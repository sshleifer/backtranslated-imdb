I wonder how many MINI Cooper cars have been sold thanks to this movie? He could not help adding to the sales of this small machine, which is present in this film, along with an attractive cast. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny robbery movie. It features a "cool" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> The scene of the best pursuit is right at the beginning with a boat chase in Venice, Italy. The film does not upset the violence, it has a pretty clever script (with a few brief exceptions). presents interesting characters and is well established. The cat-and-mouse game between the characters of Norton and Theron is full of suspense and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Once again, however, we are manipulated into cheering for criminals portrayed as "the good guys". How many times has it happened since "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? It's twisted Hollywood, for you. Here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang, so he is the worst of the group and the villain of the film. Even the character of Theron is in the typically exaggerated Hollywood feminist mode in which women can do everything (including driving a car) better than a man. A third minor irritation is Seth Green's smug and intelligent attitude, which we should also accept because it is fashionable and fashionable. <br /> <br /> In spite of these obstacles, it is an extremely funny film and not exaggerating with bad words or sex ... and, yes, those little machines are beautiful. Everyone I talked to who saw this movie appreciated it.
