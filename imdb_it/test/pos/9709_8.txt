This film surpasses the previous one-mile incarnation, taking everything to the next level. As always the boys of JackAss are simply incredible, and I personally laughed louder in that theater than in a long time. Like the first JackAss, this is not so much a film as a series of eighty-minute stunts and jokes. It is pure circus entertainment brought to the highest level. Essentially these guys are clowns, debasing themselves for the fun of others. Is fantastic. Cheating is so low, outrageous and often disgusting that it transcends into a higher form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> You can't evaluate this along with other films, it's in a class of its own. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for the pure show that it is.
