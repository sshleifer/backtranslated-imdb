This is probably the second best of Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 reminds me of "West Side Story" with a new twist. Not even the recent film "Gangs of New York" can compete with a New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 that is tormented not by two rival gangs - but by a large band. A gang that is willing to do things like cut a person to death with an ax if he transgresses on his set. <br /> <br /> Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays delicately in this action-packed film that is full of a lot of shooting violence. So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III marks with its delicate, romantic moments as well as its violent moments. Only the scenes of James Bond's love interest would do much better. <br /> <br /> And, in addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new gun called Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of Dirty Harry's movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. The Wildey gun has a big punch and when the Kersey kills with it, he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick. <br /> <br /> And that anti-tank missile that killed the main gang leader? Well, that's something. Kersey would not use an anti-tank missile as his normal guard weapon ... this is too military for him.
