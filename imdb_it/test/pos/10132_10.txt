Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. where they are perfectly expressed in this film. It is a compelling story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we are interested. I think there was a lot of realism with the characters. The writer did not incorporate racism into the film in a way that most films do, and I thought it would create a more realistic storyline. <br /> <br /> Writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually exaggerate. <br /> <br /> There are so many cities like this where people of different races live harmoniously. Ed Harris should have been nominated for an Academy Award because he was good as a leader and coach, as realistic as a father and showed a loving side when he helps Radio.
