I turned 13 when Elvis achieved great moments in 1956 with his first RCA hit. A year later Buddy Holly intervened to give the king some competition. One of Buddy's main talents, in addition to his unique singing style and songwriting ability, is often overlooked. Buddy was also a skilled solo guitarist, developing a unique rockabilly style in his Fender Strat. Gary Busey tries to capture this aspect of Buddy's character. There were other contemporary rock musicians of equal caliber, like Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy's talent is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> As noted by others, Busey is the driving force behind the success of "The Buddy Holly Story". Not only does the script play with the facts of Buddy's life, but it also interposes several anachronisms for Buddy's two years of popularity, practically from 1957 to 1959. One that comes to mind is the scene where Buddy and Maria are watching 3-D film. Buddy is disenchanted with everything and tells Maria that he will never last. It's just a passing fad. In reality there were no 3D movies in circulation at the time. The golden age of 3-D was in the early 1950s. By 1955 fashion had already faded. Yet another example where only a little research would have been enough to make the story more credible. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes difficult to separate what really happened from the urban legends surrounding Buddy's career. The story of how the Crickets got their name may or may not be apocryphal, but it certainly didn't happen the way it is presented in the film. Another problem with the film is how Buddy's parents are depicted. Certainly Buddy's parents supported his musical career. "Maybe Baby" was attributed to Buddy's mother and helped write the song. <br /> <br /> It's great that Buddy's biggest hits have been used in the movie, but I miss hearing one of my favorites, "I'm looking for someone to love". I am proud that as a result of this film, Buddy's music has been reprinted for a new generation to listen to. His legacy is one of the best since the early days of rock 'n' roll. Rave up, friend, rave up.
