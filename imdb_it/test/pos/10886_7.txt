This game has animated graphics, not much violence and really short levels - so why do people say it's so brilliant?!? Because he always keeps your attention, fascinates you and refuses to let go! You will try for hours trying to find that damned flight recorder, trying to figure out how to get into the room without alerting the guards, etc.! The levels are short only when you know what to do - until when, you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find matches, where to find helicopters and so on! And you'll have fun all the time you do it! It's worth a rent!
