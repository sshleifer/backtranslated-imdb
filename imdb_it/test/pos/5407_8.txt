While "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" by Salinger ends with the suicide of a prodigy, this film opens with the death of the high school swimmer legend, Matt, who turns on his head with a revolver after the opening scene. But the death of Matt Travis serves as a key to unlocking the door of another prodigy, his brother Tim, who in his life never seriously worried about the question: "What will I do?" <br /> <br /> When he finds his dead brother, with his head broken like a fallen watermelon, the Travis family starts throwing up its secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. He is a victim of bullying, domestic abuse, alienation of the family, heartbreak, sexual problems and friendship. <br /> <br /> Tim reveals his wounds from physical bruises, but these are not the only wounds to his person, as we slowly come to realize, since the script painfully reveals the origins and the result of Tim's scars. Everyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch plays the character quite well, revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body, a myriad of conflicting emotions within the soul of a child that no one seems to hear or know very well, unaware and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent. <br /> <br /> Two brothers share a doobie, curled up on a spinning red saucer, Tim asks Penny, "What will I do with the rest of my life?" The scene is framed by a familiar and recurring image of the film: the comfortable playground where Tim obviously feels at home, filmed from a bird's-eye perspective, because with every character Tim feels comfortable sharing a part of himself, and we see these intimate moments in which he shares the red, spinnable little saucer, complete with childlike graffiti carved in pencil, from above. After kindly advising him to pass the joint, Penny tells him "Tim, well, the secret of life's success is to find something you love and you have to do it for the rest of your life? Hell you are good because if you're not, you probably you will fail. "This simple line of Penny advice is the central theme of the film, the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. Why does a person have a talent that he can't stand, like Matt, who hates the attention his swimming reputation has brought, but nobody notices Tim's talent? nobody ?? why nobody bother to ask him? Not even us. The film makes us aware of the fact that we ourselves do not know Tim as we thought we would when we meet this handsome and sad boy for the first time; in our intimate understanding of Tim, as he progresses, we are reminded that not everyone is as he seems. This is the other side of the film, the failure of who should? parents, friends, teachers ?? anyone? to notice and see the gifts of people who claim to love. Not even his mother Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, sees Tim's gift, despite his love for his son. Weaver does a skillful job of a middle-aged woman struggling with her inner demons as she tries haphazardly to play the roles of domesticity and support. When Tim is found bullied at school, the boy's trailer is raging, threatening his life, "You can tease, torture, punch, drive drunk with me, I can forgive you. Hell I can understand, I'm a good Christian, you know , I can forgive and forget, but you joke with my son and may God himself come down from heaven to protect you because while I live and I will survive all of you? 'hell on earth. "After throwing a glass of paper on her mother's face, she looks around the trailer, and looking at them both, the child and her mother are stunned, she comments" nice trailer "and leaves quickly. Weaver marks in his ability to match taste with a sour and witty visceral intelligence. And Tim's father, played by Jeff Daniels, is blind to who his son is, treating him like a stranger, not telling his family that he took a break from the office, spending his days in the city park, listless, a soul carved and slept in Matt's bed, hidden in his high school letter jacket. Jeff Daniels does a great job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and a lovable because, we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son. In an emotional scene, Tim confronts his father. Just when you think his father will hit him, he grabs him to hug him. Not letting him go, he tells Tim: "I am your father and you are my son and I am here ok but you have to talk to me, I don't know how to do it alone". He's here right now in the movie a father says to his son, you have to tell me what's going on inside you, you have to tell me who you are; I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement of Tim, angry and lonely, to his father who embraces him as he breaks and cries, revealing the emotions hidden under his shell. Tim experiences this moment of purification with his father as a catharsis, especially considering the mistreatment, manipulation, contempt, violence and betrayal that was dealt with in the long year that the film surrounds. I recommend this movie.
