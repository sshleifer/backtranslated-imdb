"Tempest" is a somewhat self-indulgent, irregular, discursive film. But like Lord Byron, another visitor to Greece, he protested with his friend John Murray about his own self-indulgent and discursive "Don Juan", "It could be dissolute but it's not life, isn't it?" > <br /> The connections to Shakespeare's "Storm" may seem, as another commentator argues, a bit tenuous. But look at the movie again after re-reading "The Tempest", and they will seem much closer. What makes this film spoiled is its disturbing mixture of pure and simple narrative and sudden sudden improvisation, in particular between Cassavetes and Rowland. But to be honest, these scenes are the most remarkable and compelling of the film, if the most difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> Even the music of this film, composed by Stomu Yamashta, is neglected. Particularly beautiful is the perfect little piece played to accompany the afternoon siesta, like people, animals, and apparently the whole island collapses to sleep away the hottest part of the afternoon. It is a sublime moment and represents the best aspect of this film and the only thing that keeps it somewhat unified, the fact that (apart from the long flashbacks and the end) is the story of a day on an island, since waking up tonight. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd rather watch this movie a hundred times than once seeing a piece of Hollywood shit. And indeed, I've probably seen it dozens of times. Most of the time, I see something I missed before. <br /> <br /> (Confession: I'm biased, this is the second movie I showed my wife Greek-American goddess.) <br /> <br /> Notes trivia about this film: <br / > <br /> - It was Molly Ringwald's first film, as well as that of Sam Robards; <br /> <br /> - It was not actually shot on an island, but in Gytheion, the southern tip of the remote Mani Peloponnese peninsula in Greece; <br /> <br /> - The primitive special effects (according to today's standards) were made by Bran Ferren, who later became head of Disney Imagineering, and was later a consultant to the US intelligence community; <br /> <br /> - Paul Mazursky, the director, chose the title of his recent autobiography, "Show Me the Magic", from the script of "Tempest".
