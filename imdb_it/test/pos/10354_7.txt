I felt compelled to comment on this film because it is listed as the fourth most voted science fiction film of all time on IMDb. WHAT!?!? Of course, this movie is lousy, but it's HILARIOUS! It's not bad on an Ed Wood level, it's more surreal and uneven. <br /> <br /> There are some classic moments in the film. Brain surgery is coarse and large - and even crazier when you consider that the film has been rated PG! Gor chases his dolly before discharging battery acid in his face- "My! Gimmee!" Speeches by Zandor Vorkoff at the beginning of the film - "Before Amir, Kali was just another weak nation struggling to free itself from centuries of stagnant feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has big lines- "No, Gor! No!" "You want these keys, don't you, my beauties?" It is absolutely wrong for this to be the 4th most popular sci-fi movie on IMDb, because it is ENTERTAINMENT. No matter how bad a movie is, if it still manages to be weird, bizarre, disturbing or funny, it has merit and doesn't deserve to be downloaded and fired. I will not defend most of the films of Al Adamson, but this, along with Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR, they are fun enough to make up for their dread.
