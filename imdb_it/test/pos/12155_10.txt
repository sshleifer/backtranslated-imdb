A German freshman, Stefan hitchhikes in Paris during the summer break where he falls in love with a mysterious young woman he meets in the Paris scene. Then he follows her to the famous island of Ibiza, the hippy joint meets Wolf, a man who throws Hitler-Jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and keeps Estelle under his thumb with drugs. The couple tries to escape from Wolf, Stefan is fascinated by drugs and jealousy for Estelle, who is formidable and a free spirit. Great photography and music, the plot is quite common for the period but it's not a kind of exploitative, cold and dramatic film. The moral is strong enough (he was looking for the sun ...) but I wouldn't say it is an anti-drug film, even if it puts the emphasis on drug use.
