This film recreates Lindbergh's historic flight across the Atlantic as he touches on episodes of his aviation career through flashbacks. Stewart was about 20 years old to play the young bishop, but his fine performance, particularly in solo flight sequences, makes this a small quirk. Waxman's exciting score is a big advantage. Despite the long duration, Wilder manages to make it quite exciting and is able to support the drama even if the result is known. What year was 1957 for Wilder: in addition to this, he also wrote and directed "Love in the Afternoon" and "Witness for the Prosecution". And his next two were "Some Like it Hot" and "The Apartment." What a race!
