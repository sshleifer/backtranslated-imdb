Intruder in the Dust (1949) Dir: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> Excellent story "Southern Gothic", adapted from Faulkner's novel, about a black man, accused of the murder of a white man, who asks a young white boy who made friends to help him prove his innocence. Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez) is an anomaly in this small town. He is a black man who owns the land in which he lives and does not think much about the sick social order which mostly maintains peace here and in many similar small towns. So when Lucas is found holding a gun on the body of Vinson Gowrie, shot from behind, less young, the young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (whom Lucas saved after Chick fell into the ice while hunting on his land) fears that the city finally has the chance to "make Lucas a *****". Arrested, and with a real chance of being lynched before the night passes, Lucas turns to Chick for help, as the only person he knows "not cluttered with notions". Chick asks his uncle John, a lawyer, to defend Lucas and while the man is initially annoyed by his own notions, he agrees and they run against the crowd that gathers to save Lucas's life. <br /> <br /> The film has a rare frankness for its time and is mostly devoid of moralization. The character of the lawyer has a tendency to speak an incredibly self-conscious dialogue that mostly sounds like something from the printed page, but has minimal impact on the tone. This is a merit of the rich characterization of all others. Juano Hernandez, who has appeared for the most part in Oscar Micheaux's films, is as superb as the proud Lucas. Porter Hall in the role of the murdered man's father, perhaps the best role he has ever seen, and Elizabeth Patterson as an old woman sympathetic to the Lucas case, who stands out for supporting roles. The setting is perfectly realized. It is actually shot in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. Brown also uses the crowd effectively, he is always an anonymous crowd against a single person (like Lucas when he is arrested or John when he gets into his office), this is very threatening. Or the grotesque of the whole city that gathered at the prison to watch the lynching as if it were a parade. Of note is an absolutely compelling scene when Chick and his friend Aleck go to gather evidence in a cemetery. Robert Surtees (THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO, BEN-HUR) fired the image. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 on 4
