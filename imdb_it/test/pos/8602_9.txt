I didn't focus on the larger genocidal aspects of the story (although the horrible images at the beginning are very powerful). I was really taken by the human story of the girl and her family. Imagine living your life without knowing if you have a time bomb sticking inside you. I was really shocking to see Yasuko rejected as "contaminated" by the bomb. The image that accompanies me the most is when Yasuko stands in front of the mirror that combs her hair, silently watching it come out in lumps.
