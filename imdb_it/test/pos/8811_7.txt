Cardiff, Wales. A group of 5 companions are deeply bored in this city. There is Jip who works in a clothes shop. Coop, a DJ in hand. Nina, inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they are just waiting for one thing: the weekend. At this time, they came out in a nightclub and at the sound of technology without music, they experimented with different drugs, especially ecstasy. So they usually continue the party to a friend's. At the end of this really fantastic moment on Sunday, the feelings are the following: tiredness, melancholy, just the memory of a crazy night ... <br /> <br /> Sailing on the wave of the infamous success of "Trainspotting" ( 1996), this debut film written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variant on the notion of hedonism. It means: how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have a reduced amount of time. In fact, as I wrote earlier, for the 5 main characters of the film, the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can break free and have a free time without just the pressure (moreover, Jip in a sequence speaks of the positive aspects of shooting oneself: one is insensitive, one feels no pressure, one is like an astronaut in orbit above the earth. Kerrigan's implacable director style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and thoughtfulness of the 5 protagonists. you live only to take advantage of a hedonistic weekend as much as possible and, to make the festive atmosphere in which your film bathes even more lively, Kerrigan is not afraid to include dream sequences that represent the fantasy or embarrassment of her characters Then, "Human Traffic" (1999) also served as a particularly bouncy soundtrack. Quantity? A perfect symbiosis between sound and music.In the end, this weekend of euphoria allows us to put aside momentarily And the usual gray image of the popular social classes, British cinema has studied a lot. <br /> <br /> Although, when a film (conscientiously or not) exploits the fame of another famous, it rarely corresponds to the splendor of its predecessor. "Human Traffic" is in this condition. There is little inventiveness at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and some useless digressions can be noted (Jip who, in the nightclub, goes to the manager's office and tells him a story about big cocks in order to enable Moff to enter the club but it is useless because the latter manages to come without problems). You can even blame Kerrigan for neglecting the dramatic sides that the story could have involved. His film can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole are practically not explored. It's a shame! He may have transmitted the following message: even in the happiest moments, there may be something terrible in preparation that can make them fall. The same observation could also be said when Coop has an attack of jealousy because Nina launches a boy. <br /> <br /> It may not be the last great movie of the Nineties as it is published on the DVD cover but "Human Traffic" is a small incisive film that transmits with the styles and fashions of the end of the twentieth century , a willingness to have fun without further reasons and problems. An ideal film to start a party or before going to a club.
