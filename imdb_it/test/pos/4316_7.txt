In fact, Cynthia Watros is in this film while Elizabeth talks with Desmond. Although I'm wondering how she became a "rehab patient" (?) Where Hurley is also trying to reduce his weight (as seen from previous episodes). <br /> <br /> However, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer expected the public to come in the third season. <br /> <br /> I only hope that next season will give light to unclear / suspended events that have happened. <br /> <br /> I can't wait any longer for season 3.
