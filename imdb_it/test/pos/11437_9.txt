This is a funny movie. It's very realistic for the "wonderful world of music". I was there and I did it. Show a human element in every character and realism that nobody is perfect. These amateur musicians weren't so bad. The Cleavon Little character, Marshall Tucker, has been played very well. Marshall was not a saint by himself. Here he was paid to do a job and giving these guys a hard time for everything in the van. Don't bite the hands that feed you. I find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has claims to know none of the Dixieland songs. It has a tremendous sense to foresee the chord changes on tracks that you don't know. Uncommon, but not unheard of. Deliver a true and hard message at the end of the film when he tells the clarinetist: "It is not a religion, devotion is not enough". At that level, he's right, although I think the clarinetist could have managed the job. He was practicing his ass and the vocal accompanying music is not so difficult to read. Very funny movie.
