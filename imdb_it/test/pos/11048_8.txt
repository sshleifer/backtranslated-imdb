This film is worthwhile despite what you might hear. Marie Dressler's performance (I hope I wrote it correctly) as a drunk old drunk is reason enough to see this movie. It is an extraordinary performance. He's been in drunken astonishment in three scenes for quite a while and never does the same thing twice. You can really smell the alcohol when it's done. Amazing. And Greta, of course, talks about her first jokes about cinema and it goes great. Eugene O'Neill's story is solid and like most of O'Neill's stories, very deep and intense. This is not light entertainment, but if you like those great actors of the 30s and 40s you'll like it. Part of the film is technically blurred, but all in all it's worth it.
