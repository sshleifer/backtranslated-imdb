Project A II is a classic film by Jackie Chan with all the kung fu, the crazy acrobatics and the slapstick humor that you expect. Not as good as the prequel, but it's still a fantastic movie if you just want something fun to watch. The story is simple, Jackie Chan against evil men. So if you want a movie that you don't have to be a braniac to understand, I'd suggest this.
