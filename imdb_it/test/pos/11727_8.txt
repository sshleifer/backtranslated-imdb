This was one of those movies that I would always meet (whether on TV or cheap DVDs), but it never hit me to give it a shot because I thought I wasn't losing much. It was a night and I thought oh well ?? why not. A good decision too, as I would kick myself for taking so long to make it. For me it left me impressed, since it is there with the best Burt Reynold films ("Deliverance", "White Lightning" and "Boogie Nights") and returns to the gritty and hardboiled urban thrillers of the 70s / 80s that don't they were afraid to be obscure presumably and go out of their way to set-up characters, pack-it with realistically brutal force and effectively incorporate local positions (Atlanta which is the case here) to the fold with ground photography. In some nuances it reminded me of "Dirty Harry", but this is vaguely. Anyway it was the blues with its right sound, with its hot kicks, funky changes and disconnected sounds, it made me think a lot about the soundtrack of Lalo Schifrin orchestrated for "Dirty Harry". The soundtrack of music on the other hand is inconstant. <br /> <br /> Sgt. Tom Sharky was a narcotic agent of the Atlantic, before a fainting during a bust saw him demoted. Together with his new team they run into a prostitution ring, which captures their interest due to the fact that it is owned by a crime lord who is difficult to track down and condemn. What they dig involves a leading government figure and a call-girl who can give them some important names, but they must reach her before she has reached a goal. <br /> <br /> The acts of Burt Reynold, but also a rigid and muscular fashion that would be good for his laconically tough performance and the thematic and hard script by Gerald Di Pego (adapted from the novel by William Diehl). Well, it shows a kind of heart / piercing thoughts between that armor within the scenes involving the acutely capable British actress Rachel Ward, whether it's the scenes to stake out when she looks at it from another building (and slowly becoming infatuated with her) to when they finally unite, but these last interactions halfway slow the momentum, but give him noir as shots. The performances are quite apt with Reynold's formulation of an excellent relationship with exceptional actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The demure word and the witty dialogues between these guys were a hoot. As for the corrupt villains, Vittorio Gassman builds an impressive strength and power, but it is Henry Silva (who seems to have been born for these roles) the cunning smart and unstoppable that makes the show. Where its appearance seems to outline the things to come and help them stay in their place. Moreover his climax full of adrenaline and violent cat and mouse with Sharky and his team is brilliantly done. <br /> <br /> Exciting action steps could be quick and dry, but remain violently lethal like an immensely heartbreaking sequence of interrogators. Some old fashioned hand-held shooting techniques increase suspense. The intriguing material makes it rather tactical from the point of view of the character, but when we think of its fluidity of navigation it offers a dull surprise or two together with some intense confrontations.
