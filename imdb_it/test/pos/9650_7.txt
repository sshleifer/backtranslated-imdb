See Les Amants Reguliers immediately calls the comparison with Bertolucci's film "The Dreamers", in my opinion the best film made about the Paris student uprising in 1968. In reality, director Philippe Garrel does not seem to avoid confronting his colleague much more famous, sharing the main actor and also including a direct replica with an eye of the eye on an old Bertolucci film. Still, LAR is a different and interesting film. <br /> <br /> Even the plot looks familiar. The film begins with long scenes of the "emeutes" of 1968, perhaps among the best made so far. The film is made in black and white and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the fence reminds Eisenstein. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action moves in the Parisian apartment where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art, smoke drugs, dream and fall for each other. There is no direct social commentary, no real explanation of the background of the revolt. The film focuses on the psychology of the characters and the love story between the main characters. It is like a premonition of the transition process towards the establishment that the 1968 generation went through, it's just that not all participants can adapt or survive. <br /> <br /> The film speaks more about the characters than about the events. And it is only for the style of which he will be remembered. Black and white cinema is memorable not only in the scenes of the revolution, but also when looking at the evolution of the characters. Many sequences are enhanced by a technique derived from the films of silent films, with long takes accompanied by an off piano melody. The effect is exquisite. Yet the duration of the film is barely justified, it lasts more than three hours and I doubt that cutting it in just two hours would have been a lack - in fact I am convinced that it is quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> Without raising the depth and subtlety of Bertolucci's film LAR is another perspective to remember about one of the most important years in the history of France and the world in the 20th century.
