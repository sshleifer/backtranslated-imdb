I like the show, but online writers, take some action! Exit by dragging it forward and forward. You have a great concept and it could be much more. Miles (Jenkins) is great and behaves like a child that age should behave in the situation in which he finds himself. Hey, get creative with creatures, they can have telepathic abilities or other powers out of the world. The child actors of the series are very good and convincing. Miles's parents seem to be a little too out of mind about what's going on, but develop it, come on! you have a big seed here and there may be a whole new twist next season with lots of new characters and creatures and all sorts of science fiction stuff. If they could do a series on a witch, you should be able to create one on these creatures and children.
