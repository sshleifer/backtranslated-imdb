True stories create the best stories, right? There is always something pleasant in a story, be it a novel or a movie or anything else, simply because it is real makes the story even more fascinating. This film is based on a true story of two young Americans, one a government employee and an enthusiastic hawk, Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) and the other Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), a drug dealer. These two begin to sell secrets of the government, mostly CIA, to the Soviet Union in 1975. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men, as well as their growing personal problems (especially the Penn character with ever-worsening addiction), rather than glorifying their traitor status in America, which would undoubtedly damage the credibility of the film in the United States. Boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually frustrated and paranoid as their relationships drag and dig deeper and deeper into treacherous territory. Daulton becomes more dependent and dependent on cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened, and more desperate to keep control over a situation he has no control over, he already has problems with the law. The torment of the families of Boyce and Daulton because of the way in which they lead their lives is well represented and adds to the idea that espionage against one's own country, even if thought to be executed, only leads to major problems and ruin of life? ? including the degradation of friendship and trust between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Here is the description: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Hutton and Each of them did extensive research on the characters to capture their appearance and their individual appearance, so they are portrayed with great depth and realism. <br /> <br /> - Acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> - The atmosphere of paranoia is built quite well. <br /> <br /> - The story is fascinating and, of course, like one based on real events, it has some more kicks. <br /> <br /> - Beautiful sets. <br /> <br /> - The Soviets working with Boyce and Daulton are very well portrayed, and they are not stereotyped or given evil consciences just to make them look bad. <br /> No Hurt It, Did not Help: <br /> <br /> - The music is ok, nothing perfect though. <br /> <br /> - The sound effects are occasionally a bit uncertain ?? such was the case with many films from the seventies to the eighties. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman we barely know. Because of Boyce's problems with the United States and Soviet governments, his life can be jeopardized, but this is not as extensive as it should have been. Small problem, though. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a bit unnerving. Nothing like a constant state of non-happiness to keep the masses feeling the most at risk. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - Displays the first CIA report accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason it is "hard night". <br /> <br /> This was another film that suffered enormous delays due to the controversial content of the story. Studios and producers have not seen how a film about two American traitors could ever be accepted by the American public. Fortunately, it is filmed and interpreted with a high degree of class and quality. Of course, it helps that traitorous antiheroes are not portrayed heroically, more like a couple of young people who have committed serious errors of judgment in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama, and a very well and very credible portrait. <br /> <br /> Acting: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Photography: 8/10 Character development: 9/10 Special effects / Make-up: 8/10 (small quantity, high quality) Nudity / Sexuality: 2/10 (a scene in a strip club) Violence / Gore: 7/10 (no blood, just a little violence) Music: 7/10 Direction: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 8/10 <br /> <br /> If you like movies about espionage and spies, then you can't go wrong here. If you like drama with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters, then this could work for you too. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
