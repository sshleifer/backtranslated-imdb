The film has started, the wheels are spinning, your car has entered a race against the fox ... You're behind can't get into the front row, you think, "if I go out, I'll take you with me ..." Beat against the cars parked on the side of the road, you turn to hit Fox but your aim is bad .... Bang, you climbed into the back of a VW, and you crashed into a tank. Your cars light up. You could go out if you wanted to, but the shame of losing brought you ... BANG! Your car explodes, everyone looks desperate, some cry ... The sound of a siren tells you that the cops are coming. Everyone gets into their cars and shoots, letting you burn. The charred remains of the chassis of the machines are there, obsessing the spectators ... You are dead. <br /> <br /> This is one of the scenes; actually it's the first scene in the film. There are many other similar ones. As you enter the cockpit of the Fox in his crazy V8 ford, Terry Serio in his crazy GTHO, and many others in this explosion of the past .... JOHN CLARKS masterpiece, "RUNNING ON EMPTY" "- Will win at any cost-"
