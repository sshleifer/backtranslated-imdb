Spike Feresten is a comic genius. "Talkshow" demonstrates a new interpretation of the kind of ball irreverence that made famous successes such as Letterman and The Daily Show. His sympathy is palpable. It seems to find the unique angle of the joke, not the predictable path of the sitcom ... thank God. His comedy is reminiscent of the award-winning Arrested Development (fingers crossed that "Talkshow" has a longer duration). The topics he emphasizes are those that go unnoticed by everyone else, yet when he jokes around them, you wonder how you missed the first time. I particularly enjoyed the sketches ... "Unfair Target" will be a cult classic in no time. Set your Tivo people ... this is a show not to be missed.
