The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I've ever seen: much better and more deeply than Romeo & Juliet by Luhrman or Titanic by Spielberg. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her research, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong and loving woman throughout the film. Kay is the poisoner of the dark forces: temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this film. I cry every time I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay. And I wish it would end soon ... Snowqueen also tells me if my life deeply identifies me with the story and the characters. Thank you at least for Hans Christian Anderson and the director.
