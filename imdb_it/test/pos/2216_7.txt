This film was a great surprise for me as I watched it at the Cinequest in the great California theater in San Jose. It's a musical, which I normally don't like, but I have to say that this was different. Robert Peters, who directed the film and took part in it, did a great job. During his Q & A he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew! Most of the dialouge was composed on the fly and actually made the film while participating in another film festival in Germany! I can't say enough great things about this film, the only negative thing is that you really do notice the camera working and it shakes a little. If you happen to come across this movie, take a look!
