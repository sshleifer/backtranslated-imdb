This film is a great passion for action and comedy, it comes to us right away, there are no boring accumulations. The chemistry of the main roles adds excitement and anticipation of the ending, even if my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked brilliantly and were credible! I would have liked a different ending, but it still disturbed my emotions. The plot unfolds well, however it is a film that you have to watch carefully from start to finish to gather all the details, to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment. <br /> <br />
