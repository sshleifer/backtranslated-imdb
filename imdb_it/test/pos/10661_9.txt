Eisenstein created the Russian Montage Theory, and this film is his best example. It took years before anyone could use his ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). Nevertheless, the wheelchair scene really demonstrates the messy nature of the RMT. Of course, like most movies, there is a lot of time in some parts, the beauty of the film is amazing. One of the best silent films I've ever seen.
