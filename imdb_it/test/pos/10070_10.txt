Don't listen to what critics have always said about this nice and fascinating film. Madonna is GREAT in this clever comedy. I worked in a video store for several years and suggested this movie to many customers - nobody has NEVER taken it back and shouted to me to tell them to rent it. Everyone has always had fun. In reality it is also a great film for children.
