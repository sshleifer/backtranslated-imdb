The very famous director Werner Herzog "Fata Morgana" is incredibly unorthodox. Although the characters appear from time to time in the film, there is no real story. The film is also not an educational or historical documentary. It's a film without an accompanying script. <br /> <br /> The film consists of a curious background music and a somewhat illogical VO, whose combination overlaps with a long series of images mostly, though not exclusively, of the desert of Sahara. Some of the images are wonderfully strange and out of the ordinary. The camera captures spectral images, or mirages, optical illusions that excite and hypnotize. <br /> <br /> This general cinematic trend is punctuated by occasional observations in the margins of fortuitous arguments. For example, in a sequence a man wearing glasses gives us a mini-tutorial on lizards. And in what to me was the most captivating and bizarre sequence, a small collection room contains a man in dark glasses who sings in a voice totally distorted by the microphone he is using, accompanied by an old lady who plays an old man piano. Neither the man nor the old lady seem to appreciate what they are doing. How much is baroque. <br /> <br /> "Fata Morgana" has a basic concept, which combines the vast assortment of strange images and eclectic sounds. But that concept is so subtle, so opaque that you'll never find out without help. From this subtle theme the film really makes sense. Without that point of reference, however, the film may seem tedious and endless, a useless parade of random earthly images and meaningless words esoteric narrative. <br /> <br /> Unapologetically redundant, thematically disconcerting and cinematic heretic, "Fata Morgana" will probably make you faint with joy or make yourself vomit. Either you cling to the qualities of the Zen genre of the film or you are tempted to destroy the DVD in a thousand pieces. One thing that many viewers will agree on: "Fata Morgana" is ... different.
