I saw the film in its original film version in Austin, Texas. The old Paramount Theater (I don't know if it still exists.) Everything went out with the speakers around the walls precisely connected to all six channels. At 15, I was speechless. The concept of surround sound was completely foreign to the music and movies at the time. <br /> <br /> I vividly remember at least three exceptional scenes in which surround sound had a huge impact. (Although, please forgive me if time has deformed my memories with inaccuracies.) The first was a car trip through Catfish Row, alive with the sites and sounds of everyday activity. First you saw them all, such as a blacksmith, then, as the camera passed them, their sound continued to be heard passing left or right along the back side of the theater. The second was a musical band that had been seen first in the front, then paraded in front of the camera splitting left and right. Not only did the sound of each instrument follow its directional path, but it also changed the timbre as it played towards you, at your side and then away from you. And if that wasn't enough, they also took into account the Doppler effect for each instrument as it passed. The third scene was near the end of the film while Porgy leaves Catfish Row for New York to search for Bess. He and about half of the cast members pass by the camera as they leave the village with the same sound effects as the band. The other half of the cast / choir sings with them and also greets Porgy and the other friends. Friend replies can then be heard from the sides and the back. <br /> <br /> Surround sound has been used with stunning effects throughout the film. I think I remember a rock or something thrown from a pier and hear it land in the water behind me. Little things like that were evident to theater-goers who were lucky enough to have all six channels - things that would seem trivial in cinemas without it. <br /> <br /> I stayed in the theater for several screenings. You could do it then. And I came back several times before he left the city. I never saw the movie again. Literally BEGS for DVD release with picture fidelity and surround sound restored. I hope someone has kept it somewhere. Please, family Gershwin, allow it to be released before it is permanently lost to other generations.
