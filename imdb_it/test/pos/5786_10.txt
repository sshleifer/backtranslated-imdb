I own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. I've seen a lot of them and I love all the great information out there. However, only a small handful are approaching to offer important information like this. I have read other people's reviews on this film and I can't help but notice that the main things that people criticize are irrelevant. How "It is very one-sided" Such a pathetic criticism, in which in the society in which you look you will see the other side and if you still need help go to globalpublicmedia.com. "They are always the same people" One could be led to believe that these people are the experts, so maybe they are the best people to interview. "The style of shooting is always the same, head shots with few exceptions" If you want to watch flash and dazzle Michael Moore if you want information look at real documents like this. As you can clearly see none of these complaints has any relevance to the information contained. My guess is that these people are simply losing their sense and don't want to give up SUVs. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: Watch it. Learn from this and continue your education on these topics. It is very important stuff for EVERYONE.
