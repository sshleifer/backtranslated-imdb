A very intelligent and exciting thriller that is not based on action but on the situation, which is very rare these days. I would compare this film to Jackal's Day, another film about the search for a dangerous international criminal. Acting across the board is superb - Aidan Quinn has a difficult dual role as the ferocious terrorist Carlos and the Navy man who impersonates him. Donald Sutherland plays the CIA amoral agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who assists in the plan. This is a very tense and effective film, and it is remarkable considering how little action there is in it. The first half of the film is all mounted, while the Navy man prepares to play Carlos. The second part is a breathless actionless, the action that comes out of the characters and their situations, thus making it more compelling. A really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked.
