I love the premise, but its replay value is only for certain parts (the initial scene of course). Some characters are a little outrageous, but they're still fun. I think the Ballping sh-t was pushing him. I know it was to show that Nick and Casey were living in Los Angeles and to show why Casey gave up the lifestyle, I think the flashback story could have been better. Even the Jamaican boy chatting on the phone is smart and funny, but once again I think the story was told in a neglected way. It looks really incredible. In fact I believe that Swordfish (Woods' other film has written) more than a few parts on Thursday because the government continues to keep a secret all the time, and has organizations that the public will never know. <br /> <br /> Thursday is the best Quentinesque film I've ever seen. I think Woods is imaginative, intelligent and intelligent; however, his work needs more maturation to reach even the screenplay level of Natural Born Killer (not Stone). How old is he anyway?
