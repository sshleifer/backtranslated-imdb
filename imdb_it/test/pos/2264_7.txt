In America, the Jew Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) collects personal objects of his family for recollection. Moments before he died, his grandmother took an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman named Augustine in Ukraine. Jonathan contacts Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to guide him to the place where the photo was taken to find Agostino, and together with the interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a strange dog, they travel in an old car in search of Jonathan's family's vanished past. <br /> <br /> "Everything Is Illuminated" is a strange film about a strange boy with the compulsive behavior of collecting souvenirs from his family so as not to forget them looking for his grandfather's past to understand how his life could be if his grandfather had not moved to the United States. This bizarre vegetarian character meets a dysfunctional Ukrainian family that owns an amateur travel agency specializing in helping Jews find missing relatives, and together they have an almost surreal journey through the country of Ukraine. The film begins as a comedy, with a sarcastic black humor, and ends in a moving and tragic drama recommended for a specific audience. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Uma Vida Iluminada" ("An Illuminated Life")
