HISTORY Chinese Tall Story tells the story of the just monk Tripitaka, who along with his guardians Monkey, Sandy and Pigsy make their journey west for a search to recover the ancient Sutras, finally reach the last leg of their journey in the city of Shache But all is not as it seems when the city is attacked by demon demons. Monkey does his best to fight them, but is overwhelmed, knowing that his master is in grave danger, he uses his trusty gold stick to push Tripitaka to safety. <br /> <br /> The monk ends up being knocked out when he lands and when he wakes up he finds himself in the presence of an impertinent young lizard named Maiyan who takes a good shine for our young hero, after many verbal misunderstandings Maiyan is convinced that Tripitaka loves her, so when the monk decides to save the Monkey and the others, he insists to accompany him. So the couple disagree begins their adventure together. <br /> <br /> REVIEW Okay, so it's another Journey to the West movie, which is not a bad thing for me since I love the story and the characters associated with it, so I was a little excited about get your hands on the DVD. So I think I'll start my review with the story, which is everywhere, at first it was your standard fantasy movie, then it became a ridiculous comedy and then suddenly became a real science fiction, if director Jeff Lau was experimenting with mix of genres and then did a nice scatological job with this film. I think it's a rather unique approach having the center of the story on a different character from the notorious Monkey King, particularly taking a pacifist character like Tripitaka and then inserting it into what is at its core a love story. So, overall, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is solid, with lead Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi performing in some excellent performances, although Ah Char spends most of his time on the rather nasty makeup screen. The supporting cast is well put together, includes all the usual main EEG stays so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong make appearances, an actor I would like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays the Monkey King, did a good job with limited material which seemed to have been given, played a version of the Monkey King who was submissive but arrogant, I had the feeling that he would rebuild the territory of Twins Effect II but fortunately this is not the case. I hope he succeeds in giving a follow up to this with himself in the central role, since the film leaves itself open for a sequel. <br /> <br /> Okay, so let's go to the director, which is again a bit everywhere, Lau gives too much time to the absurd comedy of Stephen Chow, which includes a scene in which Tripitaka gets stronger, dresses up as Spider- Man, which I assume leads to many since the film is set to settle in ancient China. He creates some really beautiful and tender moments between the two protagonists and immerses himself in a mushy territory, but sometimes this reviewer enjoys some sap, so he didn't bother me at all. <br /> <br /> Right now on CGI, which for the most part is quite bearable, there are many moments that probably belong to a PS2 as many other reviews have claimed, but there are some interesting moments, especially the scene in which Monkey fights a flying servant. Many of the CG gags are provided in the form of a gold stick that turns into a series of different things, ranging from a giant fly sweeper to a mech suit released by The Matrix Revolutions. So yes, it sounds crazy but I think you should see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Right, so in closing A Chinese Tall Story is not a film without its flaws but held together long enough to entertain and generally be a pleasant film overall. If all of the above doesn't make you swing to see it, so far as I put it this way, it's much better than Twins Effect II.
