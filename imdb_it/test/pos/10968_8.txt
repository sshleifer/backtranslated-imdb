I had never seen a John Cassavetes film until two years ago, when I first saw THE Chinese KILLING OF A BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema, which I found interesting, to put it diplomatically, but not so special, I immediately wanted to see more of his work. Since then, I have tried - with an emphasis on the proven - looking at his other work, particularly the Shadows. I have to admit, it took me a while before I really liked the movie. At first, Cassavetes was shot in a single, raw and impromptu way, he pushed me away a bit and I thought of it as an original experiment - absolutely - but imperfect and dated. But now, after examining it, these small imperfections make it so fresh, even today. <br /> <br /> Shot on a minimum budget of $ 40,000 with a skeletal crew of six, SHADOWS offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three brothers in an African-American family where two of the three brothers, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), have fair skin and are able to pass for white. Cassavetes has asked that the actors keep their real names to reflect the real conflicts within the group, but have seen the film as concerned about human problems that do not involve racial ones. Cassavetes filmed the film in ten minutes and a jagged editing, a reaction against the values ​​of Hollywood production "without interruption". Cassavetes 'main inspiration - at least in the cinematographic style in which the film was shot - was the Italian neo-realists and also the admiration for Welles' pioneering spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisations could resemble some Italian neo-realist directors, but with his bebop soundtrack by Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi, the film feels very different, very American, unlike anything done before really. <br /> <br /> The song with feathered girls, "I feel like a lollipop" (or something like that) feels like light years back, ancient history. But no matter how dated it may seem, it still makes a delicious capsule of the Fifties New York time. I think this is one of the first films that made filmmakers aspire to make an independent film, without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who acted and was involved in SHADOWS, claims that Jules Dassin's THE NAKED CITY (1948) was the first and inspired them all, but I think it was the very one that opened the eyes of aspiring independent American directors . br /> <br /> Darkroom --- 8/10
