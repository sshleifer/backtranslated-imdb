Frankie Darro was a wonderful child actor who stood out for playing hard fists with huge chips on their shoulders. He appeared in a couple of important films from the early 1930s - "The Public Enemy" (1931), a drama and "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933), a film on topical depression about children riding rails. He was essentially a younger version of James Cagney. Although short of stature, his willingness to do his stunts kept him engaged in a series of programmers when the larger studios no longer needed him. <br /> <br /> "Crime School" should have been a remake of "The Mayor of Hell", but had much more humor in it and featured The Dead End Kids and Humphrey Bogart as a very relaxed deputy commissioner. "The Mayor of Hell" is actually a combination of "Hell's House" / "Crime School" / "Boy's Town". Although Cagney didn't make his appearance until the 25th minute his impact (as usual) was immediate. He plays a hot-headed gangster who is on the payroll of a crowd-run political group. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his band (including "Farina" from "Our Gang") run a racket for car washing but bite more than they can chew when they steal a department store and push the owner through a glass plate. They appear before the juvenile court and are condemned to go to the state reformatory. It is painted in brilliant terms - a model school where kids have the opportunity to learn a trade. Actually, it's a hellish place run by a sadistic director, Mr. Thompson (played by Dudley Digges). The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith, the living nurse (played by Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> "Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) received the post of new deputy commissioner, as a favor. Upon his arrival at the school he witnessed a failed escape attempt and after talking to Dorothy, he realized that the school needs radical reforms. Soon he is running the school and introducing a "self-governing" system, rather along the lines of "Boy's Town". Although Cagney doesn't have much to do, the image is accompanied by his gripping climax from Darro's energy. After "Patsy" is temporarily out of the field (accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state), Thompson returns and his brutal treatment, with the consequent death of a boy ("Skinny") turns the rest of the boys into a crowd angry. They burn in a barn and Thompson falls to his death - "Patsy" coming back just in time to calm the crowd with some small talk. <br /> <br /> Of course, all the boys seemed to have a stature talking to their crimes, but I disagree with one of the reviewers - Thompson was more than just a "bad guy". His sadistic treatment resulted in the death of a boy. There is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served an inedible jelly - Thompson orders ham and eggs and continues to accumulate the butter on his bread while talking to Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, although he is only advertised as "a blonde" he has one of the most memorable lines when he sulks and says "I thought there would be boys here, where am I? "!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
