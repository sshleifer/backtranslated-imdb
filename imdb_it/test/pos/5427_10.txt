'The Big Snit' came into my life purely by chance and left an indelible mark on my soul. A scar of love, destruction and uselessness that will forever be part of my life. This is a story of beautiful uselessness. We are powerless one without the other. We are defenseless against the wrong actions of the government. We are defenseless about the choices we all try to make when we are in love. Deaf to the mutterings and chatter of a world outside the window. Blind for an inevitable apocalypse. Fool of hatred and greedy opinions of an overly indulgent society. This is a story of personal commitment and triumphant love that defeats the ideologies of war. Their petty quarrel is a sublime observation of human nature and how love comes with its pain and darkness. Everyone has an irritating aspect to his personality and this is observed by the creators in the most simplistic and fantastic way. We travel a short distance with the two main characters, but we want to complete our travels with a simple, loving and honest philosophy. I am so happy to exist in this "our time". Another 20 years on this side of my date of birth, and I would not have seen and heard .... .... The Big Snit. William White. Sheffield.
