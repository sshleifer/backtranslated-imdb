what can I say, this movie is fantastic. has its flaws as every movie makes for example shaky headstones in a cemetery, a slide clearly visible during the penguin death scene, Max Shreck loses his heavy coat in a fraction of a second between shots during the image consulting scene, Batman he loses his black eye Trick all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman, the dialogue is recorded but is reproduced and pronounced differently than when it was first uttered and finally Catwoman suddenly knows how to use a bull without any training. these defects are minor compared to some that you would see for example in batman forever where the puzzler can obviously be seen waiting for his cue stick or val Kilmer hair that changes between shots. <br /> <br /> what makes this film so deserving of an 8/10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton resumes his role as Batman and has much more to do in this film. He looks more comfortable in the role the second time and is on par with bad shows. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin instead of the non-threatening comic book or TV show character because now the character has more depth and has a much more interesting story that generates from the fundamental need of the family and to feel accepted and wanted there. gives an evil character to whom we feel sympathy because he has been rejected for being what he is, that is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as a Catwoman. she is sleet and sexy and she is also a villain that we can feel sorry for the way she is a victim. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is such an interesting character even though he is not even in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> the soundtrack is far better than the first and Danny Elfman has more chances to show off his musical talents this time. The sets are fantastic. They are detailed, captivating, sinister, gothic, unique, dark and many other adjectives can describe how incredible they are. the costumes and make-up are fantastic and obviously a lot of work has been done to make them and all the work pays off because the Batsuit is better, the cat dress is incredible to look at and the penguin's make-up and the effects are so convincing. The animatronic penguins seem really realistic and are reproduced with good results. The script is really good and the plot is plausible in my opinion. overall, due to all these factors this film deserves an 8/10 and stands out as my favorite of all Batman movies
