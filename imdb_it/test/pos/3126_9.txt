Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford <br /> <br /> Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> John Ford takes the corporation to the desert of Utah to film a western and arrive out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicting antihero, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a jewel of photos. <br /> <br /> This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They are horse traders who come to town to do business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, is shown at the exit. The group is about to embark on a journey to their settlement, but they know that the odds and the hard ground are against them. So they hire Travis and Sandy as wagon masters for their journey. Along the way they meet and bring with them a street vendor of medicines and his two female cohorts (Alan Mowbray as a doctor, recalling his appearance in My Darling Clementine and Joanne Dru as his "daughter"). Tension is added when Clegg's murderous band arrives on the wagon. And there is also an atypical meeting (for Hollywood) with the Navajo. <br /> <br /> Most of history and humor are driven by the clash of ideals / cultures; first between Travis and Sandy and the Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (constantly trying to suppress his desire to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his women and Mormons, between the carriage and the outlaws, and finally, all and the Navajo. There is also a classic Ford scene of a noisy dance that expresses one of its characteristic themes of the civilization that reaches the border. <br /> <br /> Again, no Duke here, but I found Ben Johnson, especially the young, dick Ben Johnson, to have an engaging stage presence. It comes with its past history, with that furrow and even when you see it while doing all the stunt riding on itself. He's exceptional here in one of his premature appearances. Harry Carey Jr., although he has been around for a few years at this time, is still pretty crude at times, but he is likeable. Ward Bond is his usual wonderful, bold. I found Joanne Dru irresistible in whatever she sees, but here she is mercifully discreet. Other familiar faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford and Hank Worden, who sound "stupid", as he will do in The Searchers a few years later. It's not fun anymore here. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely spectacular black and white photograph of the frequent Ford collaborator Bert Glennon. Not only is there a typical masterclass on landscapes and horizons, but there is also a bit of prosperity in a handful of scenes with shadow and light (sun). The soundtrack presents the legendary country music group, The Sons of the Pioneers. I can't have more cowboys than that. <br /> <br /> *** Â½ of 4
