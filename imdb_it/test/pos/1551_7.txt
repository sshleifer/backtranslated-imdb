After being suspended for a while, Columbo is back with some new mysteries made for the TV that, although not up to the original series, are better than the shows that were made in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> "Murder can be dangerous to your health" he used then (and I imagine now, if you think about it) the real crime shows the situation of a murder. The murder was committed by a true conductor of a true egomaniacal crime, George Hamilton (in a good deal of casting). His chain-smoking nemesis, who lost his job for him, played by Peter Haskell, attempts to blackmail Hamilton when he discovers a porn video that Hamilton made with a minor actress on her salad days. Hamilton uses Haskell's cigarettes to deliver the deadly blow via poison, also giving him an alibi. <br /> <br /> Columbo is led to find out what happened. You know the rest. Very funny.
