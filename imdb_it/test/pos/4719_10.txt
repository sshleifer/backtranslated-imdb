"Beyond Rangoon" is simply wonderful. From the traumatic opening to the edifying ending, you'll be amazed at how well this film is put together. Patricia Arquette incredibly plays Laura Bowman, whom we meet as a young woman who is closed and lost, unable to face her pain at the loss of her husband and her son. Throughout the course of the film, while trapped in Burma, witnessing the democratic awakening and the massacres in the capital Rangoon, she flees to save her life and saves the life of her tourist guide (U Aung Ko), is recovering her will to live. This may seem forced or heavy: it is not. John Boorman, a master in spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film roughly, and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state and physical situation. Patricia Arquette, as usual, offers a wonderfully convincing and credible performance like Laura, emotionally wounded. What Arquette does incredibly, in every role you play, gives us a window on the heart of his wordless character. Every time a close-up is given to the film, the public is given an idea of ​​his character. It does not need to talk to convey emotions or be over the top. Some critics were tough on Arquette's performance in the film when it was inaugurated on August 25th 1995, believing it was "flat" or "boring" in the role. I found its decisive characterization, remaining far from the melodramas that typically form part of an actor's performance when a personal tragedy occurs. She is shocked and reserved for her feelings: it is normal how to scream that rails against those around you. I hope that Warner Brothers will release this title on DVD very soon. With the highly successful NBC drama "Medium" by Arquette, which takes her to the family title, not to mention the victory of the Emmy and now the 2007 nomination, it would be in the best interest of the firm to do so. I hope there will be extras with the alternate ending. Not from this movie. It is one that you will not forget after seeing.
