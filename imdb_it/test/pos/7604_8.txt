This film turned out to be more or less what I expected. Of course it's corny, of course it's predictable. We all know the fairy tale. But knowing that when you go to see it, it's pretty fun to watch. It was fun and sweet. I found it annoying that they showed geeks like children who didn't wash their hair or children who loved math and joined math clubs and wore math shirts. I was an outcast in high school and I didn't do these things. It goes much deeper than that. To deal with many things, some of which are how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how much you are willing to be with other children. Anyway, I won't go in there. I disagree with other opinions that Drew is not as convincing as a geek. With braces, no tricks and unwashed hair, I don't think too many people can drool over it. And even when he returns to high school and throws those things. He still wears the "wrong" clothes, the "wrong" hair and has the "wrong" attitude to consider cool. And his other friend "geek" could be nice but it doesn't matter, where I come from, you can still be an outcast and be beautiful. (inside and outside)
