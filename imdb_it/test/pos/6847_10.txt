I found the movie Judas Kiss excellent. Carla Gugino's performance was extraordinary, probably the best of her career. His facial expressions in many scenes were incredibly faithful to the character, and were best exploited by director Gutierrez. All the actors and actresses were very good at their performances. Emma Thompsom was, as usual, wonderful. His acting skills are far above what would be required for this character, so he enhances it in the film. <br /> <br /> The story, though sometimes too intricate, is entertained and aimed towards the end. Very very good. A movie not to be missed. A well-woven and brilliantly direct plot. Film quality, excellent.
