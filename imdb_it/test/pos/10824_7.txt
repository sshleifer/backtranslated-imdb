More and more French cinema shows that it is the only one able to confront Hollywood and to spend high figures on its films. If Bon Voyage had been made in the United States no one would be surprised. Perfectly set in France, in the 40s, when the Nazi invasion, technically unexceptionable, and with some of the most French French actors (Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen ...). The centering of Bon Voyage on two parallel stories: a scientist and his disciple (Ledoyen) trying to hide one of his discoveries (a kind of water that can function as an atomic bomb) from the Nazis; and a poor boy in love with a famous actress (Adjani), who ends up in prison accused of a crime he did not commit to protect her. <br /> <br /> Bon Voyage seems to have been made in the old style, with no unnecessary movement and room effects. Without big shifts in the plot. As I said before, they did a great job about the production itself. But the main problem with this film is the script. Is it a spy movie? A romantic comedy? A spy comedy? A comedy of intrigue? It is not clear. This makes Bon Voyage a little unbalanced. When you think of watching a comedy, it suddenly turns into another plot, more dramatic, slower ... I think they should have focused on one of the lines of argument (the one on the spy plot) and left the romantic parts in the background . <br /> <br /> My vote: 6.5 / 10
