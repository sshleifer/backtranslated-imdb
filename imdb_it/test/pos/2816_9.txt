"Stripperella" is an animated series of a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper in a gentleman's club known as "The Tender Loins" and as a sexy criminal known as Stripperella, aka Agent 69 who works for a government organization. Like Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil like a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that explode or fatten up and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cents and has his two henchmen shared with a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and creator of Spider-Man). <br /> <br /> Towards the end of June 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) previewed a Thursday night block of three animated shows. These shows were "Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon"; new adventures of classic children show the characters Ren and Stimpy for adults made by the original creator John Kricfalusi, "Gary the Rat"; of a lawyer transformed into a human-sized mouse with Kelsee Grammar of "Cheers" and "Fraiser", and "Stripperella"; the adventures of a stripper who also acts as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of them first. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy while I love the original show. I was a little disappointed. It was fine, but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two having gay sex together was a little too much. Although Gary the Rat was not bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had a fantastic introductory song, it had a certain talent behind it, and it was fun to die for! The show was so stupid, I don't even know how to start explaining it! After four or five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block has disappeared, which is strange because I know he got good grades and was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go but several months later I discovered new episodes transmitted as one. I only saw one and even though it was fun to die for and I was glad to see the show after all that time, something seemed a bit off ... <br /> <br /> At first it's short running, "Stripperella" had a great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic and even a little sexy. Even the Stripperella costume looked beautiful, the character was well designed. After the long break and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of a dark and realistic look, it originally had everything now that it was really colorful and cartoony. However, Stripperella has received major changes. Before she had normal long hair, she now had bigger hair than Peggy Bundy's (married with children), if possible. Moreover, the eye mask actually shows his eyes now; before it was just white you saw that it was nice since it was more superhero. Moreover, the upper part of his costume was a kind of collar vest and his costume was dark blue; what has changed in his costume is a bluish-purple color and his superior costume is really lousy in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and much foolish in advance, but in the second half it became more comics and, although still ridiculous, hilarious, it became even stranger; for example, there was a subsequent episode on a beaver ... yes, a beaver. <br /> <br /> In any case, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, "Stripperella" only ran one season, but it was a very good show. Like the Tales from the Crypt movie "Bordello of Blood", it could be really campy but it's really fun. Until you are crazy you will find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't gotten the DVD yet for two reasons: # 1. Paramount has released and they have this wrong policy regarding not including any extras on almost all TV shows, even if this was the whole show (I would have liked to see the comment of some mams explaining the animation change and the interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and # 2. the fantastic Kid Rock song during the opening has been replaced. Now I'm not a fan, but that intro sang the show's theme WAS! If you don't intend to pay for extras, at least pay to get the original introduction song. The show also had some interesting guest stars like John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic impulse that hates models. Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was also on the show as the owner of the strip club in almost all the episodes. Even Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode. <br /> <br /> The Breakdown: <br /> <br /> PRO: it looked fantastic in the beginning, FUNNY AS HELL, a very entertaining show, great vocal talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and look at some of the things it does), and it was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned above. <br /> <br /> CONS: The series changes the animation change and the lousy DVD described above. Apart from the fact that some of the humor could be quite stupid sometimes I have nothing negative to say about this. <br /> <br /> OVERALL: Stripperella is a huge, guilty pleasure and it's just a pity it has run a season It was a very fun, sexy cult series, full of action that I hope to see the air on Adult Swim one day with the original intact intact and possibly give it another season as a Family Guy. Check it even if it's on the lousy DVD. Laugh yourself silly. <br /> <br /> Rated TV-MA: Raw and sexual humor and nudity, Duration: about 25 minutes per episode, Score: 9/10
