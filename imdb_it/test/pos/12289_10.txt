I tried to reconcile the reason why so many negative reviews of this film, while the vast majority of reviews have a rating between 7 and 10. The reason could be that this film is a bit difficult to describe in a positive review, although a few have already done quite well. This film is confusing, depressing and has no happy ending. I still gave Pola X a score of 10, because basically for me literature and art are combined on film. This is really my favorite type of directing. I've only seen two Carax films: this and Mauvis Sang. Like in this movie, I'm a little pretentious when I call it one of the best Carax movies, but I am. Carax has a minimalist style. If you don't like that kind of film and it's boring, then it would be better not to watch it. But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang, so it had a lot of intensity for a thriller, at least for my taste. I found it rather interesting and engaging. The two main roles played excellent. (I mean the main character and the young woman he thought was his half-sister.) Catherine D. is always great, but her role was not very big or significant in history. But everyone did a great job. I thought the cult material was fantastic. It may not have been very credible, but this is due to the fact that it is quite abstract. There is a lot to do between the lines in this film. This is a very Freudian psychoanalyst thriller.
