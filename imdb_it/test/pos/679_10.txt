Every time Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30s, 40s and 50s, you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the image was in black and white. Ida was able to capture the public and keep them spellbound until the end of her photos. In this film, like Mrs. Helen Gordon, "High Sierra", "41 along with Robert Ryan, (Howard Wilton)," Golden Gloves "," 40 makes you understand how the relationship will end and how poor Mrs Gordon will be in able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and true affection. If you liked Ida Lupino, who could play the roles of a criminal in a women's prison and a prison guard who was hated, this is the movie for you. I truly believe that Ida Lupino was not given the credit he deserved for his great talents in the world of cinema !!!
