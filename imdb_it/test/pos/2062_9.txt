I hadn't planned to leave a review, but seeing some of the other terrible reviews for this film, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I have no intention of giving away the ending or anything, but I give away some important points of the plot in this review, so you should be aware of it. The short (not spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis are both kicked in this movie, and it's very funny. Watch it. <br /> <br /> This film is one of my favorites of all time. Geena Davis is as perfect as the action heroine, torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother and the memories that are re-emerging from her previous life as a CIA Assassin. His interpretation is superb as he perfectly interprets both sides of this relatively complex character. <br /> <br /> The performance of Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, also excellent, as the Private Investigator that Geena Davis's character assumed to examine her forgotten past. He does a great job playing the unconscious partner of Geena Davis' difficult character. Some of the jokes he pronounces in this film are the best he has ever used in all the movies he has been to. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you haven't seen it, do it. It's a fantastic story with many unexpected twists, and it's extremely well directed and played.
