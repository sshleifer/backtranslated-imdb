I liked it. Here, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of times. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer films like this to junk like Die Hard 4 that hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have an old man who saves America. Van Damme moves well for a boy his age (47 I think), offering kicks that recall one of the kickboxers. If you like old school action and explosions, this is the movie to watch. This is one of Van Damme's best works. <br /> <br /> The films of Van Damme and Steven Seagal are distributed in the halls where I live, so I don't miss the chance to see our old action stars on the big screen.
