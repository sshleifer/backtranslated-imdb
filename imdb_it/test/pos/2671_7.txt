It is sometimes difficult to look at these self-declared "message films" from an earlier era, apparently simpler, without a degree of cynicism. The issue of racism and religious tolerance is the one that has been taught to us from an early age and, with growth, teachers and authority figures have sought less flashy but equally effective ways to get the message across. 'The House I Live In (1945)' is as unclear as the "message films", and Frank Sinatra seems to treat his audience like a child ?? indeed, perhaps this was the point, since the short film was undoubtedly intended primarily to influence young viewers. Even so, did I find myself strangely impressed when Sinatra launched into that sincere patriotic speech about what it really means to be an American? and I'm not even an American! Released just two months after the end of World War II, director Mervyn LeRoy greeted the audience tired of the war with a message of tolerance, solidarity and, above all, hope. Music is not bad either. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra with a fresh face ?? already a star, but not yet the superstar he would have become ?? opens the film in a recording studio, exploding "If You But But Dream" with a complete orchestral accompaniment. When, between a song and another, Frank goes out for a smoko, he observes a large group of kids who bully a young Jew, their provocations provoked only by his different religion. Ol 'Blue Eyes quickly puts an end to this childish behavior, delicately labeling the bullies "Nazi werewolves" and berating their irrational prejudice. Then, frankly, he gives lectures to the group on the simple nonsense of racial and religious discrimination, assuring them that every American culture, though it differs from ours, is still American in its heart ?? unless, of course, you are one of those damn "Japs". There is a bit of hypocrisy in defending racial tolerance as a nation presents itself as the collective enemy, although Hollywood can hardly be blamed for being less than enthusiastic about the Japanese situation in 1945. <br /> <br /> Sinatra driving his point at home with a wonderfully moving rendition of "The House I Live In", written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. When the songwriter first heard the song about the film, he was furious because the filmmakers had completely excluded three of his verses, which he considered fundamental to the message. These omissions were most likely due to time constraints, but Meeropol understandably did not take them too well, and reportedly needed to be expelled from the cinema. When it was released, "The House I Live In" was considered a short film so important that it won a Golden Globe for "Best film for the promotion of international goodwill" and an honorary Oscar for all those involved. In 2007, it was judged "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" and added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, which is how I learned about it. While his approach may seem a little high sixty years later, this film remains quite watchable thanks to a young boy named Frank Sinatra.
