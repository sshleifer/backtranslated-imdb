When a bomber, a parricide, a pornographer and a crazy cyclist, along with various other forms of social scum, they have had enough of their haunted cell, they locate a mouse and look for the hole. Escaping from the sewers the group of 9 souls, take advantage of their new found freedom and head towards civilization. What follows is not surprising. Complete chaos and terror follow in their wake. It seems that everyone has incomplete business to deal with. <br /> <br /> Freely inspired by The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far one of the top 5 best films I've seen this year. Running around 2 hours 9 SOULS will provide a plot so powerful that it will literally leave you breathless. The beautiful, but subtle, use of undulating walls adds to the realism that is expected of this story. The vision of the director Toshiaki Toyoda (Blue Spring, Porno Star), is completely stunning while it realizes a sense of pity towards the characters. With the same rapidity with which each character captures his dream, he is quick as if he were torn from them. Now, all the responsibility for the success of this film should not only fall on the shoulders of the director, but the props must also go to the actors. This film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda (son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition) offers a stellar performance, and seems to bring some of his mothers quirks to the screen. <br /> <br /> I also have to give props to the Artsmagic DVD. This is their sixth movie I've seen now, and they seem to improve every DVD. The sound quality is perfect and the image; clean and fresh. It is very annoying to try to watch a movie that is too dark in the transfer, so the disks of these cats are cute. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film will soon receive a masterpiece status of spectators from all over the world. Watch in 2005 for 9 SOULS; it's a really amazing movie to watch.
