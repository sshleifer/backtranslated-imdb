Simply beautiful. One of the best minds - umm ... screws - in existence. Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles all the way through this story of a children's book writer who - maybe? - wrote a subversive treaty. Moscow could learn some things from torture techniques in this film. They could even do worse than hiring Alan Rickman. Five out of five stars and currently (1-20-2000) # 2 on my 100 best films of all time.
