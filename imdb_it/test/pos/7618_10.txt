This is a really hilarious movie and I've seen it many times. Drew Barrymore is as brilliant as Josie Geller, as is David Arquette as his brother. You are ashamed of embarrassment at the thought of his return to high school as the film is a reminder of how high school was! His clothes are extravagant and bizarre, and bring back memories of those who dressed a little differently! The magnificent Michael Vartan was adorable as a teacher (I wish there were teachers like that when I was in high school!) And Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a movie you can watch again and again, with a fabulous soundtrack! One for everyone at school in the 90s to watch!
