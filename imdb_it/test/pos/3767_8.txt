Who are the people who act in this thing? Never heard of them !! But this is one of the funniest comedies I've met. He should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd begins with Dr. Jeykl sniffing his dust and turning into a sexual demon. He is chased by a libido-driven nurse at the beginning of the film in one of the funniest scenes in the film. Pay attention to the background PA hospital system; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde who accepted the award made me laugh for years. Oh ... and the "Busty Nurse" is Cassandra Peterson, who became Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed classic Mel Brooks movies (Blazing Saddles, etc.), I suspect you'd like this one. <br /> <br /> Damn shame that you can't have DVDs anywhere. <br /> <br /> It is available on DVD now !!!!! Fortunately, DVDs are not consumed by use !!!!!
