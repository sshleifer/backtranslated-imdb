ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" is the story of a nobody who gets pushed into fame, only to realize that living his dream is not the way he imagined it. We've already seen all this (in the best films), but this human story captures the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and perceptive edge. It follows a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. The script, by the director "Crazy / Beautiful" John Stockwell, portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images - he doesn't explain what it is, he shows us. <br /> <br /> "Rock Star", originally titled "Metal God", sees Mark Wahlberg as Chris "Izzy" Cole, a Pittsburgh sales office who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the singer flagship of the heavy metal rock band, Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings for his rock band tribute called Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those of Steel Dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. His group gets angry with Chris's obsessions and gives him the boot. <br /> <br /> This upsets Chris, as well as his supportive parents and his loyal girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston of "Friends" on TV). Then he receives a call. It's the Steel Dragon band. They saw Chris's tapes and they want him to replace the recently fired solo singer. In an instant, Chris enters the dizzying world of sudden celebrity, from the biggest fan of rock to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it's not as rewarding as expected. <br /> <br /> A true story inspired the concept of "Rock Star". An Ohio supply vendor, Tim "Ripper" Owens, really replaced Rob Halford, the lead singer of Judas Priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. The rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. The film describes the various difficulties of being a rock star. Explore aspects of the tour, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, distressed relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty and extreme measures by manufacturers to satisfy fans and keep popularity high. <br /> <br /> I've seen all of Mark Wahlberg's films, and this is the first one that has gained my affection. Wahlberg, a former singer / model, has made films like "Fear", "Boogie Nights" "Three Kings" and, more recently, Tim Burton's missing remake "Planet of the Apes". I'm starting to admire the young actor more and more. Although he has not acted in many successful films, he has had many opportunities and played a variety of roles. "Rock Star" is his best film to date. I can't think of many actors who might have interpreted Chris Cole's struggles and aspirations convincingly. Wahlberg really makes "Rock Star" rock. <br /> <br /> Even Jennifer Aniston illuminates the screen. Create a relationship rich in chemistry with Chris that induces public participation. It is tragic of what happens to their relationship. We take care of these characters a lot. <br /> <br /> During the scenes of the film, director Stephen Herek (who also directed "Holy Man" and the live action version of "101 Dalmatians") creates a compelling atmosphere. Capture the scenes with intense urgency and a raw and unmistakable energy. Musical numbers provide the film with the best and most engaging scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Herek cannot sustain energy and joy in everything. At the three-quarter mark, it loses the spark while the film becomes boring and unpleasant. I understand where the story has to go to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it had previously done. In "Almost Famous", a much better film on rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life even in the most painful scenes. Here, it seems that the directors lose their passion. <br /> <br /> The message arrives a little too late and suddenly in history. The film turns into a moral tale that wants to provide us with a multi-faceted destination. Filmmakers could also stop everything, appear on the screen and say: "public time, the moral of the story is ??" We understand the theme, but it's too instant. Chris' personal discovery must be gradual. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the movie, barely enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonable feature. "Rock Star" is not a great film - see "Almost Famous" if you want an extraordinary rock and roll film - but for Marky Mark, it's a turning point in his career. <br /> <br />
