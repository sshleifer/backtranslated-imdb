Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security company owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton company is in financial difficulty for, unknown to the owner, has an employee who is selling secrets to the owner of a rival business (Jim Bacchus). He is not Brian, because he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, partly because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a weakness for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for courting her. However, Brian has developed an excellent security device. It's called CHOMPS, which stands for canine home security system. The device, which looks like a dog, is actually a computer-controlled animal with the ability to break down walls and make siren sounds to catch thieves. The rival owner sends two botched spies (one is red) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton's security? This is a fun family film from the old school of good and clean entertainment. CHOMPS is, of course, a real dog, played by the adorable and talented Benji. In fact, Benji has a duel role, as Brian also has a "real" dog named Rascal. Just looking at this little dog in action is pure joy, since it is able to climb walls, "pull" trucks and operate the machine's buttons to capture the bad guys. Even the human cast is very nice, with everyone giving optimistic and contagious performances. Costumes, landscapes and production values ​​are also good. Even if you may have trouble finding the film, it would be worth trying to get a vision for your loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful and healthy diversion from the problems of the world.
