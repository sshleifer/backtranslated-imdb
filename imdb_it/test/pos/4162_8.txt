Emanuele Crialese has done a fantastic job with one of those movies that grip you for years. It was Breath (see comments and synopsis here on IMDb). <br /> <br /> Now, transporting the magnificent young talents he had on the screen for the first time, he takes the audience into a dark void. A literal dive into dangerous waters. The topic is migration. In this case, from Italy to the New World (the name of the film). A big deal calls him for his American release "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest - that is, their lives, for a dream. <br /> I'm sorry to ruin the show by telling the story, so I will dwell a bit on Crialese's work and his whole team did so brilliantly. <br /> <br /> First of all, by choosing to stick to it he knows: direct sound as much as possible. This means, the whole movie. Textures, pain, the nuances of reality are always mixed with smells, heat or cold, sweat and blood, life and death, as vibrant as in real life. <br /> <br /> The squeaks of bent metal and jarring wood, the infamous wind hum and the disturbing sounds of large engines and ship horns are among the points that make this film so engaging. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present from the first shot (again, almost the first shot of Respiro) and pervades the whole film with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation. The subdued tones and very gray and sad images of the people who suffer from the narrow and dirty boat that set sail to hope is fascinating. <br /> <br /> The light is scarcely used, almost to discover each character in the dark. The beauty of each shot, and each scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical traits of the actors. <br /> <br /> Also in this case, as always, Vincenzo Amato is definitely alone. He plays the father of two children (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now have nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always transmits to his very complex characters. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsbourg is so-so. I imagine he never reached perfection again achieved in The Cement Garden and in his first film: L'Effront√©e. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just that it looks a little strange in his role. <br /> <br /> The places and sets are harsh and irresistible, almost playing a character of their own. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most remarkable character is the one played by Filippo Pucillo, the dumb younger son. The contrast here with his first role is complete. Then, he played an overloaded child who was as relentless as anything around him. Now, his character is all expression. And just that: no words. His eyes tell the whole story with sublime power. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the United States. He is absolutely Italian in everything. It is so Italian that most of the time, language is one of the many dialects that is much older than Italian itself. In the United States this film could be a little too much for Americans because of the subject. But whoever remembers the history of their families when they arrived in the United States will see these films in awe. <br /> <br /> And again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with Crialese's ideas is back with a closing scene in the water. Only this time he goes from underwater photography to the plane. <br /> <br /> All in all, another great and very well-told story of this director who only this year (2006) collected 6 awards and was nominated for the Golden Lion. Not a small action!
