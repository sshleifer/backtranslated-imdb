I've always been a fan of this largely unseen film from Gershwin's opera since I last saw it in 1959. As many of you know, it wasn't available on video or DVD; in fact, the Gershwin family has tried to destroy all existing prints. <br /> <br /> However, for some reason - hopefully signaling the end of his opposition, the Gershwin family recently approved the screening of a collectible print at the Moving Image Museum in Astoria, Queens. . <br /> <br /> Well, the widescreen and technicolor print was excellent! (Not perfect, but excellent). The sound was outstanding, in street quality stereo. People who saw this in their original version would not have seen a much better copy. (The program's notes include Variety's original review, which warns that people might reject the ticket price at a low price of $ 3.50!) <br /> <br /> And, as much as I loved it originally , PORGY AND BESS was better than I remembered it. It's simply wonderful. Sidney Poitier in the role of Porgy was at the point where his career was starting to catch fire, and his charisma shines through. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is extraordinarily beautiful. Brock Peters as Crown is aggressively male. Pearl Bailey as Maria provides some comic moments, even if her role is small. And Sammy Davis, Jr., like Sporting Life, steals every scene he finds himself in; it's particularly compelling in its two big numbers: "It's not necessarily so" and "There is a boat that is Leavin 'early for New York". (The latter won the applause in the projection I saw.) <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS is set, but it doesn't matter when the set is as beautiful as this. The costumes are also exceptional. <br /> <br /> The sung voices of Sidney and Dorothy are dubbed, but they are nicknamed extremely well. The exquisite "Summertime" is sung by Clara, played by a young Diahann Carroll; his singing is also nicknamed. (Actually, only Pearl and Sammy do their vocalization.) <br /> <br /> The music is sublime, of course, but what really struck me this time was how much emotion Preminger had from the story. People actually sniffed the audience a number of times - once when Bess sang that beautiful "I Loves You Porgy". And I really enjoyed the audience laughing out loud at the "It Is not Necessarily So" lines. Could it be that they had never heard this song before or never heard it? I believe that much of the emotional impact of this film is due to the interpretations of Poiter and Dandridge - you root for their love of winning. <br /> <br /> A small quirk with a 136-minute span - one or two slow scenes, and some sort of stereotypical Amos-n-Andy scene on Bess that sees a shyster lawyer to get a divorce from Crown even if she isn't even married to him. (I would have cut that.) And the beginning is a bit confusing - both characters are embarrassingly introduced - they're part of the movie before they realize who they are. <br /> <br /> And I don. I think Preminger used a single close-up in the whole movie. Everything seems to be shot in 3/4, which I think is his way of working with the big screen. <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult film for those of us who have seen it, for those of us who loved the soundtrack, and for some of us who have only heard about it . We hope they find a way to repost this and put it on DVD. It deserves the widest possible audience.
