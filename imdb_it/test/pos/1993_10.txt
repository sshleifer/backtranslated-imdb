Who should watch this movie? Anyone who has ever taken acid has read Philip K. Dick, thought that the premise of the Matrix was better than the special effects, that he had an interest in philosophy or that he liked having a sense of reality messed up. I laughed aloud at this film, just because it was so outrageous and so apt. This movie is fantastic. This movie is fantastic. It's better than the Matrix, for a long time (I didn't fall asleep in Existenz, for a kick-off: action / special effects films bore me and, despite a plausible philosophical glory, this is exactly what Matrix is) . Existenz is disgusting, it's scary, and it's fun. David Cronenberg did some shonky things (Rabid) and some works of genius (Videodrome is worth it, like the adaptation of Stephen King The Dead Zone). But this is one of my all-time favorites. I can't remember the ending, which is a good thing, because it means I can watch it again. Or maybe I never watched this movie. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe it 'really' happened to me. I do not know. However, it is now perfectly embroidered in my general illusion of reality, and I am happy.
