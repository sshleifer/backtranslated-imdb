taking into consideration the films of Chan that follow, this is not bad. A lot of stereotypes that start with the black man at the beginning and when the police captain orders that "every Hindu in the city" be rounded up. A parade of stereotyped characters enters the scene including Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to move quickly through the city from Sutton Pl. To the W. village in a flash. The ending is stupid. An obvious toy airplane is used as it rises through the sky and then plunges to the nose. Ed Wood couldn't have done it better. The final scene is absurd as the killer will incriminate himself obviously in an attempt to calm the only person who knows his identity. Overall, it's worth watching.
