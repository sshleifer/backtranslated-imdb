I first heard of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya from a critic on Youtube. He literally slapped the show with a bad ugly gasp, condemning it as garbage and confused. Curious, I decided to watch the show (once I got the order of the episodes right, thanks to those who made the lists), and I found it absolutely brilliant and fun to watch. Great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely adorable and fun; a unique and not excessive plot that makes sense now that I've seen the show; and two of the best anime moments in history, in my opinion. Furthermore, the opening and closing themes are fantastic. <br /> <br /> The anime, based on a collection of successful manga novels, follows a simple plot, once understood. While the show's focus is on the main character, Haruhi Suzumiya, the point of view is of her friend Kyon. Kyon is a regular high school student who does not really believe in supernatural things (eg Santa Claus, aliens, time travelers, ghosts, espers) but soon ends up talking to Haruhi, who is the school's strangest girl and I prefer to go out with an alien, considering all men worthless. She also joined all the school clubs to find something interesting, but resigned as quickly as she joined. On Kyon's advice, Haruhi decides to form her club with the Kyon club. In the literary club room, Haruhi forms the SOS Brigade - her mission to investigate supernatural cases (think of Scooby-Doo without the dog, the masked man and the Machine of Mysteries). <br /> <br /> Haruhi "recruits" three extra members. The first is Yuki Nagato, a bookworm who speaks very little and spends most of his time reading and sitting. The second is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl who is forced into the club by Haruhi who thinks she needs a cute mascot to do something. She is often forced into costume by Haruhi to improve her cuteness. The third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and sociable transfer student who always smiles. While Haruhi thinks her group is full of normal people, it couldn't be more wrong. While Kyon is as normal as it gets, the other three are rather unique - Yuki is an alien, Mikuru is a time traveler from the future, and Itsuki is an esper (a person who has ESP). All three have come to watch over Haruhi who could have the powers of a god, and if he gets bored, he might be able to discover his powers and create a whole new world, and Kyon is involved in some way. <br /> <br /> The show deserves to be seen with great characters, music and some funny and wonderful moments. However, for parents, there are some sexual references including the neckline of Mikuru that is exposed or touched repeatedly, and also many used swear words. Apart from that, the show is one of the big ones.
