The "mania" of the vampire has, in my opinion, demonstrated his dignity of such a notorious categorization. There were a lot of sub-genre films from a multitude of countries last year. I have reviewed many and have others to discuss. Forgive my indulgence, but since I recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which is and, incidentally, represents my favorite horror staple). Now I will move out of North America for a while and hopefully present you in the sense of films you have not seen at the time. <br /> <br /> Of the many effects of Twilight is the creation of "vampire movies" boy "and" girl ". I hate this sexist categorization, which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into" parts ". I think men are inclined to hate the work of Stephenie Meyer (and her offspring) to some extent because they feel a sense of betrayal that an archetype that has always been theirs is now released. Women are unlikely to enjoy future "neutral" photos since they grew up with ironic expectations that have been applied four times.We need more directors to create vampire movies that are the genre that can (unequally) enjoy if vampires survive madness and will remain relevant Cue: Thirst This Korean film was directed by Oldboy's Park Chan-Wook There are two ways to dissect it, or it is between genre expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable, or it is a mess chaos who does not decide which target audience they prefer and should therefore not be seen by anyone. Don't let me convince you that the film has no inclinations. His director is a man whose fame is the plot-based action movie. His protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (we'll talk about that later). However, his desire for a woman he knew both before and after mortal life is not invented, and his attention is restored. There is a male inclination to this image, yet it is not so one-way that women could not enjoy it. The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moon. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a novel by Emile Zola entitled Thérèse Raquin, which I have not read. According to Wikipedia, the novel is about a relationship that develops between a married woman and a single man. He kills his husband during a fishing trip and starts going out with her. The two are unable to have sex because they depict the body of the dead between them. They are so driven to madness, but they take care of the woman's sick mother. At the end of the novel, they try to kill each other, discover each other's plans and commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Now, transcribe this almost 150 year old French novel in modern South Korea and you have Thirst. Chan-Wook does not embellish the story enough to elevate this to be seen. He often ignores many of his ideas to follow his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are upset by the narrative. His use of the mother-in-law as the counterpart of their bad romance is simply perfect. Watch it. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is originally a devout Christian who becomes a vampire after a transfusion of defective blood following his volunteer work for a new medicine. He thus becomes the god with whom he was once struck. People crowd for him and see him as a great healer. OK. It's really cool and could have provided a good basis for his relationship. And yet this idea is given a little idea of ​​time on the screen as it turns into a figure of a realist Christ who tries to maintain his virtue even if his lifestyle demands that he renounce it. Instead of dealing with delusional people, he prefers to sip the blood of hospital patients in a coma. <br /> <br /> Let's continue with the Christian allusion. The woman deceives the vampire man to kill her husband. The overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and eventually warns her friends in the family of her mother-in-law's betrayal (fiddling with her fingers). The man kills her but resuscitates her. The two invite former friends and the woman begins to torment the humans without mercy. The man says it's enough and he decides to go to a beach and force her to wait for the dawn with him. Both die, but he reproaches his crimes (and his but the film portrays his illness more clearly). <br /> <br /> The female character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior. She is a housewife with no education, while the man is a priest whose mortal life is restrictive. Vampirism magnifies their characteristics. Become a monster like you'd expect from someone without knowledge. Become a demigod with a spirit. His life is how atheists see themselves and his life is how religious people see those without divine intervention.
