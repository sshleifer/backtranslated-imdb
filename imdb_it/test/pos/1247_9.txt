This is one of Bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, it's a moving film, with a well-made story and an extraordinary performance by Bruce Willis! All the characters are fantastic, and I thought that Willis and Spencer Breslin were just fantastic together, and Bruce Willis is just great at that! This is definitely one of Bruce's best comedies (The waaaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was fantastic) and I thought it was very well written and realized, plus The ending is particularly beautiful! He is good-natured and it was good to see how Russell's character (Willis) changed during the movie! moreover, the ending was pretty good. I think this should be higher than 6.0 and it's one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen! besides it has many surprising moments in all. All the characters are extremely nice and also have a beautiful love story, in addition to Bruce and Spencer Breslin who both have really funny lines (Holy Smokes!). This is one of Bruce's most underrated films in my opinion, it's a moving film, with a well-made story and an extraordinary performance by Bruce Willis and I say it's a must see! The direction is great! Jon Turteltaub does a great job here with a great photographic work, and keeps the film at a very fast pace. Acting is excellent! Bruce Willis is amazing as always and he's fantastic here, he gives one of his best comic performances, he's hilarious and had a wonderful chemistry with both Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, he had some funny jokes, and he died throughout the movie It was one of the main reasons why I liked this movie so much! (Rules of Willis !!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is as fantastic as the younger version of Russell, he was very funny and he didn't get on my nerves once, he's one of the best child actors out there! Emily Mortimer is as good as Amy and she was really nice I liked her too she had a good chemistry with Bruce. Lily Tomlin is as funny as Janet, I liked her a little. Jean Smart is good with what he had to do, which wasn't much. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall it's a must see! **** out pf 5
