I had the opportunity to speak with co-creator, Rebecca Cammisa, at the 2002 High Falls film festival in Rochester, New York. He said his style must be completely open and uninhibited in the cinema, but he was very happy to be so heavily constrained in the narrow quarters of the group's home. The narrow corridors and small rooms have been skillfully taken with a realism that would have been lost with controlled and deliberate work. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen herself is an extraordinary character, coming from the tragedy in her own life to being an unusual combination of care, tenacity and street smart. The way the film introduces us to its past is excellent, spending only a few carefully selected minutes scattered throughout. <br /> <br /> In all, I can't begin to accumulate the praise for this movie properly. It is truly a treasure of cinema and the subject is a treasure of humanity.
