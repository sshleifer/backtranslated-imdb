While most of the films that put humans against the horrendous extraterrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the "Aliens" series, Pitch Black is a beautiful piece of science fiction and an excellent film around. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is lighting. This film beautifully employs many colors, shades and light intensities that create the atmosphere and give the film a unique feeling, something different from the "normal" cinematic lighting to which we are generally subjected. Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner, skillfully avoiding the habitual portrait of the inveterate criminal. After all, the film is about Riddick's (Diesel's character) personal journey, so fortunately Vin doesn't drop the ball. The rest of the cast (with the exception of the talented and beautiful Claudia Black) was unknown to me but they all turned into wonderful performances, animating the different characters with peculiarities and unique mannerisms. Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a great movie without the resources of an excessive budget. The special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the only goal, as in many high-budget "blockbusters". It's a great film because it uses Science Fiction as a means of telling a compelling and provocative story, rather than telling a mediocre story to use the science fiction flash.
