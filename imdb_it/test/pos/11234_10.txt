It is quite evident that many of your nights have been spent alone. If you watched 5 minutes of the real show instead of watching the spot, you would have seen one of the greatest TV shows in Canadian history. Too bad you're watching him alone. Probably the reason why you hate it ... no game. The keys for the VIPs are hilarious, light and fun. Guys are going to eat this show. My game is tight and I can't wait to get on this show. The chicks were HOOOOOT and the clubs kicked in the ass. I'll watch every week. I wonder why you don't make bigger shows like this. It is now clear that talent in Canada has the capacity to produce American quality television.
