In & Out is a comedy with a simple premise. Admirably he succeeds in the mission of being fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The comedy in this film ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime, the physical comedy exists alongside dry humor, with a nice turn from Bob Newhart. Kevin Kline is predictably in good shape in this film, along with Tom Selleck who does not play his kind of "square jaw" point man. Mr. Selleck interprets his humor well and shows a good sense of comic time. The cast makes this movie successful. <br /> <br /> Not all movies with homosexual themes are made to advance a sort of left and hidden Hollywood agenda, in reality this film was made simply to entertain, and if any part of it film makes the viewer think, so it was a by-product of work well done by an exceptional cast of professionals. Often ironic, I found myself laughing at the right moments. A solid "B."
