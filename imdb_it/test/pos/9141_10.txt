With a little wine, some friends and a bit of a good mood, I had a great time watching this movie. I particularly liked Jilon Ghai's performance (as "Randy"), which was such a kick in the pants! His scenes with Charity Rahmer ("Michelle") were wildly funny. I wouldn't want it to come from me, but it was nice to watch "Randy" try to score with "Michelle" and even better to see the results! Of course, even the girls in the movie are very fun to watch. And, a friend of mine showed me the problem of PLAYBOY that Pilar Lastra had as the companion of the month. She is definitely a looker. All in all, this film completely served its purpose, which was to entertain us in a light and worry-free way.
