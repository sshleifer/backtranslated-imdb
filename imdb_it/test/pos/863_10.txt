When I saw Stella for the central comedy for the first time I thought "God, it's horrible!" But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew something didn't make sense. There was nothing left for me to do but look for Stella shorts that I had heard had more dildos than any other comedy troupe. When I found them, not only did my expectations on dildos meet, but I probably found the greatest comedy scenes I've seen in years. The set of twenty strange short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs. Not only did I laugh my ass the first time I looked at them but I kept laughing louder when I looked at them again and again. It's really a pity that Comedy Central had cable television restrictions for the Stella series. It would have done much better on HBO or Showtime. Their brand of humor cannot be limited by censors or popular culture. Given even if it was on HBO I'm sure the "masses" would have voted canceled in a season or not, but it would have been fantastic nonetheless. Needless to say, I am now in love with Stella and all her individual members. Any fan of Stella should check out David Wain's site with all his short films. They are equally pleasing as Stella herself. So my hat goes to Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black and David Wain for the incredible comedy they did with Stella. I hope to see more of the crew in the future.
