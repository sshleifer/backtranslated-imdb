well done documentary on a sailing competition, sanity and the loss of both. <br /> <br /> I remembered reading Sir Francis Chichester's story of his journey around the world when I was in high school while watching this movie. what an adventure it was. <br /> <br /> the deep water tells an equally fascinating story. <br /> <br /> it takes a special person and an excellent sailor to manage a journey without stopping all over the world ... alone. <br /> <br /> this film does a great job of proving it. <br /> <br /> I love to sail, and my brother runs from J-30. <br /> <br /> but I could never make such a feat.
