I saw my beautiful Bollywood films when I was growing up - you know that the typical plot boy meets the girl, the girl rejects the boys, the dakus (the bad guys) take the girl away, the boy saves the girl killing hundreds of dhakus and getting married happily (Of course I omitted an hour of musical style numbers) .. Well going to look at Hari Om, I was expecting another typical Bollywood style movie; however, to my great satisfaction, it turned out to be atypical and really quite comical. Bharatbala's Hari Om is the one that could be labeled as one of those "off beat" Indian films like the famous South Asian hits like Monsoon Wedding, East is East or Bend it Like Beckham. <br /> <br /> Being of South Decent Asian and having seen various classic Bollywood films, there was a lot of humor and sub-dialogues that could be gathered that reminded me of the fun and fascinating side of Indian culture (for example, the various Indopop numbers that were actually redone by Nitin Soni or the witty Indian slang that were used). Hari Om can be appreciated by all South Asians, and it is also fun for those who are not accustomed to Indian humor, since the characters and the plot are aimed at all viewers. <br /> <br /> In a cocunutshell, the film is autoscrips driver (aka "four-wheeler" for those of you who have traveled to India know it) played by Vija Raaz (from Monsoon Wedding) who gets involved with a cheater and ends up making him a lot of money. To avoid selling his four wheels, "Madhuri" escapes accidentally with "Madhuri" and a very charismatic and beautiful woman from France, Isa (Camille Natta), who is escaping the boredom of her boyfriend Benoit (Jean Marie Lamour who was in the pool). Is the film of their journey traveling through the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan ?? the land of love stories; through humor you see the two main actors trying to find out who they really are. <br /> <br /> What made the evening most memorable was having the director, executive producer, lead editor, and even the lady's mother. Natta present at the screening. After talking with Bharatbala (which actually has a zoological background) many interesting curiosities of the film were discovered, including: having the film finished only 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and taking only 45 days to shoot and have only five actors in the game (the rest were all the first real actors). Arriving home I understood two things about the film - that there is always a human connection between each of us, despite our differences and secondly, as the director had said "Everyone has a love story". <br /> <br /> It is a must SEE for everyone!
