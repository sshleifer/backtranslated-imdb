I had the great pleasure of recently seeing this beautiful film adaptation of the 1943 stage awakening (which unlike the original 1935 production) which included extensive spoken recitatives. This had been the fashion at that time, so blaming the film for a 16-year tradition. The film should be seen, if nothing else, for Sammy Davis Jrs, a brilliant feline performance like Sportin 'Life, which comes and goes from the shadows. His seduction of BESS by Dorothy Dadridge "There will soon be a departure of a boat for New York" is one of the many highlights. Almost all the main music is intact and beautifully sung. He certainly never bores the recent versions of PBS and MET. It was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the film, and I hope that it will be made available in the near future for generations that have not had the chance to try it.
