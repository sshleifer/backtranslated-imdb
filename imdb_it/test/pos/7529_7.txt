Pepe Le Pew can really scare you or totally wipe out your feet. However, you can't help but feel a little afraid of seeing this classic WB character. This commentator personally believes that Pepe was the inspiration behind other casanovas animated today by "Johnny Bravo" by Cartoon Network at Disney's Lumiere from "Beauty and the Beast". <br /> <br /> His unique brand of love-making is a wonder in today's world, where his antics would normally be slapped with a sexual harassment mandate and at least 50 m away from all his victims . <br /> <br /> In this particular cartoon, a tired cat from the world decides to make a final makeover and gain some respect for a change to pretend to be a skunk. Everything is fine, until Pepe arrives and promptly chases the unfortunate feline with his exciting overwhelming creation of love. <br /> <br /> The foundations for Pepe's numerous brands are placed in this cartoon. From his adorable "Francopathic" love he turns to his pursuer of unbearable calm. <br /> <br /> This comic goes just to show that, as far as the world of cartoon fantasy is concerned, the most daring suitor can go far ... and have his beloved "pigoneone" that he leaves behind traces of their dust.
