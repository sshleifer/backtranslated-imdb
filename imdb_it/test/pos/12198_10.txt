Surface is one of the largest t.v. series I've seen. The acting is great and the plot is compelling. Each episode left me barely able to wait to watch the next one. I especially thought that Carter Jenkins, who played Miles Bennett, did a great job ... he's a very talented actor and I can't wait to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that Surface has only done one season ... once again the public disappointed me. It is difficult to understand that a great show like this would be canceled, while the crap reality shows continue year after year. Anyone who has made the decision to cancel this show has really dropped the ball on this one.
