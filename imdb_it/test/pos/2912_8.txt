When this film is right, it does really well. And when it goes wrong ... I would say that the 3/4 complete of the film are great. I can also isolate the bad bit. It is all that has to do with romance. Everything you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes, but it drags on for about 30. I would recommend skipping that section if possible. He does nothing but explain his exile. It should have been a small point of the plot quickly put aside. Fortunately, the period between 0-30 and 1: 00-2: 19 (The End) is excellent. <br /> <br /> There are a number of excellent performances in this film, and an equal number of terrible ones. Just like everything else in this film, acting is perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov as the slimy slave with one eye Kaptah is perfect. It's one of his best performances, up there with his role in Spartacus. Even Victor Mature as the ambitious Horemheb is perfect. Again, one of his best roles. Jean Simmons is wasted as Merit, the perfect girl in love with our hero, John Carradine, has a nice supporting role as a philosophical thief; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who seeks to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt just to see it fall apart due to his reluctance to fight. Now for the bad guy. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is sadly mixed. This is doubly unfortunate as it is the main character. The whole film revolves around him. He is actually quite as good as the disillusioned exile and the wise old man. This is because of its very limited range. He doesn't seem able to put any passion into his words. This is particularly evident during love scenes that are over embarrassing. He spends the last half of the film like an old man, a performance he is quite decent. It has the perfect voice for the character. The less they said of Bella Darvi in ​​the role of Nefer, the perfidious Babylonian woman, the better. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets are magnificent. This is the only film I know that attempts to describe the life in Egypt that is not obscured by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the fourteenth century BC which is even before the Exodus. The only monotheists are the pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. There is the same strong element of religious zeal that can be found in most epic films, but it is done differently and manifests itself only at the end. An interesting note: having Akhenaton followed by Horemheb as a pharaoh, the film completely skips the most famous pharaoh of all: Tutankhamun. It seems that a strange thing to do when using that name could increase the awareness of the film. <br /> <br /> Be careful: this is an epic movie from the 50s. If you don't like that kind of thing, then don't expect this to be different. It's different, but it's still an epic poem. I appreciate this film and I appreciate what he did and what he tried to do. This is a film that should be remembered better than it is.
