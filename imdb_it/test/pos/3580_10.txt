A breathtaking view of the ocean and life within it. <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> Working with the camera was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see all the different animals that I never even imagined. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough has the perfect voice of the narrator. No one could have done better. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> There were one or two different times when there was a reference to the Earth of 1 million years (I hold a different belief). <br /> <br /> Overall a TV series that anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. Stars 10/10.
