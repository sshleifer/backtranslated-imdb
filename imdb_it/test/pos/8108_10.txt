I was surprised and impressed to discover that this film was released in 1940, before the United States entered World War II. On the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misinterpreted as an eruption. But the splendor of Chaplin does not just make a joke on everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message would not have been as valid if it had not been for the excellent use of humor in this film along with moments of dramatic mixed drama. The drama alone would not have had the bite and resonance that this film has made. Laughing with someone (Adenoid Hynkel) may be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) may be the best way to love them. In the final speech of the Jewish barber, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about took place more than half a century ago. These are words that have meaning now and at any time during the war. For this reason I believe that the film has had a much greater benefit than the damage, since it still has the same profound effect today.
