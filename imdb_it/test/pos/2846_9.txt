I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone, including "the young and the restless". However, I imagine that some of the bad words, violence and sexual allusions in the film are not suitable for "all your children". However, before the sand fills the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the movie: "Nurse Betty". Renee Zellweger plays Betty. She's a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance and thinks she's a real star of her favorite soap opera. For this reason, she sets off on a trip to Los Angeles to reunite with her alleged lover of soap opera character Dr. Rubell. To add fuel to the fire, it is chased by some ruthless killers who do not believe they have stolen their drugs. You could say that this is how Nurse Betty spends "the days of her life" throughout the film. This very "generic" situation eventually leads her to the hospital set of her beloved soap opera. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks it's all true. It is as if his mind was in "another world". Ok! Quite! I will dry my mouth with soap and will not mention other names of soap. I have already registered my vote for Renee as the best nominated Oscar actress. Furthermore, Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Rubell was as good as in his acting biography. To sum up, my final diagnosis is that everyone should call "Nurse Betty". ***** Excellent
