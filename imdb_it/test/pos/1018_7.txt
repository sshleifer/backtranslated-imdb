"Are you home alone?" it belongs to the days of pre-cable TV when networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It is a thriller well done with a cast of talent and credible situations. Kathleen Beller plays a high school student who receives a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think it's nothing but a joke but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is the high school principal and Dennis Quaid has one of his first roles as an arrogant child. He is a competent chiller with a still relevant social message. Beller is adorable - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that it was very popular with young people. Blythe Danner, who usually doesn't like me, offers really touching performances. Nice little movie.
