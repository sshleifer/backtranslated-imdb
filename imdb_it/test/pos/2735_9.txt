This is a multi-faceted, insightful and bold story about people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and our) perception and reality. Although the main theme revolves around a delirious young woman, the story flirts delightfully with physics, medicine, religion and even politics while questioning our perceptions of what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma transmits magnificently that the world in which Mithi is living is as real to her as ours is to us. Within that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, not the incomprehensible that appear to us in our world. <br /> <br /> Here are some amazing scenes to watch while watching the movie Do not worry, these are not spoilers). I absolutely loved the way Aparna Sen put these comments into the story. <br /> <br /> - References to quantum mechanics and relativity mixed with the sorcerer ("ojha" in Hindi) performing his religious rites he believes will take away the "ghosts" sitting in Mithi's brain. <br /> <br /> - The doctor prescribes shock treatment as a solution "believed" to work <br /> <br /> - Windows of perception - The scene on Anu's book review. <br /> <br /> - The allusion to illusion in a conversation about a director in search of "maya". <br /> <br /> - News of George Bush telling the whole world that "there is no doubt in his mind" that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (now, it's not so much for the perception of Bush , I suspect he knew the truth, like the perception of the gullible public about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.) <br /> <br /> - One of the best scenes in the film is where Mithi tells Anu "Charu sent this man to beat me "and Anu dismissed it as an obvious thing. Konkona did a fantastic job, bringing out the strange mix of confused thoughts in the brain of a schizophrenic when his world and the real world collide. Aparna Sen was bold, but not bold enough to ask a big question: Is it almost entirely the delusional human race to believe in God? He could have included some scenes of "normal", "healthy" people who prayed and sacrificed themselves for a Being that no one has ever seen or heard in all of human history (the ritual / exorcism scene does not go far enough). This would be the last question: what is normal? Who is the reality is right, IMHO of the Believer or of the atheists? <br /> <br />, this film is a much more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind of "A Beautiful Mind". Look at the minds not only of the sick person, but also of health, and does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our minds and our world. If the first has 4 Oscars, this deserves more - At least one for history, script, director, Konkona and Shabana Azmi. It was really a pleasure to see this movie and I'm glad I bought the DVD for my collection. <br /> <br /> This was a very well told story.
