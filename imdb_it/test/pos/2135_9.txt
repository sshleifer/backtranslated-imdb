So many of us who are dedicated to the "art" of the film will neglect or forget that movies are also businesses. Most of the time, they are too expensive to produce to be something else. In light of this, it often seems to me a miracle that they are made really big from time to time. Once in a while, filmmakers will reach such a low budget for the production of a film that the businessmen responsible for financing the business will suffer serious financial damage and will obviously be very angry about it. I'd like to know precisely how this happens that this has often led both the big studios and some critics to "shoot" the image when it was finally published. Terrible expectations are generated and often what people expect to see clouds are their perception of what they are seeing. <br /> <br /> You can see this phenomenon at work in the imperfect, but magnificent "62 re-make 0f" Mutiny on the Bounty ", and you can surely see it in the reaction to" Heaven's Gate ". Cimino took too long and it cost United Artists too much money to take this photo. The company was mortally wounded by its excesses and, no doubt, powerful people were out to see its reputation ruined forever when this strange epic was finally released. spectators who do not like long and heavy images. The narrative in this film is not realized with great economy or lively rhythm. Like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often chooses not to specify the particular affirmation he is making with a given scene. he draws it in such a way as to make the spectator feel as if they were living at that moment, giving time for their imagination to participate in depth in what is presented. They do not react favorably to this approach. They want the story to move quickly and clearly and easily become impatient and confused by this type of film. These factors undoubtedly contributed to the failure of the "Heaven's Gate" box office. <br /> <br /> By nature, a movie editor, I am deeply frustrated by two problems with this film. Here and there, a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been cut without damaging its effectiveness. Then we come to the massive battle scenes and pull at the end of the photo. Where these are concerned, the clarity of the narrative is indeed damaged. If you enjoyed the movie to the point where they occur, it is likely that your understanding of what should happen is becoming unclear and this is really a frustration. Not having seen all the raw footage, I can't say if new footage would have been needed or if some critical elements of the plot would have been made clearer by careful re-editing of some moments. Given the time and money that has been poured into this image, more attention should have been paid to this problem. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, some weak occasional action, some dialogue that doesn't sound true, but these are really minor concerns. The reason I am so troubled by the above problems is that, like on many other days, I too feel that in all the "Heaven's Gate" it is so splendid to look at and deals so magnificently with important historical, political issues and sociological that is little less than a masterpiece. Despite its shortcomings, it is so dramatically and visually powerful that it stands out for most of the other Hollywood movies I've ever seen. I'd like to re-mix a lot of the sound. I'd like to re-direct and re-edit the scene in which she is killed, but the magnitude of this image is such that these considerations become really trivial when compared to the value of the total production. I should add that it should always be seen on a big giant screen to get the glorious effect it is so capable of offering.
