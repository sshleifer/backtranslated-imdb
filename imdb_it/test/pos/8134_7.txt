This was the last silent film by Laurel and Hardy for Roach Studios. However, since the public had a real thirst for "talkies", the same short film was redone by the team a few years later with few small plot changes. RUIN GRAVY was essentially the same plot, except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a tender puppy from their grumpy landlord - not a goat like in ANGORA LOVE. The whole goat corner is the worst part of the film. While you can understand that kids want to keep a cute little dog (after all, it's snowing outside), because exactly they bring a goat home is just artificial and useless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home and so they got tired of chasing him away and holding him. Eh? This makes no sense - if it was a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same thing ?! Besides being an unconvincing storyline, the film itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for comedians. This film has some laughs, but unfortunately it is not one of their best films to end their silent careers. This aspect of their career seems to have ended in a groan.
