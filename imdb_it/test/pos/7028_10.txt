I first saw this movie with my girlfriend many years after it came out. I thought I would have hated it, but to my surprise it is so trivial that it is fantastic. We spent many hours recalling parts of the film ("Sylvia ?! Yes Mickey?" O "I'm sorry you had to see that child. Sometimes in this world we see things we don't want."). My finance cracks every time I imitate Neil. Even the music is classic and fun to sing together, especially during road trips. Of course, I don't admit any of this to my male friends. It's like a guilty pleasure. I look seriously at Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it's just as good every time. Jennifer Gray is also so cute in this movie. Too bad his career never took off.
