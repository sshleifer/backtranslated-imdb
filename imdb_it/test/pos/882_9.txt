Jewel Thief is a rare breed of film - completely noir in its history but nothing about presentation. A young Vinay, superbly played by a new face has lifted Dev Anand at the age of 40, is estranged by his police officer Dad and finds a job in a jeweler's shop. Soon random people will come to him and call him Amar. Using only a few concise moments establishes the presence of a "doppelganger". Then a Shalini woman (Vyjayantimala) comes forward and claims to be engaged to Doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar who makes him take off his shoe and proves that it is not Aamr, the 6 fingers. The super cute daughter of jeweler Anju (Tanuja) is completely in love with Vinay. In the midst of all this confusion there is a jewel thief in liberty and is stealing at will. Slowly we learn from the Vinay meeting with a super hot night club singer (Helen!) That the thief is Amar the doppelganger. Many good-looking women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) seek the hero. Police forces, including Vinay's father, are completely confused. Vinay is slowly falling for Shalini / Shalu and his brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim because that is where the next Amar robbery will take place. The rest is for you to look at - the duplicates, the girls, the men who cling to all of Vinay's words, thinking they are their leader Amar, the brother, a loving sister - nothing seems right, and you need the skillful story ( and direction) by Vijay Anand to conclude this story in a very funny way. The film has numerous moments that you will marvel at until they delightfully intertwine in a grand finale at a ball in a palace in Sikkim. <br /> <br /> I was not a big fan of Vyjayanthi but he is quite competent here, although at his most plump. He is able to add to the confusion in the story subtly, but it is better when he is sad or dancing. Tanuja is as cute as a button and I loved her in this movie. I wanted so much for her to take the man. Dev was, well, Dev. If he wasn't walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder lower and lower than the other) I wonder who they found to imitate him! Yet his style, his charm and his charisma were inevitable. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool bringing a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was simply fantastic - Dada Moni did not lose a beat of the entire film and turned it into one for the history books. <br /> <br /> SD Burman has done magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in imitation of the red blood of the rooster that dances on a bar above), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera and my seductive number preferred by Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a great story, with more pretzel twists, wanting to be guessed, but fun and amused - then go buy or rent Jewel Thief. Better to buy it, so you can go back and see it again with your friends. This is a keeper.
