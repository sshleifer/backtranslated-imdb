(Warning: may contain spoilers) Let Rosalina help Mario act as guide and smile because this game will light up your day. <br /> <br /> 120 stars will require luck and skill, but 60 will give you a thrill! <br /> <br /> Shining through the stars, show Mario and Luigi and what travelers are now! <br /> <br /> Walking upside down has never been more fun, especially a final battle with Koopa near the Sun! <br /> <br /> This is really a fantastic game and absolutely deserves a place in the Nintendo Hall of Fame!
