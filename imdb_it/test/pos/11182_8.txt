Another fantastic offer from the Monkey Island team and although it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of Ron Gilbert is another worthy episode. My only complaint is that it appeared a little short compared to the previous ones, although this could be due to a glorious lack of disk exchange. Throw on MI4.
