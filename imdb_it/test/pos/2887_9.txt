I admit that Alex has become a bit podgey, but I'm still (for me) the greatest rock trio ever. I highly recommend this DVD to all fans. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed that they canceled their recent concert in Munich (logistics) and regretted not having made an effort to see them elsewhere. DVD is a small consolation - the biggest incentive to get a proper DVD playback setup. <br /> <br /> Maybe Naive, but I still can't understand the meaning of tumble driers on stage; I would be grateful for any clarification. <br /> <br /> Hi, Iain.
