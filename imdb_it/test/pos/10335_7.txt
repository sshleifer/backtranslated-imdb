"Summer of My German Soldier" was one of many TV movies that became a key feature on the small screen in the 1970s (others were "Brian's Song", "Sybil" and "Someone's Watching Me!"). Describes a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) who befriends a German prisoner of war (Bruce Davison) in World War II Georgia. One of the things the film shows is that many of the German soldiers were not actually Nazis, but they were only sketched. Watching the film, I had a real sense of how things must have been in the South at the time; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? <br /> <br /> So, I certainly recommend this movie. I think it's always important to show the things portrayed here. Occasional hyperactivity prevents the film from being a large-scale masterpiece, but is usually quite good. I hope the film will end up on DVD. Also played by Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (the patriarch "My Big Fat Greek Wedding").
