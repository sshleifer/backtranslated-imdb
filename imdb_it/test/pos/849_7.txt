Earth Final Conflict started as a new world, a new vision of the creator of Star Trek, something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner like William Boone, a former good cop starts working as a guard for some sort of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons), after his wife's death in strange circumstances. But soon the character of Kilner joins a group with a mission to find out what the aliens' truth intentions are, because they seem so kind and attentive to the human race. Soon this resistance group will begin to discover the sinister plans of the Talons by using humans in their own problems to survive their own destruction. As I said before, the show started off great, everything was almost perfect, including characters like Da'an, the original Da'an was a great mystery because it seems to be a beautiful creature but at the same time it has its evil plans manipulating some people on earth. Soon Zo'or arrived who was not bad but ... marked the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first great enemy of humans, the embodiment of evil, killing what could have been something greater in Da'an . The first season ends beautifully with Boone's death and the second shows a new protagonist (Liam) a hybrid being of humans and Kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting powers. He replaces Kilner's character in a good way, so that other plots make him better, including the conflict with the jaridians and the atavus. But while I was saying the lines before Zo'or's wickedness began to take on more importance, the new conflicts were less realistic than the Talons themselves. Over time all the great plot of Liam's alien roots where almost completely erased the same with other things from previous seasons. So, when the final season began, the original Earth conflict on Earth was just an almost forgotten dream, all the magic was missing, just to leave some vain intention to keep the show alive including the return of Kilner and Liam for some episodes. The final episode was just the evidence of how bad the show was with so many bad changes (to think that the authors of some episodes didn't know anything about the first stories), it was one of the worst end I've ever seen in a film TV program. A pity because Earth Final Conflict started as something unique, fresh, the stories of the cast, after seeing so many shows from the United States, something from Canada from the mind of the creator of Star trek was wonderful but in the end everything changes to worse. I hope that one day someone does a remake of this show, obviously not using anything from the fourth season and the fifth (except the cast, everyone was perfect in his work). I can still dream of better things.
