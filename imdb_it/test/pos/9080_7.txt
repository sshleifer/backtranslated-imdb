Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. More often than not, the movies you loved as a child will disappoint you as an adult. Although there are exceptions to this rule, it is difficult to justify the possession of a Krull DVD, regardless of the number of insightful comments made by the director. But watch out for Gen X / Y'ers, because the dozens of disappointments that dominate your journey along the memory, could keep you from tripping over a retelling. <br /> <br /> A surprise film worthy of another look is the Flatliner by Joel Schumacher, the supernatural thriller starring the heavyweights of the 80s Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. One might think that a stew made by this cast, Schumacher's witty inspiration and the wetter eye of cinematographer Jan De Bont would result in something disgustingly heavy, but calories aside ... Flatliners is not bad bad. Although the design of the production is inexplicably exaggerated and the photograph is painfully over-stylized (full of neon-soaked streets that emit endless streams of steam), Flatliner still manages to be an effective and obscure thriller. If there is an explanation for why Flatliners has been forgotten, it could be because the 1990s saw the release of another supernatural thriller far superior: Jacob's Ladder. <br /> <br /> Had Flatliners was released a year or two after Jacob's Ladder, it's probably Schumacher's flashy thriller would have been dismissed as a dramatized and commercialized Adrian Lyne's nightmare masterpiece. But with these films released in the same year, Flatliners had a different fate, tripling JL at the box office despite being a watered-down version of a similar premise. The passage of time has not been so kind to the Flatliner, it was lost on top of a dated Brod Pack 80s, while JL cemented its reputation as a timeless classic. Apart from the facets, JL is perfectly terrifying and manages to keep the public guessed until the last frame, while Flatliners is the victim of an excessive simplification and Hollywood comfort that drag the final act in a predictable epilogue. The comparison between the two films is unfair, and ultimately neglects Flatliner's ability to represent the 80s at its best par excellence. Released at the end of a decade of superficial excess, Flatliners will always be dated with its hairstyles and clothing styles, but in all honesty, it should also be remembered as a well-executed film at (or at least close to) the top of its particular pile of dreck. For intent and purpose, it's a fun walk in the memory.
