Joline (Heather Graham) leaves after her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) who disappeared to clear his head of himself and their marriage. Joline, who is engaged in their marriage, begins her journey to find Carl, but on the way she finds out a lot about herself. During her journey she meets a lot of interesting characters who unknowingly help her find her way. <br /> <br /> In my eyes this is a classic road movie, which moves at just the right pace (some viewers might find it slow too). During the film she keeps her humorous note while Joline responds to the madness of the world that surrounds her with a warm, conscious, sometimes sad smile. All the actresses and actors give wonderful shows and the soundtrack is immaculate. 9/10
