I remember this movie fondly from seeing it in the theater. I recently found a copy on VHS and kept the memory of it. Although obviously not a big-budget film, acting is quite credible and the scenery, the premises and the costumes are very well done. I only hope that the Mammoths have been more than the photo, but when you see them, they are also well made (remember, SFX was made in those days without the benefit of computers, a poor devil actually had to put all that fake hair and fang on real elephants!) ... the same effect was used on elephants in "Quest for Fire". A better than average adventure film and a chance for the star, Rod Cameron, to play something besides a cowboy, which he also did very well over the years.
