This is the classic case of an excellent film that is watched by the American public simply because it didn't have Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger as the protagonist: Adrian Quinn performs a better double performance, just as you heard it twice in this film compared to those who have ever made a career! Well anyway, now to the review ... <br /> <br /> The Assignment is freely based on the story of Carlos the Jackal, a radical of the 70s who terrorized Europe for years before being arrested by French agents . In this adaptation, a US Navy officer (Adrian Quinn) is on leave in Israel when he is arrested by the Mossad (the Isreal intelligence / counter-terrorism agency) and considered due to the fact that it seems EXACTLY like the jackal (this is the extremely delicate part of the film, but believe me it does not detract from the great value of this film). When discovered, Mr. Ramirez is not the Jackal, however, he is recruited by a CIA agent hardened by the name of Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, who does his usual mysterious brigade figure of government authority, but wonderfully) who he spent his life chasing the Jackal, and the series of events that will follow will fascinate anyone watching this movie - it's chock full of great acting, without all the usual clicks of action movies and jokes and a fantastic plot that will surprise anyone. The three main men - Quinn, Sutherland and Kingsley - carry this film much further than his modest budget would have let anyone else fill his shoes. Compliments for the director and his staff, camera angles and cinematography are also top notch, especially in action scenes. The Assignment is better than anyone could ever expect to rent it, it's a shame that the movie went badly at the box office, otherwise we could see a sequel to this stupendous espionage thriller. <br /> <br /> 9/10 stars, this reviewer LO strongly advises all potential viewers!
