I love this movie. It has a very real feeling. I believe it has never been popular because of the matter, however, due to the matter, it makes the film much more important. <br /> <br /> This is an "A" movie and I highly recommend it. If you liked the "1984" book or movie, I think you'll like it too. <br /> <br /> This is hard, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some rather vile. Not for the week at heart or stomach. No gore, but his film is so beautiful in projecting the mental anticipation that it does not need blood and guts. <br /> <br /> If you're not a realist or a pest-like person, I don't think you'll like it. It leaves you with a feeling of unease about humans, about what they are capable of and the real possibility that our government (s) does not necessarily have our personal interest in its heart.
