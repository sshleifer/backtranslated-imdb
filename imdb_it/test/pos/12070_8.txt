This is not a BIG film as if the cast (especially children) admirably helps to carry on this very sad but invented plot, full of cliché about clichés. Poor family in the 1950s in Central America, a dying mother, an alcoholic father, 10 children (1 of whom has epilepsy) and a terrible decision to make. It's very easy to watch and some of the children's shows are moving without being sick or cheeky. And little Frank and Warrnen steal my show with the last scene, letting me scream, no matter how many times I see it. A great rainy afternoon movie that I recommend to everyone. Only those with the most difficult hearts may not be touched by this. Not like Sophies Choice, but a good television equivalent !!!
