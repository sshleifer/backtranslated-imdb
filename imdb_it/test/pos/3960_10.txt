Let me clarify it. This is not a "good movie", but I'm so glad it's out there, I'm so happy to have seen it, and for the role it plays in my DVD collection, it's sublime. It is the last PG-13 game, it is university as we imagine it will be when we are freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that could even happen on Mars. It's so healthy that even when you're trying to be dirty, it won't make your grandmother feel uncomfortable. Watching it requires so little sophistication, (in fact, thinking too much about what's going on will hinder your appreciation for this job), it makes me feel like I'm 12 years old. And that kind of experience is worth more than $ 9.99.
