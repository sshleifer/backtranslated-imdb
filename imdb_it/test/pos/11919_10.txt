Not only does this film have a great title, but it's simply the greatest drama I've ever seen. The viewer is hopelessly drawn to the film that involves 5 young people working together to try to overcome the insurmountable probabilities, Sean Astin while Billy Tepper is brilliant along with great supporting roles of TERussell, Wil Wheaton and Shawn Phelan, the guide and guide Gosset and the characters of Astins make the film much better. Over time, the film continues to gain momentum and it is a disappointment that none of the young actors made a name for themselves in the film industry after this wonderful film.
