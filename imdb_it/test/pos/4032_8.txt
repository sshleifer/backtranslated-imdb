For all those people who believe that dialogue is worth something and appreciate a farce clever enough to take it seriously, this film will surprise you. It is not a "lung" for people who may not be able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). <br /> <br /> Cornell teaches in southern California, near the tar pits. He hasn't published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a little too much and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students. He recommended a friend for advancement and a brilliant young student presented him with a manuscript as an independent project. Cornell doesn't even want to read it, so he gives it an "A" and pushes it to the side. Leaning back with a drink in his office, he looks out the window when the bright young student falls from the window onto the street to meet the sidewalk in a bolt clash. <br /> <br /> Hal comes to talk, and they chat, drinking a little more. Cornell realizes he has to read the manuscript now. When he returns home, his wife is waiting with divorce papers. He drinks a little more. He leaves, and goes to a faculty affair, only to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife finds out that the student died, she faints and discovers that he had had an affair with the student. This obviously leads him to drink something more serious. The next morning he wakes up to find himself in the dorm room of one of his students, a freshman named Syd (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> He feels worse than a hangover, he goes to the doctor and learns that he has been poisoned, is irreversible and has 24-48 hours of life. He doesn't have much time to find out who killed him, and there are sub-plots, motifs, reports, and surprises at every corner, even if it finally makes sense. All his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm, dry wit and acute observations. Let's just say that this film will give new meaning to the saying "publish or die". <br /> <br /> There are no bad performances in this film. There are recurring images and symbolism used at accurate intervals. Look at the broken glass and the distorted images through the glass. Some of the shots are revolutionary for 1988, and some of the violent actions are carefully and skillfully choreographed. The music is discreet and appropriate, even if it occasionally makes its own statement, in the lyrics of the songs. The images in this film are impressive. <br /> <br /> If there are any failures, it is that the opening 20 minutes move a little slower, and almost put you to sleep. But the pace increases rapidly, with the right amount of exposure between the action segments. <br /> <br /> There are no explicit sexual encounters, even if there is violence and bad language. <br /> <br /> This is a writer's film, and is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure. I think if you take it seriously, you're already in trouble.
