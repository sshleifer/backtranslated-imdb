First of all I want to say that most people who give a negative review don't like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and you're not afraid to laugh at some stupid stuff. > <br /> This film is shot just like the TV show with a lot of short clips collected in a long movie. Some scenes don't even have a dialogue, someone will come out and do something unexpected and it's fun !! The only negative thing I had was that I felt like I had wasted money on my Popcorn and Icee, there was no way to eat or drink something during this movie that I was constantly laughing. I was honestly nervous about drinking some Icee and seeing something that made me laugh and shoot everywhere. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind a bit of male nudity, and you enjoy the movie Jackass, taste the TV show, and live the bam, then go to YOUR film to see this movie. <br /> <br /> And if you don't like the first movie, or the TV program. Don't see it, and if you see it, don't post a negative review about it. Stubborn Christians who see this and hit it don't seem right.
