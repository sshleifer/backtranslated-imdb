I love this show. It's really unique. I had the impression that he would have had more seasons. In anticipation of the 2 series, I recently purchased the 1 series to look at it again to be updated when the second part began. Now, after seeing it, I was excited and wanted more, so I came to the site to see the continuation program. I'm really disappointed to see that there are no more plans for a second series, because I couldn't wait to see more of this story. I think they really dropped the ball on this one. There were lots of plots to build and many unanswered questions. Now I am a very unhappy vision and I hope they reconsider their decision and take up the story from where it was interrupted.
