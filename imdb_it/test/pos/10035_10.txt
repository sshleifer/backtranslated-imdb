The film is excellent. One of the most noteworthy things is that Flynn's performance is superb. It is worth emphasizing, as he was often derided as an actor by Bette Davis and others. <br /> <br /> I remember the scene where Flynn gets Arthur Kennedy drunk to bring him to his fate in the battle of the Little Big Horn. The cold, calculating look on Flynn's face is extraordinary - much better than the much vaunted Spencer Tracy or many other stars could have done. <br /> <br /> The other thing to note is the excellent interpretation of George P. Huntley Jr as "Queen's Own" butler. It is puzzling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards - it would have been thought that he would be created for years as a leading actor.
