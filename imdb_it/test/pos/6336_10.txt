This episode of Buffy was one of my personal favorites. Also the number three of Joss's personal favorites. The episode showed very few dialogues and despite this the good guys of the Emmy decided they deserved a nomination. Unfortunately he didn't win. When Hush made his debut for the first time, he received about 6 million viewers, which was the most voted episode of the fourth season. This should tell you something. Although there has been little talk, he has managed to intrigue people enough to tune in. Those gentlemen characters (who played my mimes) were some of the scariest creatures the show produced (or any network TV program I've ever seen). Nothing is more disturbing than a group of men with silver teeth who come at you with a scalpel while they smile. I think that despite the lack of dialogues the actors did a fantastic job in the episode.
