An interesting film and involved in a "Lifer" who tries to live his days in peace. Elements of the main character appear in Michael Mann's subsequent films, such as Thief (1981), Heat (1995) and so on. You can see it at the UCLA Educational Media Laboratory, one of the few places in the country that has copies readily available to the public. Is fantastic!
