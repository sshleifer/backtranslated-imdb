I love this movie. I just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch my birthday. This film raises several questions. One is. Who are the monsters of this world? Being different is just that. Different. The real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness. They are the ones that everyone considers "a nice quiet boy" who "didn't bother anyone". Or they are worse than characters like those played by Croneberg. Men who derive pleasure and power from sculpting people and creating their books of blood. I love shapeshifters, people with gifts and those who can be abject to people to look at. This film touches and explores what is normal. Who are "other" and what fear does to some. Even if I gave this movie 10, I'm still sick of screaming women or being so set up that they can't see what's going on and being a vehicle for things that destroyed Median. My other complaint was because they never made a second film. I for one would have liked to see a continuation of this more intriguing story that keeps me fascinated from start to finish
