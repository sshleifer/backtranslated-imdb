What an excellent film, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I came across so casually, sailing on a beautiful icy day in northern Texas. Kathy Bates is her usual best protagonist in a cast of very normal and human costar characters through one of the most wonderful wellness films we've ever seen. Because this film was not given the attention it deserved in its release in 2002 it is difficult to understand. Because it was the head and the shoulders on so many of the boring pieces of garbage released with greater fanfare and the attention is evident in the vision. It is obvious that we as a public in general are forcefully fed by what has been considered "great and wonderful" by the powerful and influential while real gems like "Unconditional Love" manage to shine through all those pretenders to a really nice cinema. Rent or buy this movie ..... you won't regret it!
