Roy Andersson managed to create something that defies almost all the conventions on what a film should be, a work of art that is both beautiful, fun and evocative. The end result is a moving story, even if fragmented, of humanity in its simplest and most honest forms. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely that everyone will like it, in fact the humor is so tuned that many are unlikely to get to its wavelength. The almost absurdly long takes, the embarrassing silences and the coherent medium shots definitely postpone even the most willing of the public. But it is within these disconnected stories and unconventional thinking that Andersson models a world in which each character seems to be at the center of his own absurd way. Each scene is absorbed by the desolate environments, with the characters apparently left alone in their strangeness. It's a difficult piece to look at times, not least because, like many of its scenes, it requires patience. But while some may greet him on an artistic throne, others simply look in confusion. It is a film that blends sober humor with its own brand of heart
