This was an interesting film. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! In addition to this, I loved the stunning music in which this film was shot. Chris / Izzy's parents are fantastic! They totally support their children's interests and believe in him enough to support him - now that it's FANTASTIC !! What really surprised me was Chris's accomplishment at the end. It was not really the "hollywood" ending on his way to self-discovery. The general ascent towards celebrity and its fall was rather a roller coaster ride.
