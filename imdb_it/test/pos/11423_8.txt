Stan as a bullfighter and a good one is quite a surprise. Usually obscured by Oliver Hardy, this silent short allows him to take the lead, and the limelight. <br /> <br /> It can only be concluded that his character "Rabarbar Vaselino" was a parody of Rudolph Valentino's many films of this era. <br /> <br /> Get ready to laugh at yourself in a stupid way at some of the dialogues, and keep an eye on the special effects. <br /> <br /> I saw this on DVD in a Vol. Collection 1 & 2.
