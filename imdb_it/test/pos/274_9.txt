The Stepford Children is Stepford's second best film in the Stepford series. I saw the original The Stepford Wives in the theater when it came out in 1975. I was absolutely shocked, it was great. I've seen all of Stepford's films, and I like them all. I think The Stepford Children is a catchy and fun movie. I saw it recently on tape and enjoyed it immensely. The cast of this film was really cool to watch. Barbara Eden did a hard job as usual. Every role she has ever played was very beautiful. Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles in which she is a kind and generous person. Don Murray as her husband and father was just perfect. in this movie. He was particularly effective in being the irritated father of his two teenage sons. I made sure to have all of Stepford's film on tape for fun. If you have the chance to see this movie you should.
