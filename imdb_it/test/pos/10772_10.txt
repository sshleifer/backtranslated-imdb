When it comes to movies, I don't easily discriminate between shit, pure shit and masterpieces. I believe this film is an absolute masterpiece and it is difficult to entertain for more than 90 minutes. This movie had SLOWER rather than Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 put together and I still managed to stay nailed to my place. For me, it was the passion that Eric Bogosian put into his performance. It is extremely difficult to get such a stunt and be able to get a positive effect. Bogosian probably nailed one of the toughest performances of a single man in modern cinema. I had no respect for Bogosian until the end of the film. The whole monologue, a few minutes before the inexorable climax, was the turning point, it was the key that made me turn. This man hit such a low point that he knew he could never recover. The company guys congratulated him on the performance. His formidable prose shook his head in awe, even the leanest of the ride. It made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy do not count in the world of spoken radio, even in the corporate world for that matter. Stone may have pushed some super-liberal program, but it was the film and the production that caught my eye. Oliver Stone is a minor master of the lunatic. The last third of the film probably had the best lighting and cinematography I saw in each film. The stone artistically renders the DJ booth like a five-for-seven cell in a nineteenth-century prison. Visually speaking, it seems that Bogosian's only friend is the black foam that absorbs his routine vitriol. Speak and do not respond. It's a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who gave him his success. Stone and Bogosian have carved a splendid film of a man trapped in a prison of walls and in a prison of himself. This man is limited to his will and can never escape from him. The scene that made me understand his riddle was when he wasn't willing to go back to his ex-wife. He preferred his prison instead of the outside world. Every story has a conflict and has arrived at the simplest of conflicts: the man against himself. 'Talk Radio' presents this conflict intelligently, compellingly and skillfully. There are no hidden messages in this film and the progression of events should be provided by any astute observer. I simply leaned back and let my mind be caught by this movie and I loved it. It is unannounced, unseen and will never receive due recognition. We hope it stays that way because the gems deserve to be found and then hidden again. It's a gem because I found it in the discount basket in my local Wal-Mart store. For $ 5.50, it was worth the half hour of digging trying to find it. I did and I got more than my money's worth. This is one of the best films ever made and is worth ten reasons. Ten reasons give a score of ten. <br /> <br /> My rant ends here!
