I consider myself a big fan of horror movies. One night I just wanted to rent some new horror movies to make fun of. Then, I rented Milo. I was so surprised by this movie. It scared the hell out of me. It's not something I can say very often. Usually Halloween alone scares me. <br /> <br /> Two other friends watched him with me and were left with a disturbed feeling. A nice feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. If you are not interested, then what is the point. <br /> <br /> This film was original. He did not follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. That's why movies like Valentine have bombed for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, many remained with unanswered questions, like many horror films do. It's worth the rent though.
