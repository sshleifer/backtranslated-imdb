Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir play "And One Was Beautiful", a 1940 film with Billie Burke. At an hour and 15 minutes, it seems to have been a movie B. Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, which many women desire, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is the most earthly of the two who likes to set up cars, and Helen is the blonde social butterfly with beautiful clothes. Ridley returns to the city and, believing she is not at a party, Helen decides not to participate. Since the party is entrusted to a family friend, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a stiff dress. Ridley is there, and the two connect. But Ridley is more superficial, and when he sees Helen at a dinner, the two pick up where they left off and go to a club. He gets terribly drunk, and Helen initially refuses to drive because she doesn't let her drive. After walking a little and breaking the heel of the shoe, he enters Ridley's car as he passes. He faints and she picks up the steering wheel, casually hitting and killing a cyclist. <br /> <br /> Ridley remembers nothing, so Helen blames him for death. The heel of a woman's shoe is in the car, and Katherine sees her sister burying her shoes - plus, something in the way of Helen makes her realize that Helen isn't telling the truth. Ridley is sentenced and goes to prison, and Helen marries a man who does not love and leaves for South America. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film, even though at the time it wasn't an A-list cast. Cummings plays a part that Robert Taylor would have played (it's an MGM film) - he is handsome and very lovable, although he doesn't have the dazzling look of someone like Taylor. Laraine Day is my favorite actress, someone MGM lent constantly because she didn't know what to do with her. Because, I wonder - a wonderful actress with a big face and a voice, has revived many films. This is no different. His Katherine is determined, understanding and totally adorable. Jean Muir is a very bad actress. <br /> <br /> So who was the beauty? We all know even if MGM has not done so. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended small jewel.
