Is it along the line of the comedy of errors, of the wrong affection that is transferred from one to the other, blooms and passes over a kind of cat and mouse situation ?? Flare of passion, fanned sparks of fire and put off guessing maybe she loves, loves or they love ?? Circle of emotions, evolving, releasing ?? hiding, but not hiding ?? Wanting to let him know, wanting to let her know, let him know? A good choral cast despite the apparently confused mix of emotions of the different parties involved. <br /> <br /> It is a refreshing, casual, free and easy and rather realistic spellcaster, not Hollywood glamor like "Notting Hill", but a lot of human feelings, fragility, flow vulnerability. Yes, everything revolves around a love letter found by chance (lost and found). Kate Capshaw is the owner of the library of the city, with a variety of characters played by Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stuart, Alice Drummond and Geraldine McEwan as the seemingly senseless Mrs. Scattergoods. Romance is in the air, love lurking everywhere. You will appreciate the talented Kate Capshaw. ("The Alarmist" is another quirky little movie that is fun to watch: Capshaw has a wonderful chemistry with David Arquette, and Arquette with Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> "Notting Hill" is satisfying in its revolving story around the sparkling combination of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, and the wonderful support of her circle of friends from (London). "Love Letters" is delightful in its eccentric (Loblolly) town, and its story involves the centrifugal rippling effects of Kate Capshaw on her friends and neighbors. Both fantasies perhaps, somehow, the latter seemed more reachable if it were to happen to you. And if you appreciate words or poetic lines, it could be the movie for you.
