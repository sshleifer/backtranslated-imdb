This film is a joy to watch and should do well on DVDs and videos. I imagine you have to be Irish to appreciate some of the subtitles like the accent, the colloquial expressions and the sense of the dress of some characters, but I assure you that when Dylan Moran plays "Barreler" the imitation is quite familiar to most people from Dublin because we have many characters in our beautiful city who watch, act and speak like that! The simple comedy employed and the genius of Michael Caines acting alone are worth the money, but what's more, the plot is fantastic, the script is fantastic and the dialogue is quick and engaging. A perfect light entertainment movie without the crazy humor of Jim Carrey.
