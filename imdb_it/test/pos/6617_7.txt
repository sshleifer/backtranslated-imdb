Let me first say that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before realizing that I was totally uncoordinated. I always thought it was nice to watch cats that know how to be extreme when they do their thing, but I've never been a skateboarder and I've never really followed the sport. That said, I thought it was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some reviewers have said that these guys were waving their flag a little, but what the hell? It seems to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for shaking up the skateboarding world and have provided some good shots of their innovations to support it. It's fantastic the way viewers can see these guys both then and now and the footage they shot while they were growing up in California offers some interesting nostalgia that goes a bit beyond the sport of skating. I would never have realized where extreme skating came from, but this type of film links all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary. I'm sure it's at least a little biased, but isn't everyone documentary? It is worth looking for anyone interested in sport or, as in my case, anyone who grew up in the 1970s.
