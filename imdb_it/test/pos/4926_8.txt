I love this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = Which is rather difficult to do. This film is one of the best adaptations of cartoons ever. It doesn't distort characters like other movies out there. Everyone has a character and they have a role to play! <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Busters and Babs coming down the river after a flood (courtesy of Buster), to Plucky making a trip with Hamton (hilarious), Elmyra wanders around torturing animals (as usual), Fifi follows his crush on an autograph, and Shirley and Fowlmouth go to the movies. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I didn't like the Buster and Babs scored a lot, even though they had some noteworthy dialogues and jokes. I must say that the parts of Plucky and Hampton "Vacation" were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIOUS! I especially like Uncle Stinky. Fifi in the hotel was also hilarious. I love the actor's cameos during this scene. : D <br /> <br /> Probably the most famous part of this film, still IMHO, is when Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the cinema ... LOL! You have to see it to appreciate it! And when Hamton and Plucky pass through the tunnel to make a wish ... :) <br /> <br /> Even if this movie moved slowly during the Buster / Babs parts, the rest is pure gold! I consider this film 8/10. Show this to your children one day ... or even to adults - WATCH THIS FILM! You will not regret.
