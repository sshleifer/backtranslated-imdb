The script of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and even if they click on each other. Matt is rather unlikely: aloof, braggart, apparently lazy and misogynistic. He was seriously injured by his dysfunctional mother and this makes him a little easier to take. I think I liked the details of his dysfunction - it was credible. Over-reward bragging about nailing Amy. He acts so well for Amy that he hits him twice. When they talk, he can't show her who she really is. She identifies herself and then sculpts it at the right moments. She looks so mature and strong that her features that come out later don't seem to fit. (For me.) I found it incredibly sexy and pretty. . . Pretty girl next door, I call her. So I would have liked this movie unless it was really ruined. <br /> <br /> Funny things happen with the coach, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. The football scenes were finally perplexed. Matt does not carry the ball, but it seems to be an obstacle. Folks, it's not the right size! He's fifty pounds too light for that position. But I thought his acting was clever. I measure it by the way I wanted to twist his neck a couple of times during his scenes with Meredith Monroe. The film was all right. Meredith M was better than all right.
