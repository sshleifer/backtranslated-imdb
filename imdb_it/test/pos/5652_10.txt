The main result of this film is that, although racially unipolar, the film still manages to carve out a picture of war representations that leave a lasting identification with anyone who can see it and whoever was present at that time. Although good films can have the ability to universalize their subjects, which is often a difficult thing to do; the great films have the ability to universalize their unipolar subjects, which is what this film does. <br /> <br /> Instead of carving out a context of unity, the film describes the Japanese in the diseased final of the Phillipines war front in February 1945, making signs for pacifism or war, but rather by making signs of feelings, death, destruction, victory and war sickness with the bloody hands of the defeated. For different, and superior, films like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, both of which needed a satirical methodology of banalization and depersonalization of American companies, and of using all races as a struggle, which is fine, but not as grandiose as a film that uses a race and a vision, which would appear fascist if created in America, to convey the horror of war and show what it really is. <br /> <br /> The only way in which the main character manages to overcome this film to the end is to be sick, consequently inedible; then through this character, through his illness, his saving face, we see the end of the second world war in the Philippines in February 1945, and the way in which the Americans, the Japanese and the Phillipinians came together in bloody acts of war in where you live to die. <br /> <br /> The film is clearly influenced by a neo-realist way of filmic representation, which is original and beneficial for a spectator, both then and now, for the neorealist techniques it employs transmits all the horrors of war in the images form, a showcase for pacifism or "militaristic responsibility". Like Germany Anno Zero, by Roberto Rossellini, a story emerges from the environment and the conditions associated with it. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film, with the two-way discussion between the two Japanese soldiers, prefigures and rereads the events. Through this opening we feel that the struggle is human against human and human with human; shows that they relied on each other to face the enemy in past battles, but now, in this opening, or "pivot" of the Japanese's experiences in the Philippines, new information is transmitted to the main character Tamura, giving a presentiment of a cannibal addiction on each other if they wish to survive. <br /> <br /> The jungle is gritty, moist and thick, and the sky is not very cloudy and cast. Ford with latecomers, despite puddles and swamps, sick as the land around them. Nameless corpses are scattered everywhere. Once in a while you can't tell if they are bodies, rocks or corn. Apparently there is no difference here, everything is dead and sick. Everything is dying. All they need to feed on are rare monkeys and corpses of fallen comrades and / or unnamed enemies. <br /> <br /> Often Tamura meets another fallen close to death. Although crushed in spirit, and crushing his own, some offer their bodies for him to eat, but he refuses; still, like Hiroshi Kawaguchi in the role of Nishi in Giants and Toys, he will not let himself fall into the death of Japanese dignity and morality; this is why it is all that it must really support for its survival, a dignity of self. So when Nagamatsu is analyzing a soldier for consumption, he shoots him because of him. Tamura can be used to kill, but due to the disease of killing and looting it cannot decipher. He is neither a good man nor a bad man. He wants to survive, but he will only go beyond the simple murder of war. His self belonged dead on the battlefield, he is not happy here to wade and wipe out the weak for his survival. <br /> <br /> The sickness you see everywhere, in all; and sadly he lacks the ethical logic of thinking or thinking entirely of others, since he cannot give up his body for them because of his contagious disease, or think entirely of himself, since he sees the disease in everyone, even if it continues to kill them even if they do no harm. Seen in his attack on the two Philippians in the hut. He can't see anyone. No one can see anyone. The only ones see an aversion from illness and an aversion to health, the heart of survival instincts. Often an arm appears to the left of the screen, towards what must be hope, because there, in so far Thule is their freedom. Yet it is blocked by American soldiers, leaving Japanese laggards to die slowly in this disconsolate filth. A church tower also appears, reflecting the light of an invisible sun. But on closer inspection the ravens flutter wildly about it; even religion is a poisonous air. <br /> <br /> Nobi, the Japanese title of the film, gives more evidence on the themes or feelings of the film: the slavery of destiny, the heaviness of existence under the leaders and lives controlled by others. His correct English-speaking translation is the subject of a heavy debate among historians, since the non-Koreans translate it as "slave" and "slavery", while many Koreans claim that nobi was not a slave system, but a servant class system that does not meets the criteria for slavery. A way to escape the excruciating poverty. This improves the theme of war and the symbolism of the soldier. <br /> <br /> Isn't it important in the period in which we ask ourselves what is the purpose of what will become our conquered history? Should we feel comfortable letting it unwind without a conscious effort for change? It is not what we are fighting, the question of old age history, but rather why are we fighting? Fires on the Plain is with Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa and Mickey Curtis; based on a novel by Shohei Ooka. In Japanese with subtitles.
