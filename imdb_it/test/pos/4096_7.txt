This version of "The Lost Horizon" is not a bad movie at all. I think the problem is that people like to choose musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film in its original version in 1973 (I was ten) and I really enjoyed it, especially the music. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good and technically it's excellent. Of course, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win them all. I have this movie on video and I watch it every now and then ... and I enjoy it every time!
