Motorama viewers should already be interested in other desert b-grade films, such as the Bagdad Cafe or the Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also simulates the bizarre humor (and in particular the trail of eccentric characters) of the comedy of the writer Joseph Minion, "After Hours". In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor for temptation and redemption, Gus (well played by Jordan Christopher Michael), a 10-year-old boy collects in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang and runs away from his parents who seriously neglect. It starts as a journey through salvation (which is evident in the scenes with John Diehl), but once it hooks into a scratch-off game called Motorama, it becomes easily tainted with temptation and loses its childish innocence. Travel from an imaginary state crazy to another way of inventing the Motorama cards from the participating service stations, just enough to be able to pronounce the winning word MOTORAMA and be entitled to the cash prize of $ 500 million. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he is tormented by dozens of strange characters such as Flea who plays a fighting game, Meatloaf who plays a crazy cyclist, and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron (a Seinfeld regular) as two violent kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The r√©elease of the DVD can be very misleading, as well as previous attempts to sell this film to the non-cult market first with slogans that compare it to Home Alone and Thelma & Louise. The most recent one calls it a love story with the slogan that implies that the film is about Jordan Michael Christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams ... who, despite the size of his picture on the DVD cover, it's actually just a 1 second Drew Barrymore cameo as the fantasy girl Gus dreams of. Why didn't they just market it for what it was? Thought that it may seem totally bizarre to the first vision, it is actually a well-designed narrative. <br /> <br /> Motorama is an exceptional material for fans of strange B-level comedies. This was a pretty interesting story, and in particular due to the strength of its lead actor - Jordan Michael Christopher (who unfortunately has few other major film titles) - and the clever metaphor inherent to the plot. We hope his DVD reprint will make it easier for cult fans.
