This is a surprising film: a romantic thriller with a twisted plot but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical, brilliantly supported by the use of recurring visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully filmed: the women, the apartments; but more surprising is the devastating juxtaposition of the images, almost every scene has the echo of another. This is a story told in light, in color, in many quasi-parallels. Every time I look at it, it fills me with joy. <br /> <br /> Even the acting is fantastic. Romane Bohringer is as gorgeous as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything about her changes with her mood. Vincent Cassel has a very different role in his part at La Haine; but no less excellently: elusive and understanding at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - ah, Monica Bellucci, well, in a nutshell, she interprets (is it?) The most perfect woman in the world. There is a small scene about three quarters away where she does nothing but smile; yet in that instant, he says more than hours of junk in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> We cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle in turn. But if a moment captures the splendor of this work, it is the scene at the beginning of this fabulous epilogue, whose perspective has been presented to us jokingly throughout history. And yet, when the time comes, it is handled so delicately, so briefly, so cleverly, that in case of reflection it makes you jump. Only a director of bewildering confidence would have the courage to underestimate this vital point. But trust is justified. The cinema does not come much better than this.
