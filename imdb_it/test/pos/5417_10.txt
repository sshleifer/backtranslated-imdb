This short film was nominated for an Academy Award, losing to Anna and Bella. Not since Dr. Strangelove made nuclear war so much fun! Condie takes a situation and turns it to her ear and then turns it around for good measure. Visual gags abound in Condie's work and I always see something I missed before I looked at it. On the biggest animation in the world, it's worth seeing for this and many other short films. Recommended.
