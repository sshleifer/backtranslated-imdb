It has the developments of drama, suspense and character that you would like if you liked the drama that involves you and amuses and educates. <br /> <br /> Writers know their material and show it. Direction is always engaging and not blas√©, and terrific acting. Because this show has not won any awards it tells me that the "powers that be" in Hollyweird do not know the drama or anything for that matter. <br /> <br /> There is a twist in this episode at the end it was a complete surprise and it was very well played. I'm glad it wasn't used as a shock scene for any climatic purpose in this series that would have been more typical and boring. Rent this series at once! We hope that it will be traced back to the extinction of celluloid.
