After sleeping out of pure solitude, Lestat wakes up from a 100-year sleep to the sound of new music he wants to be a part of and the band "The Vampire Lestat" was born. His desire to end his loneliness and his attitude of "living in the light" along with his music, the anger of his fellow vampires and awakening an evil that has been dormant for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> This film is not for those looking for a true adaptation from book to film. Those who have read the books and expect to see it on the screen are in great disappointment. This film will appeal to those who really enjoyed the film "Interview With the Vampire". <br /> <br /> There are some holes in the plot and inconsistencies, but overall this film was satisfying. Stuart Townsend plays Lestat with a sensuality and sensuality that is missing in the previous film. The reports portrayed in the film were very sexy and sparkling. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, the story forces you and attracts you. The casting is wonderful. I love this story and this movie. If you like latent sensuality and sexual tension, you will love this movie!
