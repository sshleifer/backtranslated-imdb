I loved this movie for a long time. I hadn't seen it for a while, so I checked again and actually found it even more enjoyable now. I loved the Chipmunks cartoon when I was young, so of course I loved "The Chipmunk Adventure". <br /> <br /> I honestly can't think of a better storyline for this movie. It's not wildly creative, but I've always wanted to travel around the world, and so I enjoy watching it so much while my desire to travel grows even more. The part with Elenore singing the little penguin always makes me cry ... <br /> <br /> "The Chipmunk Adventure" will always remain my favorite, I'm sure. I guess it's because I saw it when I was so young. I don't think it would have a big enough impact for someone seeing it for the first time. (Unless, of course, they have a young heart)
