You know you are looking softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm fine with lip lip synchronization, but the sound mix is ​​just too much. Every time someone says something, there seems to be a narrator. In any case, this is practically the purgatory between the boring French professionalism and the heavenly film of Joe D'Amato that involves cannibalism and so on. Don't get me wrong, there's a good deal of exploitation in this, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser is a star, and that's okay because she's sexy. It's a bit strange how sometimes you can see its bone structure, but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can even make a nice drinking game than you often take your kit. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good Every place is good A scene also involves an entire hockey team, whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way, and the supporting cast is made up of vile-looking people, but there's enough Laura Gemser for everyone.
