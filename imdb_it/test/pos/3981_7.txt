I don't think I've ever seen a movie all my life about a high school kid who started his own college, just to impress his parents. Nowadays, movies are either remakes or sequels or storylines that have been used in many different movies. This has an original plot and to follow it turning it into a comedy movie only lighten the deal. With this story well thought out and mixed with laughter, this is a good movie. Now I've seen better, but on entering the theater I was thinking of another drug / beer / frat party with some sexual allusions thrown in (aka an "American Pie" movie) but I was surprised. To sum up, I liked the movie and the next time you browse through the film sheet, look for the show times on "Accepted". If you want to laugh out loud, that's it.
