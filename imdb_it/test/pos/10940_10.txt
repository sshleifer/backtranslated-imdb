The twins effect is a martial arts film about vampires available in Cantonese with English subtitles. It's a Jackie Chan production and makes a special guest appearance, even if it's not for those who liked Shanghai Noon / Knights and other recent Hollywood movies that made it famous, this movie is much more special than that . br /> <br /> Originally called The Vampire Effect, but as a popular Chinese female pop called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung) took the two main roles, the title was changed to cash in on their fame. br /> <br /> The film is aimed at three types of audiences: those who love martial arts movies, those who love vampire movies and those who hate junk movies that Hollywood generally churns out. <br /> <br /> the premise for the film is that vampires are concerned and a secret society tries to hunt them down before we become snacks for the undead. This bloody work is performed by some martial artists who drink some vampire blood to give them the edge they need, well, it must be a thirsty job! Things are going on the course until a particularly bad European vampire discovers that if he gets a set of keys held by all the vampire principles, then he can walk around in sunlight and so on. And generally eat when you want. Telling more about the plot would ruin the pleasure of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The twins consist of a vampire hunter (Chung) and a sister (Choi) of another. They are the twins who really make the film; with some of the freshest and fun acting. The fighting scenes they play are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of genuine athleticism and wire work. To add the icing to the cake, the twins are both adorable to watch. <br /> <br /> The direction is clear and the script is clear. There are only 3 things that let this movie fall: the vampire trick is pretty poor, Jackie Chan seems to be in the film just for taste and adds nothing to its content, and some of the slapstick comedy have tried by the male vampire hunter it's rather lame. Fortunately, twins save the day by bringing originality to the film that is normally only found in European films. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi) who only communicated with screams, his ability to convey his thoughts through this medium was a comic pleasure. <br /> <br /> Theirs are many other touches of originality in this film - I particularly liked the coffin complete with surround stereo and TV screen! And it is precisely the touch and the acting of many films that prevent being an old flop and turn it into a movie not to be missed.
