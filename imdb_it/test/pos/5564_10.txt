The other reviewers are in some ways completely unrelated to why the Farscape show was (temporarily) put to rest. NOTHING to do with the quality of "loose" shows. In fact, the exact OPPOSITE is true. They kept getting better and better! :) I have seen all the episodes and when you look at them simply to make you really amazed how much fresher it becomes as they go on and on, and the wormhole and Aeryn subtree are really very interesting and give you MORE vibrations, not less. Before it was a bit chaotic, slow and rather pointless. They passed like the first two seasons running from this kind of enemy, but in the second two they were actually trying to DO something :) Also I've never seen such a fun mix of sexy girls and sci-fi attitudes. The blue girl - Zahn - was nice but not "sexy". They literally got to the point where the girls ran in leather corsets and high heels that blow up aliens - now tell me, what could be nicer than that ??? :)) <br /> <br /> The real reason why Farscape went away for a while is because it cost too much - and that's a GOOD thing for fans, because the show, seen from head to toe, is really like an epic film lasting 60 hours, with all the blockbuster movies (ok ok use similar sets, but the CG is fantastic and the girls are sexxxy). <br /> <br /> Blah blah - the real reason is because TV shows are about profit. It is a BUSINESS, and the Sci Fi channel or anyone not enjoying great success in this expensive Farscape show as they could with junk shows like "Stargate". Lexx was really cool until they got rid of the German girl and replaced her with this bizarre oddity. <br /> <br /> Anyway, yes, remember this: Farscape kept getting better and better, until it was just like a little real movie every week. Then the networks decided 'hey people will look at any old piece of drek we will be broadcasting as long as it's the only nonsense at that time, so why are we spending all this money on Farscape, let's squeeze the low budget "Stargate" down for the throat of the people and they call it a "successful series" because it is like everything we play every night LOL :)) <br /> <br /> This is the way it goes. I must also tell you that Claudia Black is a really fantastic actress. After undergoing a facelift (her broad eyes narrowed) she looked really beautiful - one of those dynamic types like Judy Davis, and sometimes sexy, sometimes ugly - like a roller coaster ride. I talk about Claudia Black with Lucy Lawless for style and substance - both VERY fun to watch - not just Chrichton :) And we can say that the pregnancy was trivial, but how many science fiction shows have a romantic subplot BELIEVABLE and DEEP that actually goes somewhere and progresses ?? It was legitimately beautiful as a love story - the actors on the show are fantastic. It is really a pity that the show is in limbo for now, but I hope it returns soon in other episodes and also in the movies, because I really buy them! :-D
