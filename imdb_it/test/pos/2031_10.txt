If you like 80s rock, you should definitely watch this movie! I only saw him recently and I am completely in love with him! <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a lot of fun, it offers you a lot of rock songs and not a single second of the film to find boring! It was a great idea that some of the real-life musicians were in this, doing what they do best. I was happy to see Zakk, as well as Blas Elias, they all exhibited solid performances. I tend to agree with many people who say that the first half of the film was much better than the second, especially in terms of the script. It could have worked a little better, but not a big problem. One thing that bothered me a bit was Jennifer Aniston's performance. I thought you weren't the right person for this role, I couldn't see you as a girlfriend rock star. But while the movie goes on, you realize somehow that he did a good job with this. There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she offers that just doesn't make you cold. <br /> <br /> To sum up, a good and fun movie, which does not delve into the characters but gives you good fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the powerful voice of Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic!
