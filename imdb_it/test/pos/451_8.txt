Yul Brynner was a symbol of villein in the 50s, he has the role of Russian leader in Hungary at the time of the revolution in this country in 1956 that he did against Marxism. <br /> <br /> the script of this film was made with good taste by the writer who mixes love and adventure with the representation of different characters in the journey from Hungary to England. The best point of this film was the symbol of the Hungarian Resistance's challenge to kill the Russian major (Yul Brynner) in the film's waiting room which meant the disadvantages of this major from his bad works, but he eventually made a good job to help Deborah Kerr escape from her and her beloved in London to write in her book a good job to get people, the agreement and the trust after her assassination by the Hungarian resistance.
