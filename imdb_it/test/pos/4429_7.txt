I think the film's title describes it well. if you are looking for a documentary on louis kahn and his work, you will have to look elsewhere. even if part of this is covered by this film. <br /> <br /> of course, I eat pretty much everything that is fed to me, and I don't know much of the family history that revolves around this case. so I believed what they had told me about Nathaniel and his father, etc. <br /> <br /> for what this film was, I thought it was pretty good. a little slow and to attract attention at a time, I wish Nathaniel would have focused a little more on his father's work than on his family drama (although much of the story was interesting, Louis was a bit of a player ). <br /> <br /> this is really a journey through someone's life, and I was happy to tag for the experience. a learning experience for me, and so it seems, also for the director. <br /> <br /> oh, and the footage of some of kahn's works is * gorgeous *
