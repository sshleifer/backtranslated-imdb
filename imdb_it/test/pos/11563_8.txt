A strange little westerner, unknown to the world, with captivating colors (probably the same material used in "Johnny Guitar", I imagine "Trucolor" or something that makes blood drops look like bright rubies), almost surreal scenes with twisted actions and characters. Something different, far from being a masterpiece, but there should be more attention to this little gem in Western encyclopedias.
