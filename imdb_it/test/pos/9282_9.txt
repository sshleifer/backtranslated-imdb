This is the first movie I saw from Singapore and it's fantastic. If you don't know much about Asia, its languages ​​and its culture, then this movie could be a bit confusing for uninformed people. As an Asian-American with dual specialization in two Asian languages ​​(one of them is Mandarin) and attended some Asian American Studies courses, this film was easier to understand, but even without that kind of knowledge, I believe this film is still accessible to its foreign audience as long as you keep in mind that it is a type of age-based film. The film certainly deserves to be seen, so you have the chance to see what kind of problems Singapore's young teens are struggling with and facing. This is a fantastic training film, but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way. The actors are exceptional.
