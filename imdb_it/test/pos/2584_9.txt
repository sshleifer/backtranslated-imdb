I saw this movie at the first screening available in my area, and it was pretty clear that most people didn't take the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It's a completely human story about some very imperfect people in a southern city, and really talks about the root of the blues. If you don't know what "Black Snake Moan" is when you leave the theater, you don't understand it. And no ... it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is absolutely convincing in her role, as is Samuel L Jackson. I think this is his best performance from his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best, including the one due to his character's BSM range. The rest of the cast is solid, with some brilliant performances here and there, most notably John Cothran Jr as Reverend RL. I am a very selective observer of cinema, and this film is really one of my favorites for his sincere look at the race, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern city, along with his cinematographic genius, in my opinion.
