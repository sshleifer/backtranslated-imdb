I remember seeing this film as a child in the 1960s. He took my breath away then at a young age. I was glued to my place in front of the TV in black and white. The cast was one of the best I've seen in my life. The musical was one of the greatest ever written. To please the Gershwin and Goldwyn families, please publish this video or DVD so that present and future generations can experience what I am sure of what many of us did when we saw this great work of art. the work of this great man cannot be seen for years to come. I pray and hope that the hearts of these families soften and that the world sees this great film again.
