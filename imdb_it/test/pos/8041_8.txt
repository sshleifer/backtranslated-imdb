The stunt sequences (as well as the special effects) are brilliant in this film. Michael Scherer must be one of the best Stunt Canadas coordinators of all time. The explosion in the Caf√© is a wonderful combination of acrobatics, special effects and visual effects. The director had an idea, which the crew managed to create on film. <br /> <br /> Beyond that; Donald Sutherland does one of his best performances in this film .......
