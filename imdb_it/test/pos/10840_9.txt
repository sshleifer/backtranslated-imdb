So far only the first episode has been shown and many stories have been made about lesbian sex scenes. But for those who care to look further, they will find an incredibly beautiful love story and one that in this episode ended in a shocking climax / cliffhanger. I found the story so powerful that I was inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic series was based.
