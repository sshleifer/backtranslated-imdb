In the 60s / 70s, David Jason was famous for his numerous secondary roles in television comedies such as "Do not Adjust Your Set!", "Hark At Barker" and the "Doctor" series. It was in 1974 that he got his first starring role, in "The Top Secret Life by Edgar Briggs" in London Weekend Television, written by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna. <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs is a secret agent of the 'SIS' ('Secret Intelligence Service'). He sincerely tries to do his job well but he always seems to make trouble. Surprisingly, however, he always manages to get to the bottom of the cases, much to the surprise of his colleagues - "Buxton" (Michael Stainton), "Spencer" (Mark Eden) and "Cathy" (the delightful Elisabeth Counsell), who respond to " The Commander "(Noel Coleman). <br /> <br /> Briggs is married to "Jennifer" (Barbara Angell), a woman who, very similar to "Betty" by Michele Dotrice of "Some Mother's Do" 'Ave' Em! ', Has the patience of a saint and resists her husband (but well-intentioned) Leonardo, regardless of what. <br /> <br /> Like 'Some Mother's Do' Ave 'Em' and 'The Baldy Man', 'TTSLOEB' was sewn completely with slapstick. Each episode saw Jason perform tricks like falling off a high window sill or falling from the top of a staircase while decorating his apartment. It was "custard stuff in the face". <br /> <br /> "Edgar Briggs" was not a great success, due to the poor programming by I.T.V. A pity because it was a fun and entertaining show, well served by its star and supporting cast. The main man, however, did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show. David Jason vetoed the repetition of the show because he felt his acting was not refined. Of course, David Jason who played "Del Boy", "Inspector Frost" and "Pop Larkin" is very different from Briggs, but it's not his unrefined acting at all. Most of the actors would have turned Briggs into a ridiculous caricature, but Jason's performance made Briggs a credible and realistic figure. Strange, perhaps, but not unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Jason's next vehicle was "Lucky Feller", in which he played mother's boyfriend "Shorty Mempstead". It also failed to make the assessments. His successful break came to fruition with ATV's "A Sharp Intake Of Breath", in which he played in the "Peter Barnes" walking disaster area for four series between 1977 and 1981. So, although not exceptional as such , 'Briggs' is a simple and useful watch. The theme of the 'James Bond' style themes is also beautiful!
