Every time I watch this movie, it really makes me want to go out and have a nice evening! My partner uses the "weekend landed" speech for psyche himself before going out! and so do I ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> This film is a great debut for the writer / director - well done friend! <br /> <br /> Acting is great, all the characters are believable and are bigger than life! The "weird" scenes are a joy to watch, the flashbacks / explanations / visualizations of Mr Floppy are fantastic! The scene in the huuuuuuuge pub when everyone gets up and starts singing the fake national anthem is a laugh. There's a lot of comedy here - Howard Marks's "spliff politics" speech is hilarious! Oh god, you just have to see it. Mind you, I heard that the film has somehow glorified the use of ecstasy, but hey, this is the truth of the matter eh? At least the film does not avoid this fact. I suppose the film also has a decent message - don't take life too seriously, you have to let yourself go down a few times. And of course the chat at the pub when Moff tries to explain to his companions that he's getting out of drugs is a sure reminder that when the coming down is out of the good times, you know the party's over! <br /> <br /> This is sometimes a very clever film in its use of the camera, lighting, etc. It was a piece of cinema made and a great story of friends, loves, discos and drugs. <br /> <br /> Get out of the people of the "rat race" !!! <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
