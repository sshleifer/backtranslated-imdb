An incredible performance! This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I know this is said a lot, but I bet you won't regret watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's fantastic from the beginning to the last second. The acting (especially the mother - played by Judith Light) is so convincing, there are not many other films I've seen that could be compared to it, and it seems impossible not to feel anything for people in this drama. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of films made every year, but if you have to choose only to see some of them in your life, make this one of them.
