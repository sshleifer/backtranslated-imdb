Forget the recent terrible American remake that sadly dulled the reputation of the French original by virtue of the director's involvement in both. This is a romantic 90s noir with lots of twists and turns. It works best as a Gallic ode at the back window of Hitchcock, because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that triggers the intricate script. The story is extraordinarily realized, like a Picasso painting, offering multi-perspectives on the same event and requiring the participation of the viewer all over the world. The settings, the music and the disturbing score are wonderful as are the excellent contributions of the cast. Watch it more than once.
