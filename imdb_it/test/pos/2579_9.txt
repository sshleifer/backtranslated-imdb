Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his film. Forget the black guy on the White Girl action. It happens, but it's not Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly, this film is about the values ​​and culture of people in this city of Tennessee. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While the shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the municipal minister, who is also struggling with his problems, becomes an adviser and mediator. It is an interesting concept that may not fit everyone. <br /> <br /> Brewer shows us the region where he grew up. Yes, it is still contaminated with racial problems, even if there are worse problems in many metropolitan cities. This is in the subtext and not the main plot of the story. People live a simpler lifestyle, yet life is still complex and atrocious. <br /> <br /> Jackson and Ricci do a fantastic job in this movie. Jackson the blues ex-guitarist who ages and makes his living on his small farm. His 12-year-old wife abandons him for his brother, so he turns into depression. Meanwhile, Ricci and Justin Timberlake have a last wild sexually charged night before embarking on the army. Ricci suffers from a childhood of sexual abuse, although this is not revealed until later, his torment can only be extinguished by sexual incursions with various boys (in black and white) in the city. <br /> <br /> When Ricci is beaten and left for dead on the road near Jacksons' farm, he finds it and takes care of his health. He believes it is a divine intervention that this half-naked white girl be left to his care. Hold up the Bible and pray for guidance. He refuses his sexual advances and instead treats her with dignity, respect and care. Something that few men have ever done in his life. <br /> <br /> In time you see Jackson as a man of honor and morality, yet he also brings his own pain. He plays his guitar and sings for her. Yes, it's the Blues and also the damn good one. With the minister who advises her, she slowly understands how to deal with the sexual abuse of her childhood. Jackson, through Ricci's transformation, realizes that he must let his pain heal. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake returns, discharged because of "anxiety problems". While looking for Ricci, who lives with Jackson during his recovery, he discovers he has been promiscuous and unfaithful to him. <br /> <br /> Find her and Jackson in a bar, where Jackson decided (as part of his healing process) to leave the pension and play the Blues again. Timberlake follows them home and confronts Jackson and Ricci. <br /> <br /> You'll have to see the movie to get the rest of the story. If you decide to watch this film, remember to watch it from the appearance of a foreign or independent film. It's a slice of life, from a particular region of America that few of us can see. It is interesting and revealing. It also shows us that, regardless of the color of our skin, we all have similar problems that can be solved with similar solutions.
