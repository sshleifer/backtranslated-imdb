Mickey Mouse is now 75 years old. It was created by Walt Disney, a famous creator, producer, director, etc.: I love Disney movies because it's so much fun to watch cartoon movies. Overall Walt Disney I think is the king of creations, Everyone has to love these creations and the films of Walt Disney. Thanks Walt for all the classic characters you've created.
