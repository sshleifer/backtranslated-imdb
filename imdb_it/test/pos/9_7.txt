I've seen this story before but my children don't. A boy with a troubled past joins the military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played to perfection by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives. After losing his team he takes a teaching position by training the next generation of heroes. The young recruit in difficulty is interpreted by Kutcher. While his scenes with local love interest are a bit stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt the butter, he compliments Costner well. I never really understood Sela Ward as the neglected wife and I felt that she should have given up on Costner for her concern for her safety with respect to her selfish needs. But his presence on the screen is a pleasure. The two non-accredited stars of this film are the Coast Guard and the Sea. Both powerful forces that should not be taken for granted in real life or in this film. The film has some slow points and could have used the 15 minutes wasted to strengthen character relationships. But it still works. The rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and modified to provide maximum impact. This film gains the applause of the public. And the applause of my two children.
