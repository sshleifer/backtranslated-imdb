When "Madame" decides to let her cats inherit it, it creates problems. The snout Butler Edgar who is next to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thus history can begin and cats can go on an adventure that otherwise would have been impossible. An adventure that allows them to meet the charming, but not entirely reliable, O'Malley cat. It helps them through many dangerous and fun situations until the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> The strength of this film is in its humor and its music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulting butler who is willing to fix the score and, of course, he himself suffers some serious beatings. One of the best scenes sees him being chased by the two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The soundtrack is fantastic and, as in "The Jungle Book", you have almost "musical" scenes in the sense that the story does not progress and the goal is to let the protagonists express themselves through dance. And of course we like that the soundtrack is quite Jazz. <br /> <br /> And of course it's not just me, but also my children who love this. <br /> <br /> Greetings Simon
