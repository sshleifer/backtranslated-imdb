The lament and the almost unbearable melancholy of the music of Amalia Rodriques go to a place in the soul that only music can inspire. In his voice and magical presence, one finds the exquisite agony of Fado, an art form of which I was unaware until I saw this film. For me, the success of this beautifully and lovingly elaborated documentary lies in the fact that the director resists the temptation to editorialize and simply allows us to share the magnetism and elegant passion of this icon. There seems to be an inevitable corruption between the Portuguese Fado and the American blues. <br /> <br /> Documentary cinema at its best transports us to a previously unknown reality. and having had this look, we are transformed. <br /> <br /> Abrigado, Sr.de Almeida
