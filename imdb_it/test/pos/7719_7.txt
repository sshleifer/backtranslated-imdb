My comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the extra of the film) and his unfortunate evaluation of the film. I think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. The film was sweet, the acting sufficient, the experience of watching it a nice diversion from a busy work week. It was not "The Hours" (acting), "The Matrix" (special effects), or "The Color Purple" (Direction). Most films will not be. But it wasn't even the shit party that "vinny ..." would have led you to believe. I'm sorry, boy, just my 2 cents. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it eventually became very gay (+ # 1). He showed a world full of different and not perfect people - you know it, just like ours (+ # 2)! He opened a door to a culture without excluding other cultures (+ # 3). And I liked the music (+ # 4).
