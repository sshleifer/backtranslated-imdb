Certainly when I saw this film at HBO, I was a little erratic in following the plot, but it attracts my attention when I see Dustin Hoffman inside it. I honestly am not fascinated by watching old movies, but in the end it changes my point of view. Seeing this moving film made me once again try to sit on my seat, without realizing that my tears suddenly rolled down my cheek, and then, after unleashing a deep sigh, I realized the impact of what I just seen. Kramer vs Kramer was really one of the best classic dramas I have witnessed for a long time, although I myself could not imagine how he touched me. The story was highly emotional, but it is not saturated with it. The characters were not unrealistic for their roles; They have qualities that make viewers like them whatever their position in the film, like the role of Meryl Streep, it was a mother who honestly gave her mistakes in the past, but then she is sure to raise her emotional motivations to get what want in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was too great, I can't even understand how this guy can play really difficult roles and suddenly jump into another completely different role, so run it well. Even though I've seen the movies a lot of times, when I sit down and sit at home scanning movies worth seeing and buying a time to do it, catching sight of Kramer against Kramer will make my experience another noteworthy moment.
