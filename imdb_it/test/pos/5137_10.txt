HOOT talks about these three kids trying to save a group of burrowing owls. now for me I think they are up to what is right and what is wrong. in this film the name of a child Roy Eberhardt (Logan lerman) moved from Montana to Florida. and once he gets on the bus, a bully Dana Matherson starts teasing him, the next day, Roy punches the bully and runs away from the bus chasing the mysterious boy who runs. after all that Roy finally meets the Boy called Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley) well, actually his nickname the half-sister Beatrice (Brie Larson) gave him because he manages to capture Mullet with his bare hands. however Mullet Fingers and Roy become friends and together they join Beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is the one behind all the acts of vandalism that happened there and even later is bitten by one of the dogs that put them on guard at the site. so they stood in front of the muckle who was driving the bulldozer and everyone saw the owls that turned out to be a great movie because it showed where children can make a difference in life, supporting what is right and what is wrong. that's the beauty of this movie. teaches everyone a lot about wildlife and how important it is.
