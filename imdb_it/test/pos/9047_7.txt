Dexter (Kurt Russell) returns to The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes for a new adventure that can stand on its own. Dexter, a university student always prone to misadventure, has an idea for a formula to make things invisible. Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is far from impressed and hopes to win a lucrative scientific prize with the student who studies the bees. However, bees sting the student and are allergic. There is that chance of winning a prize. But wait, Dexter does it! In reality, it creates a liquid that makes it invisible. The problem is that an unscrupulous businessman (Cesar Romero) learns it and decides he can use that formula, thank you, for something illegal. Will he be able to steal the bottle from under Dexter's nose? This is an accompanying film for the TCWT, but it was not necessary to see the first film to enjoy it. Russell is a brilliant loss that comes when it really counts. The rest of the cast is also a dream, with Flynn, Romero, Jim Bacchus and others showing why their comic abilities are still held in high regard today. The script is just an innocent fun that is fascinating, with special effects that are somewhat simple, by today's standards, but still effective. If you want to sit back and relive a bygone era or simply want to share a quality, a G-rated movie with your family, this is a great choice. Even if you are over 30, there is a great possibility that even now you will see your loved ones snickering the blues with a screening of this film.
