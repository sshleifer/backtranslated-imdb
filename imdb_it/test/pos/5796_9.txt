Forget every spy movie you've ever seen - this is what life was like in the USSR, and it is still in many places in Russia and the former Soviet countries. Vera dreams of the life of leisure, while she imagines that the West is; its reality is very different, with a bitter mother, a violent father and the ever-present alcohol. And its prospects for the future are not much better. Find a man and try to patch up a life together, but he's afflicted by the same environment, both socially and physically - the scenery of this film is brilliant, sitting comfortably in the company of post-apocalyptic films but obviously done with no special effects; they just walked in and shot whatever happened in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Forget your stereotyped and cold Russian espionage movies. This is the real deal: people are passionate, vibrant and present in a way you will never see in a Western drama.
