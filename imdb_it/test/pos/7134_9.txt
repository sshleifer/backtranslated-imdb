I'm definitely not a player, but a couple of people in my family and my boyfriend are. So, with a little reluctance, I decided to find out what the big problem was with "fantastic things". I saw Dorkness Rising and I thought it was HILARIOUS! It's slap, but not disrespectful for those who love role-playing games. Moreover, and above all, people who have never played before can enjoy themselves and not feel excluded or lost trying to understand the plot. The acting was great and the shots / sets on the field were credible. This makes me want to see more films from this production company. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group! Three applauses - well done !!
