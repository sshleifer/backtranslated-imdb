This is a romantic movie, even a shoddy one, which is one of my all-time favorites. It is one of the many CLASSICS of the 80s like "Pretty in Pink" or "Some kind of Wonderful". <br /> <br /> Nic plays the typical punk boy in love with the traditional valley, the preppy girl Julie. It is a moving love story that gives you the chance to win the girl at the end. <br /> <br /> True, most of the acting sucks but ... <br /> <br /> I've been in love with Nic since I saw this in the theaters and I've seen almost every movie where has been since then. He grew up as an actor but it's obvious in his first film that he had a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> If you love movies from the 80s, you'll love this classic. <br /> <br /> Go get it !!!!!
