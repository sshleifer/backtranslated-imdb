a beautiful romantic comedy. erroll flynn shows how skilled a touch for the comedy he owned. a talent that probably shows some of his real jokers. the comic writing on this film is excellent. eleanor parker does a good job as Flynn's ex-wife who erroll is trying to win back. Eleonora is also easy on the eyes. the sets exude the glamor and style of 1940, if appropriate. <br /> <br /> Flynn's comic timing and spirit are shown to full effect here, look at his shotguns, his ability to verbally neutralize the punch with a brisk comeback or recite the straight man and his total credibility and sincerity where required, this guy could act! it's a shame that the mistake didn't have the chance to do more roles like this throughout his career, he was extremely talented to the extreme. if you enjoyed "it happened one night" with gable and colbert or some of the comedies william powell and myrna loys you'll have fun. <br /> <br /> rhythm and laughter. a lost diamond of a movie.
