This film is the funniest Danish film I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The plot is fun, surprising and exceptional. Danish humor is unlike any other, and takes you every time. The whole audience laughed 90% of the time ... it was incredible. The characters are so well interpreted, and the two actors, Mads mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas play their best ever! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend seeing this movie, you won't regret it, believe me:)
