After working on 7 films with director Mickael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood Are Their Best Results), Errol Flynn got tired of his dictatorial leadership and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This meeting is a happy thing for cinematography. THE MONSTER WITH THEIR BOOTS is their first and best film together. Raoul Walsh plays General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debuts at West Point, to the civil war and finally to the battle of Little Big Horn. It is true that the film shows a too heroic portrait of Custer, but it is not important. What is important is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters. Who can forget California Joe, the great "Queen's Own Buttler" with his song "Garryowen", the touching Mrs Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the diabolical Sharp well played by Arthur Kennedy? <br /> <br /> An eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic cutter.
