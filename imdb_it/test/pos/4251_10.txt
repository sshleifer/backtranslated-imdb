This film has improved over time. I can't believe it's been forty years since I saw him at age 15. Yes, it's true. Movie rankings were not yet a reality, so every teenager could get into any movie. Imagine how it was for a child of my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King have just been killed, but the following summer saw a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's opportunity to attach it to man. You'll see where Robert Downey, Jr. got his sardonic genius. His old man was an instant hero for children like me. There are no punches in this classic, and the old hippies will rejoice when they relive this era. I hope the new flower children will be encouraged and this current era of fascism will be subjected to the same examination that my era was subjected to.
