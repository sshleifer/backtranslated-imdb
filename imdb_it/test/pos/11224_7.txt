The images control this film. The characters, although interesting, take a back seat. The first scene I remember is a black and white shot of the ocean, which then opens up in full screen and color. The gurgling water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface. The theme of the film here, being that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living. <br /> <br /> Water as the ultimate consciousness, as an instrument of God, is used here to force people to take their "houses" in order (judgment day). The dead must be justified and taken to a better place. Whatever has remained unresolved or unresolved will be wiped out. There is no attachment to the past, to a buried memory of what it was. <br /> <br /> This film has been compared to O, Brother Where Art Thou, and the threat of water and its use as a cleaning force is similar to that movie. What is different in this film is that the arrival of water is knowable and therefore, once again, the emphasis is on what needs to be done with the here and now. <br /> <br /> I agree that some of the scenes are reminiscent of a work by David Lynch. Take, for example, the dinner segment with the deep and androgynous waitress. You get the same surreal feeling from the setting and the weird character as you do with the interlocutor in the Fire Starter scene. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a problematic character, while this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message. Men in black suits cannot have anything they want: they must be patient and accept what is available.
