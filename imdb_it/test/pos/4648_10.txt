I hope so and how can I be involved? <br /> <br /> This film is a classic and mature of laughter, adventures and a cast of all the stars, 80s! <br /> <br /> What happens when you gather a group of athletes and sisterhood, a group of nerds in discussion, a band of misfits and a couple of couselors? <br /> <br /> A lot of laughs that will beg for you more! <br /> <br /> David Naughton plays Adam, the leader of the "yellow team", a kind and fashionable university consultant who helps students with everything from the lessons they want to get for the first time. <br /> <br /> His nemesis is Harold, the "blue team" leader, played hilariously by Stephen Furst of "Babylon 5" fame, the not-good son of a rich, former college athlete with enough trophies to make any famer room jealous. <br /> <br /> Pit these two against each other and throw in a "red team", a "white team" and a "green team", an incredible "sight" in an observatory, consequences of cheating miniature golf, a super tour at Pabst B lue Ribbon brewery and a hateful old hostess among other adventures, and you have all the ingredients of a night to remember! <br /> <br /> Look for the appearances of Michael J. Fox, Eddie Deezen and director Andy Tennant in one of the last films in which he starred before becoming a director and you have an all-star, hilarious cast. <br /> <br /> The only downside to this film was Debra Clinger's performance as Laura. It's terribly exaggerated, but the rest of the film is so beautiful, it can simply be ignored. <br /> <br /> I own this movie and I can never watch it enough! <br /> <br />
