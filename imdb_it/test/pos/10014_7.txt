"Night of the Hunted" sees French porn star Brigitte Lahaie. In fact, many of the cast members in this slow-motion production were porn actors at the time of his frantic shooting. This film is definitely different from Rollin's usual lesbian vampire movies, but it's not as memorable as "Lips of Blood" or "Fascination". Lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can't remember who she is or where she comes from. Most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex, where Lahaie is held by a kind of medical group that is treating a number of people with a similar condition. In any case, escape from the monolithic tower of the office where the affected people are located. On a highway outside the city, he meets a young man, "Night of the Hunted" offers a lot of nudity, unfortunately the pace is extremely slow. The atmosphere is terribly sad and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another inmate Dominique Journet is well developed. Still, "Night" by th and Hunted "is too boring to be completely funny. Just take a look if you are a fan of the works of Jean Rollin.7 out of 10 and he is kind.
