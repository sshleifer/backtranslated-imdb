I liked this movie. I saw it in a crowded venue at the Toronto International Film Festival the day after the gala cocktail that must have gone well. The director, Gavin Hood should have been present for today's screening, but unfortunately his twins were born a few hours earlier, so he had to make a return flight. "2 parts in 24 hours" was the way he joked about this. <br /> <br /> The Rendition refers to "extraordinary rendition" - a term by which suspected terrorists in the United States can be sent, without the legal consent of their parents, nations, prisons abroad to be interrogated and detained. <br /> <br /> It is quite predictable - innocent Egyptian-American man unjustly accused of being a "disappears" terrorist while traveling from South Africa to Washington DC. He is sent abroad, while his wife at home (Reese Witherspoon) struggles to find and release him. But what makes this film special are some good choices in telling stories: 1) a human-touch story of what's happening in the place where a suicide bomb went off; 2) the humanity of a CIA agent who tries to understand and be honest with what is really happening; and 3) the chronology of the story that makes it a tense and tense story that moves and moves at the right moments. Ah - relief! And a mix of emotions that swirl while the story fights for a finale. <br /> <br /> A well-rounded acting with Meryl Streep like a reckless fox.
