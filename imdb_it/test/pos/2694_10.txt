King of Queens is a comic genius. Kevin James, who plays IPS messenger boy Doug Heffernan, is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife, Carrie, is incredibly sexy (# 19 on Stuff magazine's sexiest women's list), and very funny. The real magic of the show However the scenes with Jerry Stiller are, they are the most fun on the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, who lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I have to admit that I have never witnessed this show until this year, 2006. Every time I browsed it before it never seemed fun, but with the cancellation of Friends, Still Standing and Yes Dear, I needed some new comedy . Actually giving The King of Queens a chance I found out that it was absolutely fantastic. So funny, in fact, that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched each season in 8-hour blocks. I warmly urge anyone who has not seen this treasure to check. You will not be disappointed.
