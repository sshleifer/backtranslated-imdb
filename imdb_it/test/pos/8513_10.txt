Let me pass by many comments that I have read here, and I say that this film is one of the five best Bonds, along with His Majesty's secret service, From Russia with love, License to kill and Only for your eyes (the ONLY time when Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond instead of walking around). Of course, Sean Connery puts it all together - as a co-author, co-producer and in his best performance from From Russia With Love. He is fit, energetic and obviously enjoying himself. His acting is mature, confident and intertwined with the right dose of humor. This is in contrast to his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking through You Only Live Twice, and his playful, paunchy romp through that cartoon known as Diamonds Are Forever! <br /> <br /> This is an imaginative reworking of Thunderball, without having sets and machines that overwhelm the characters and the plot. This cast is far superior. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on eye patches, SPECTER rings or a boring uniform. Kim Basinger is athletic and adorable, Barbara Carrera is dynamic and, for once, we have a great Felix Leiter in Bernie Casey. The depictions of M and Q are original and the addition of the grumpy Small-Fawcett agent is fun without expiring. <br /> <br /> The director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his places (the Bahamas and the French Riviera) without losing sight of his actors. Although the close inspection reveals some mediocre special effects and falls into continuity, Kershner keeps the film moving at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even its director, Terence Young, did not like). Obviously the fans will miss the cannon brand and 007 theme music, but they are, after all, owned by Eon Productions. <br /> <br /> Michel LeGrand may not have composed the most memorable score, but captures the atmosphere of the places without being overly intrusive. Not surprisingly, his best moments are in the south of France, with his French love song (at the spa) particularly attractive. And tell me, how many really remember Moonraker's music? Personally I'd rather forget Man With the Golden Gun and A View To a Kill! <br /> <br /> Eons can giggle this movie, if they want. (Yes, Octopussy has made more money.) At least 007 of Connery did not cross the jungle by shouting Tarzan. He didn't joke with a Bengal tiger, nor did he fight the "Indian" snake charmers with a tennis racket. Despite Eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman have put together a good movie, one that I think Ian Fleming would have appreciated. <br /> <br /> If, on the other hand, you would rather see James Bond get kicked by a dwarf from his shins, engage in another strenuous fight with "Jaws", jump into bed with Grace Jones, or lead a hunt slapstick pirates through San Francisco, this is NOT the movie for you!
