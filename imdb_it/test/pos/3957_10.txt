"Blind Spot" is one of my festival favorites. I was totally fascinated by the idea of ​​three strangers in search of a mysterious man who loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is fantastic. James Franco is particularly surprising as the boy with a broken heart in Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we listen to off-screen, work well with graphics and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. He also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening atmosphere of lost love. There is a dreamlike quality in different sequences and the images are saturated with a disturbing sense of tension. Strange. Suspense. Good looking. Definitely worth seeing. I would really like to see it again. Periodically check to see if Blind Spot has been distributed. I look forward to seeing the film in the cinema or on DVD. <br /> <br /> Davide Pepe 08/13/2005 Bologna - Italy
