I think this movie was recommended to me by the lady in the store I was hiring him from! For once she was bang on! What a great movie! First of all I was convinced that James McAvoy and Romola Garai were so convincing Irish were their accents; and in the middle of the film I was absolutely convinced that Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure he was also James McAvoy! When I saw the special features of the DVD and saw both actors in their "normal" guise, to say I was speechless would be an understatement !!! I remember all the applause that Dustin Hoffmann got in the 80s for his portrait of autism in the movie "Rain Man" - frankly (in my opinion of course!). Steven Robertson's performance / performance blows Dustin Hoffmann right out - and deserves recognition as such !! All in all one of the greatest portraits of friendship / love / human relations ever - and was made in Britain / Ireland with home-born actors - stick it in his pipe and smoke it in Hollywood!
