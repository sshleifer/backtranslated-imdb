This is a film that really makes you think about your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. I won't give the plot in this post, I think others have already beaten me. I hope that, despite the reading of opinions on this site, you will take the opportunity and see this film for yourself. I went to see this movie with my husband and a friend and I must say that after the end of the film, there was total silence in the theater. After a few minutes I looked behind me and everyone in the theater stared at the screen, lost in thought. This will get you into your psychological abyss to reflect on several things: <br /> <br /> How much does society affect my life and my generation? <br /> <br /> How long does someone have to pay for the mistakes they made? <br /> <br /> If there is a second chance given, is it ever realized? <br /> <br /> Is it better to live in a box or not live at all? <br /> <br /> My questions are not intended to show my approval or disapproval of Leland's actions. I don't want my opinion of them to dictate in any way what you will take away from this movie, so I won't give it. Watch it for you. I'm still lost in my thoughts, trying to answer my many questions in the film. I loved it and I hope you will too. This film is not trying to answer questions, condone any action or promote any punishment. This film is trying to make us all evaluate our lives and take off the pink glasses that most of us see in the world. <br /> <br /> Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars
