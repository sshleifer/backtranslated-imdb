Simply one of the greatest films ever made. Worthy to sit next to such European masterpieces as THE RULES OF THE GAME, GREAT ILLUSION, NOSTALGIA, ANDREI ROUBLEV, 8 1/2, THE WINGS OF DESIRE, VIRIDIANA, THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS, THE ROAD, ORDET, THE PASSION OF JOAN DI ARC, THE FOUR CENTURY BLOWN and MADAME DE ... Both a blessing ... and an almost perfect work of art.
