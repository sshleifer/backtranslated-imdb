This show was incredible, but too esoteric for most people. If you had never seen a European variety show in the 70s or 80s (or at least the Mexican one), the whole show would probably be lost on you. If I had done so, this show was a dead man to pierce the satire of the fake show and the superficiality that these shows immerse themselves in their worst. "Viva Variety" is a variety show that tries to take off from every episode, but always goes down in combat, helmed by a would-be smoker with a pencil mustache and his ultra-glamorous and immortalizing harridan of an ex-wife. and acts very badly. The hosts are joined by "Johnny Bluejeans", a side kick that seems to have been called because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and this means that kids will like it, which they obviously don't. <br /> <br /> The result was an exhilarating parody of variety shows in general. Imagine that BACKSTAGE probably happened during the last days of the "Sonny & Cher Show". Now imagine that ONSTAGE is happening in front of you and that the stars are trying to stay calm. Now add cheese and a Euro-riche mentality (tuxedos, clothes, alcohol, accents and fumes). NOW you have "Viva Variety". <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard a musician whose music was written for other musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did this for the comedians. WAY too esoteric for the standard American public. It was fun as hell. And condemned.
