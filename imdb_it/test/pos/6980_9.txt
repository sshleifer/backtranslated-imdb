I've seen the version of Director's Cut and it can be nothing but content. Excellent acting (especially Cole Hauser, I was sad for the limited space for Claudia Black), the subtle visual effects and the credible plot photography (considering the genre) without a lot of logical holes, unpredictable twists, build-on characters . These are the film's major resources. Combined with the style, some may consider this film a B-level effort, but I would disagree. Everything is really very original and elegant. <br /> <br /> And even though I'm not a Vin Diesel fan, this rough Riddick role suited him. I can't wait for Chronicles of Riddick, it's really nice that this movie has a sequel ... <br /> <br /> 9/10 if you ask me
