When it was announced that the "King of Pop" had died at the age of 50, a month before starting a series of live concerts at London's O2 Arena, it was a huge shock for millions of people around the world . He was, and will forever be, one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and will miss him terribly. I decided to remind myself how wonderful it was by looking at what is considered by many not only the best video of Jackson (and perhaps the song), but the biggest music video ever made by director John Landis (An American Werewolf in London ). The film opens with Michael and his girlfriend (Ola Ray) with the collapse of the car, and after giving her a ring, the moon comes out and turns into a werewolf. So let's see Michael and his girlfriend watching this horror movie in the cinema, she is scared and leaves and Michael follows her soon, singing the iconic song. Soon the voice of Vincent Price arrives, and the zombies start to crawl out of the ground and open coffins from the cemetery, and Michael and the girl are obviously surrounded. He turns and Michael has become a zombie himself, and with all the other creatures they do iconic dance, before he returns to his normal self, at least for the choir. The girl runs into the nearby scary house, blocks the door, but Michael's zombie still manages to break through and when he touches her the girl shouts to see the usual Michael say "what's the problem?" The film ends with him taking her home and looking at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and was number 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star, the Thriller album was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Albums, and this video was number 100 of The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and was number 1 of the 100 greatest pop videos. Very good!
