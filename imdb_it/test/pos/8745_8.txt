I've read countless reviews talking about the superiority of the miniseries. I certainly cannot agree on such a general statement. If you analyze all the aspects of a video / film production, there are countable areas where the film is probably enormously superior. <br /> <br /> Certainly, many of the comments are valid regarding the particular areas of the mini-series. In particular with regard to more threads (customs officers) and more developed threads (such as the Pakistani peasant and the family). That said, I found the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones much more compelling than desperate women, from poverty to riches who "won't come back". He is a much more likeable character than these cold women who do not seem to have as much reason for his rapid passage to evil. (And yes, I understand ... her children, she was desperate, I didn't see her in despair). <br /> <br /> Also, while appreciating some of the most story-rich threads in the mini-series, the character of Benicio del Toro was very compelling. An anchor for the film. That thread has been changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) only in good ways. A fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I am skeptical that such a pure person can exist within such a system, but I don't know enough about the politics of the nation to be discussed). <br /> <br /> After seeing the first episode of the mini-series, I actually revisited the film. Why? I kept reading about fantastic acting. I found the executions in the first episode of the ridiculous miniseries. Of course, this has improved with the progress of the miniseries. Now that I've just finished both versions in a few days, I can't agree that mini-series performances have reached the same level as Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, even though Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan were very good. I also hear that the police in the film far outnumbered the mini-series. I was not very impressed by the Germans in everything. <br /> <br /> Finally, dialogue, as presented in the film, is much more nuanced. Especially in the scenes that are almost literally. "Careful, you start looking like your husband." unlike "HAHAHAHA! You look like Karl". Once again, I found some of the acting in the miniseries very unconvincing. This was a great example. <br /> <br /> Other superior aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing. <br /> <br /> Should I complain that the film wasn't longer? No. I think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format. The changes made were by themselves. I mean, you'd sit in a theater for 5/7/10 hours. Of course not. <br /> <br /> Mini-series: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Movies: 9 out of 10
