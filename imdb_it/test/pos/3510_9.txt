I saw this film for the first time around 1990 as a kid and scared the Jesus out of me. I liked it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it. <br /> <br /> In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so I went to the Need to know section on IMDb and explained what the movie is about and he tried to get his name. Anyway, eventually someone told me about IMDb, so I did research and tried to buy the movie. So in the end I had a DVD take, and now I keep this film as one of my most precious horror films. I really love it, and I think anyone who looks at it will be very scared in the woods the next time they go. 9/10.
