Honestly, at first, I watched this movie because of the free sex scenes I heard, but watching the movie made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there. Actually, it's one of the most well made and touching films I've ever seen. I am a bisexual teenager and the film told me about my difficulties - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. He gave me an idea on how to deal with these problems with the help of myself and others around me that I love for who I am. Cox has really managed the film well by sprinkling dozens of heart-warming lines and a bit of sexuality in it. It made the film more interesting. Some compare it to Brokeback Mountain but disagree. The Brokeback Mountain are more dramatic while the Last Days are well balanced.
