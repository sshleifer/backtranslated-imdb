This film is based on the series of games: Final Fantasy. This particularly concerns FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game and I was very happy to see it turned into a movie, I loved the CG, it was fantastic. Lots of great fighting scenes, action and characters to make the movie memorable. If you are a passionate fan of the game you will love this movie. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of games, but I'm starting to become one. <br /> <br /> My favorite Final Fantasy VII character besides Cloud, should be Cid. I love Cid, I think it's cute. I was amazed at how real the CG images were, it was fantastic, it's the 3D game. I really enjoyed watching the movie and, by the way, I love eons, especially Bahamut, it's great! Overall I gave this film at 9, because yes, I loved it. I thought it was a really good movie, and yes it's on my list of movies to get. The characters were fantastic, they loved the CG, the story was wonderful, with lots of action and fighting scenes. Overall, it's the best movie I've ever seen, based on a video game.
