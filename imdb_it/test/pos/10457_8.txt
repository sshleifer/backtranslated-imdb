It looks like an impressionistic film; if there's such a thing. <br /> <br /> The story is well told, very poetic. the characters well developed and well interpreted by the performers (or interpreted by the actors :)). <br /> <br /> The movie sometimes has fun with its sumptuous emotions and works well, unless you hate that emotion in the movies - it's not like that for me. <br /> <br /> It is a very humanistic film. <br /> <br /> The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in all respects. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> A good classic for every good movie collection.
