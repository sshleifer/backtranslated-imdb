"Back in the Day" is an interesting but imperfect effort. Ja Rule plays Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man who tries to face his father's death. Meet his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he must choose: Love or Crime. <br /> <br /> Ja Rule does a competent job like Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone. It brings a lot of energy and threat to the role. Joe Morton as the preacher is the usual usually excellent, but it doesn't do much. The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggie's dad. He needed more time for the screen. I don't want to say it, but Pam Grier is really as horrible as Mr Cooper. She twists every scene and brings the film down. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are there but they do nothing substantial for the plot. <br /> <br /> At the end: you should see it for the skilled performances of Ving Rhames and Joe Morton and the determination to write and direct.
