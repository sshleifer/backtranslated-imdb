This bittersweet slice of magical realism has had a history of chess production (replaced by the director / writer) and grossed the box office, but it's a helluva film. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are pre-teen brothers whose wobbly mother (Lorraine Bracco) is having fun with an alcoholic with a petty spirit (Adam Baldwin). During his drinking periods, Baldwin physically abuses Mazzello and manipulates him to remain silent about his situation. But when Wood blames what is happening, the boys put their heads together and open a fantastic solution to Mazzello's devastating dilemma. <br /> <br /> I love movies that mix dark reality and fantasy. They rarely succeed financially ("Lawn Dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and intriguing. <br /> <br /> The Baldwin drunk is shot from a low perspective as a child and his head is deliberately severed beneath the top of the frame. This device allows us to judge him only by his actions and as a beast totally physically. Both Wood and Mazzello are excellent, and they drag us effortlessly into their dark and terrifying world. <br /> <br /> The title "radio flyer" is a small red wagon that children carry their belongings. Here carries a dream. <br /> <br /> Seriously interesting things.
