From the Oldboy director comes this smooth vampire movie. Kang-ho Song plays a priest who is accidentally turned into a vampire while being healed by a deadly and mysterious virus. His vampirism and priesthood are quite conflicting, but he is able to survive by stealing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who might not care for some siphoned blood. Because of his supposed miraculous survival, he enters the life of Ha-kyun Shin's family. Shin has cancer and his mother believes that Song can cure him. Unfortunately, Song's vampirism raises his desire levels to a height where he can't help but fall in love with Shin's young wife, OK-vin Kim. Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lovers. The film from there goes in strange directions which I think you should try for yourself. What really should be mentioned is the domain of Chan-wook Park in the middle of the cinema. My God, I've rarely seen a visual artist so masterful at the height of his powers. The main flaw in the film is that it is a bit inconsistent, especially in the beginning. Park is interested in telling his stories especially in graphics, which can sometimes be difficult to follow. But when it works, man, fly. The film is also perversely hilarious. The final sequence, easily one of the best of the decade, is both heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous. OK-vin Kim should become a world star after this movie. You offer one of the best performances of the year.
