Dr. Franz Tobel, a Swiss scientist, is sneaked out of his country by Sherlock Holmes because the Nazi agents who spy on him do not get his invention of a new bomb. Arriving in London, he takes up residence with Holmes and Watson, but goes to pay a visit with his girlfriend, Charlotte Eberli, where he leaves a clue for Holmes as for the positions of his sight bomb, which he has divided into four pieces, but La Holmes's eternal nemesis, Professor Moriarity, is also looking for the bomb to sell to the Nazis and kidnaps Dr. Tobel and the clue left to Charlotte, a coded series of dancers, that both Holmes and Moriarity are unable to completely decipher . Eventually Holmes discovers the clue of the code and gets the position of the fourth piece of the bomb, but Moriarity has the other three and a clash is inevitable. Excellent voice in the Holmes series with a lot of mystery and guesses to go on. The portrait of Atwill by Moriarity is more sadistic than the cunning described in the stories of Doyle (or the performance of George Zucco in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but Atwill's skills as an actor make his Moriarity rather benevolent. Both the script and the direction make this voice more a cat and mouse game between the two characters and this is one of the reasons why this voice was successful. Great work also for cinematography. Evaluation, 8.
