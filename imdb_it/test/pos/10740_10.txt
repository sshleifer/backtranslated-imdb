Although Dr. Seuess should have given credit for stealing the plot of "Horton Hatches The Egg", this was a good movie. He touched both emotions and intellect. Due mainly to the incredible performance of Justin Henry's seven years and a script that was in tune with each character (and his difficulties), the elements that provoke thought linger long after the tears are over. Overall, superior acting from a solid cast, excellent direction and a very powerful script. The right touches of humor help keep a subject "heavy" from becoming boring or difficult to seduce. Finally, this film stands the test of time and does not seem dated in any way, decades after its publication.
