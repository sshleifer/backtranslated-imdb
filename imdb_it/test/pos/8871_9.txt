This film sat for years in a dusty pile of videos in my home before watching it. We knew it was there - whenever someone wanted to watch a movie, it was suggested. It's almost become a joke ... "I know, let's watch Throw my mother from the train" ... I don't know why he was always refused, he was. We didn't know what we were missing. It still seems to me that it took so long ... I mean that says Danny DeVito, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsy (which we called "The Lady of the Goonies"), a cast of stars that should have appealed to everyone in my family . But he stayed there for almost ten years. Until one day it was suggested and we could no longer refuse it .... <br /> <br /> It was like finding King Tut's grave ... <br /> <br /> No film has ever made me laugh like this strong, and I doubt any film will ever do it. I had to rewind for almost all the jokes because I was still laughing at the joke that came before and I lost the ability to listen or pay attention. Not even a simple laugh, or ... the kind of laughter that spends more energy than running ten miles in the cold. The kind of laughter you can't control, which causes the rolling and spasms, and the tears and snot that run down your face because it's just funny. Once I have memorized the film, I will say that this effect has diminished, but I don't think I would get tired of looking at it and finding new ones that can appreciate it. I think that's all I can say. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you don't like it, please don't let me know, I will probably be offended.
