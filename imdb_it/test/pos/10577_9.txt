I had never read any of Sarah Waters' novels, nor looked at Tipping the Velvet. I have only heard of Fingersmith while browsing the websites of "The L word". The plot of Fingersmith interested me, yet I passed it away, thinking "Lesbian in the Victorian period, which never ends well, I've had enough of those lesbian series and films that don't go where" <br /> <br /> , during Christmas, my local DVD store gave Fingersmith a discount, I brought the DVD and my life has never been more colorful <br /> <br /> This mini series deserves to be appreciated and praised. The acting is so great that I call it rare. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton and many others I can't name all brought light and darkness to their characters. Just a small gesture, a small look, a little touch, they made their characters real and as a spectator, I couldn't help but bring them home, keep them close. <br /> <br /> Fingersmith, set in the Victorian area, is a story of Sue, a thief who loves and lives with his "Family" of pickpockets. He did not know that his destiny was linked to Maud Lily, a shy and shy girl who grew up in a palace miles away. Maud's mother left her a fortune, but Maud herself cannot touch her, unless she married. Worse still, Maud's uncle makes sure he never will, keeping her prisoner at home. <br /> <br /> Enter Mr Gentlement, a charming and handsome thief with a heart as bad as any. He wants Maud's fortune for himself and, to do so, he prepares Sue as Maud Lily's maid, asking Sue to convince Maud to run away with him. over time, things would be simple, if Sue didn't fall in love with Maud. <br /> <br /> And things would be simple, if the story were what I just said. I don't want to spoil it, so I'd like to stop here. But I can assure you that everything is distorted and transformed before you can even know what happened. Once that happens, ask then what would happen next. Moreover, the story is full of passion unlike others. There are no questions of self-research, questions about sexuality, "Oh my God, I like girls," because the Fingersmith girls are buried so deeply in their own darkness that they can barely care. the story with such a twisted texture moves smooth as water, running passionately, but strangely calm. <br /> <br /> It's been weeks since I saw "Fingersmith", but Maud's eyes still haunt me, and Sue's words still warm my heart "You pearl, you pearl, you pearl", he said . And that pearl is.
