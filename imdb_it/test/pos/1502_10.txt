this film gets a 10 because there is a lot of blood in it. Who cares about the plot or acting. This is an Italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from acting or from the plot. I took the movie from other movies and added it to this one. I've never seen any of the movies he took from him. I did not care. The Italian godfather of Gore out has made this film. This is one of the most elegant Italian films you've ever seen. No need for a gorebondo without this movie in their horror movie collection. Buy this movie, no matter what the dream of a mar√≤ is come true.
