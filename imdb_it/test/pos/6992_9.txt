People who thought that THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK sucked harder than the black hole that had swallowed the HORIZON EVENT probably didn't see the movie that gave birth to Vin Diesel's murderous skin, and probably didn't want to. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK actually kicks the ass. <br /> <br /> Directed by the veterinarian of the genre David Twohy, (WARLOCK and the excellent but undervalued BELOW) and written by the brothers Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK starts with a prologue 'ALIEN' . When a combined merchant ship / cargo ship is badly damaged by a strange meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), co-pilot Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL'S Radha Mitchell) has an important decision to make: abandon the load or passengers? Near the digging of the occupants, the emergency landing derails its course of action. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, because the catastrophic landing was done on a presumptuous rock that once housed a mining colony. Among the survivors are a pair of settlers, Shazza (FARSCAPE's Claudia Black) and Zeke (John Moore); an imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" boys and girls?); an antique dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a "boy" named Jack (Rhianna Griffith) and the most controversial members of the group: a Marshall named Johns (the exceptionally slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous killer named Riddick (Diesel). <br /> <br /> The way in which the group dynamics follow one another causes a lot of dramatic tension, especially with regards to Riddick and how many people could cut and cut if he ever left. But nobody comes out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along, how they will survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. The things that are hungry, enchanted and fast are creeping around just where they can't be seen, living in darkness where they can survive and thrive. They want the flesh of the newcomers to satiate their appetites, but they can't go out into the burning light to seek food. <br /> <br /> Does the phrase "total eclipse" make things a little more interesting? Here is the title more than appropriate. <br /> <br /> Vin, more monosyllabic than Dirty Harry by Clint Eastwood on his ugliest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that really seems worthy of a sequel or two, and Hauser , which oozes threat and bile, is just as good as his dad Wings was rascal on the screen. Surprisingly, though, Mitchell keeps his and manages to be as strong and understanding as Fry. You wouldn't expect anything less than a strong performance from Black, She Who Once Once 'Aeryn Sun', and she doesn't disappoint. (Too bad his role was not bigger, but that's all I'll say about it.) And David makes his usual indelible impression as the saint whose faith will really be tested in the very pit of Hell itself. <br /> <br /> The rhythm moves faster than Riddick who slips behind his prey with a stalk between his teeth, and once the darkness has fallen, terror and tension never stop, practically as in other classic science fiction / horror films that this imitates. But if imitation is really the sincerest form of flattery, Dave Twohy and the Wheats deserve big repercussions to get this right with a vengeance, and to give us an ending that is anti-Hollywood at best. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil the surprises, so I won't say anything else, except that if you saw CHRONICLES first and you weren't too happy, give PITCH BLACK a chance anyway. And if you haven't seen anyone, definitely start with this. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to Vin, but it could certainly do worse than give these guys a call again. I'd like to see what they would dream after ...
