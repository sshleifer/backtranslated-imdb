Just a fantastic soundtrack. Really nice music. Exceptional cast, great lead performance. Worth watching. <br /> <br /> It doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. We feel that the integration is to blame or that with the departure of the main character the neighborhood has disintegrated. <br /> <br /> This film seems well studied and extremely well done. I particularly liked some minor characters like Jeffrey Wright. <br /> <br /> Cutting during the opening sequence helps to express what a lively, engaging and desirable experience that disco would have been with jumping music, food, drinks, dance, gambling and sex.
