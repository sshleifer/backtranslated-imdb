The cast for this production of Rigoletto is excellent. Edita Gruberova sings Gilda beautifully and passionately. Luciano Pavarotti also sings beautifully. Vergara is a beautiful Magdalene; Fedora Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the maid, Giovanna. Weikl sings Marullo; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. Like Rigoletto, Wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this extraordinary singer ensemble. Kathleen Kuhlmann in the Countess. All the major ones are famous and famous all over the world. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting Rigoletto both visually and musically. <br /> <br /> I have it on both laser and DVD discs. You should have it too!
