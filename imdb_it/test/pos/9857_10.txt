We must be careful of those who talk about watching movies 12 hours long. It might be easy for people to assume that this is a sort of regular event - in fact, even in the "arthouse" world, these huge run times are extremely rare, for obvious reasons. This is something shared by Hollywood and artistic cinema: the generally accepted journey time of 90-120 minutes, with a minority of films that dare to approach, but rarely exceed, the three-hour mark. <br /> <br /> For this reason, a film like Out 1 (runtime: 729 minutes) is a challenge even for the most incisive film lover, and somehow explains why it was projected only on some occasions and remains extremely difficult <br /> <br /> Originally conceived as a television series by the unidentified Nouvelle Vague director, Jacques Rivette, it aroused little interest from the French networks and instead received a brief theatrical series (Peter Watkins was forced to do the same with his brilliant pseudo-nuclear war documentary The War Game, although this has had more to do with state censorship than problems with the execution time). Shown a couple of times in 1971, Out 1 re-emerged in a handful of Rivette retrospectives over the past two decades, and many of those who saw it, including the respected American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, hailed it as one of the most great movies ever. <br /> <br /> Is it? Well, yes, if you like Rivette. Only this is a big "if", since Jacques Rivette has never been a successful commercial director. Only two of his films have been successful (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both superb), and many remain difficult to find on DVD today (the Out 1 became available on the Internet only after a rare videotape has been loaded). However, he is highly respected within the film community and, with good reason, his playfully surreal narratives, the sense of rhythm and the use of improvisation set him apart as one of the most singular and satisfying filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Out 1 deals with a theme that is part of all Rivette's works: the nature of acting, particularly in the context of theater and improvisation. His fascination with acting makes Rivette's films a much more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, as improvisational aspects allow actors to play a much more active role in determining how the film gets together. Out 1 is roughly divided into four main narratives, which gradually intertwine and merge with the development of the film: two composed by theater companies, each of which tries to devise post-modern theatrical adaptations of the works of Aeschylus; the other two individual thieves (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto, icons of Nouvelle Vague) who pursue eccentric methods of making money; and a general plot involving a mysterious conspiracy inspired by Balzac centered on an organization known as "the thirteen". <br /> <br /> Like every movie Rivette with a "conspiracy" narrative, the mysteries and secret organizations are little more than a red herring. As the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their interpersonal plans and connections are interrupted, the film becomes more and more a symbol of the post-1968 era and of the decline of the ideals of that era. For a film made in 1971, these were very early themes; another French director in Jean Eustache would address this topic equally satisfactorily in his 1973 masterpiece, The Mother and the Whore. But this is not the limit of the scope of Out 1. <br /> <br /> Consisting of eight episodes of about 90 minutes each (the beginning of each episode has a short and abstract black and white editing of the events of the previous chapter), Out 1 is no less watchable than any quality TV series, and could even be better experienced on a single episode at a time. This does not mean that it does not remain difficult even when viewed in segments. Like most Rivette films, he uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot, of sorts, and some of those early scenes (in particular the sequences describing the highly abstract "exercises" of the actors) seem endlessly long. These scenes are important, however, not only as an exploration of the methods of improvisation that interpret both a literal role and a metaphorical role in the film, but as a method to adapt the viewer to the somewhat languid rhythm of the film. Paradoxically, long films make films much longer tolerable for an audience, and this understanding of rhythm has led Rivette, along with more modern directors like Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, to create films with less commercial execution times that nevertheless maintain the ability to leave the audience spellbound. <br /> <br /> In a film that is in many ways of acting, the acting is fantastic. Many famous faces of Nouvelle Vague appear, including the aforementioned Léaud and Berto, the exceptional Michel Lonsdale and Rivette Bulle Ogier. Another legendary director in Eric Rohmer also has a great cameo as Balzac's professor who appears in a pivotal scene. The people and architecture of Paris c. 1971, however, seems to have an equally significant role: the landscapes of the city, the crowd scenes and the interested spectators get stuck in Out 1 in time, a document of a place at a point in history. <br /> <br /> After a little over 720 minutes, the film ends with an incredibly short and enigmatic note; however, the grueling journey that the viewer has undertaken is so full of possibilities, complexity and spontaneity, that he would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning, or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters. For those who have seen many types of cinema and think they have seen all that the art form has to offer, Out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be many other things and diverge in so many others directions than those permitted by current conventions. For filmmakers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something to love.
