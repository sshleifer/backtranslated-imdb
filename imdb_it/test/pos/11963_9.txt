In the 1980s, Savage Steve Holland made three films, two of which are classics of what appears to be a very small genre, the absurd teenage comedies. The third "How I Got Into College" is not up to "Better Off Dead" and this, mainly due to the lack of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (except for a small cameo). <br /> <br /> One Crazy Summer is an underrated movie, with lots of great features and gags. As I recall, Savage Steve's films were scorned as brain deaths at the time and after three films he slipped into children's TV. We could use more films than artists like him.
