I agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews. I saw it at Austin's South By Southwest Film Festival. Of the 20 films I saw, 7 were really good and this was the best for me. I suck for movies that have plot devices in which the characters go through transformations that totally change their lives. The excellent acting was mostly performed by people involved in TV, or it was their first film. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. This was his debut as a director. Jay's work is apparently a game administrator for many famous films. Forgiving the Franklins was a total pleasure and extremely fun in the spots. This is a movie where I would buy the DVD and watch it, a real complement to me. Well done, Jay, yes ... give up your day at work!
