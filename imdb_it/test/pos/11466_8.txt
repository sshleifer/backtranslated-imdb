The 80s were invaded by all those slasher-style horror movies HALLOWEEN / Friday THE 13TH, so this is a real relief. <br /> <br /> Ten incredibly annoying teenagers (would you like to go out with these jerks?!) decide to organize a Halloween party at a former local funeral called "Hull House". During a "past life" a demon is released randomly, and each person becomes possessed and kills others. <br /> <br /> Everything looks very MALE DEAD / DEMON-ish, but Tenney lends style to the process, there are good jokes, the music is excellent, the make-up of Steve Johnson's prosthesis is scary and Linnea Quigley is pretty funny as a crazy baby who spits his eyes with his fingers and does a fantastic new thing with a tube of lipstick! <br /> <br /> Great fun at a no-brainer level! After checking the breakdown of the votes and other published reviews, I don't understand how this one received only 4 out of 10 (?!) <br /> <br />, I gave it, 8 out of 10.
