As for the Christian film, it is typical. Upon mega-budgeting they try their best. Some times they are falling short, sometimes they hit the target. A combination of HP Lovecraft and Frank Peretti were a good idea. All we needed was a better story, and better character development to make it a fantastic movie. The images are not so bad, even intelligent ones that keep the demons up to the last minute help keep the suspense at a good pace. He could still use a better ending. It is not a bad premise that terrorist experiments go wrong. Much better than the typical Hollywood treatment of the demonic kingdom. Maybe someone will finally "This present darkness" like a movie.
