'In The Line Of Fire' tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former psychopathic government assassin. The secret service agent / bodyguard (Eastwood) is in defense and the murderer (Malkovich) is on the attack. The stakes? The president lives. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie ... I've seen it many times on TV and recently bought it on DVD. However, it is not an excellent film. The plot is too thin and attempts to thicken it are definitely ridiculous. The whole love story is not very plausible and the way they brought one more character into the story, just to be able to kill him is a sort of insult to the more or less intelligent viewer. Although I believe that these errors cannot be forgiven, I can safely look beyond them at Mr. Malkovich's exquisite performance. I've always considered him a great actor, but he's really on fire in this film. There is a reason why he received an Oscar nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were fine, but I don't think their performance was memorable. They are never at their maximum capacity. <br /> <br /> If you don't expect too much, you'll surely like this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is truly extraordinary and I don't think anyone can enjoy his performance. It's really worth watching ...
