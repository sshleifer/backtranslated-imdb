"Ahh ... I didn't order any very successful shows" ..... "We'll have one" Hack is simply the biggest TV show ever made. Some of me died when I launched t.v. on a Friday night to get some Hack and it wasn't on. The show focused on the main social issues of our culture. I discovered that at the end of each episode I watched; I left having been both entertained and informed. I'm actually more stupid now that Hack is gone. I don't want to help the needy and less fortunate anymore. Since Hack left, I see them as an eyesore and an unnecessary effort for tax payers. So for God's sake we have to bring back Hack!
