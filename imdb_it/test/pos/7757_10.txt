A 2006 online survey of Japan's top 100 favorite animated television series, conducted by TV Asahi, placed this series in fourth place. This tells you everything you need to know. So go look at it.;) I don't want to comment on the story, simply because I don't want to ruin anything. I just ask you to keep looking after seeing the first episode. The animation is really good and above the television average. The best thing about this series is that there is finally something new. I mean it's not revolutionary, but still offers a new idea and nice characters. You will not regret entering the world of Suzumiya Haruhi. <br /> <br /> and the best thing that a movie will come soon
