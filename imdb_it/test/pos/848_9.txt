Gene Roddenberry has never disappointed his fans. His death ended the legacy of science fiction that will never be matched. Earth: The Final Conflict was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 Seasons were well written and meticulously produced, but somewhere along the way Roddenberry's touch was lost. The loss of lead, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely damaged the series because it was a vital part of what worked. The story involves the human race visited by the Taelons, an extra-terrestrial race that calls itself "The Companions". After 3 years they gave the earth new technologies, useful information about the Universe and more. Many question their intentions here on Earth. The main link on Earth between the races is Da'an (Leni Parker) and for many, the most trusted Taelon. The questions arise: why am I here? what are their goals, is Daan aware of any suspected plots against humans? There is an underground group led by the millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen) who uses his millions to investigate the Taelons. By the end of the first season things are going well, Da'an seems reliable, Boone assists Porte in his investigation while working with Da'an and Taelon as a liaison. In the middle of the 2nd season things start to unravel and the once terrifying and fascinating series go down, mainly because Roddenberry was dead and wasn't around to guide the producers, whose wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry was producer. However, the first season remains intriguing and fun to watch.
