Spoilers ahead. <br /> 2001: at Space Odyssey it is undoubtedly the most challenging and successful film of the late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a movie you watch to be entertained or amused. Instead it offers you a feast of food for thought, images that remain in the mind's eye long after the film itself is finished. It is a film to meditate on. <br /> <br /> The film intentionally offers us more questions that can be answered, is made up of puzzles and mystifications, but still leaves the viewer with a sense of awe and reverence. (which is allowing itself to be engaged in the process of seeing it, the enjoyment of this film requires an effort on the part of the spectators) the questions it poses are large and threatening, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it is the last place in design cosmic and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. <br /> <br /> The first of the Four Quartets films offers us a distinct view of past species. We see our distant ancestors, half a human half monkey, in a state of near starvation. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are close to hunger. An extra-terrestrial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by its presence in the creation of tools and violence. They are transformed from day to day into carnevores, and when two tribes meet near a water source, the tribe that has developed the ability to build tools and belovedness profoundly destroys the neighboring tribe. The new leader of the winning tribe, enhanced by the first vestiges of technology, triumphantly throws the bone he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is torn by nuclear paranoia. The characteristics inspired by the appearance of the monument that once helped us survive threaten our very existence. <br /> <br /> Once again humanity is in crisis, once again the other-worldly presence represented by the black monolith will intervene to help humanity in the next step in its development. During an exploration of the Moon a monolith is discovered identical to the previous one we have seen. The governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications. A mission is organized. the monument was engaged in a sort of radio communication with Jupiter. Some men will travel to the transmission destination. Most of them will, for the most part, be kept in a state of suspended animation. The spaceship pilot will be HAL a super computer that has been programmed to imitate all human traits. <br /> <br /> The film has many exceptional sequences. As usual for Kubrick, the use of classical music is exceptional. The most memorable are "Blue Danube" and "Also Spake Zarathustra" (particularly appropriate given the theme of the film transcending ordinary consciousness). Also the cinematography is particularly excellent, after a single vision the last 30 minutes of the film will haunt you for the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> The character of HAL is the most important from the point of view of the central thesis of the film. By imitating all the characteristics of human beings, it also comes to have their negative traits. The paranoia that develops and that almost leads to the ruin of the mission is a faithful mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation to return to earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we want to proceed to the next phase of our evolution. <br /> <br /> Even the architecture of the film is significant. The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the film. The 2001 finale is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film takes a vision of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and in the James Joyce novel Finnegan's Wake. It proposes a model to human history and evolution that is cyclical, but progressive, repeating the same events at great intervals, but with the human race developing according to the will of a being with a greater purpose in mind. Even if we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, its destiny is great beyond its capacity to imagine. It continues to amaze me that despite this film many people continue to view Kubrick as a misanthrope. <br /> <br /> This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to a specific creed, but because of it is the invocation of wonder in the vast panorama of existence and its involvement with the deepest questions and vital to purpose and truth. <br /> <br /> In the hands of any other director, this would perhaps be a little too much. The vision of life in Hollywood is too small, usually to understand the magnitude and intensity of a vision like this. But Kubrick was a visionary, he directs with absolute security, not only that he can manage material of this type, but that he is the only one to do it. The process of making this film used all its creative resources. The collaboration written with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in the history of cinema. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the incredible climax of the film. The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence. <br /> 2001 is an absolutely unique cinema experience. Those who lose it do so at the expense of their intellectual and imaginative abilities.
