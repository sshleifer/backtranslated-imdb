I think this film is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is fun and the harmony between her and Glenn Ford is perfect. There is no boring moment in the film and Debbie is beautiful as always. <br /> <br /> The story is about a showgirl Maggie (Debbie Reynolds) who meets a penniless soldier Joe (Glenn Ford). She takes an instinct to dislike him, but after accidentally tears her dress, she returns it to her on condition that she goes on a date with him. They end up getting married the night they have their date after just one kiss. Joe and Maggie move to Spain and discover they have nothing in common but physical attraction, so Maggie proposes that for a month they live but not as a man and wife, which means Joe is not allowed to kiss or sleep with Maggie, with great frustration of Joe. A hilarious storyline and a wonderful movie. Not to be missed.
