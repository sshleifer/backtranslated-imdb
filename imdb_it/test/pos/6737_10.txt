I love this movie. The cast was exceptional in the portrayal of their various characters. Judith Ivey played a weak, frightening, dependent, passive aggressive man in his whining and self-involved character so well that it was a relief to see the metamorphosis of the character. Blythe Danner was equally attractive in her role as a judging Jewish mother, devoted wife and loving sister. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Dishy, ​​Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz have played their roles equally well. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that deal with difficult times without losing your sense of humor and hope, you will love this movie.
