I love the promised land. The first episode I saw was during my mission from 2003 to 2005. I really loved the rich family background represented in the show. Here was a family with their own struggles, but instead of dwelling on them; they would reach love with others who would have the same problems, in an attempt to forget themselves and go to work. This is what made me fall in love with the show. All the actors; in particular Gerald McRaney; he had demonstrated the true meaning of "Family" which left an indelible mark on my life. I have traveled the same path as they have, but it took me a long time to develop this type of character. I love this show so much, that I wanted to share it with friends; but I was really stunned when I heard that the air was removed. I thought and I still think they should BRING IT BACK! So many lives can benefit from the media inspired by the sky. I honestly believe that this show was divinely inspired; because it brings the spirit every time I see only one episode. This show actually (in my book) really defined what a "Promised Land" is. It is love that you hold in your heart for others; which takes you to a higher destination. The spirit of Love is one of the most powerful messages in this series, and all I can say is: bring it back. -Roberto
