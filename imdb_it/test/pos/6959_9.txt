I saw this film for the first time in a day of school sickness about ten years ago. Compared to the Lifetime movies made forever, it has become an instant albeit obscure favorite. I've seen it maybe twice since then. I think some parts are not tasty, maybe the plot could use a little more action. <br /> <br /> However, it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. Magic realism is on a par with that of Amelie and the heart of that of The Wonder Years. Despite the particular development of my tastes, I still find the subtle magic of this film, the lovely characters and its charming simplicity.
