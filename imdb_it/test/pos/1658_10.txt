To begin with, I did further research on the film. Firslty, Jules Dassin directed and starred in this extremely imaginative and different crime film. Secondly, this was a very low budget film, created in the Renaissance of the first moment of the film noir. Thirdly, the jewelers in which the robbery was attempted is a real jeweler. The producers of Rififi have asked them to film their own, surprisingly (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject), surprisingly, for some not very obvious reason, they were happy with the idea of ​​a detective film set in their shop <br /> <br /> The characters are impeccable and the plot integrates perfectly with the surrounding environment.To add my applause, I will say this: some might say that this was a typical Hollywood movie, on the contrary, this set the basis for the regular plot of a Hollywood crime film. <br /> <br /> Laslty, I would like to say that I support this new idea of ​​a movie in which not only a part wins, and that part I don't always have to be good at. For once, I can say that a film is not predictable! Ten stars!
