This film is excellent in the way it portrays the reality of sexual abuse. The daughters perfectly express their contrasting emotions of affection and betrayal. The on-site scenery is incredibly authentic and the soundtrack is discreet but moving. This film is a university level course in a reality that is too little recognized in American society. Personally, I'm scared of the names of the characters - the character of Lange is Ginny Cook Smith - my name is Connie Cook Smith, and my mother is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, which is my sister's name, and the father is Larry Cook, my cousin's name. But sexual abuse was not in our family.
