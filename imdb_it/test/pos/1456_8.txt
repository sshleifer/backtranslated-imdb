The man with a golden arm was one of the trio of great films in circulation at the same time as people talked about drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think of the three this is the best. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Otto Preminger had shot the thing in the real Chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film could have been even better. Who knows, maybe Preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for the position. It's the only flaw I find in the movie. Frank Sinatra is a heroin addict card dealer who was caught for covering his boss Robert Strauss when the game was searched. He took care while in prison and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. But a lot of people are conspiring against him. <br /> <br /> First Bob Strauss who wants it back, especially because a couple of top bettors are in town. Use some devious methods to get Sinatra's services back. Secondly, Darren McGavin is the local drug retailer who loves Sinatra and hooks up again as a customer. And finally Eleanor Parker, his partner who is doing a game of accounts to beat everyone, just to keep him around. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra got a nomination for best actor for this film, but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra could have won for this if he hadn't won for From Here to Eternity in the category of non-supporting actors some years ago and that Marty was a movie acclaimed that year. The scenes going through the retreat locked up in Kim Novak's apartment will leave you speechless. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker does not have enough credit for her role. It's really something like the crazy intriguing wife who wants Sinatra to tie her up regardless of the cost. If she had not been nominated the same year for Interrupted Melody, she could have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the highest point of his career. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin got his first real warning as the very serpentine drug peddler. His performance is guaranteed to make your skin crawl. <br /> <br /> Elmer Bernstein contributed with a great jazzy soundtrack to accentuate the general squalor of the squalid Chicago neighborhood where the characters live. It is not a place you would like your family to appear.
