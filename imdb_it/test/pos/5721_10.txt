John Leguizamo's one man performances are unmissable: Mambo Mouth showed his intense characterizations and timing but the material was average, even Spic-o-Rama made the first but this time the material was fun, Freak is a classic sequel from his disappointing Sex-o-holic. But his stuff in Freak shows off his genius and when he is in the spotlight he is unparalleled. <br /> <br /> Freak's semi-autobiographical look at a young man's journey has power and resonance. I don't even think that the creator known of Allowing us the chance to see his soul, Mr. Leguizamo gives us the opportunity to project our life on his and there can be no greater gift that an artist can give. The willingness to abandon "the Wall", expose and share is too terrifying for most actors - they use characters to hide behind - but JL is at full throttle and cheerfully breaks any claim. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best observers / comedians / cultural actors because they spoke from their heart of what they noticed in society and the truth offered sharp humor. Combine this with the gift of a great mimicry actor and being in-the-moment (not to mention the sense of humanity) and you will see that John Leguizamo has the power to do the same. At least in Freak, it does. <br /> <br /> From birth to its first major interruption and every life-changing moment, a spectator sees our guest and other characters in their most intimate moments as they experience the pain, hope and humor that is provided. Looking a little tired and muscular, JL is flooded with sweat at the end of the evening that offered his crazy life to an audience; The fluid work of Spike Lee's camera captures the actor's nuances to the last curl of his lips and slowly flashes. The scenarios range from drinking with his father (when he was 9) to machismo to see A Chorus Line with his deaf gay uncle; the fierce humiliation of his first girlfriend when she strips naked, eager to have sex. A first nightmare sexual encounter with a large German woman in the back of a Kentucky Fried Chicken follows an unsuccessful attempt to take a "drunk Catholic abandoned" in a bar on St.Patty's Day. Cycling in a serious showdown with his mother and his father, this is where he shows his true genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and he and his brother with such strong dramatic / humorous intensity, you forget that you are only looking at one person. There are no costume changes, ugly wigs, light or make-up tricks. Only an actor who gives everything. It's just great. <br /> <br /> Other actors / comedians emerging at the moment are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock, but they do not immerse themselves as deeply as John Leguizamo does; it is not a criticism, not for a long time. I love their work but Freak is different. It is moving in a no-b way *******. It's the best one man show out there and no one will be able to touch it for long.
