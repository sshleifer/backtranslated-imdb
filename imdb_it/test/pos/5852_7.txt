Sandra Bullock paints a credible picture like the detective in difficulty, even if seeing her as a cynical man-eating victim who became a persecutor, requires an act of faith (or two). The two restless and restless boys are adequately portrayed by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of trouble bringing Ben Chaplin into the equation (the same problem came up when I watched "The Truth About Cats & Dogs" (http://us.imdb.com/title / tt0117979 /) I mean, when you put an Englishman into an all-American movie, shouldn't there be at least one reason to put him there? "Shouldn't there be any dialogue indicating and explaining that rather obvious fact? Or even a few jokes about whether it's English? <br /> <br /> It looks out of place here, as it looked out of place in" The Truth About Cats & Dogs "Producers should really take note, distract and annoy the public (at least me). There's nothing wrong with Chaplin's acting, it's just a matter of making an actor who is" "out of place" is believable and not credible puts it somewhere without a good reason or plot. <br /> <br /> The film itself: well, thrillers, especially those who deal with it. To solve a complicated crime, it is necessary to suspend disbelief. This is no different; in reality it requires more effort than usual. To make Bullock smart enough to solve the case, despite all the pressures that force it to let go, some unrealistic assumptions have been made about the evidence, and I'm sure many people who saw it had a few moments of "Come on, it's highly unlikely in these circumstances "or even" hey, you can't brush off the evidence this way to end this movie! " <br /> <br /> Like I said: reasonably fun and watchable. Just don't use this as a required view for investigative exams. There are no shortcuts there.
