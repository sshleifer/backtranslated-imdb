After seeing "Waco: The Rules of Engagement" I was just sitting in disbelief of what I witnessed. A big FBI coverage, a massacre by gung-ho / triggers happy government agents? I clearly remember Waco's situation, I was 17 and I was looking at CNN. I remembered thinking about all the children watching the Mount Camel fence burn in April 1993. I remember being sorry for the children, but I clearly felt it was the fault of their evil leader David Koresh and the other Davidians. Gazecki's film clearly shows, without a shadow of a doubt, even if it is biased, that the FBI lied again and again. I think this film was a great contribution to the reopening of a new investigation into the incident in 1999. The outcome of this new investigation was somewhat predictable, the judgment was based on the fact that it was just as gray as the facts that the Davidians introduce yourself. I was very disappointed with the verdict, because as far as I know he didn't take into account all the lies, misinformation and evidence gathered by the FBI and other officials. Why shouldn't anyone be tried for obstructing the work of Texas Rangers investigators? Why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and demolish the complex shortly after the accident? These are questions that have not been answered by the government. Above all, what about children? In this new survey I was not informed about who was responsible for spraying CS flammable tear gas in a compound with many hazards for igniting this gas and I found no response to the fact that the children's muscles contract due to the gas effects while they were alive. If they did, I would surely think that Janet Reno or whoever was in charge of the raid should be indicted for mass murder or manslaughter. The question raised by Gazecki, but not mentioned, is; Was it a direct plan for managers and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building with intention? (a plan that would have been implemented with 112% effectiveness) or were the appointed officials so incompetent, that they were not aware of the consequences of their actions? Both are equally scary. Although the Davidians set fire to the complex, the officials in office certainly gave them the opportunity to do the job. If the officials in charge knew, as they claimed, that the Davidians would set fire to the complex, why the f? the tanks cut all the holes in the building making it a furnace and why didn't they have plans to deal with the fire they knew would occur? Obscure questions that still won't go away The final and most relevant issue of this film is the way the Davidians are demonized by the government through the media, which simply feeds it to the public. I clearly remember the resentment I felt about the bad Davidians I saw at CNN in 1993. Now that I'm older, I see a clear line of communication coming out of the government whenever they prepare for a massacre of civilians along with their intended goals. Demonize people with words like; "they have different illegal values ​​so we" "don't enjoy freedom" and "are a threat to our freedoms and lifestyle" makes them so much easier to kill ????
