The greatest period of cinema began in post-war Europe with the Italian neo-realist movement. During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, the French New Wavers captured everyone's attention, and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere, creating bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought the art form to the starting point, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work * Death in Venice *, which could also be called * The Death of Europoean Cinema *. After the end of the 1960s, so did the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This film seems absolutely a great summary, not only of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in the films. And don't worry, you won't find a master of homework more severe than the one Visconti has revealed here. People are not playing, people: either get behind and follow, or stay behind. Rhythm is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. The "accidents" are few and far between, but each one seems charged with symbolic meaning in a sturm-und-drang cosmos. <br /> <br /> We will probably never be in such a rarefied company, in terms of film: one of the greatest writers of the century who inspired the story (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest directors who directed him ( Visconti), one of the greatest actors in the main role (Dirk Bogarde), and almost incessantly swelling in the background, Gustav Mahler's 5th symphony. Making full use of Mahler's ability to inspire romanticism even in the most cynical bosom, Visconti changes the main character, Aschenbach, into a composer decrepit from his original character as a writer, even making Bogarde a LOOK like Mahler (geek, specific mustache matted, duck walk). Bogarde, among other things, offers what is probably the greatest interpretation of an actor in the history of cinema: it is a largely silent performance and the actor must deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a look - a difficult trick without attacking Chaplin or simply behaving like an animated corpse. <br /> <br /> Cinema is no better than this. I will ignore the complaints of Ritalin addicts that they say it's too slow, but even the most legitimate complaint about some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonist friend is out of place. Flashbacks are perfectly suited to the film's thematic concerns (ie, what is the best path to achieve aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), And the sudden and very acute interruption of these interruptions serves to prevent drowsiness among viewers . (Obviously, some viewers will still sleep through this film.) An uninterrupted flow of Mahler and dying Venice would be nothing but a beautiful image; but this film is about something. And what it mainly deals with is suffering: romantic suffering (capital R), in particular. Like a suffering romantic, Visconti knew who he was talking to. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. . . I guess) If nothing else, see * Death in Venice * for his wonderful opening titles. . . and for his unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's black hair dye dripping from his sweating, dying head and his chalk-colored face. Meanwhile, in the distance, the young Tadzio, object of Bogarde's dying desire, is in the ocean and points towards the horizon like a sculpture by Michelangelo. The climate sequence summarizes in an agonizing economy all that concerns the film: love, lust, beauty, loss, the end of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm and sunny beauty. * Death in Venice * is a miraculous work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: As with Visconti's masterpiece released simultaneously * The Damned *, I suggest you turn on English subtitles while watching this movie. It is apparently in English, but the sound of the DVD seems muddy and there is a lot of Italian spoken during the film, however. <br /> <br />
