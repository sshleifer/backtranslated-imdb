I just saw him at the Toronto International Film Festival in the beautiful Elgin Theater. I was amazed by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very complicated game and, last but not least, by the clever performance of Al Pacino, born to play this role, perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance by Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> The film cleverly explores the themes of love against loyalty, the law against justice and passion against reason. Some may argue that the content is inherently anti-Semitic, yet they should consider the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced way it is told in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
