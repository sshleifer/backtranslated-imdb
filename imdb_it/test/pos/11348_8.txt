Set in Hong Kong in 1962 (in turbulent times, as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed love story between two married people linked to their traditions manages to recall the essence of old Hollywood on stage after scene of color lush, evocative yet contained sensuality (as opposed to the required sexuality and occasional nude scenes that have become part of the norm of a romance in the film), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication . It is not difficult to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, as she is known for minimalism in the narrative and describes the powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters with a strong bond and the use of - acting scenes that could possibly take place in the lives of both characters. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATE CANTABILE, his pen is strongly visible here from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) to the last scenes that explain the intensity of regrets feeling while remembering the opportunity that was lost in reaffirming this relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot also resembles something Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Li-zhen, neighbors in an apartment while both are fairly successful professionals, begin to discover in the more mundane ways in which their spouses betray them, and discover quite naturally, is with one another. The question is: should they act on what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners? Each scene plays with the idea that at any time they will surrender each other, and at some point, it is suggested that in the end they do it anyway as intrusive as the camera is detailing their meetings (which seem to happen on a daily seen by the frequent changes of Cheung's clothes), we never see it. And just as not seeing any of their spouses increases their love story, not seeing them carry on with their attraction makes the eventual separation even more bitter because at any moment we want something to happen - a catalyst - and the only one what comes is when Leung reveals that he loves her, followed by his silent revelation that he will never leave her husband, which implies that he won't do it either. It also gives us a taste of what culture and timing can do: from a Western point of view, a fulfillment of their love story in a more solid and lasting affair would have been possible especially in the 1960s, but like Hong Kong, cultural values ​​are very different. <br /> <br /> The performances here are of a high standard: it is very easy to play a torrid love story, but playing continuously a repressed platonic relationship that is full of desire only barely suggested is difficult and makes all sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung burn and their damn chemistry lingers long after the credits have been launched.
