I think the film was really good. Subject, acting and music of Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan were wonderful. Although the director has managed to show the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of the male-dominated culture, he has somewhat neglected the character of Phoolan and focused more on the violence he faced.
