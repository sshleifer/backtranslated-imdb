Much better than expected A nice family coup - take it in replies. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti chews the landscape: he has much more talent than the role he deserves. A pleasure to see Inspector Uhl of "The Illusionist" exaggerate. The scenes of the blue men had my 11-year-old puppies. The cameos were especially fun for the parents: it was nice to see Lee Majors and Urkel (umm, Jaleel). It will be hard to think ten lines for this film, but let's listen to it for a film that promotes honesty between a child and his parents! Amanda Bynes does a great job when she becomes part of the sting. Normally I can't stand Frankie Muniz but he's fine here. An affectionate greeting to the casting director - if only to hire Giamatti!
