All-Monster Congregation in the final film of Universal's famous cycle of classic horror stories. Count Dracula (an intense, dapper John Carradine), who calls himself Baron Latos, comes from Dr. Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) who asks to be cured of his affliction. Of course, this is just a ploy. Then, by chance, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney), aka "The Wolf Man", shows up and obviously * wants * to be treated. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, monsters do not get the same time on the screen. The Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) is thrown away only for the purpose of including all universal monsters. Also here the repertories and the music of the library are reused. The film perhaps spends a little too long with the Dracula part of the story, although Carradine gives an impressive and non-hammy performance in the role of the Count. The film is primarily a showcase for Stevens, who goes through a tragic arc of his and does an excellent job. The women are wonderful, and I must say that I loved Jane Adams as the luminous nurse - who seems to be a hunchback. <br /> <br /> Of course, it would not be complete without the inclusion of angry villains. <br /> <br /> The chiller with competence and professionalism is, just for my taste, not really scary, but fun regardless. It's a respectable serial entry in general. <br /> <br /> 7/10
