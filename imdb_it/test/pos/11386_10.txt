Some time ago I saw this when HBO was showing it and from what I saw, it looked like a good movie. so today I'm at Blockbuster and I see it there with the DVD'S and decide what the hell. So I rent it. After finishing watching him I was shocked at how beautiful he was. <br /> <br /> This film has just touched my heart. Everything was so extraordinary. The stories, the actors, the dark humor, the MUSIC !!! Oh, don't let me start the music in this movie. PT Andderson is one of the greats. Definitely the best thing to get out of Quentin Tarantino (a god). After finishing the first vision I looked at it again with Anderson's comment (I was surprised by how cool he is.) <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in movies should watch this movie, if not has already done so. Anderson is obviously a movie lover. In the film he rips so many other director techniques. Like the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. Obviously robbed by "I Am Cuba". But I have no beef what ever with that. The film is very respectable with its repopulation. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who can deal with some of the movie's content (porn). <br /> <br /> 10/10
