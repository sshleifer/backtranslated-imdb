The Kid is a great family film about a late image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has a lot of money, a good job, a nice house, etc. The only problem is that he doesn't have as much social life as anyone looks like him, because he is not always very kind. But one day things are about to change when his eight-year version magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to sort things out. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and gives a really good performance. The Kid is a pleasant and touching film for everyone.
