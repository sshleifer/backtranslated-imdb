This television broadcast of the classic musical "Sweeney Todd" does not do justice to the production, but it is still quite compelling. <br /> <br /> First, the funniest aspect of this version is the production design, from the multi-wheel set the amazing hatch. So, the staging is excellent, up to the cut. <br /> <br /> The main failure here is in the performances that people give. Oh, they are credible, okay-- but it's quite frustrating when no one seems to hit their signals in time in such a hectic song like, for example, "Kiss Me". In fact, the actress who plays Johanna is not just off-time at a dismal degree, but also slightly off-key. And Angela Lansbury's slightly exaggerated cockney accent is a little irritating. Another thing ... what, exactly, is so bad for Judge Turpin's performance of "Johanna" that is banned from the American theater, but not the cannibal hymn "A Little Priest"? <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is an excellent production. It is a thrill to see people doing what they love - and I don't even talk about "meat pie with a touch".
