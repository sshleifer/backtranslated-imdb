Tia Carrere was the reason why I decided to watch this movie, because neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film ?? which goes to show, me and all, that a DVD should not be judged by its cover. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The film seemed to be around, not going anywhere for the moment ?? Paul Faber's embarrassment (Zak Orth) around the girls is almost too embarrassing to look at, and the fringe on the irresistible Kirsten Beck (like Alexondra Lee) is too girlish to look at. Where are they really fashionable in 1995? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Vicky Mueller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Boomer (Jason London) was tempting from the start! That first meeting on the lake ?? magical. What a beautiful coincidence they had to meet again just as he behaved like a complete moron ("Boomer, with two O's like a moron ??") in front of Alexondra. A pity that we, like the public, knew who Vicky Mueller really was. (Well, the title gave it away, don't you think?) <br /> <br /> What really surprised me was the acting. Especially in the scene where Vicky gives Todd a metal version of his alter ego (the dog character), in the little box of white jewels. Did the actors really manage to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss ?? point of no return for Todd and Vicky. A pity that the film ends up concentrating (after passing the leadership of Todd Fathers, Harvard), to get together with his friends. Can I imagine a completely new film ?? following Vicky in New York ?? there must be a good art university that Todd can attend?!? <br /> <br /> However, a film that does just what we want Hollywood: entertains us for the duration of the film. Has anyone else noticed that none of the loves is happy in this movie? Todd's mother is a bit crazy (on the phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), her dad doesn't find her attractive (anymore?) Is Todd's teacher obviously disenchanted with his wife and vice versa ?? Todd himself enters a wonderfully erotic and daring relationship that, however pleasant, would realistically be very difficult to maintain (age difference, maturity difference, etc.) and Alexondra and Zak do not meet because Alexondra is not mature enough to manage a relationship (-> his reactions towards the condom, the cheating, the progress of Zak etc. are all very immature and often imply to escape), and Zak himself, the poor boy ?? he's too much of a best friend / brother-boy to attract Alexondra too. <br /> <br /> Please, good movie though! I gave it an 8/10. Brilliant performance of the actors - who give life to the script.
