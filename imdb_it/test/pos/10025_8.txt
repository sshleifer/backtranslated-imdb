The rude charm of Errol Flynn really transpires in this fun and exciting, but historically biopic bankruptcy of the famous (and some would say infamous) general Custer, who follows his career from his first day at West Point, through the Civil War and westward at the battle at the Little Big Horn, all the while he heads with rival Arthur Kennedy and the romantic Olivia de Havilland. <br /> <br /> Some might say that Flynn, who offers a great, flamboyant interpretation as a general, is practically playing himself by playing Custer! <br /> <br /> A prodigious production (which should have been in Technicolor), well directed by Raoul Walsh, was performed with sequences of battles really well staged. Also, it's a real pleasure to see Anthony Quinn play Crazy Horse. <br /> <br /> The previous year, Flynn played Jeb Stuart alongside Ron Custer's George Custer on the Santa Fe Trail (also with de Havilland), another action-packed Warner Brothers production designed to make you fail the history lesson!
