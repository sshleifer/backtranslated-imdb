If they distributed prizes for the most depraved and messed up films in the world, Japanese cinema would be cleaned up: their exploitative cinema wiped out most of the other contenders, the most extreme examples were absolutely stunning exercises in bad taste, nauseating gore, bizarre strangeness and misogynistic sex. <br /> <br /> Guts of a Beauty is a striking example of such filth, offering the most demanding viewers only an hour of total debauchery and gratuitous violence seasoned with very crazy J-splatter of goodness. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a young woman named Yoshimi, whose search for her missing sister took her to the hands of an ugly yakuza, who proceeds to rape her and shoot them full of strong drugs called Angel Rain. After the gangsters have finished having fun with the poor woman, she manages to escape and flees to a nearby hospital where the sexy psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) tries to help. However, Yoshimi, upset and confused, ends up throwing himself from the roof of the hospital, turning into a watermelon while striking the ground (at least what it seemed to me!). <br /> <br /> Trying to avenge Yoshimi's death, Hiromi draws Higashi, a member of the yakuza, into his office, and, while he chases him away, hypnotizes him to attack his fellow gang members. After Higashi made himself happy with a knife in the yakuza's headquarters, he was severely beaten and stabbed, forced to tell about his meeting with Hiromi, and then hacked fish at it. <br /> <br /> The psychologist is then captured by the gang, subjected to a stain of forced sodomy (while simultaneously being forced to give the head to a yakuza slut), and injected with Angel Rain, after which she promptly the caresses. The gangsters then put his body in the trunk of their car, along with the remains of Higashi, ready for disposal. <br /> <br /> Before they can get rid of the corpses, however, the super dope has an unexpected effect on Hiromi: she returns from the dead like a hermaphrodite monster with a toothed penis and a ravenous gash, and, revenge for revenge, decides to kill a yakuza one by one; this leads to some memorable scenes of scandalously bloody splatters, including a messy head squish, a man suffocated by the dripping vagina of the monster, and a woman who is screwed to death by her gigantic shrill phallus. <br /> <br /> As you can probably tell from the synopsis above, this is a crazy stuff, ruined, and probably not for the sake of most healthy people, but for those extravagant ones who have long been tired of mainstream cinema and are already experts in Asian excess, Guts Of A Beauty should prove delightfully fun and deviant. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
