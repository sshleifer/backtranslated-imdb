With documentary films, the question of realism is always growing. How much of the film is real and how much is manipulated by the director? In PICCOLO DIETER HE NEEDS TO FLY, Herzog is too absorbed in telling the story of a man who tells his story to also address the question of realism against formalism. From the beginning, Herzog's role as narrator is obvious. Fortunately, he is a master storyteller. LITTLE DIETER is the most beautiful and engaging documentary I've ever seen. Dieter's story is compelling, and Herzog's reconstruction efforts, putting a strain on his story as he turned, are very effective. The story that Dieter says is real, but Herzog is always present, excruciatingly absurd comment from realism. This film is a must for all students of documentary films and / or Werner Herzog.
