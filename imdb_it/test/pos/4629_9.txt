Well ... What to say. <br /> <br /> I think I'll start with a confession. I cried 4 times in my life. once when my father died, twice because of a high school girl, and at the end of this movie. This film addresses the real problems of confrontation of 6 school-age children, forcing them rather uncomfortable all over the world. I've never seen a film that deals with human emotional condition. everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and I doubt that there are many people who are safe from the sting of familiarity with at least a couple of scenes. <br /> <br /> Start with a suicide. at 14:37. therefore, without letting you know who died, the story begins to be told from the beginning of the day. follows the lives of 6 school children until 14:37. interchangeably and modified with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers, it lets you know everything about their lives. their loves, hates, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false trust, self-hatred, corruption and arrogance. whose overall result is a sort of "whodunnit" that seeks to discover the identity of the suicide before it is revealed at the end of the film. without ruining anything I must let you know. don't feel cheated by the ending. contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now a warning. this film is definitely not for the faint of heart. Many people actually came out of the cinema halfway when I saw it. Disgusted by some of the content. Or maybe it's that sometimes it's hard to face the cold and hard reality of reality. This is what high school is for many people. I'm sure most would agree.
