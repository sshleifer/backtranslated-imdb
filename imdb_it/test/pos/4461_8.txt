"Do not Torture a Duckling" by Lucio Fulci paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of Sicily of a small city plagued by a series of brutal murders of young people. This surprisingly well-directed film (especially in comparison to Fulci's subsequent gorestions) is distinguished by the general atmosphere of perversity, malice and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. budding, the almost seduction of Bruno of the naked Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) must be seen to be believed. Highly recommended, especially paired with my other cult "House with the Windows That Laugh" (1976).
