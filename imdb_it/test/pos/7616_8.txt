I can't say I embrace it as a romantic comedy, as I find it a little funny about it. I found it appealing, fun, moving, and terminally sweet, and while there were some witty moments, I found them more bittersweet than an absolute comedy. <br /> <br /> I liked this. Barrymore has grown as much as an actress, and it's always wonderful to capture her on the big screen, but this also translates into the small screen. In fact, in subsequent visualizations, I like more and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of romantic comedy, then you might be a little discouraged by the lack of comic effect with this, but if you're in it for romance, it's definitely here to find. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 7.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
