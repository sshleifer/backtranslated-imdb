I saw some films by Fred Carpenter on Showtime, Pay Per View and video / DVD and enjoyed most of these films, especially with some beers, (Carpenter knows how to entertain) "EDDIE MONROE" and "ASSASSINO INNOCENZA" are my favorite. Recently I saw a promotional DVD of "EDDIE MONROE" and everything, from the cast to the plot and the director, worked without a hitch. (Doug Brown's soundtrack was sensational). I enjoyed seeing Frank Sivero ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "The Wedding Singer"), he is an extraordinary and very underrated actor. But I particularly liked the performance of Paul Vario, who played Uncle Benny, I searched for his acting credits for the IMDb and discovered that this was his first starring role. Where was this boy! Giving credit to Fred Carpenter for discovering Great New Talent, it's just a matter of time that you'll see this guy with Constantine and DeNiro. As I have already said Carpenter knows how to entertain and when you work on a limited budget it is incredible what Carpenter can Produce. (I read the VENT MAGAZINE interview and Carpenter never made a film for more than $ 400,000.00.) Before watching "EDDIE MONROE" I saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd" both great movies. "Eddie Monroe" led me to a surprising ending for a very good screenplay, good performances by the entire cast (Craig Morris is a movie star waiting to happen and lead actress Jessica Tsunis was exciting!) Great Cinematography, Direction and Doug Brown's musical score. As I stated that I recently saw "Rocky Balboa" and "The Good Shepherd", if I had to write a comment on those two films I would say some of the same things I said about "EDDIE MONROE", the only thing that those two excellent films don't have in common with "Eddie Monroe", they don't cost a few hundred dollars. Great movie and I didn't even drink a beer.
