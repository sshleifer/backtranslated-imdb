I try to be different in my watching the movie. I can enter "Pride and Prejudice" as easily as I deal with "Disappearing Acts". Love Jones is my all-time favorite, it's the standard by which I judge any modern urban romantic comedy. Shot very well, the shot of Nia and Darius riding Lakeshore Drive on the Motorcycle is one of the all-time Classic 3 second shots. Of course nobody will ever remember it. When it came out, I thought it would be a new paradigm for the Modern Urban Film making, good actors, no guns, and so on. The film industry has disappointed me to a certain extent, you'll have your occasional Drumline, or Roll Bounce, or Tyler Perry's "Why do I get Married". So whenever I need to see "my people" presented on the screen in a very professional and elegant way, I jump into Love Jones. There has never been the best film ever made for many people and opinions for it. But it's my personal best. My favorite sentence of Love Jones "Baby, I just want to come and talk !!"
