One of the most poetic narrative films ever made, WAGONMASTER is nevertheless a difficult film to appreciate immediately. I love this movie, but I recommend seeing some of the other John Ford westerns before taking a look at it. The first time I saw him I was 18 and I hadn't seen too many other westerns, and I hated him. I thought it was incredibly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen. It took me several years to love this photo. First of all, I fell in love with westerns in general - traditions, characters, landscapes, ways of talking, etc. - and this made me realize when I saw WAGONMASTER again that basically a lot happens. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I was simply a more experienced spectator at that point and had learned to appreciate visual storytelling and to listen to what each image was telling me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual film by one of the most visual directors working near the peak of his career. <br /> <br /> The film is a celebration of a lifestyle, and its subject is more emotional and inner than other Ford westerns. In reality, it is not as precise as saying that, rather, it has much less external action than other Westerners. (The other westerns have an external action and an inner emotion). It puts its Mormon pioneers fairly well in the context of nature. There are many shots of animals and children - not for surface, narrative purpose, but to illustrate this idea. This is why the film can be called a poem. This is not the superficial history (which barely exists) almost as much as an emotional idea, and this idea is received through composition, editing, sound and music. Indeed, it could be argued that this is a purer form of film production because the images directly express the film's emotional idea, rather than having to serve a "story" first. <br /> <br /> Give this film a chance and allow it to exist on its terms, not the terms of other westerns or other films.
