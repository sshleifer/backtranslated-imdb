The best movie so good it's ever been made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether dealing with everyday life or prostitution, I can always look at it for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy is the man. No one is worse. Watch Dolemite while he and his army of all-female kung fu killers knock down Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome storyline, eh? There are so many one-liners that more visualizations are needed to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple of lines from Dolemite, you're immediately strong. If you're in the mood for a laugh, rent this movie. Discover also The Human Tornado, Disco Godfather and Petey Wheatstraw the son-in-law of the devil. Now, can you dig? <br /> <br /> "You are not an excluded business, insecure, eating rat soup, motha !!"
