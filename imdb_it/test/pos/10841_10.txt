Andrew Davies' adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel was excellent. The characters of Nan and Kitty have been superbly interpreted by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes respectively. The whole series was a total joy to watch. It has captured everyone's imagination across the board, both heterosexual and gay. I wish there could be a sequel!
