The reason why this film is no longer known and appreciated for me seems because of its subject. Because of his controversial topic, this film has never been very successful and still remains rather unknown to this day. Not that it is a subject is now more controversial. <br /> <br /> Basically it's basically a film about a white man who makes friends with a black man. Friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic, but the way it is portrayed in this film makes everything very real. We see these different ethnic groups mingling together, as if it were completely normal. Unfortunately, of course, in those days nothing was considered normal. Seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend must have been a difficult thing to look at, for example, for some proportions of her 1957 audience. <br /> <br /> You can really understand because Sidney Poitier has always been and still is respected so much by Hollywood society and the black community in general. Of course it's one of the reasons he also received an Honorary Award at the Oscars in 2002. In his films he often fights against discrimination and prejudicial issues, of course with "In the Heat of the Night" as the best example of this. A true role model, which has certainly inspired many African-American actors, to date. But besides all this, he was also a great actor. Yes, he is still alive, but now he seems to have retired completely from the movies, since his last role was awarded in 2001. <br /> <br /> This film was Martin Ritt's directorial debut and it wasn't too much film to spend on his film. Studies were probably also a little reluctant mainly due to his concept and / or because it was Ritt's first film. Or maybe it was simply due to the fact that MGM was no longer that big and had left its best days behind. From the 1950s on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer he had a reputation for making films that were not too big and cheap, while in the early years he was really one of the biggest studios with lots of acclaimed stars and directors connected to it, who made many classic award winning films. Fortunately for them their reputation is beginning to change again and every time the MGM logo appears in a movie, people no longer expect a minor movie. <br /> <br /> However, even with his limited budget and limited resources they managed to make a great movie out of this. The film is very simple, with only a few characters and a simplistic plot. The film still manages to capture you with its story and its arguments, without ever starting to become a preacher or anything. It makes the film effective even with its subjects. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
