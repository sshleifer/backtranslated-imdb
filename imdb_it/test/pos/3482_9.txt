I don't usually comment on movies since I work in the film distribution industry, but I have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no tacky speeches or exploitation of disabled people to try to make this movie more "Hollywood". James McAvoy is an exceptional actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was also impressed by Steven Robertson. I can't believe this is his first real movie. Brenda Fricker has a small role, but as usual is exceptional. This is a movie for everyone to see how lucky we are. If you like waking up and the mask, you'll like this story. You owe it to yourself to check out this movie.
