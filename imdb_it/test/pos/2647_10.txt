begins with a view of the earth and Jupiter aligned. <br /> where we come from, and where we are going. <br /> <br /> the story begins with "the dawn of Man", a documentary vision of the prehistoric prairie-eating monkey that was facing its extinction due to no physical abilities that would allow him to hunt, and the lack of grass and water in southern Australia. the monkeys had not survived had it not been for the "godly" intervention of an alien artifact, which somehow transformed the apes that touched it, and gave them the opportunity to use tools, which were previously used as weapons that allowed them to kill pigs to eat for super and kill other monkeys fighting for water. that monkey was Man. an enigmatic beginning for an enigmatic film. <br /> <br /> after the fast forward that leaves the film today, we see a magnificent dance of spaceships at Strauss sound. The rest of the film talks about how the instruments have taken control of Man. The strange artifact appears once again to make Man evolve towards its final stage: the boot. <br /> <br /> to 1968, the year this film was released, only the astronauts had any idea what was out there in space. after this movie, it has changed. futurism took 7 years to explore. the special effects are incredible. they are completely realistic, even today. <br /> <br /> the direction, together with an excellent musical taste, acting and fantastic filmography, make it an epic. <br /> <br /> the plot, with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of the man tools, with an AI psycokiller, with a fine hypnotic psychodynamics, makes the journey our life. <br /> <br /> if you've never seen this movie, watch it. don't be afraid of lack of dialogue, sit back and have fun. it is a symphony of evolution. is fantastic.
