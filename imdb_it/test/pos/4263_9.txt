Jarl and Moodysson are part of a dying lineage of political filmmakers. The Swedish population should appreciate that they try to find out the truth when the government and the media actively distort and cover the events surrounding the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is utterly heartbreaking to see how these innocent children have been abused and drugged by the Swedish police and sentenced to jail time in political trials for sending text messages and taking revenge for other actions. The only unfortunate thing about this film is that it will not reach the masses in Sweden as it will only be shown in theaters and will not be published on video or broadcast on television. <br /> <br /> Political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and insights on complex issues and has a role to play as educator of the masses.
