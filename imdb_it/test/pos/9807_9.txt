You understood well! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend throughout the film, even at the beginning, as they traveled to California. His mother knew about Bobby and does not discourage Mike from Bobby because his imaginary friends are common with young children. <br /> <br /> That's why they both have stomachaches at the same time. That's why the boys were so close. <br /> <br /> Finally Mike was letting Bobby go. The "king" was arrested. Mike could go on without Bobby. It is also the reason why Mike's mother does not seem disturbed when Mike receives the postcard (Mike wrote and sent) from Bobby the Ol 'West tourist stop and other postcards from around the world. You noticed that Mike's mother turned over the top card and looked at the postmark. What a beautiful mother who did the best she could at the end of the sixties. <br /> <br /> A 9 out of 10 for me. Reported memories ...
