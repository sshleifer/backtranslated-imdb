Ok, if this film had been made much later in the history of cinema, it wouldn't be particularly useful. However, in 1898, the films were in their infancy and almost all were boring and did not have a real story to tell - instead of simply showing normal people doing everyday activities. If seen today, almost all of them are hopelessly boring and very, very short - often less than a minute! And so, in light of this, this short clip of a movie is pretty stuff and could make you laugh. Two boys, a miller and a chimney sweep collide with each other - falling and throwing flour and coal dust over one another while they struggle. IT'S EVERYTHING - the movie is finished before you know it.
