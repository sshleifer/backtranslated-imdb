As always, Joan Hickson is as wonderful as Jane M. Subtle, sharp and aware. I do not wish to dwell on his acting skills as they are praised enough on this site. I would like to criticize some of the smaller parts because the rest of the cast seems to have been chosen by director David Tucker. <br /> <br /> The performance of Liz Fraser as Mrs. Bent (the mother of the missing girl Nora) is a joy to watch. Subtle and deeply moving like the grieving and alcoholic mother who loves and desperately misses her daughter. A nice long shot of his monologue (thanks Tucker!) So it can be enjoyed to the fullest. I was moved when I first saw it when it was broadcast and I moved again, now I have it on DVD. Brava. <br /> <br /> Joanna Hole as Madge, the tour guide I find very entertaining. She is on the edge of over-acting but her role can have it. She is so funny as the overly organized guide who wants to do good with everyone on that bus, I find it exhilarating. His reaction after getting on all the buses is fantastic ... As always: to play the comedy you have to take it very seriously, and that's what Ms Hole does. <br /> <br /> I hope those two ladies have a good career (since I live in Holland, I don't know if they have it, not all theatrical productions can be published on Google ...) - their on-screen performance deserve it. <br /> <br /> Pieter
