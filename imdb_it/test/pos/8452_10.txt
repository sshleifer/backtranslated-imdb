I really enjoyed this movie when it was released for the first time, and I've seen it since then. The political drama is effective, if not particularly new or inspired. The decades that have passed since the release of the film have shown that the desire to cut costs to the detriment of public safety is certainly not something imagined by a screenwriter. <br /> <br /> However, I think the most impressive element of this film is the performance of Jack Lemmon. It is absolutely amazing to see him at work. He has the gift of being able to communicate so much, sometimes without saying a word. Next time you watch this movie, take a look at Jack's face sometimes he's not saying anything. He doesn't need to talk (or worse, mug mug) to let you know what's on his mind. <br /> <br /> I'm calling this spoiler, due to the impression it made on me when I started saw the movie: in the last scene of Lemmon in the film, while lying on the ground, he feels a slight vibration . The terror in his eyes is one of the scariest images I've seen in every movie. It's a perfect acting, because it instantly transmits the threat that is about to happen - if Jack's character is so terrified, there's certainly something terrible about to happen. And it does.
