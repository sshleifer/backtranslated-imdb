I just watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. During the movie I had the feeling of having seen a movie with a similar story before ... a movie with Ray Liotta but I can't remember much. Of course, this is much more dramatic, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> This is the story: Emilio's life becomes a lie that he can no longer sustain. After 20 years lying about his entire life to his wife, his son and all the people he knows, the truth is the hunt for him and there is no place to go. <br /> <br /> Watching Emilio's tricks is hilarious and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thing ... the relationship with a girl should have said something but it is not. Despite this, the film is still fun, exciting and engaging. Or it makes you want to help Emilio with his lies or help everyone else catch him. I liked the analogies, photography and good performances. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10.
