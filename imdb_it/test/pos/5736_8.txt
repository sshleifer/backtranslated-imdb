Six teenagers go to an abandoned and remote old school where 27 years ago there was a horrible massacre for a night of fun and jokes. Instead the children clash with the wicked security guard (excellently played with the terrifying and terrifying threat of the Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy) who committed the terrible killings. Director Carlos Gil tells the intriguing story at a lively pace and does an adept job of creating an irresistibly spooky and mysterious atmosphere. The witty script by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers an intelligent and inspired mix of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the imagination to the last. Fernando Arribas's refined cinematography makes expert use of light and shadow. Even the moody of David San Jose does the same. The attractive and attractive young cast contributes to lively and engaging performances, with the particularly praiseworthy turns of Carlos Fuentes in the role of leader Ramon, Olivia Molina in the panic Maria, Zoe Berriatua in the hateful panic Jordi and Carmen Morales in the role of goth Sandra. Murders are just as bloody and brutal as they should be. Even the terrible setback of a surprise dark ending. A solid and satisfying shock.
