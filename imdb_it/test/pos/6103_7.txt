(There are Spoilers) Walking down a lonely country road one rainy afternoon, Joanna Kndall, Margaret Colin, is distracted for a brief moment and runs to a little girl riding a bicycle on the roadside. By doing what she can to keep the young man at ease, Joanna goes to ask for help at a local service station. Before he can pronounce his name, Joanna hangs up the phone to go back to the girl and see if she's okay; it is then and there when the nightmare begins for Joanna. <br /> <br /> The harrowing drama that can affect any of us when you try to do the right thing, but is influenced by the words and feelings of those around you. Returning to the scene of the accident, Joanna sees that it is delimited by the traffic police. Before she can tell them what happened, and her involvement in it, Joanna starts thinking twice before handing herself over. <br /> <br /> What initially would have been a tragic accident turns out to be a success, and - with Joanna facing the time behind bars, if caught. Even worse, she has to live with herself in what she saw almost every day the family of the child who met Kelly Corey, Dallas Deremer, who attends the same school as her two daughters Mindy & Holly, Gretchen Esau and Kira Pretentious. Joanna's life begins to fade as she tries to keep the truth from her friends and family, not to mention the Eaton police, the one with which she was involved in little Kelly's accident. <br /> <br /> You can easily see how the words of his friends and neighbors and her husband Doug, Drew Phillbury, hit and run, hit Joanna. Those were the words that had prevented Joanna from admitting that it was not just for her own concern, but also for her two daughters and her husband. Feeling that they will be avoided by people they knew as friends and neighbors for years. <br /> <br /> Joanna on the verge of losing her mind tries to involve her friend Nancy Grayson, Sherry Hursey, in Kelly's accident, trying to plant her ears, which she lost in the Joanna house, at the place of the incident It is then that he realizes what he is doing and stops suddenly, preventing her from further worsening an already bad situation, not wanting to have Kelly's accident, but also his innocent freedom and reputation on his conscience . <br /> <br /> Margraet Colin gives an extraordinary performance with Joanna Kendall, guilty of guilt, and you can really try for her to see how she is eaten and not know exactly what to do. Wanting to first give the police a series of miscalculations, Joanna would have become a fugitive from the law. When he finally did Joanna he became the most hated and despised person of Eaton. <br /> <br /> Not being herself, when she is still at large, Joanna's husband begins to think she has returned to smoking or had an affair. Never in a million years Doug would have thought that Joanna was the person who ran down little Kelly and let her die on that rainy street! The expression on his face, with a trembling mouth, when he discovered the truth said it all. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes of the film took a lot out of you knowing what Joanna was going through, not to minimize the suffering of the injured Kelly Corey and her parents, and how she now has to face the music for what she has done and having to live with it for the rest of his life.
