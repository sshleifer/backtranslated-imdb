It is simply ridiculous how undervalued this film is. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's never late, it never slows down, it's a movie that has a wonderful flow in the plot. This along with brilliant writing makes this film fantastic. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti offer a bad-boy comedy, but Viju Khote and the aspiring Ajit are the best with their stunning intentions. If you want to laugh and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you won't regret it. Most Indian films tire me in the end, because they are 3 hours long. This film is just as long, but I wish there was more when it ends, because it's a fantastic film.
