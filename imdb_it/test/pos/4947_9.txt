Iron Eagle has always been one of my favorite movies for a long time now. It looks like Topgun but with a different plot and (many people disagree with me here) I think it's better than Topgun. <br /> <br /> This movie has some amazing aerial combat scenes when fighters are zooming through the air. It also has the Queen's song "One Vision" in the background, which in my opinion is a fantastic song. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Iron Eagle was very good, but the sequels were rubbish. <Br /> <br />
