It's one of the best movies I've seen this year! I do not agree with the person who said that it is boring. Sure, some people might find this movie not scary, but personally I had a great time. This film very well alternates sex scenes with scary scenes. There is also a nice touch of humor. For example, when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father, and then her husband says "how can someone abuse someone like you", and then try to attack her on the bed for sexual games: D Much funny ! I recommend this film to everyone and, by the way, I am sorry for my poor English (I am French).
