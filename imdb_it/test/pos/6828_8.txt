"Confirmed Dead" is an important episode in the series, as it introduces four new characters: the rescue team that Naomi contacted before receiving a knife behind Locke. However, as the quote in my one line summary says, their real purpose of being on the island could be something else. All the new characters appear intriguing (especially Miles, a sort of psychic / exorcist), but at this point it is still too early to make solid judgments. I heard that this episode was a slight step down from "The Beginning Of The End" (no flash forward this time, short-term flashback), but it still has its wonderful moments and takes steam near the end. *** out of 4.
