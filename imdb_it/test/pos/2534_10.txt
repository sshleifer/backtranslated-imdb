"Pixote" is the most powerful, shocking and moving film that comes from Brazil. It concerns the life of street kids in the streets of Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro, and focuses on a ten-year-old boy. The camera follows them in an almost documentary style: from the juvenile detention center (where most of the staff is as corrupt as the police) and back on the street, and never leaves the horrors of the city. Prostitution, drug use / use, corruption and murder are all witnesses of these young people; yet it is something to which they are painfully accustomed. Director Hector Babenco has used real street kids as actors, adding a brutal reality to the film. Although not for everyone, a film is highly recommended. An emotionally devastating film. <br /> <br />
