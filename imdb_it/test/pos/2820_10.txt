I don't usually deal with things like dark / psychological thrillers. However, SEIZING ME is really an extraordinary job. History, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are really quite complex and compelling. Rose accurately interprets the complexity and change of a psychologically disturbed woman. My partner was particularly impressed by the sophisticated way in which energy exchange problems were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we ended up leaving three quarters to "have tea" and felt compelled to take a shower. The plot was compelling but clearly we were not able to handle all the energy at once. (Digs in the hard and dirty side of people, but does not leave you there). I thought about characters and deeper meanings for a long time. I highly recommend this. Get ready for an experience you may not expect.
