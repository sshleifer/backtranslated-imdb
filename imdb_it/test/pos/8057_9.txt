To view the fictional biography "The Phenix City Story", I argue, is to enter fields where US filmmakers rarely ventured, director Phil Karlson got his job as director in "The Untouchables" television series largely based on of "Kansas" City Confidential "and this film; and it has become one of the most admired and most imitated films ever made. The rarest enterprise for US directors seems to be the intentional hero-oriented anti-crime film or TV series; I remind the viewer how the producers of "Cain's Hundred" and "Hardcastle and McCormick" and even "the Untouchables" "had to work to produce anything except episodes devoted largely to the unofficial activities of criminals rather than to those of their opponents ethical. This powerful, seminal and gritty film has a style all its own; and his lesson seems to be attention to details about opponents and victims of criminal organizations and members of their gangs. There is a prelude to the twelve-minute film, in which the journalist Clete Roberts interviews the true participants of the city of Alabama who fought against his gangs of corrupt deputies. The problem stemmed from the presence of Fort Benning across the river and from the almost secular existence of vice-bureaus in the area. The film describes in detail the return of John Patterson from Germany, where he was a prosecutor. His father, defeated by the attorney general of Alabama, refuses to join his quest for 14th street vicelords, despite several provocations including a beating of his son, vindicated by Patterson on his tormentor. There are several well-developed characters, including Ellie, who works at one of the clubs and her honest boyfriend, union leader, Patterson and John's wife, Ed Gage, Vicelords operatives and Zeke Ward, an honest man color victimized by his opposition to them. Harry Neumann's cinematography and Stanley Fleischer's art direction are in black and white and are very similar to news films, adding to the realistic power of the film. Harry Sukman's music contributes effectively to the film. The writer Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur have produced a fast and direct story that is divided into parts. The first part illustrates the Vicelords empire within one of their clubs, showing the fate of a victim who was beaten and then taken by the police in the pay of the Mob. In the second part, Albert Patterson refuses to oppose the leader of the Mob, the intelligent Rhett Tanner. In the third part, young Patterson returns and after several incidents, including his having to hit the head of the Mob to avenge his own beatings, he decides to run his father for the state Attorney General. His wife is horrified; and the Mob kills Zeke Ward's daughter and dumps the body at Patterson's house with a warning that his children will be the next. Some other of these incidents, including the loss of a trial in which the Pattersons show that the goon killed a friend of theirs who had found the car involved in the murder of the child, and looks at the investigation to declare the accidental death, convince Patterson running, and wins the nomination for the democratic state despite the Mob's state tactics, and is promptly murdered. John Patterson prevents a crowd of vigilantes from starting an open war with the 14th Street crowd and uses their voices to call the capital and demand martial law for Phenix City. The clubs are closed and the equipment is confiscated, but not before the girl inside is killed by the Mob's goiter, and Patterson must be stopped by Zeke Ward from killing Tanner instead of handing him over to the law. The ending of the drama is optimistic; but the prognosis for the city is less optimistic than painted; the crowd actually tried to return and then moved to Tennessee. In this well-made classic of anti-crime film production, Richard Kiley is young but very strong like Patterson, playing it without an accent. John Mcintyre as his father is very good, while Edward Andrews in the role of Boss Tanner is a caliber of caliber. Others in the cast include Kathryn Grant as the girl inside, Ellie, Jean Carson and Kathy Marlowe as the women of the Mob, John Larch as their madman, Biff McGuire as the young victim, James Edwards as Zeke Ward, Lenka Peterson as the wife of John, and some good characters actors like citizens and masters of the Mob. I suggest saying enough positive things about realism and the lack of attitude in this film; it's definitely one of Phil Karlson's best directorial efforts. Even Karlson did "The Scarface Mob" later he also did "Walking Tall". A sober and inspiring look at the ease with which complacent citizens of a democracy of public interest can consent to tyranny and how few honest men can teach them the need to fight for their rights.
