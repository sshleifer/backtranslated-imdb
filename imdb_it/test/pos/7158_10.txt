I saw Forgiving the Franklins in a Paramount screening and I loved it. I have to be honest. I didn't really want to go and I got pretty tired of the movies made today. a great story that I said I couldn't believe two guys who shot this and put it all together. I thought that if these guys can make a movie like this on this budget, they figure out what they could do with a lot of money behind them. And then I thought he was the tired guy that the studios would probably have done ... anyway. That said, thanks guys I got lost in your movie and that's why I go to the movies to forget the world for a couple of hours.
