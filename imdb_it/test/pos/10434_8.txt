The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies that I really enjoyed. The topic and the acting were well above the usual tripe that Hollywood was (and still is) afloat these days. But for a while, smaller studies were producing films about teenagers who weren't slaughtered or softened for children. The men who pulled the strings behind this production were your friends of Cannon. <br /> <br /> Three teenage friends are trying to lose their virginity while I'm still in high school. They will do anyone or anything to achieve their dream goal. The sensitive of the group (Andrew Monsoon) what it is to find the right girl while his two best friends will take everything they can get. One day, the boy finds his perfect girlfriend (Diane Franklin). But fate would play one of their foul tricks. Her best friend moves and drives her away. After dropping it, the sensitive child helps the girl to her feet and pays for her abortion. He still has feelings for her and tries to win his heart. Meanwhile his best friend has a violent fall for praying to his dream girl. Still, he does his best to convince her to love him. The night comes when he asks you the question. But his heart is shattered when he sees her dancing with his former best friend. In tears, the boy leaves the party. <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie is that it didn't punch. Instead of being full of fake situations, it was very realistic, honest and brutal. The film is full of funny moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this movie for fans of teenage comedies. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
