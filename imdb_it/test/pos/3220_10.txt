it's the best movie I've ever seen !!!!!! I simply love them !! I watch it every day! I have episodes from the internet! here in Romania the 6th season is broadcast! I am happy to have seen the show from the beginning and I'm glad that through the internet I can see the season 7. so far, season 5 is my favorite: D I like it because Logan appears and the scene in which they jump is mine preferred. I also liked Dean, but Logan is the best. I'd like Lorelai to stay with Christopher, because it's beautiful. this show is good for all ages and is worth seeing. I really want DVDs, but I think that here in Romania they will never appear, because I think they don't even know they have fans here. but no matter what, I'll watch it. goodbye!!
