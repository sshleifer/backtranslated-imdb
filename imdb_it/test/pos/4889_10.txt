I'm a junkie on the TV show, live shows and everything they do. And this was the last work they did on TV / movies like "The League of Gentlemen". <br /> <br /> If you love the series, you will love the movie. It's a nice ending for their TV series. <br /> <br /> It's smart and fun. <br /> <br /> Although not focused on some of the most popular characters, it's still nice to see all the characters together and with the writers. A must see for all fans of the League of Gentlemen. <br /> <br /> Watch it!
