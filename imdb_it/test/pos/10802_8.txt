Many American brains that adore and support the half political truths of beggars like Michael Moore would do well to sit in this movie more than once and see how hypnotic manipulators can scare, intimidate and lie to an underdeveloped audience and get people scared or hate killed, sharp and mutilated. Robespierre in this refined epic kills the opposition with the remote control, all in a fit of moralistic devotion to his principles. We had the impression that Robes felt quite justifiable to tear his opponent's head away, even when he sent his followers to eradicate false and deceptive accusations against the state. Today, the captains of our rotting media institutions are much more sensitive than Robes ... they just kill your character with insinuations and false accusations without foundation or sources. Witness Dan Rather's attempts to assassinate W's character on the eve of the 2004 election, or the constant drumming that the 2000 elections were stolen, although constitutional scholars continue to mock such irresponsibility.
