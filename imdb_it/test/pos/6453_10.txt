I thought I had witnessed all the wrinkles that the crime / gangster film had to offer, but the Garrett-Marcin-Hammett combination caused real thrills and surprises here, thanks to the inventive direction of Mamoulian, Lee Garmes' atmospheric photography , in addition to extremely sharp film editing and impeccable special effects. Even the brilliant acting helps. Coop offers one of his most convincing interpretations as the reticent lout with no boots (the kind of character progression that he would have had to repeat in other roles like Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (pictured in the center) in her first major role is also a revelation. The presidents receive great support from Paul Lukas, Wynne Gibson and Stanley Fields as the heavy men, and even from the nail-hard detective of Robert Homans. The film was obviously built on a large budget that is brilliantly deployed in its realistic and crowded sets.
