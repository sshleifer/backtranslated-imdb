As much as I hate not agreeing with the original poster, I found Asterix and the Vikings pretty good, and a huge step forward compared to previous attempts to animate everyone's favorite Gaul. <br /> <br /> For someone who is not familiar with the famous comic book series, the show would be difficult to follow, but for those of us who know, it's a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is far superior to the previous comic adaptations. You can say that they took the time and effort to really regain the look of the comics this time. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the film and I can see how the fans of those titles might feel confused or a little disappointed, but I was so taken by seeing one of my comics Preferred childhood represented faithfully on the screen, any writer I had was less than the comparison. Minor spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> Asterix and his faithful friend Obelix travel north to save the grandson of their village chief, who was captured by the Vikings. The Vikings think that by teaching them fear, the child will be able to fly, thanks to some poorly formulated advice from the druid of their village. In the process, the boy meets his daughter Abba of the Viking chief and they fall in love, etc. etc. etc. If my explanation seems complicated, don't worry .. The plot is easy to follow! Definitely a great buy .. You can buy this DVD through Amazon France, but be careful. Your DVD player probably won't be able to play it. I had to change the region setting on my computer to see it ..
