The fire gives everything ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most masterful meditations on the art of cinema. Set in 19th-century Korea, it tells the story of the famous painter Ohwon, but rather than sticking to an impertinent anecdote, melodrama or psychological egg hunt, he portrays a series of episodes throughout his life, all of which are works of wonderful art. He does not give any interpretation of these episodes, but leaves them for the viewer to reflect together with the paintings of Ohwon himself. In this way, the viewer enters the same type of contemplation as Ohwon, and the less his talent can "feel" his own way in the inspiration of his paintings. <br /> <br /> Part of why this is so effective is the masterly evocation of 19th century Korea and the artistic / musical world in which Ohwon moved. There are so many beautiful shots of the world outside of the paintings that we get a mirror effect where we see the wonderful world inspire Ohwon, Ohwon who lives and looks in that world, and the works of art he creates, are mirrored in the l 'other. <br /> <br /> The story is told with extreme economy. An evoked feeling has almost never lingered or explained, it appears only quickly and then disappears because the next one appears. As an analogy it is a sort of Mozart work of art (infinite and rapid succession of great ideas) rather than of Beethovinian (Obsessive lingering on a great idea). It has a classical moderation, very similar to Ohwon's paintings. There is really no music to suggest how to try except for some classic Korean pieces used with great effectiveness in different scenes (and mostly interpreted by characters from the film). A disturbing image, if I remember correctly, is of a flock of birds flying over the blue mountains while a singer chanting <br /> <br /> "This life is like a dream, and only death will awaken us" <br /> <br /> A significant piece of advice in the film, from one of Ohwon's teachers, is that "the painting is between the lines". The film follows that attitude since there is so much matter * between * what is said and described in the film. I saw it twice and it was very gratifying to the second vision. A very torn film, with little explanation on the explanation, one could see how it is the 96th film of Im. It is an artistic masterpiece. As the great friend and mentor of Ohwon tells him in describing one of his paintings, "Not a single blow is wasted". <br /> <br /> I compare it to Andrei Rubylev in terms of quality, even if in style it is very different. It's much easier and more directly fun to look at, but classic in the way Andrei is Gothic. <br /> <br /> All in all highly recommended to almost everyone except appetite junkies. Both times I left the film I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. <br /> <br /> A point of the intruding life of Ohwon is that his crazy drinking and his delirium started suddenly after visiting the noble who told him that "Good art can only come from the big knowledge and learning ". The next short scene Ohwon was very angry, and the next drunk bomb as often remained for the rest of the film. I am curious to know why the words of the nobles struck him so much and drove him to the drink that dominated the rest of his life. Or was it just a coincidence?
