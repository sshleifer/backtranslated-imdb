Gen-Y cops ... since I heard about the upcoming movie, I wanted to see it because I loved Gen-X cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse didn't come back and B) too much slapstick. However, I liked the sequel because it may not be as good as the first movie, but it's good in its own way. <br /> <br /> Stephen Fung returns as the ultracool Lord Match, who has a constant girlfriend in Oli (NOTE: Where's Haze?) and Sam Lee returns as the crazy Alien (this time he sports a mohawk and he speaks a lot of English !!!! The real star of the film is the newcomer Edison Chen. Makes a great substitute for Nicholas Tse as ... Edison. I also liked Agent Paul Curtis' performance of Paul Rudd ... he seems to be the hard one as a nail, clever FBI agent that you would like to hate ... but soon, you would like his character. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are much better in this ... although there are very few, but they are great, courtesy of stuntman Jackie Chan Nicky Li. <br /> <br /> Look for a Ron Smoorenburg cameo as a caged fighter who has a small fight with Match. Smoorenburg is also the stand-in for Rudd. <br /> <br /> If you liked the GEN-X COPS ... you'll love GEN-Y COPS !!!
