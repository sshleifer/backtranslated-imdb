Gilmore Girls is my favorite TV show of all time. they only aired the first 2 seasons in India, but I saw the rest on DVD or read online. it is very pleasant to find a show in which the protagonist does not sneak around the mother but has an open relationship with her. the chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel who plays Lorelai and her daughter Rory is really great. all the acting is excellent and the characters, although extremely extravagant, are still credible. the inhabitants of the empty stars show all the funny bizarre of the life of a small city, which is contrasted by the infinite snobbishness and the social norms that make up the life of the high society of Lorelai's parents. on one side there are dance and fire festivals, while on the hand there are cotillons, DAR meetings and cocktail parties. the whole character develops a lot and there is a happy ending for more or less everyone. there are dramatic elements but also a lot of witty humor. Rory's boyfriends are all incredibly sexy like those of her friend Lane. after all, it's a fun, entertaining and very satisfying show that includes all aspects of life and gives you the feeling that if you work hard and wait patiently, you'll get what you want even if it's not what you mean.
