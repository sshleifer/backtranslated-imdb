Treading Water is a very beautiful film. I would put it right under the wonderful short film: Thing beautiful by Fiona MacKenzie. It is not just a question of going out, but also of tolerance and acceptance in general. I look forward to seeing more of Laurel Himmel's works in the future. The actors, Angie Redman and Nina Landey are pretty good. The relationship between the main characters may have been strengthened a bit, as we understand that there is a very strong bond between them, but perhaps this could have been explained a little. I am surprised that Angie Redman does not appear much in other films. A great first step as a director for Laurel Himmel, I'm sure there is still a lot to see from her skills.
