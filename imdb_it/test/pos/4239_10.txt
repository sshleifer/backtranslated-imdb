GREAT FILM! Chucky is by far the most entertaining character in a movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Well before Chucky died, Tiffany and he were together. But like ten years later, Tiffany resumes Chucky (like a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a great movie! Scary and definitely fun (just because Chucky!) 10/10
