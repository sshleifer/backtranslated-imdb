I was speechless when I saw "The best years of our life". The acting, the script and the direction of Maestro William Wyler (winner of the best director in 1946) is Brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film is about the veterans of the third world war who return home together on a plane and all by chance live in the same city. They are all reunited with their families. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar role) must adapt to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and to children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) it's different from before he left for war. <br /> <br /> The second man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in an excellent role) must find a good job and adapt to a wife he was married only 20 days before leaving for the war. Begin to discover that she is not the same thing. <br /> <br /> The third man has a much more difficult adaptation to do. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his excellent role as oscar) He lost his hands in the war and must face the reactions of his family and of the boyfriend 'Wilma's (played by Cathy O'Donnell) to the hooks he has instead of his hands . All these men and their families are brought together in the film in different scences. The stories of these men are all beautifully woven together. <br /> <br /> This film truly defines the meaning of a "Classic". This unforgettable film (winner of the best photo of 1946) is a film that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If asked to choose a favorite movie, I would choose this one. <br /> <br /> On 10 I would give "The best years of our life" to 11. <br /> <br /> So the next time you rent a movie rent this you won't regret it.
