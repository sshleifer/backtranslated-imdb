There was nothing else on TV yesterday afternoon, so I thought "okay, let's look at this". I didn't know the plot and I didn't have any expectations, I thought that in a few minutes I would have channeled the surf again. But then the story began to unfold, and the characters played the two boys beautifully. The story had unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a really good movie. Very well worth watching.
