S. Epatha Merkerson shines as a nanny in this touching and vibrant look on the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) as he grew up under the tutelage of Nanny. The film offers a good study of the characters of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture the ups and downs of life in a realistic way unlike so many memories that have been turned into films. The supporting cast adds a lot of spark and many recognizable faces appear in minor roles such as Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig. It loses some steam and vitality towards the end, and the final sequence leaves a bittersweet sensation. But overall, a great movie with a truly exceptional performance by Merkerson.
