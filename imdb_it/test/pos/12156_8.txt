"More", perhaps, is largely remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by Pink Floyd - in 1969 they were not yet superstars. Actually they made an album with the music of the movie, no fan can lose it! <br /> <br /> But this is also the first film by the French-German director Barbet Schroeder: it is a cult film. When he was released, censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs. It is also one of the first films to deal explicitly with the issue of drug slavery. <br /> <br /> A German boy goes to Paris and meets an American girl: they fall in love. Together they look for the sun and exoticism. But it is a love that is too expensive: it starts with drugs. <br /> <br /> In the sixties the anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there was not much information. On the contrary, in many drug-taking environments it was a kind of spiritual experience ... So it's quite surprising to see a movie of that period describing a nightmare hero experience. <br /> <br /> The film is simple, not at all vulgar and filmed in a "cinema-truth" style. The actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Gr√ºnberg are very convincing. "More" is a document from the late 1960s and also a document on the end of hippy illusions.
