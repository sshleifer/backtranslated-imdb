Another "oldie but goody" from around the same time as "Out of Towners" is "Cactus Flower", with a very talented cast: Goldie Hawn, in her first film appearance (pre-lifting), Ingrid Bergmann in one of the his last and the always funny Walter Matthau. The story is about a dentist who pretends to be married to have an excuse not to marry his girlfriend, leading to the need to invent a fictitious wife as proof. He encourages his receptionist zitella (Bergman) to take the role, leading to multiple comedic disasters and surprising romantic turns. It is in the same vein as the Doris Day / Rock Hunter comedies. Fans of those - as they are - will love this movie; if not, don't worry.
