I will put it as clearly as possible for those of you unaware of Bill Hicks' legacy. He was simply the greatest stand-up comedian in the world, almost certainly in my opinion the greatest that ever existed (his idol was the great Richard Pryor, whose battles with addiction were in parallel). His death in 1994 barely passed in the popular media, arriving a few weeks after Kurt Cobain's suicide. His tragic death at such a young age eclipses any sense of injustice that was criminally ignored during his life, of course. But the harsh truth is as clear as day: no one came forward to claim his mantle. There is not a stand-up comedian alive with almost skill and invention. <br /> <br /> The observation is made in the affectionate tribute "It's just a ride" that the stand-up comedians often see work as a step from the stone to the richest research - lame films and morally driven sitcoms, made to occupy - but never enrich - the lives of an audience without imagination. It's all against which Bill Hicks spoke. His sermon has always been a battle cry for people who think alone, to control authority, to come together in one race. <br /> <br /> His appeal continues to grow over the years since his death. His star will continue to shine long after many minor lights have gone out. Once you have been exposed to his brilliant, intelligent but ultimately compassionate production, you will be enriched and rewarded. <br /> <br /> The man himself loved to quote Dylan: "To live outside the law you have to be honest," he said. Bill Hicks was honest, beyond what was the most fun of them all .
