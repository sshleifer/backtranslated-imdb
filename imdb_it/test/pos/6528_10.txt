I love Aaron Carter but I also expected the pop star to be predictable, but I was so wrong! Aaron Carter was really fun and a great actor! The actress who played Jane was also a brilliant actress! Everyone who didn't look at him loved it! <br /> <br /> Even the music contained was really good! <br /> <br /> My favorite lines in the movie are "you can't send me to a public school mom! Im a CELEBRIDEE !!" and "Take your time, you'll come to you!" <br /> <br /> Even if the type of cheese is finished, all the good flea films do! This movie is fantastic, and a good Chick movie, which I can watch over and over again!
