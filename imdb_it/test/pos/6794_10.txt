This film is ageless and would probably appeal to today's children, even if there is no Jedi in the whole affair. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful daughter in the world and her acting is also fantastic. Even Mickey Rooney is good; as well as Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury. The world was a different place when this film was released, and it's certainly a nice place to visit.
