Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist: the Music Hall ... I know what it is and what is not associated with the New York office. Theodore of the film is just the "Music Hall". There are no Rockettes in the film. Only fantastic ice skaters as well as fantastic actors and fun. I thought you'd like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You'll never guess who the 'killer' is while watching this movie ... until the end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating. We no longer see that kind of performance. The Roxy Theater and the Center Theaters, in the city of New York, exhibited on the stage ice skating performances!
