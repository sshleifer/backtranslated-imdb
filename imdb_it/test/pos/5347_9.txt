Fantastic, fast, satirical! Americans do 'zany', but the British do 'wit' - and love to fool themselves (ahem: unattractive teeth, big lips / nose, 'veddy' common or 'veddy' snob, obsession with 'gahden' ). Inside the jokes for older people in the audience, a lot of action for children. Subtle use of devices from other classic films (look for "Back to the future", "Indiana Jones ..", "Harvey", "Tremors" .. and more). Furthermore, an elegant buddy film (Gromit is a quiet but resourceful companion). Add brilliant vocal works by Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (is it? The best acting these days is being done in animation?) - Have fun! I saw him with his grandchildren. fun time for everyone. - canuckteach
