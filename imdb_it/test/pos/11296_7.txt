I just took this in a decent DVD version if not great for a dollar at Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> Sold out and buy it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure this version is the short, incomplete version released against the animators' wishes towards the end of the fifties, but even so, in one penny it's an * incredible * deal. <br /> <br /> This film was syndicated in small pieces like a series of local versions The television stations in the early 1960s for children's shows that almost all the stations took place on weekday afternoons at that time - "Mr Bill and Bozo", "Monty's Gang" (Channel 4, Greenville SC) and "Captain Grady" (channel 13, Asheville NC - which is where I saw it). He made such an impression on my twelve year old that I immediately recognized him when I noticed him at Wal Mart tonight and grabbed him. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You should take it.
