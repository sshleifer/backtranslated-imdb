It's nice to see a new series of puppets that create havoc in this series. I found this chapter a lot of fun. In fact, it would probably be my second favorite of the series. This film has very little violence and is evaluated only as PG-13. This is noticeably different from other R-rated puppet films that have been loaded with cold blood and violent chaos. The lack of violence does not diminish the fun though. This film also has considerably better special effects than the last film in this series. Good.
