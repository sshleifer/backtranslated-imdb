Seeing Gary Busey in a G-rated movie was the first and the best. I don't know much about the director, but he obviously knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them. Where does Jillian Clare come from? My kids love it! The only thing I remember that Christopher Atkins was doing was Blue Lagoon. Disney needs to see this movie and put it to work. The wife thinks he's very nice. I liked what he did with his character. He seemed so real. What we liked most was the message that this film sends. Greed sucks and faith, love and family win! This is the first low-budget DVD we have purchased and with a lot of material. The producers did this for the kids and the kids loved it. They enjoyed the music and all the extras on the DVD. Probably the director will not stick to family films, but I hope he does, because he really knows how to get the most out of children, animals and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was great and seeing Gary Busey behaving like a dog was even more fun. There wasn't much we didn't like about this. It's hard to find a family movie without all the raw humor, and Quigley was a pleasant surprise.
