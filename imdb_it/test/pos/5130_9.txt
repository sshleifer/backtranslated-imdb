Hoot is a nice simple movie with a simple message. It seemed that this film was for small children, but I know that adults will like this movie. The plot is pretty simple. A child who has moved to Florida must help a soccer jockey and an outcast save the owls that hide from building a pancake house. The message in this film is great especially for activists and animal lovers. The message is to do everything possible to save endangered animals. The acting in this film is decent. All three children seemed to have good chemistry. The music is not too shabby. I liked the Jimmy Buffet songs in this movie. Overall this is a good family movie. I consider this film a 9/10.
