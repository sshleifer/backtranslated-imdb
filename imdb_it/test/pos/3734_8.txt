Hey look, don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you're particularly feminine and you've always had a weakness for Richard Gere; this movie is right in your way. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have chemistry on the screen that dates back to the past. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not an Oscar-winning film and it will probably be forgotten sooner or later but if you want a love story set in a charming atmosphere between MIDDLE AGED good-looking people (they don't turn your stomach and also when Gere is "on top", it doesn't seem too exaggerated), then this is the film for you. I loved the theme of the story and it was quite relevant in many ways. Obviously everything was presented in a superficial way, overlooked and not really addressed ... I mean, I would have liked to know more about the father / son relationship between Gere and James Franco, but the story was really about the idea that a big love can CHANGE for the better; whether it's a lover, a child, a friend, etc. The theme of the film is about love and its mysterious ways. I was a little surprised that James Franco took such a small part in this film, but it's always good even for a few minutes. I really enjoyed this movie because it was moving and sweet.
