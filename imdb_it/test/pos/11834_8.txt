"In Love and War" is a simple wellness TV movie, and should be seen as such. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> It is the story of a second world war British soldier, Newby, captured with his command by the Italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. While the Italians surrender to the allies, the command is released and tries to escape. However, the Germans arrive and the command is again captured. Only Newby, wounded, remains at liberty. The rest of the film tells of how it is hidden and protected by the partisans and of its survival. <br /> <br /> (End spoiler) <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, "In Love and War" is a pleasantly simple film. Half comedy, half love story, the story is simple and unmistakable. The "atmosphere" is warm and sunny, and the various stereotypes (desperately disorganized or romantic Italians, severe-looking Germans and phlegmatic and pragmatic Englishmen), though not original, are still humorous. Nicola Piovani's soundtrack also adds to the Mediterranean flavor. <br /> <br /> Although it is anything but a "Tea With Mussolini" or a "La Vita E Bella", "In Love and War" is a simple sweet film that will put a smile, and maybe even a little tan on your face.
