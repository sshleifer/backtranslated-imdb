The producers of this image are Hungarian. The artistic moment that X and Z are capitalized in the titles is not to go crazy considering that the word "isten" means "god" in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian ... - Hum ... Is that so? <br /> <br /> We consider this film as a science fiction brother of "A History Of Violence". Both films share the strength to make their genres explode; thriller and drama in 2005 is no science fiction sci-fi in what we are watching right now. Everything he has has a meaning and is surrounded by details: the nod to Phil K. Dick (who wrote "In The Days of Perky Pat") creating a fast food restaurant "Perky Pat". The mention of Stanley Kubrick using the 2001 naming model; when IBM became HAL (a letter down in the alphabet) in the 1968 film, in the classic eXistenZ lubricating spray WD-40 becomes XE-60 (a letter above) when Allegra cleans Pikul's door. The nod to David Cronenberg using the witty type of Videodrome formula ('Death to ...' and 'Long Live' ..) and taking another medium for the central theme of an image (TV in Videodrome, Video games and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983, you entered a television, in 1999 you entered a game, welcome to Canada! <br /> <br /> The nod of good taste with Peter Suschitzky's cinematography, the music of Howard Shore and Ronald The editing of Sanders (a team that wins). For all those born in the early 80s with a super famicom, genesis or an arcade stick in their hands, this movie rings a bell. plot? "Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the role of game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual reality game that draws the minds of the players" as we can see on the main details page of the film. This is the story of the story. For me, this image speaks of a young couple of "demonstrators of reality" c he infiltrates the "new virtual game" presentation session to destroy his programmer. I suppose what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if something like reality exists. Jennifer Jason Leigh always plays a game designer in the game she is in and the end of the film. It is reality, with the fans of giggling video games, the big furry dogs, the "realistic Cronenbergy" plastic textures (helmets and stuff) and the 9 mm guns. What you see is true. It sounds transcendent for an hour or so (in this game, there is a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays the brilliant eXistenZ programmer and Jude -Pikul - a marketing apprentice associated with the game of Allegra), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very worried about the health of her pod (the thing in which you connect your nervous system, to play), she must connect and Pikul onwards wins the game (Transcendenz) and again in reality they kill Yevgeny Nourish, TranscendenZ programmer. <br /> <br /> Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ means facing your essence, facing your subconscious while creating a virtual reality that you will have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (playing the game, the girl who plays Allegra, the demonstrator of reality 'turns into Allegra, a' goddess of virtuality '. <br /> <br /> Which game would Heidegger play in his abstract term da-sein? To be truly engaged in the world? <br /> <br /> And what to say about Nietschze (Yes, Friedrich, God is dead and you know what? Willem Dafoe represents him! - God, the Mechanic -) ??? <br /> <br /> Yes, we build a narrative for ourselves and losing this discussion that we follow from one day to the next disintegrate people as personalities, eXistenZ discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who has really involved it. have beautiful things, a perception of virtuality in vi rtuality in reality.
