Like the 5 years protagonists of his latest work, "Ponyo" by Hayao Miyazaki enchants with his unbridled innocence as if the anime-meister had become a child himself in weaving a narrative that savors in its simplicity and emits a contagious charm in the process . Miyazaki, recalling his previous works, paints a brightly colored world, obviously oriented to the younger public, and the raw effervescence blithely strips the thematic elements that distinguish his immediate predecessors. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (nicely voiced by Yuria Nara), a fish with the face of a young girl (which makes her look like a loving child in a pink-coated Halloween costume), escapes from her underwater home and from his sibling school to explore the surface. Stranded on the ground, it is rescued by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year-old who, together with his mother Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi), resides in a house on the nearby cliff. This initial encounter and, ultimately, friendship, has a profound effect on Ponyo who now wishes to become human, but becoming so inadvertently relies on the balance of nature and unleashes a vortex on earth. With the help of Sosuke, Ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and become completely human. <br /> <br /> Although the plot does not have the philosophical refinement of, for example, its recent "Spirited Away", "Ponyo" is nothing less than a surprising sequel, characterized by extreme attention to detail and from a masterful balance between the real and the fantastic, and between simple joys and great fears. It is a simple story that, although sometimes blocked by its tendency to ramble like a child, remains in tune with its young pedigree to magically fascinate. "I'll protect you," Sosuke says to Ponyo concisely, a childlike statement not unlike the way Miyazaki endows his story with an artistic spirit.
