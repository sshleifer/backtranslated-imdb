I use "Princess Raccoon" (to give the film an inaccurate English title) as a litmus test for my friends' sense of humor. Either he leaves them cold and bewildered - as many other commentators on this site clearly have done - or results in doubled laughter, unmistakably huge smiles and occasional admirable gasps. <br /> <br /> The laughter comes from the film consumed blend of contemporary style parodies. The targets include a bouquet of Japanese and Western classical theatrical forms, from Kabuki to late Shakespearian and Spanish Renaissance Christian fantasy; the nudvuity of the modern American and European musical, as a witness of a series of random tap and rap dance songs and some very amusing banal texts, all choreographed by a loving "amateur" cliché; Live action clichés of Japanese anime and samurai; portentous Buddhist ritual; and the poignant sweetness of the Viennese operetta. I never laughed so hard at this kind of film from Ken Russell's excessive musical deconstruction in "The Fiance". <br /> <br /> The smiles derive from the ingenious textual subversion of the Japanese legend, told in a traditional structure in 5 acts that recalls the dramas of the 17th century master Chikamatsu. As in his work, the narrative is advanced in a mixture of songs, recitatives, high-level poems and bas-relief of comedy, here the pot that burns the incompetent ninja, Ostrich, from the peasants under the illusion of being a tanuki raccoon in appearance human. All of this somehow reconciles, and even more surprisingly manages to involve the observer's emotions through the confusion of cultural references. <br /> <br /> Actually "Princess Raccoon" wears her pan-cultural dress with a seductive lightness, and this is where the jolts of astonishment arrive. Visually, once again, as in the case of Russell's masterpiece, the film is a true delight, a riot of colors with its digitized backdrops of classic Japanese images from screens and prints, exaggerated sets and stage sets, mixed with some sequences of breathtaking live action in summer camps and beaches. You will love it or hate it, but there is no reason to punish the chalk for making cheese; and "Princess Raccoon" stands out, first of all, as a wicked, amusing and affectionate joke of our contemporary cultural emptiness, both in the East and in the West. Good boy!
