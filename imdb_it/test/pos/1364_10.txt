Believe me when I say this show is simply hilarious. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe, who travels from city to city taking a part-time job, chasing women and learning all he can about life. Kintaro must be one of the easiest to relate to the characters ever created. It takes everything to the extreme, and it's always fun to laugh every time. From his constant and incessant research to study life, for the little things that instantly explodes in matters of life or death. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things about this show is simply the constant and extremely exciting expression of Kintaro. Spend a great deal of time in various super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times in less than 0.1 seconds his face will not only turn into expressions of life or death in manga-fighter style like a weight lifter trying to set a new record. It's hilarious. <br /> <br /> If this were not enough, the writing is superb and the acting in English could not be better. Kintaro's English VA is simply perfect and will roll you when you are not even saying anything. The only thing to say is that this is undoubtedly a Ecchi series. Practically defines the word. If you're a fan of anime for adults that can make you laugh out of movies like American Pie, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> - Rirath_com
