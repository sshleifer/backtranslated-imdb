I think this is the best Norwegian film I've ever seen. He is the 40-year-old Andreas who is hit by a subway train, and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, however, everything here has been prepared for him. He has a job, a house and clothes. At first this city seems perfect, without death, without pain and without problems. Everywhere there are men in gray suits who clean and fix everything that doesn't fit their definition of perfect. Anyway, Andreas doesn't really seem able to adapt and starts to go back to his old world for a long time, and tries by all means to go back. <br /> <br /> The thing that strikes me most in this film is how they make the city so surreal, even though I've seen many of these places in real life that seem so far away. Another thing that contributes greatly to the performance of the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is the perfect guy to play the confusing and annoying Andreas. And all the other characters are doing a great job playing apathetically (it seems like hard work, right?). The strong difference between Andreas and the others leads to very funny situations. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a fabulous film. The plot could be a bit confusing, but the film has such an atmosphere that I would recommend everyone to go and see it. <br /> <br /> And I would not recommend listening to "ccscd212", as it seems to have seen too many American commercial films and seems to have become too used to receiving the moral on a silver platter. As I see it, there isn't much in this film that tries to tell us that suicide is right or wrong. I consider it more a warning of a direction that our society seems to take. Of course, everyone can watch a movie in their own way.
