There are not many movies that I would call perfect, but Rififi is certainly up to it. No other robbery film came close to it, sooner or later. The plot is simple, but it attracts you. It never ceases to amaze me how exciting the film is every time you watch it. You worry about all the characters, even if they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws. It is difficult to imagine other actors besides Jean Servais as Tony le St√©phanois. When the crew members talk about what they will do with their money and eventually get to Tony, his answer and the expression on his face say it all. While the 30-minute robber sequence is the most famous part of the film (and rightly so) the movie actually improves later. Director Jules Dassin knew what he was doing when he decided not to have music during the robbery scene or the shootout final, but instead he inserted a great soundtrack during Tony's last turn to his fate. To think that if Dassin, an American director, had not been blacklisted in Hollywood and forced to work in France, this cinema masterpiece would never have been made as it was. It certainly wouldn't have been nice if it had been made as an American film during that time. What Dassin had to face was absolutely horrible, but he did his greatest job because of it, for the benefit of us all. I'm just thinking about the next remake of Al Pacino. Most action movies since Rififi have already borrowed it in one way or another. There is no reason to redo this masterpiece beyond money. Leave the classics alone!
