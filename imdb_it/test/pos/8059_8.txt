After the Second World War, the uninterrupted crime in Phenix City, Alabama, encouraged by the money of a military base right across the river in Georgia, deteriorated further. Gambling, prostitution, loan on loan and the like have helped a criminal organization in the city. Soon he was too ugly and violent to tolerate yet. This film is based on the true story of that fight. <br /> <br /> By the standards of the 50s it was incredibly explicit. Although on a low budget, the same small budget helped the realism that required outdoor shooting. A very gritty film. Richard Kiley was as wonderful as ever, and John McIntire is stolid. <br /> <br /> Because this beautiful film is not on video it is a real headache!
