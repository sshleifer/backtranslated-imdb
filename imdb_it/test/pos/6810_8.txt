I saw this 1997 film because I am a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and his father, the late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo gave the best of himself in this film, above all thanks to his hairstyle and preppy wardrobe that were flattering. <br /> <br /> As the plot progressed, I realized that the film was more than just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor. The story was about a serial killer ring and attempts by law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring members to justice. There was adequate suspense, and I believe that violence was necessary to relate the story to the viewer. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film I was shocked to learn that the film is the true story of the horrendous murders that took place in Utah. Furthermore, Lorenzo and his protagonist were the portraits of FBI agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the arrest of the ring. I believe the film is worth it as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.
