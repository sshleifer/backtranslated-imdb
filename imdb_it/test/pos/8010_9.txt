"STEP BY STEP", it's my opinion, it's pure ABC success! I can't remember every episode, but I still liked it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always fun when an accident occurred at school. I always laugh at this. In fact, I think of every single of J.T. (Brandon Call) and Cody (Sasha Mitchell) were funny. It would have been nice if Penny (Patrika Darbo) had been on the show for the whole duration. Everyone always gave a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope he never stops going on syndication.
