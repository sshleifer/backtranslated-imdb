"Hoppity Goes to Town" was the second animated feature film made by Max and Dave Fleischer, which created a parallel universe to Disney. While Disney movies are well remembered today, both Fleischer films "Gulliver's Travels" and this have been forgotten. <br /> <br /> "Hoppity" is a fascinating original, not an adaptation like the first photo. This is an important advantage, one might think. No, the critics, rarely on the sides of the Fleischers, tore them up for this. Yes, the story is not as close as "Gulliver", but how can you hate a movie that sports so joyfully? <br /> <br /> It is full of great musical numbers and a very engaging story, which would be a crime to reveal. The characters are adorable and fascinating and in this film there is a heart. <br /> <br /> The Fleischers really outdone themselves here and never did it again. Most of their time would have been dedicated to a group of players after it had been canceled from the box office. It is a pity that they have not continued to do functionality. Who knows? Their next attempt could have become the masterpiece they were aiming for. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
