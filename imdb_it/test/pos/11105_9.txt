For the 1980s, this is a very obscure film. At this point, the filmmakers were starting to operate on the assumption that all films required a funny comic relief (which, of course, is taken to the extreme today), flashy action scenes (even more exaggerated today) or sex scenes hot. /> <br /> Hutton and Penn are wonderful in their childhood childhood roles turned into Soviet spies. Penn in particular is as brilliant as the drug dealer Daulton Lee. <br /> <br /> What you have here is a real thriller / drama. There is no pleasure for the eyes to talk about, but the story is so compelling and the acting so superb that (hopefully) most people wouldn't lose themselves. There are a couple of funny scenes, especially the one in which Penn tries to involve his Soviet benefactors in a major drug deal. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at.
