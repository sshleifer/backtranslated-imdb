Rififi deserves a special mention for the famous scene of the robbery and, indeed, that scene deserves all the credit it deserves. It is a masterful piece of suspense, interaction between characters and photography. But Rififi is not just this scene - every scene in the film is masterfully put together, and as a whole, the film is not only taught with suspense, plot and character, but a cleverly told moral fable that started the film noire for the years to come. <br /> <br /> Cinematically and technically, the robbery sequence could be the most impressive scene in the film, but for me, it's the final scene that holds the most power - Tony le St√©phanois's hallucinogen driving toward redemption.
