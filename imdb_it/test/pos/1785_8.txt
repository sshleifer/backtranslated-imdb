Well, I fear that my review of this special does not take into account much different observations than the others before me, but I literally looked at it during a PBS subscription record - and frankly I am too excited to say nothing. To really appreciate the enigma that is Barbra Streisand, you have to look back before the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid-60s. When television was still a young medium, there was a very important form of entertainment in the air that is just a memory today: musical variety. Some musical shows were weekly series, but others were single, one-off specials, usually showing off the special talent of the single performer. This is where we get the first raw and uninhibited looks from Streisand. She had already been a guest as an actress in other variety shows, including Garry Moore, Ed Sullivan, and got a coup in a single tandem episode with the woman who would have given her the extraordinarily beautiful witness: Judy Garland. In 1966, COLOR ME BARBRA introduced Barbra Streisand in color (hence the title), but he copied the format of his first special a year earlier almost to the letter. In 3 separate acts, we get an abstract Streisand (in an after-hours art museum that looks and sometimes becomes a work of art), a comedian Streisand who works an already adoring audience in a studio circus (populated by many furry and hairy animals) and, above all, a Streisand who sings in mini-concert format ... well, frankly, I do it. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that you had the cinematic debut of FUNNY GIRL yet to come, as well as a singer-songwriter, director and political activist. Here, just 24 years old, she does extraordinary things because, as she says in her camera introduction, "we didn't know we couldn't, so we did." The art museum sequence was filmed in Philadelphia for a weekend immediately after the museum was closed to the public on Saturday night and apparently was made with ONE color camera. Yet there are cuts, fades and tracking shots galore, giving rise to a rather spectacular peak moment, the modern, slightly Beatnik, "Gotta Move". After getting lost among the modern abstracts, the bongos of the jazz-club begin, with Streisand emerging in a psychedelic dress and a glittering make-up for the eyes, making the captivating melody detached with an almost androgynous sex appeal. It is not until act 3, believe it or not, that the moment is equaled or improved by another company: in the sequence of the concert, in a white dress and pearl earrings, Streisand recites the torch "Any place where I hang my hat is home "," Tear off the final notes and reveal one of those belts that make you scream like a little girl even if you are 44 years old ... and a boy. Simply old big television.
