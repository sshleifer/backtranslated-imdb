This "TFTD" episode of the first season ironically called "Answer Me" is a fairly well done and memorable episode, and in the end it takes a shocking turn. You have Jean Marsh across the hill and you have washed the actress of L.A., who moved to New York for an audition and lives in an apartment provided by an old friend. Strangely, every night she is awake by a telephone ringing from the apartment next door, yet strangely the house where the phone rings continues to ring is not occupied since guests have been dead for many years. In the end she had to surrender only she would have to follow him and not answer the phone with anyone at home, since it is bad to get caught in a phone with a life of its own! Overall, a good episode, even if strange, on a supernatural phone is still full of suspense and turns out well in the end.
