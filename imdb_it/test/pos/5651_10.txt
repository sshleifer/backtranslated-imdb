This film is a knockout, Fires in the plain referred to, (burning at the end of the harvest period) A happy memory for Tamura, relives this in his mind many times and at the end of this desolate film, I like a man who dies of thirst, believes he is at home and this last illusion is all that is left to him. The Big Carnival (Ace in the hole) by Billy Wilder is the only film (which comes to mind) that is as sad as this little masterpiece by Kon Ichikawa. While I think the whole movie is brilliant Two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (Crawling on their stomach) are attacked by Americans and massacred, True Horror, And like an American soldier and a pretty girl Filipino the soldier has a cigarette on the side of the road, smiles as she moves with the tug, then his face changes to anger as he sees two Japanese soldiers trying to surrender, grab a gun and kill them with joy, the American soldier tries to stop it but has no chance, for me this speaks of wanting the atrocity committed by the Japanese in the Philippines, all in all a great movie if you have the belly.
