STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Mr Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world, but not of this world. His mind simply does not seem to understand things as a normal person would do and his life is a long disaster because of this, finding himself in continuous misadventures and distant, strange situations that are left to resolve on his own as it does not seem to mix with nobody and rarely speaks. But he never gives up and, although the simplest of tasks is a constant struggle for him, in the end, applying his bizarre methods to solve the problem always pays. <br /> <br /> The state of modern British humor, with all its interest in sex and general vulgarity, would be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr Bean was created at once. There is nothing unsuitable here, only Tommy Cooper type U humor and the like in the 1950s. And I find it just as fun to laugh now in my early 20s as I did when I was a kid in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Although I can look a little deeper now and see it must be more to this character than it seems. There must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to go wrong for him. As others have noted, it appears that he may have a type of autism. In fact I am so convinced that I really think it was a professional psychologist analyzing it, I think Mr Bean could be the first famous and imaginary character who was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. <br /> <br /> If you would like to see some hilarious English humor at best, before everything becomes obsessed with sex and vulgarity, then it would be highly recommended. Shows like Britain work because they are well made, but in reality it is just as vulgar as the rest. Shows like this show we have been more sober and civilized once, and I hope we could start to release this kind of humor again soon. *****
