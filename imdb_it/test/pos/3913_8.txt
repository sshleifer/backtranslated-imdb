I think anyone who is stupid enough to risk being a wax freak just to be able to go to a soccer game or who doesn't want to leave their car "to be stripped" deserves whatever happens to them. <br /> <br /> The guy, Wade who "went to a barber and asked for He-Man's haircut" was not my type, but there is this really cute scene about him that has eyebrows and waxed facial hair. It's a bit too high maintenance for me. <br /> <br /> Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks "like Elton John just gayer", but this whole story is not going anywhere! Blake was hot, I could see him if he weren't like that in his girlfriend, who is a fake Paris Hilton with a bad wig (no Chihuahaua in her purse, though, but it would have been really valuable). I don't think the girls that look like that still go to football games anyway. Nick, the car thief is the sexiest! One of the best parts is where a kick lands on him, and instead of putting it back, he lowers his cigarette and burns the ball. See, this is just the kind of guy he is. She has a sister who looks stupid by borrowing her white batter-wife. His bra straps are showing, like 1/2 of the movie! <br /> <br /> Mostly you just want to wax your legs and never go to football games after seeing this.
