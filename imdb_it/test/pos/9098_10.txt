Jack Black and Kyle Gass collaborate together to promote their Tenacious D band in this Classic Rock called Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their Rock Opera..it is like an Opera of Rock 'N' Roll. Some of the most twisted events took place in that film ... the big part of the foot ... the mushroom part ... and in the end when they did rock against the devil. A classic format in Tenacious D .... one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The last couple of things I saw in the theater were stupid ... but this film was disconcerting. This really made me laugh. The whole base is that Jack Black runs to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and the man who was always bald. They work together to find this magical choice that can make the most terrible musician sound. Finally they arrive at the Rock 'N' Roll Museum and steal the pick. Along the way they meet The Stranger, played by Tim Robbins. They reach the club to win the cash prize when the owner grabs the pick and all the time was the devil and fights the D in a Rock Off. The D does not win but the devil's horn falls and sends him back to hell. Therefore LONG LIVE THE D !!!!!!!!!!
