Acting, of course! Think about it, Closet Land could easily have been so horrible - a whole movie shot in a room with only two people, it's better to have some damn interesting things to talk about. <br /> <br /> But it didn't turn out horribly. On the contrary, thanks to the incredible portraits of Stowe and Rickman, Closet Land is a masterpiece in its own right. <br /> <br /> Not necessarily for everyone. The people who got their attention declined through gorgeous sex scenes and the fire of a random gun could have trouble digesting Closet Land. However, those who appreciate the good story without explosions should take a look at it (no matter how many video stores you have to call to find someone who has it in stock).
