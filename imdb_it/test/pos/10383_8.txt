A wonderful cast cast in the modern mystical romance for intellectual adults. Yes, they too need a love story to arouse those hidden impulses without Hollywood hair. All this under the masterful direction of Antonioni and Wenders who both love to pin their characters into exotic places and make them diminish by the surrounding environment with long, wide strokes. It's nice to see that there is a desire in the mid-life crisis sector.
