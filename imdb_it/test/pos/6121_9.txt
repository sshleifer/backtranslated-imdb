More fun than all the gay orgies in "300" combined. More heartbreaking than a Shakespearean tragedy. More poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. And the biggest garbage ever made. <br /> <br /> A black comedy that tests the limits of human senses, the cult film by John Waters "Pink Flamingos" is a story about the conflict between two families that ends with humiliation, death and, of course, eating dog feces (yes, by the way, which is actually not the humiliating part). No no, it's not about impossible love, there are neither Romeos nor Juliets in these 90 minutes or so. This film is about the battle for prestige, if I could call it that. The battle for the title - The dirtiest person alive. <br /> <br /> On the one hand we have Divine (played by the conductor of the regular waters ... umm ... Divino) a caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, murderer, pervert and current owner of the said title. He loves his son Crackers a little too much. The same cracker has a sexual attraction for chickens and young ladies, sometimes mixing them in threesomes. Friendly family and faithful accomplice Cotton gets his satisfaction from observing the Crackers during some of his ... acts concerning the objects of attraction mentioned above. Last but not least is Divine's mother and grandmother, Crackers, Edie. A 400-pound woman who sleeps, eats and lives practically in a crib. It is dependent on eggs and loves the egg man (the man who brings the eggs ... lol). <br /> <br /> The four live peacefully in an out-of-town caravan until they become a target for marbles. Exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, really bad people. Their main source of income derives from the abduction and impregnation of young women. For the impregnating part they use their trusty and faithful cross-dressing butler to provide sperm. After that they sell the baby born to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> It was the envy of the Marbles towards the Divine and its title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. An epic battle of dirt, perversion and violence. <br /> <br /> "Pink Flamingos" is an unsurpassable masterpiece in the trash film genre. Loaded with oddities and strange deeds, John Waters' film is hated and hated by traditionalists, critics and the average audience of viewers. But for the few who are left unscathed by these generalizations, flamingos are an unforgettable experience. Funny and sick, violent and poetic. It really is a bad taste exercise
