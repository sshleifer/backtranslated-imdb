The standard bearer of all the films in series, the good boy defined - Flash Gordon - against Bad Guy - Ming the Merciless. Although the special effects seem horrible by today's standards, by 1936 they were top notch. But the essence of the story is the battle between Earthman Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) against Mongor's Emporer Ming (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are fantastic in their parts. And the supporting characters who play Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcan and the rest are all very good. This serial is far superior to the 1980 film, basically because Crabbe is far superior to Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> This serial is the standard bearer for all movie series. No question about it.
