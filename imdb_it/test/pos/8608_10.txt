The opening of Imamura's masterpiece avoids the mere sensationalism in his description of the unfathomable events of 6 August 1945, in which 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives have been annihilated in an instant. Instead, Imamura emphasizes the unprecedented strangeness of the catastrophe, concentrating on images as portentous as the cloud of diabolical mushrooms that wander silently in the distance and the black rain that splashes the face of a beautiful young woman. The rest of the film traces the ramifications of this latest incident, bringing the atomic holocaust and its consequences (over 100,000 people died from radiation poisoning) to the intelligible level of the difficult situation of Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) and her baby " community linked by the bomb ". <br /> <br /> Survivors strive for normality and continuity, in particular by trying to find a suitable marriage for Yasuko, but the imminent possibility of radiation sickness obscures every aspect of their lives. Yasuko's potential suitors, of course, avoid a young woman, no matter how attractive, who could suddenly fall ill and die. Genuine love, when it finally appears, does so in an unexpected and ambiguous way. We wonder if love through class lines is more a sign of Yasuko's status as "damaged goods" or of a common humanity, thrown into obvious relief by harsh circumstances, which transcends class divisions. <br /> <br /> the classically understated style intensifies the impact, the eloquent internal shots that remind us that Imamura began his career as an assistant to the great Ozu. Imamura's mastery is evident, for example, in the coupled scenes of the Yasuko bathroom, the first to emphasize her beautiful back and legs, the second as her hair falls. The shots are almost like bookends to the trajectory of narrative, distilling its tragic essence. The realism of the documentary-style film is violated several times for expressive purposes, perhaps in particular in a scene that lays bare the restless inner life of a distraught veteran. Both the soundtrack of the famous avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu and the splendid black and white photography contribute greatly to the gloomy atmosphere of the film. When, in the final shot, Yasuko's uncle (Kazuo Kitamura), the laconic narrator of the film, looks at the empty sky of a rainbow as a sign of hope and regeneration, the black and white image suddenly becomes so touching as to be almost unbearable . Few films from Japan (or anywhere else, for that matter) could be compared to the great Japanese humanist masterpieces of the 1950s. This film is one of them. When I finished seeing him for the first time, I sat stunned, unable to move for at least five minutes, overwhelmed as I was by the emotions that the great tragedy should have inspired: terror and pity.
