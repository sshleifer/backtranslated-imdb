In a style that recalls the best of David Lean, this romantic love story crosses the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set. It is a film that claims that love is not chosen, but rather that it is love that makes the choice, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it is a matter of the heart often conditioned by the prevailing conditions and circumstances. And so the situation in "The English Patient", directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inappropriate of places and times, demonstrating that when it is predestined, love will find a way. <br /> <br /> It is the second world war; Flying over the African desert, the Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane is mistaken for an enemy plane. And although he survives the crash, he is badly burned. Fortunately, however, he is saved by a tribe of nomads and ends up in a hospital. But the existing conditions are governed by war circumstances, and Almasy soon becomes one of the many patients transported by convoy to a different facility. After reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay with him in an abandoned monastery. <br /> <br /> Hana soon discovers that his accusation is something of a mystery man, as Almasy remembers nothing of his past, nor his name. Thought to be English, the only clues that indicate who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the incident, but they too are as cryptic as Hana's patient. Slowly, however, under the pressure of Hana, Almasy begins to remember fragments of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is helped even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he is looking for ... a man with whom he wants to set a score. But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to emerge; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) - as well as the memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And, paralyzed in his mind and in his body as they are, those memories become the only thing he can hold onto with all hope, even if his life seems to slide farther and farther with each passing moment. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the Michael Ondaatje novel. The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's "Doctor Zhivago" and "Lawrence of Arabia"; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. In a nutshell, Minghella's film is ingenious; made and delivered with poetic perfection, observing it is like watching a Monet come to life. From the initial frames, Minghella launches a hypnotic spell on her audience that is binding and transportable, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engaging and vibrant images that come to life from the remarkable cinematography of John Seale; images that virtually fill the screen and the soul of the viewer. In every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a surprising emotional capacity that facilitates a truly transcendental experience. Named in twelve categories, he deservedly received a total of nine Academy Awards, including Best Film, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography. <br /> <br /> If you had to choose a single word to describe the essence of this film, it would be "excellence". Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Academy Awards without extraordinary performances; and the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term "worthy Oscar". Named best actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush was awarded gold for "Shine"), Fiennes has never been better, reaching an emotional depth with his character that is almost palpable. Private and introspective, Almasy is not by nature an individual to whom the public will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds the way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough to let you savor the sincere passion in him. And it works. Almasy does not look for your friendship; however, you will gain your compassion. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas also received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for "Fargo") for her portrait of Katherine, a woman whose stoic face masks the emotional conflict that rages inside her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet which she willingly gives herself, taking away the chains of repression to embrace a love so strong that it threatens to consume it. The reserve that Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the public, as Scott Thomas manages to exploit the emotional depths of his character with the greatest possible effect. It is the type of exhibition that attracts you and keeps you strong, taking you beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion. Understated and shaded with subtlety, it's a fantastic job by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> Binoche also offers an extraordinary and touching interpretation, as the good-hearted nurse, Hana; it is his humanity, in fact, that defines love in its purest sense and offers a balanced perspective within the context of the film. His relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) gives us a taste of another's passion, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine. `The English Patient 'is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you won't want to see end. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
