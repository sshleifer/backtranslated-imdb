I saw this movie at the Boston Internation Festival of Women's Cinema last night, and I was saddened to hear that Ms. Troche told us (in her Q&A after the screening) that she doesn't expect to see too much distribution in the United States, because of its insistence by including all so-called "gay content". It was a FANTASTICLY funny comedy, and it seems to me that the American public could appreciate it in the same way they enjoyed "The Full Monty", so it is really unpleasant and ridiculous that some shots of two kissing boys keep away from traditional theaters. Wonderful cast, FABULOUS script and, of course, Rose Troche's direction make it one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
