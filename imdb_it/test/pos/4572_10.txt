I've seen this film since I was a child, and being from New York and remembering how people lived, brought back many good memories. This film not only wants to end a fairy tale, but to understand the difficulties of becoming a better person, the woman and the supplier that Claudine tried to be. It was about the welfare system that put women in a binding situation. It was about the injustice of a system that invaded and forced a family to stay afloat. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and she was well deserved. If you want to live a strong family with moments of conflictual but marvelous union, enjoy Claudine. Your goal as a spectator is to keep an open mind and understand the general frustration.
