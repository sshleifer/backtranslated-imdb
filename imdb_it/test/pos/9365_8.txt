A brilliant thriller, which deserves much more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are fantastic in their leading roles, as well as the entire supporting cast. A truly compelling noir film, with some wonderful images and a great dialogue, at the center of everything is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel on homophobia, this film attacks post-war anti-emitism and all intolerance and hatred, with considerable power. Although the parts may seem a bit wary of the modern public, it still has the power to shock and works very well as a thriller in its own right. A credit for all those involved.
