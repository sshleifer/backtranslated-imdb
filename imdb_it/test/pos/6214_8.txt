This is a wonderful look, you should forgive the pun, to 22 women who talk about breasts - them, their mothers, other women, and how they affect so many aspects of their lives. Young girls, old women and everyone in between (with all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc.) They talk about developing, reacting, celebrating, hiding, improving or reducing breasts. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating, delightful, sad, fun and all in between. Interposing with documentary films and clips of those famous old "young women films" that the girls were brought to the canteen to see, the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women and their breasts in what the other half has to say when I don't know you're listening.
