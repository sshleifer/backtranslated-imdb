At first glance, any adolescent comedy is likely to be both sophisticated and obvious, and fair enough, most of them are. There are some who have risen above the usual banality of the source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and give me the hope that others can join the depressing crowd of teenage comedies that are actually funny and not just an excuse for light up some starlet's cum or be a vehicle for some ever-was like Tom Green. <br /> <br /> Enter Accepted, directed by John Cusack friend Steve Pink and led by the sympathetic Justin Long (the nerd smart guy in Galaxy Quest and most recently highlighted in Apple computer ads), on a group of guys that are not accepted in college and decide, as revealed in the trailer, to fake a fake to take their parents off their backs. When they go a little too far with the website and the other children end up enlisting, the children have some problems to solve. <br /> <br /> Ok, the set-up is obviously absurd, but most comedies live or die in execution, and here, Accepted does quite well. Long's Bartleby Gaines (mostly abbreviated to "B") is accompanied by friends who are quite comical and acceptable to help him share the load, but probably the best supporting character is "Dean" Lewis (no doubt named as a tribute to Rodney's Dean Dangerfield Martin), aka Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who is wisely limited to brief flashes where he can quickly shoot his only mark of irritable observational humor. Black is fantastic here, frankly telling children what life is like (its final line full of imprecation is hysterical) and provides the adult face to the false university for parents. <br /> <br /> But Long has to bring most of the film, and he does it, in spade; Bartleby is easily identified with and we take it almost immediately. A nice breakthrough was provided by the character of Columbus Short, Hands, an athlete who loses the scholarship due to an injury and ends up becoming the de facto art school of the fake college. Also noteworthy is Bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic little sister, Hannah Marks. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film feels familiar in some places; there is a debt due here, of all places, to Revenge of the Nerds. Those who are rejected by all others find a home with Bartleby and his cohorts, and of course the villains are types of Race Master conformists empowered by steroids who run a fraternity (well, ok, friars are bad) and try to humiliate and bury the balls for the ?? rattle ?? crime of being different. But apart from that, Accepted has fun with the material and also asks some decent questions about the expectations of college kids and the curriculum. Not that it is a puzzle by any means, but Accepted is not just another brainless teenage comedy (or vehicle Owen Wilson). It's a fun, intelligent 90 minute that, while not a great departure from its genre, is smart and creative enough to be very funny. <br /> <br /> There is at least one moment of unadulterated brilliance in the film, when Bartleby controls a nearby college in an attempt to gather ideas for his school's curriculum. When he sees that the boys are all stressed out at the other school (many even refuse to talk to him during the lesson for fear of losing something), he shakes his head, thinking that there must be a better way. As he moves to leave, he is met by a stream of children going to the other side, a person moving against a human tide, while in the background, the opening lines of Eleanor Rigby play. Perhaps an unscheduled moment of brilliance, but nevertheless brilliance.
