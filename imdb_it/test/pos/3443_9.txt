Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing it as a compelling, fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It is not necessary to see all the episodes, since the former are the best, while the latter are a bit boring, but for every person who likes Germans and their good-natured ways, all episodes deserve to be seen. German fashion, values ​​are constantly questioned, even his murderous Nazi past is confronted in recent episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended to anyone who wants to live or travel in Germany, preferably in the original language !! <br /> <br />
