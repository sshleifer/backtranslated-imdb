As I sit here, I find myself laughing at some moments in this movie. Go see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you've ever attended a club, go see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you've always wanted to go to the disco, go see this. My bet is that the movie was born from an idea while out of the club and this is the product of that possibility out of a million copies that someone remembered in the morning and had the application to follow him. <br /> <br /> In summary, go see this movie. <br /> <br />
