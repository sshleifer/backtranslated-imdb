I was lucky enough to see The Last Stop here where I live at the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those of you who don't know, the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a Canadian film tour made in Canada). I was told just before the film began that it was the world premiere and that it was about to get an American distribution deal that added to my excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the horror movie, and yes, I also love the Scream trilogy. So when I found out that Rose McGowan was making a kind of Ten Little Indians movie, I knew I liked it. Rose McGowan was the leading actress / actress of the entire festival. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe it without giving too much space to the plot is that it's not quite like Scream. And certainly worth seeing. It's set in the middle of a snowstorm (it was shot in Vancouver, California, Canada) in a motel at the top of the mountain, which adds further suspense. Rose McGowan performs a great performance like the girl next door (?!) Along with the rest of the cast. And as for what happens in the end, well, the only thing I will say is that you will never guess the ending. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it probably won't do so in North American mainstream theaters because the only decent money maker in it is Rose McGowan. But if you have the chance to see it, I would advise you to do it. And if the worst comes to the worst, there is always a video. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 9 out of 10.
