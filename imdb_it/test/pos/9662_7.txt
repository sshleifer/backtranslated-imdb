I must say that I did not expect this film to be so beautiful. Oriental cinema usually presents the communist past in 90% of films. However, this film surpasses Romanian cinema, being worthy of some extra publicity. <br /> <br /> The acting is truthful and not exaggerated, the plot is simple but complex as it presents life in the Romanian suburbs, the sound amazed me, the direction was good and what else can I say ... <br /> <br /> This "Crash" of Eastern Europe attracted me to the film by living every moment. I even felt the desire to come out of me, a desire for adventure after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Watch it! You will surely like it! <br /> <br /> 7/10
