I can only agree with many observers that Traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw Traffik when he was on TV and I just looked at him again. I am particularly moved by Tim Souster's haunting music, and especially by the painful tensions of Dmitri Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony in C minor (music beyond the end credits and in some parts of the film). The music intensifies the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad destiny. Music is highly emotional. This arrangement combines two of the movements of the symphony, but I recommend listening to the symphony itself.
