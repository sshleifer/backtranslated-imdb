I love this movie so much. It always makes me cry. If you like Drew Barrymore as much as I do, you will love this movie. It has all the essentials I look for in a film. He has good actors, good characters, good humor ... also many exciting moments. The flashback moments when we see Josie in high school make me cry. Every single time. I'm sure you'll like this, don't judge based on the fact that it looks like a movie for teens, even if in a sense it's a movie for teenagers. Of course, if you are a boy, and all those you watch are hardcore movies with special effects only in the best 250 movies of all time, then this is not for you. But if you like romantic comedies that you won't forget after seeing it, take it in a video store and have fun: Drew Barrymore is great at it!
