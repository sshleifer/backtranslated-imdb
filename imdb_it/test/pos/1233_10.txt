hello to all Denver fans! <br /> <br /> I could not agree more with you guys! This show was so beautiful and cute, I saw it as a child in the late 1980s. Among the Denver there are also other favorites, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. Now I'm 24, but it's still one of my favorite shows and my favorite cartoon from the 80s. Bring back all the memories. Even the theme melody was fantastic, I get goose bumps every time I hear it. It's sad that it lasted so little time, but it remained a favorite. It's great that I'm not alone and that there are people out there who liked me too. This is one of the cartoons I will keep for future generations. <br /> <br /> Long live Denver! :)
