I quote here in the words of my favorite writer, Paulo Coelho, as a commentary on this film. <br /> <br /> "When you really want something, the whole universe conspires to help you achieve it" <br /> <br /> It's too easy to forget who we really are and what we want to do in life. Because there are always too many comments and tips around us to say safety. I had almost forgotten what passion would be like. Despite the adventure will take me out of the safety zone, I really believe that fear is just the price I need to pay for the next new journey in life. <br /> <br /> Thanks for inspiring me with this lovely story. It is the blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is. This is the most precious love from the light of the soul.
