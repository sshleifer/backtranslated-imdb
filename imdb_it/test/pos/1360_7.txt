Incredibly nonsense, only six episodes of duration, on an unfortunate bellboy called Kintaro (well, it's called a bellboy, even though he's destined to be in his 20s), and the adventures he has on his travels. Each episode sees him arrive in a new city, acquire a new job, develop something of a love interest before each episode ends with him. <br /> <br /> Gently sexist, youthful, very immature at times, this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Not one for starters if you're not a fan of anime, as it certainly won't convince you like that, but for those who are already converted, this is fun fluff.
