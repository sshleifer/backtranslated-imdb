This film is more than the story of Danton. It was a Polish French production joint at the time of the beginning of the end of the Soviet system. It probably helped to stimulate trade union activity in the solidarity movement. It is more about Poland in the 20th century than about the French revolution. Solidarity has begun the end of the system. This film is historical in itself because of its very existence ... the rest is History. <br /> <br /> Robspiere, aka. totalitarian leaders. Danton, aka. Walensa. When watching this film, we must remember the snowball that started in Poland. <br /> <br /> Actually, it could be useful to see the superpower fight in the only remaining superpower.
