'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war work is probably the most beautiful war movie I've ever seen. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnamese soldier who is called to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission in Cambodia to "finish the position" of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a highly ranked and highly respected military man who apparently went completely out of his mind and deserted from the army, creating his small company and helped by a cult following by soldiers. Accompanying him to the river in Cambodia is a handful of sailors, and along the way they meet several interesting people (in particular Kilgore of Robert Duvall, a lieutenant colonel with a few loose screws) and some terrifying situations. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalypse' is a war film less historical than a philosophical and psychological study. It is more "Full Metal Jacket" than "Platoon". The "Apocalypse" execution time is over three hours, but the film is so wonderfully inspiring and compelling that when the end of the film came, I was really surprised by the amount of time spent. The beautiful photography is certainly the thing that struck me most, however. After seeing this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in the history of cinema. The "Godfather" films were all dyed in an almost sepia tone and the shadows created the sensation of a baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse', there is an incredible use of natural light, and the shadows, particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen, become almost a living character, they are so pervasive and effective. Another wonderful scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle in search of mangoes and come across a tiger. The enormous vastness of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian, but the coloring of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost a muted gray, the leaves were incredibly vibrant green, an effect that was particularly striking. Another very positive moment in the film was the big scene where the helicopters carrying Duvall and the company attack the small village while playing Wagner. This may have been just a very dramatic background soundtrack to the scene, but instead Coppola turns the song into a real part of the scene, with Duvall telling him that he likes to play while they are approaching to "scare them to death" '. <br /> <br /> Performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much has been made of the amount of money Brando has earned for the film and the amount of problems it has caused. Regardless, he achieved a powerful performance for a relatively limited amount of screen time. Sheen is completely exceptional - is this the first time I really see him unleash in a movie ?? and Duvall is a lot of fun to look like Kilgore's fool. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture now (most know many lines of choice in the film, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning 'and others), but I knew very little that there were many surprises left to experiment. I have not seen the original cut of 'Apocalypse Now', so I can't compare it with this most recent cut, but this is a film that should definitely be experienced. 8/10 <br /> <br /> - -Shelly
