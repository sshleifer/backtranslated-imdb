This Oscar-winning short (40 minutes), based on a story by William Faulkner, takes us back to Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one of about 18 and one of about 8, are looking for bird eggs (obviously a huge object to collection for children of the South in this period). Well, the Japanese Pearl Harbor bomb and the older brother, Pete, decide to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie, and leaves, wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte. Well, Willie has none, if Pete can be a soldier, so he can. He heads for Memphis, showing his stubbornness and determination as he gets the better of many adults along the way. After finding the recruitment center in Memphis, he asks to see his brother, pulling a knife on a lieutenant and injuring him in the process. We are shown the devotion and love of a little brother (Jonathan Furr). It offers an impeccable performance as a stubborn strong-willed boy in the sweetest times of the past. The film tries and mostly manages to show how the brothers can show the devotion and importance of family ties in youth. As the two brothers gather soon, the film launches a cathartic cry as brotherly love envelops us all. <br /> <br /> This film is like a bottle of cold water. Maybe Dasani or Aquafina, good water, clear with a tasty mineral package, but not pure natural spring water like Evian. However, quench your thirst and do not doubt the purity and the extinguishing effects. It's more run of the mill and less expensive than some, but it gets the job, leaving one refreshed and detoxified later. 7/10
