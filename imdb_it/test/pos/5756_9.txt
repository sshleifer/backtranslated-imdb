Ok, this may not be the most sophisticated movie you've ever seen. In reality, there is not a bit of "sophistication" * in it. It's childish, adolescent, harmless, idiot ... And absolutely hilarious. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in Britain. Play some ridiculous joke with the guests as they beat each other, try to get the rent money from the only resident who is stupid enough to stay, have a whole night drinking spree with the kids at the next station ... in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press. Give it a try if you're a fan of Rik and Ade and their work. If you're not ... Don't take the movie. As simple as that. <br /> <br /> * I'm not big, this is a word from another of Rik's adventures in the film world ^ _ ^
