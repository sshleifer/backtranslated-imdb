I saw this movie on September 1, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival which shows the films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A truly moving image "... explores the human journey expressing artistically hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life." Heartland gave this award to this film. <br /> <br /> This is a history of golf in the early part of the 20th century. At that time, it was the high-class game and rich "gentlemen", and workers could only participate by making caddies in country clubs. With this background, this story based on a true story develops with a young working-class boy who takes on the golf course and the greatest golfer in the world, Harry Vardon. <br /> <br /> And the story is inspirational. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by "Holes" Shia LaBeouf) competes against the greatest golfers from the United States and Great Britain at the US Open in 1913. Francesco is ill-prepared and has a son for a caddy. (The caddy is exhilarating and motivating and steals every scene it appears.) But despite these handicaps, Francis shows courage, spirit, heroism and humility in this world-class event. <br /> <br /> And, let's learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the arrangement of short holes, the manual scoreboard, golfers swinging with tubes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of greens and fairways and the game is not canceled even under one torrential rain. <br /> <br /> This film has an extraordinary cinematography and art direction and editing. And without big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable. <br /> <br /> Adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the plot of "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans". <br /> FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures website where there is a list of past winners dating back 70 years.
