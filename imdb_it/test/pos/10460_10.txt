I don't need to repeat the synopsis made by Glenn. The black and white rendition is even more powerful in portraying the desolation of country village life at that time. The deep measure of friendship shown by Babette to the two elderly sisters touches the strings of the heart. The supporting cast is excellent and their performances superb, it would not be fair to identify a single character since the whole story depends on the cast as a whole. I can't put my finger on exactly why I rate this movie so much since I'm not a professional critic; individual viewers may or may not agree with my vote because the enjoyment of this type of film is always in the eye of the beholder.
