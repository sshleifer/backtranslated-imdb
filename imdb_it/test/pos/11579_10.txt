A friend of mine asked: "Shouldn't you be pro-euthanized to appreciate this movie? Is it a mistake to infer that most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there's only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in The Sea Inside. He thinks that Ramón Sampedro has also addressed this in the film. He wants to die. It is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death. Speak for yourself and not other quadriplegics. Although his pioneering work, depending on the prospect, may prove beneficial or harmful to quadriplegics along the way, his primary goal is personal. But one thing that this film does (my opinion anyway) is that it forces viewers to ask themselves the infernal questions that my friend has so briefly presented. <br /> <br /> After my first view of The Sea Inside, I walked home in a conflictual blur. I struggled to reconcile myself with this maddening notion; why does Ramón want to die? Given the love, the care and the sacrifices so unconditionally poured on Ramón by the people around him, why would he stubbornly attach himself to his painful decision? Then, to my second remark, a shared thought between Ramón and the lady lawyer came into my consciousness. He raised an observation: "... total dependence comes at the expense of intimacy". Most humans crave such intimacy. Obviously, how much we appreciate these "needs" depends largely on the individual. <br /> <br /> As a person with a family sensitivity, I strongly identified with the caregivers in this film. Why can't Javier consider sacrifice and love from his family and friends? Are you blind to all this? I would not think. The miracle of The Sea Inside, therefore, is its intuitive representation of a very humanistic tug of war. When we are faced with the protection of a healthy but incapable loved one who has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what is the right thing to do? Take care and keep this beloved person alive, against his will, a pious gesture? Show the value of our love? Or does it simply limit our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding accorded to caregivers, their invalid accusations, submitting to the total dependence of others on survival, would they also be a neglected act of sacrifice? Rhetoric or not, how much is "dignity" worth for an individual? Live (or die) with dignity a privilege or a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions that the film could have asked, answers to which I am unable to provide. <br /> <br /> In our ambition to delimit intellectually the merits of pro-life or pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of ​​gray that is overwhelming the most intimately affected people, caregivers and those who are take care of them. The Sea Inside then tried to present the delicate and complex relational dynamics between them. Intuitively, this film includes one thing; that the nature of "sacrifice" is never one-sided. In this tug of war, we should strive not to win arguments, but to observe carefully and hopefully determine, who is the "strongest" part to make that sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is a sobering film. He opened my eyes to things I don't want to see. And for that, I'm grateful.
