I only heard about Driving Lessons through ITV advertising, and to be honest, I didn't know how much I would have liked. I turned on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a simple and modest film that attracts you from the beginning. Rupert Grint brilliantly plays the socially embarrassed teenager Ben. It is definitely one to keep an eye on in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors interpreted their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film, for me was Evie's rather colorful poem. Show how friendships can be formed between the most unlikely couples. In my opinion, watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. The scenery was also surprising, especially the countryside. Anyone who can call this sparkling forgettable comedy, I strongly disagree with
