This is my favorite kung fu movie. It has a very authentic flavor, spiced up with disturbing music (with traditional Chinese instruments, I believe), and some wonderfully superimposed melodramatic moments that contrast with the heavily influenced comedy. In fact, while attempting to create their own "Western" genre (ie Cowboy film), the Chinese invented a new animal, characterized by kung fu fights and related sound effects. <br /> <br /> The story of Five Fingers of death is simple, a story of revenge (to kill a loved one) and the search for the main character to master the "technique of iron fist" that will allow him to unleash holy revenge on his enemies. There is also a love interest, even if the uncomfortable, polite type (found in most Chinese films of the period). The end result is still large and much more authentic than any Bruce Lee film.
