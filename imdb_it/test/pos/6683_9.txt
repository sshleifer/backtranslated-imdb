In KPAX Softley touches on the subtleties of Eastern Religious Mores from the small archetypes incorporated throughout the film to the true purpose of Prot. Spacey (Prot) takes on a predominantly didactic role throughout the film - it is as if the statements he made embodied general truths about a culture of peace strongly promulgated in Buddhism and Hinduism. It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is "luminous" and the false veil of reality is what all the others see, but Prot sees the truth - sees the minute - and appreciates it and at some points he fears it as he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more humanly. <br /> <br /> The film is particularly detailed, so I suggest you watch it at least twice to see how Softley appeals to the nuances. Listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end as they truly touch on concepts not commonly presented in Western philosophies. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 Vote - Superb - with nominal room for improvement.
