This is a beautifully filmed film that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, particularly nomadic tribes. Focusing on the Saltmen of Tibet, the film moves at a pace that makes some Western viewers uncomfortable. For some peoples, life always proceeds at the same rate it has for thousands of years. This film follows a group of tribe members during their two-month annual search for salt. Their tribe lives its life in a traditional way (slowly according to modern standards) and always takes into account their many gods. This is an extraordinary film, which will preserve a piece of what could, unfortunately, become history. It's worth it. Don't be in a hurry when you see it.
