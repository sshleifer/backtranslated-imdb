The son of Hercules is seriously injured during a lion hunt that goes wrong. Hercules (a solid and engaging display of the muscular Reg Park) must venture into a strange and dangerous alternative dimension dominated by the vengeful evil Gia the Earth Goddess (a delightful evil portrait of Gia Sandri) and fight various monsters to save his son's soul . Meanwhile, Gia's equally bad son, Antaius (a perfectly hateful turn of Giovanni Cianfriglia) stands as Hercules and takes control of an entire city as a cruel and ruthless tyrant. The director Maurizo Lucidi tells the compelling storyline at a steady pace and keeps a serious tone all the time. This film starts a little slow, but really begins to cook once Hercules enters the nebulous and hazy world of underground spirits: among the highlights we find Hercules grappling with a humanoid lizard beast, Hercules climbing a giant gnarled tree and Hercules attacked by a bunch of rotting zombie rotting. Better yet, the bizarre spirit world only smells of a ghostly atmosphere (you must love that lingering dense swirling fog!). The strenuous physical encounter between one hand and another and the great physical clash between Hercules and Antao is likewise a stone. Of course, we too get a great destructive world to the volcanic eruption. Allvaro Mancori's clear widescreen cinematography gives the film a sense of impressive extension. The robust and touching soundtrack by Ugo Filippini has a majestic touch. Ok, so this film is an obvious cheapo job that is both cute and bad and uses copious movies from both "Hercules in the Haunted World" and "Hercules and the Captive Women", but it's still an extremely lively and fun game at the same time.
