An appropriate description of Spock of a very powerful scoundrel in whose hands the crew of the Enterprise falls. This was an area of ​​space that our spaceship should have avoided: first Sulu & Kirk simply disappeared from the bridge; an away team follows them on the surface of an unknown planet and meets Trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in clothes from a land of many centuries past But it shows someone's skills or something far beyond the human and doesn't register on McCoy's medical tricorder. The agents manage to escape back to the ship but, like a bad cosmic penny, Trelane keeps popping up. He brings them all back, including a female company, to continue his games. The dilemma now takes elements of "The Most Dangerous Game" in space and there is an exasperating and even exasperating aspect to the total helplessness of the crew before such unbridled power. <br /> <br /> What makes this episode truly exceptional is the memorable performance of the host star Campbell as the oppressive but not omniscient alien. His character is obviously an initial version of Q, which was introduced 20 years later in the TNG series pilot. Trelane's confrontational scene with Spock stands out in all the strange drama that takes place. As usual, Kirk quickly starts looking for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite old-fashioned. The answers to exactly what or who Trelane is are right in front of us all the time so when we learn the truth, it makes perfect sense in view of Campbell's perfect acting. He indulges continuously, struts before an unknown audience, making observations about things with a touch that is contagious but not entirely correct - we cannot define it at first, but there is something missing here. Every few minutes, his tone becomes sinister and the crew appears to be in serious danger. In a way, you can't take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he'll do next. Actor John de Lancie captured that tone similar to Q's in the Next Generation series.
