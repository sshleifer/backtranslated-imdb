I didn't expect much from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it and found it very noteworthy. His notoriety is mainly due to the talent and appeal of his star, John Garfield. <br /> <br /> Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star framed for murder. He has to go on the run and ends up with sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here an opportunity for redemption is offered, yet will the past reach it? Garfield was an actor in front of his peers. Before the word "Method" was coined and before Brando screamed "Stella!" "natural" port on the screen. His earthly quality and his extraordinary acting talent dominate this production. Also interesting is the fact that his role here as a boxer has the nuances of the role of "Golden Boy" he desperately wanted to want on the screen. Garfield looks like the type and goes far as a boxer, demonstrating his acting value. <br /> <br /> Ann Sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as the wild girl of Jack Goldie. I never thought much about Sheridan, but I liked it here. Play well with Garfield. Dickson's performance is a bit tired and doesn't share good chemistry with Garfield. Dead End Kids are here, and Garfield looks like their natural idol (even more than Cagney). Claude Rains is a mixed bag, and seems uncomfortable with the role in many scenes. Strange, since he has always been such a reliable actor. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the director - Busby Berkeley, best known for his early musicals with dancers and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here with remarkable ease. It maintains a gritty atmosphere admirably. <br /> <br /> A very good film that deserves more attention 8/10.
