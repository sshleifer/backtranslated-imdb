This is another classic Seagal movie. Walk, no, all the other Mega Seagal films go through the patriot. Nothing even comes close to Seagal's challenge in this film, except perhaps the part where he has to find a cure for this so-called "sore" and start throwing things on the lab, but everything works, I mean, let him do, his Master Seagal, must win. What about his dress in the film, a masterpiece, he must have chosen it himself. It's great that everyone in the movie dies after being exposed to the virus, but Seagal didn't even have a cough. The accident at the end when he kills the fat boy with broken glass, genius, I bet that Seagal has also thought about that. This film is pure and simple class. great plot, great characters and Seagal.
