I don't like boxing, I don't understand the attraction. I liked this movie. Positive representations of Latinos, without drugs, sex or street violence. The plot actually showed stable and loving families. The fighting sequences are violent, as is boxing, but not as high as in the Rocky films. Nothing wrong with trying familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity. It's a good rent.
