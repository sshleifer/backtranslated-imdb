The exaggerated madness of Richard Condie's comic book "The Big Snit" is a journey through qwerkyness, madness, hillside, funny backgrounds, melting characters, and a conclusion that almost brings me happy tears every time I see it. <br /> <br /> I saw this short film over and over again and I NEVER have a TRACK (fortunately having it on tape from a TV broadcast) !! He never ceases to burst into laughter in an uncontrollable way, to then reach the depths of my spirit, emphasizing the greatness of the human condition. <br /> <br /> Cause when someone says: "Come on, let's finish the game" everything is fine in the world and the problems we face every day we suddenly realize are all little fleeting things to not argue or worry anymore. At first glance this film looks like a simple exercise in cartoon slap humor, but it's much more than that. This film has a broader sense of spiritual meaning with humanity in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial. <br /> <br /> It is impeccable ... anyway. AND DAMN FUNNY TOO;) <br /> <br /> Evaluation 10 out of 10.
