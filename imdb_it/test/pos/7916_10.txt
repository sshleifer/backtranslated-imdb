Alexander Nevsky is rightly considered a cinematic masterpiece. However it has aged very badly. People decide not to mention it and talk about great battles and great music. The sound effects could have been good then but apart from the presumptuous organ all the sounds are laughable. I could be photographed by movie fans for this, but I'm sure that the modern spectator of Alexander Nevsky will agree that the brazen propaganda and terrifying music to belittle the film. I gave this film 10/10 because it is undeniably a masterpiece. It has its big bits though. The costumes of the Teutonic knights are superb and the battle scenes are quite good for the time. It is however a masterpiece that shows its age.
