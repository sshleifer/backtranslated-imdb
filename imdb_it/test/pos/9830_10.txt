Random Hearts is a very well directed, well scripted and perfectly cast actor for the main roles. I found it to be so intense, that you have to stop and marvel at almost every scene where Harrison and Kristin are together, as their characters face this horrible situation in which they find themselves. A highly talented acting by both. Many people believe that they did not like the film for what it was, did not understand the meaning of the film or could not even imagine a situation like theirs. <br /> <br /> (please skip this next part if you haven't seen the movie yet) <br /> <br /> I loved the ending, which was a big surprise that tied the whole movie. It was a relief to see how these two good people can come out really happier at the end. <br /> <br />
