Inspired by real events, Radio is one of the best played and interpreted dramas I've seen widely published on some occasions. It is certainly one of the best films of the year of 2003. <br /> <br /> The star of Radio Ed Harris, who is nevertheless worthy of an Oscar in this film, like football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones has taught football for life and loves the game. However, Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance as Men of Honor, comes from the football field while the coach's team is training for the game. Some team members then tie up the radio and throw it into a building. Then they bomb the building and finally Coach Jones suspects something is wrong. He arrives and helps Radio, who is afraid, and from that moment on, Coach Jones and Radio share a very special bond. The radio becomes the culminating point of every football match and has a lot of fun playing soccer games and school events. It also becomes the main interest of Coach Jones for life on football, which at first was his main priority both for his family and for the radio. <br /> <br /> The film deals with all kinds of real-life problems, including life priorities, accepting people for who they are even if they are different, death and family relationships. The film touches all these problems and more and is extremely well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. The thing that I liked most about Radio was its feeling. The shows were like looking at something in real life that occurs right before your eyes. The radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were pretty funny but other parts were very serious and sad. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that Radio has been much overlooked by critics who have only received average reviews. They must be there with their heads down because it's amazing how this movie can only get 2 reviews and something like rock school can get 3 or 4 stars, for me it doesn't make any sense. Even the performances like I said before are top notch and worthy of an Oscar. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, whom I consider undervalued as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr., should both get some sort of nomination for this film. Radio is one of my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the great Hollywood movies. My final vote for Radio is a 9/10.
