In the 70s, a small Texan director named S.F. Brownrigg has directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-cost drive-in horror films that seem to have developed a small cult over the years. Before seeing his first film, Do not Look In The Basement, I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I certainly didn't expect it to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre. I don't know, this could actually be my favorite horror movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Let's start in an isolated mental hospital. At first, it seems a pretty relaxed place to be mentally healthy, considering that all patients are allowed to roam freely and whatever, like it's their home (I guess it is). none of them seems so dangerous, just delirious. Among the residents there are a nymphomaniac, a 700-year-old woman, a man-child, a spat, a boy who thinks he is at war, a woman who thinks he has a child and a boy who thinks he is a judge. One day, from nowhere, the judge kills the doctor with an ax, a little later, the little mother wants to kill the nurse. Ten minutes into the movie, and things look really bad. Maybe the new nurse will know what to do, then again, maybe not. Giving away more would do more harm than good. It is better to dive first into this, knowing as little as possible. If you can honestly appreciate God, without control with horror, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you liked Scream, if you liked Wrong Turn, if you go for that not too original, overexposed and oversized Hollywood digital trash, then it's very likely that you don't see beauty in this. Don't look in the basement, being a first try makes the quality even more shocking. The atmosphere and graininess fit into the place and the score like a glove. Unfortunately, good old S.F. he used most of his good ideas in his first film, although, the next entry in his Texas format quadrilogy, is a bit of a masterpiece, that is, if you like Hixploitation, like someone I know. If you fall in love with Brownrigg's first two and absolutely have to find out what else he has to offer, check out Do not Open The Door and The House Where Hell Froze Over. Do not Look in The Basement has everything the horror of success needs, no stars, no budgets, no digital effects, just an original story brought to life in an asylum, with a dozen cast members, and one dark and subtle, and certainly, the coup de théâtre. This is a real horror for true horror fans. 10/10
