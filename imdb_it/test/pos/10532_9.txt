"Children of wax" is also shown as "Killing grounds" is an interesting mixture of genres. Some might think that such purity can only be good, but for me the eclectic symbiosis is a lot of fun. It is also in its history the mixture of thriller and popular action, as well as the combination of the historical masterpiece and the ethnic demand for tolerance. This film is built with the starry presence of my favorite actor, the perfect Armand Assante, but is it also marked by the recitation of a shooting star ?? Hal Ozan. We saw it recently in the TV series on HBO called "Sex". "Children of the wax" is fun for the public, but at the same time it has an eternal morality for ethnic tolerance. This is a wise way to sow well-being. The discussion on contemporary problems of our day can be made with attractive means in this very positive aspect of the film "Children of the wax".
