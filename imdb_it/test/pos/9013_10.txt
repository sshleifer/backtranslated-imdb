Lovers of original films can really love this show, if only they stop complaining all the time. <br /> <br /> The Emperor's New School brings out old jokes from the film, like pulling the lever in Yzma's lab and Kuzco pauses the episode. But since it's a children's show, it's just classic and it's in the right place. Although the style is much simpler, the animation and the characters keep their personalities very well and actually surprised me. Eartha Kitt does an excellent dubbing for Yzma and J.P Manoux does a great job for Kuzco's voice instead of David Spade, who played Kuzco in the film. Great textures, hilarious moments and the incredible appearance of Kuzco make this show worth seeing. (Just stop complaining about everything!)
