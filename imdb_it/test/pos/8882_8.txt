This film is basically a parody of Hitchcock's Strangers on a train, which I considered overrated anyway. The plot sees Danny Devito going to see the Strangers and then thinking about Billy Crystal who wants to exchange the murders, Per Crystal kill his mother and Devito to kill his wife. Both Devito and Crystal are fantastic and so is Devito's mother. This is Devito's directorial debut and is better than the rose war.
