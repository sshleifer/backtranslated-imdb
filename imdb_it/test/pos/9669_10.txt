Ignore the comment before mine. The show is a comic genius, the most underrated show of all time. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, the flashbacks are hilarious, who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story, they make me laugh so much that it hurts and isn't it the idea of ​​a good comic program? People who think this isn't funny don't have a sense of humor. Who cares if they are random, is a t.v. show, you can do what you like with it and people say it's not realistic, nor is it a cartoon, it's animated. Reason 2, The jokes are generally hilarious, Seth McFarlane and the other writers are really funny, all from Star Wars references to teasing celebrities, I love them all. And Reason 3, the storylines are simply brilliant and fun, they created all the jokes with their crazy nature and their crazy, just more fun. <br /> <br /> I caught him late at night on BBC2 and I never came back, I have all 7 seasons, plus the movie genre (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have several shirts, posters and the my collection is still growing. I've never had a collection of any TV shows, but this was so funny that I just had to get everything. <br /> <br /> Just watch the third season and trust me you will be in love with life, the funniest show ever created and I hope it never ends!
