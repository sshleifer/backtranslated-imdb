There isn't much that comes close to perfect storytelling and action-packed levels of suspense like "GoldenEye". When it came out, it was the greatest game of all time, and even today it remains strong. <br /> <br /> I must admit that this game became boring after a few months of play, and not playing it again until two years later, I was back to its maximum, almost as if I were playing it for the first time. <br /> <br /> There are 20 action-packed levels, which is probably the most in any James Bond game to date. Probably the most unforgettable is the Tank level, which was probably the most explosive video game sequence at the time. And the first-person shooting and the use of Q gadgets is what James Bond fans always die from. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as a James Bond fan, I look for aspects of a true James Bond experience, which are now displayed in PS2 games. So this game, although it has some great action and usable gadgets, was waiting for me a little more, even in 1997. I also didn't like that this game didn't have Q or M or Moneypenny, or someone from MI6. While watching the films, Bond interacts with these characters at least a couple of times in each movie, but they are nowhere to be seen in this game. And the voice dialogue would have made the game more lively rather than the text dialogue they ended up with. They had the technology. They simply didn't use it. <br /> <br /> Probably the most annoying feature of this game is that it somehow follows the story of the movie accurately, and in other ways is inconsistent. For example, there are two levels in which you have to protect or save Natalya, even if she can take care of herself in the film. There are also some superfluous levels, like the Boat level where you have to disarm some bombs (which are not in the movie), which adds nothing to the plot. There are even some levels where you will save Natalya, but at the beginning of the next level, she is captured again. Such as? <br /> <br /> Oh well. Even those little things can't really put this game down. And while I prefer new games, this Bond experience is definitely the one you won't forget. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
