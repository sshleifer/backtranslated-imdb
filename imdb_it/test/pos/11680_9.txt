Absolutely one of the 10 best musical films ever! An absolutely essential educational experience for any music fan - Especially young rock / punk fans today ... understanding the beginning of any particular "artistic" movement absolutely requires an understanding of the roots of music, as well as mentality and 'musical environment of the times .... not to mention the political and social factors involved at the moment. And, besides all this, this documentary is a flat-out rock-n-roll movie !! Do not miss it!!! Having said that, can anyone tell me when, if ever, "the decline of Western civilization" ... part 1, (not part 2, the metal version) will be made available again..specially on DVD?
