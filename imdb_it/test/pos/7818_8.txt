A fascinating film enhanced by the musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. My understanding is that there has never been a soundtrack, but you could, through your sources, advise me where I can get information about the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang. Your help would be appreciated. The song really touched me and my wife and we would like to secure a copy where possible, so that we could reproduce it as background music when we have our family and friends for our "Italian Nights". If you are able to get this information, we will be eternally grateful. Although you can recommend the studio contacts so we can go directly. <br /> <br /> Greetings, <br /> <br /> John Payling
