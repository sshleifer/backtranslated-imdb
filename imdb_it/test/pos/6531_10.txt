I'm probably a little too old for this movie, 16, and being a boy, the story is a bit too feminine, but I really thought it was a fantastic film overall. All the girls in this film are such sexy and fantastic actresses, from Alana, to Adrianne, to Deena, to Kimberly, to the cute girl who plays Alana's little sister, Rachel. I'm not a big fan of pop-stars with love songs, but I thought Aaron Carter did a great job at this, and he seems to have been really involved in this movie, and made it real. My mother likes all the older farts she grew up with, so it's nice too. I kept thinking that I liked many people and I wonder if I will see them again? A sequel would be nice. I rented it, but I could also buy it, since I have a lot of DVDs, and I like to go back and see something I missed. I couldn't buy it at Blockbuster though, so I don't know where I could buy it now, but I'll think about it. Anyway, I'm a 16-year-old boy, I've said it before, I know, but I'd definitely like to take a date to see it. It's really good for all ages, really. I think even my 6-year-old half sister can see this. This is what is so beautiful, which is something that all ages can see. I'm sure it was done on purpose, but it really works. Girls can dream of being with Aaron Carter, and guys like me can dream about all the chicks in this movie. There is something for everyone.
