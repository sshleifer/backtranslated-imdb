Jordan accompanies us in the incredible crime of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of 19-year-old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who packages a job for a local gangster and has to amend before reaching him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a threatening group with a humorous vein in them. This is what makes the film work, because we always see the gangsters as a tough group to ruin you. But this mob also tickles your funny bone. A clever script written by Jordan has characters that cross and are captured in the web plot.
