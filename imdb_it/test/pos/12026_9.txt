This was really one of the funniest specialties I've seen on TV. He is simply an incredible artist. His personality shines through in each of the songs he does. I really wish this was available as an uncut DVD, so I could watch it over and over again without the -beep- for explicit language. I didn't get a chance to see it live, but it's something I really want to do now. I can't forget his reserve singers. They really added a lot of substance and humor to the show. With their campy style and flashy dance moves, they really complement Dan's true talent. I wish there were some other songs that are on his live CD, which is also incredible. It's nice to see someone like him perform. Simply incredibly personable and real, I can't really say enough good things about Dan and this show. Once again, I just wish it was available as an uncut DVD.
