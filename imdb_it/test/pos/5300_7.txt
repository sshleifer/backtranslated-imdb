Hayao Miyazaki's last and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by CGI masterpieces from Disney / Pixar, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on a traditional animation designed by hand to tell his fascinating and enchanting stories . <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the friendship between a magical marine sprite / goldfish and the human child he meets during a curious trip to see the human world. The human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in southern Japan (based on the island of Seto) where he lives with his young mother, Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke names the strange goldfish "Ponyo" and takes it to the nursery / care center where Lisa works. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon starts to adapt and take on human aspects (it develops a human language and an appetite for ham meat) by sampling blood from a cut on Sosuke's finger. <br /> <br /> Yet just as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop a bond, Ponyo is picked up by his father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now trying to collect and develops magic elixirs taken from the sea that help him repair and rejuvenate the oceans of the world. <br /> <br /> Ponyo's desire to become human has become so strong, however, that Fujimoto is no longer able to contain it and takes on a more human aspect and frees himself from his water world and returns to see Sosuke. <br /> <br /> During his breakout, Ponyo unintentionally releases the cache of Fujimoto's magic elixirs that unleashes all sorts of magical sea creatures that cause a violent storm in the seas surrounding the city of Sosuke. Desperate to solve the Ponyo rebellion, he soon calls for help from his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother - the water elemental, Mother / Lady of the Sea (Amami Yuki). <br /> <br /> Like his previous films, Miyazaki's "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" touches on various themes of ecology and environmentalism, this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence is sometimes sober when Ponyo meets a ship in distress that is scraping the ocean floor, uncovering mountains of garbage and debris. One can understand the anger and frustration of Fujimoto's character who spent his life trying to repair the damage that civilization is doing to his oceans, but finding it a daunting and almost unsuccessful endeavor. <br /> <br /> Just can't be said of the remarkable animation in this film. Sometimes it's bizarre and outrageous but at the same time fascinating and curious. Clearly Miyazaki wanted to capture the sense and style of a child's imagination. The artistic style looks like pencil and pastel drawings and is wonderfully colorful and imaginative. It's almost like the color book of a child that comes to life. <br /> <br /> The child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do a great job as Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring adorable charm to their roles. Nara Yuria in particular sounds so damn cute as Ponyo that it is not surprising that Sosuke of Doi falls in love with the magical girl. The former girl / model and actress of the Yamaguchi Tomoko campaign (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also very good in the role of Sosuke's modern mother, Lisa. At first I was a little confused by his character, since I initially thought he was Sosuke's older sister. Furthermore, he did not help Sosuke refer to her as "Lisa" rather than to Mom, but I imagine that it is perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family (in the animated series Crayon Shinchan, Shinnosuke also refers to his mother for first name). <br /> <br /> The 1980s comedian Tokoro Joji sounds totally different from the serious Fujimoto, but wisely does not make his character seem a little mischievous or threatening. While we don't know his character anymore, the former baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige (who plays Sosuke's father, Koichi) also offers a nice vocal work. The opening theme "Umi No Okasan" by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and moving. In contrast, the Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi theme "Geke No Ue No Ponyo" is light and fun and evokes images of a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme. During a brilliant sequence the soundtrack takes on an almost wagnerian operatic sound with a music that sounds like "Die Walk√ºre". <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect however and suffers from moments in which the central plot of Ponyo and Sosuke fades into the background compared to some of Miyazaki's fantastic visual effects. I also wanted to have more time to explore Fujimoto's back-story and the relationship between Sosuke and his father. <br /> <br /> Such as "Kiki's Delivery Service / Majo No Takkyubin", "Howl's Moving Castle", "Princess Momonoke / Momonoke Hime" and "My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro", "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" is another Miyazaki classic that is a wonderful feast for the eyes. Like a fairy tale of modern times, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be appreciated in the years to come.
