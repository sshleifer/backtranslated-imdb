Thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for luck. This was another unexpected jewel. Usually, I'm not even a fan of suspense / thriller. This satisfying 100 minutes has more twists than a catwalk pretzel. It has a titillating erotic romanticism, reminiscent of "Body Heat" in more than one way; has cops and crime; political intrigues and just a hint of soap during the day. It has the right touch of gritty violence that every professional "numbers" criminal job must employ. Emma Thompson, (FBI AIC), delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for the best false southern accent of a Limey. Alan Rickman, (local policeman), who always seems to steal the show, is excellent but not intrusive. They work well as a couple. A lot of plot errors that never get out of hand and are consistently reconnected to the end of the movie. And who is this fantastic woman, Carla Gugino? I want you to bring my children. Carla, if you're out there, we'll have lunch
