I can't get past the quality of the score, the book and the shows. This is the first production I've ever seen on Sweeney Todd, so I don't have any more to compare. But the impact is so strong, I can't imagine anything better. <br /> <br /> First, there is the music - take "Johanna" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing a vocal line plot that incorporates the melodies of three songs. It is like a Bach choir in this sense - just a masterpiece of composition. And the structure of chords and the underlying voices are so perfect - a bit of melancholy, a bit of contentment, a little desire, all expressing the point of view of these three singers. <br /> <br /> So - - The text. The rhymes are so clever. Rhyme patterns sometimes seem random but always add up at the end. (The DVD, which I saw, has Closed Captions, and these are indispensable for appreciating dialogue and lyrics.) Sondheim deserves a literary award only for his poetry. <br /> <br /> Finally, the performances. I can't imagine anyone better than George Hearn. Why didn't I hear it before? His singing alone is masterful, but the range of his acting is simply incredible. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song about "you and me by the sea" - who could do better? His timing is impeccable, the tone is perfect, every beat of the score is justified; and superimposing this milestone in musicality is his comedy being completely delicious. <br /> <br /> It's a dark fairy tale, but sometimes I found it to be sweet; and the melody of "Johanna" continues to play in my head.
