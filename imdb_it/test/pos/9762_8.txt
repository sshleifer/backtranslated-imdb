This is one of my favorite books and I remember watching this series and loving it immensely. Unfortunately I never saw it repeated or was able to get it on DVD, but it had such an impact that I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> The protagonists were perfect for the roles, in particular the adorable Bryan Brown and although the scenes in Australia were not entirely consistent with the book, at least they were there, unlike the film version with Virginia McKenna who missed this part entirely. <br /> <br /> I agree that Strachan's character of Gordon Jackson is completely different from the book, but it is still excellent. For your information "MOLEY75" "Strawn" is the Gaelic pronunciation of "Strachan".
