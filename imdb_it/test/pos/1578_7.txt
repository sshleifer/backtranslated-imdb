Kazuo Komizu strikes again with "The Bowels of a Beautiful Woman", the sequel to "The Wombs of a Virgin". This time the story is based on a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to hire the Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a drugged and raped patient who stops on the doorstep one day. When she gets up and the Yakuza catches her, she learns their insidious sinker to take drugs and sell them in slavery. Apparently he ends up sick when he overdosed on cocaine. But soon merges with another body to be disposed of to become ?? dum, dum, dum ?? "Super Slime Hermaphrodite Zord"! This he, she = does chop meat from the yakuza and save the day ?? not exactly. <br /> <br /> Well, it's better than "The guts of a Virgin", but not by much. Most of the film (huge 67 minutes) consists of rape and sex with fogging and the usual ho-hum stuff. Almost towards the end, we finally get our gore groove with some cool sequence (like a Alien-inspired penis through the stomach scene and a suffocating asphyxia) but it still suffers from a low budget feeling that makes it fun but can elevate from the z-grade soft horror rate.
