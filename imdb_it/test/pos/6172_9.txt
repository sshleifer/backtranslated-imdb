I have been an IMDB devotee for a few years. This is the film that eventually forced me to write in a review. <br /> <br /> I took this movie by accident (the opening credits occurred when I turned on the TV one morning). I really enjoyed the film for many reasons, which were well covered by other reviewers: the bad mood, the forgotten history of the Czech pilots, the subtle charm of supporting characters, the fatalism of the main characters and the first view of the person during the scenes of battle. <br /> <br /> But the element of "Dark Blue World" that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during the fight (and this is a good thing!). While the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them, no manipulative stroke of worried boyfriends / girlfriends were intertwined, every little aerial maneuver did not arouse trivial patriotic applauses, and the spectators were not asked to swallow the incredible heroism of James pilot Bond. Instead, the public can feel the melancholy, fear and isolation of these individual pilots as they try to stay high during the fight. As the comrades are shot down, they save us screams of tears and the typical (but pleasant public) heroism based on revenge. Instead the other drivers sadly and quietly observe the fate of their fellow driver - in reality they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and goals at that time. We only briefly experience the pilot's breathing and the engine's background roar as we, the audience, witness a spiral of friends until his death. And then immediately 'we' need to return to combat mode and focus on survival. <br /> <br /> Too often in Hollywood we are fed by spoonfuls of the emotions we should try and there is no room for the imagination of the viewer. "Dark Blue World" maintains a sparseness that fascinates and involves the viewer, allowing us to invest in the film and fill in the gaps and spaces using our thoughts and feelings. <br /> <br /> Excellent film, worth seeing.
