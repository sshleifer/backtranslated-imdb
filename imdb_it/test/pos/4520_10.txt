Recently I was lucky enough to see "The Kite Runner" in a small theater, surrounded by experienced film-goers who knew how to appreciate a masterpiece of such refinement. With all the controversy surrounding the central scene of this film these days, I expected a piece that was both raw and violent. But the way Mr. Forster handled the delicate subject was moving and truly moving. Even though the film's credits indicated China as the main filming location, I could have sworn I was seeing Kabul in all the scenes that were going to take place in Afghanistan. The acting, by non-professional actors and professionals, is excellent and the casting is magnificent. So this is a film I would like to see again and again, because although it is undeniably sad in its subject, the masterful way in which it was created awakens new hope in modern cinema.
