<br /> <br /> After reading the critics of the unemployed, reviewed, I went to a screening of "Radio" without knowing what to expect. Fortunately, the unemployed critic now appears to me, as far as I'm concerned, a frustrated film director / critic. His review is senseless and totally new to! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make you laugh, make you cry and finally give you a break! <br /> <br /> To paraphrase a sentence delivered by Actor Ed Harris in the final scene of the Barbershop "... and for all this time that we thought to teach Radio, the truth is ... he was teaching us. He treats us always, as we would like to treat each other, a little time! "<br /> <br /> Yes, the film picks up the strings of the heart. Yes, he is emotionally manipulative and yes Cuba Gooding Jr. (In a performance worthy of the Oscars) is a bit exaggerated (see the Christmas dance scene) but you know what? SO! From time to time the American community needs to remember what tolerance can do for our great country. We must remember how big we can be. <br /> <br /> This is a solid cast. I was particularly pleased to see S. Epatha Merkerson, who portrays Radio's mother, do something outside of Law and Order. I've always wondered, Miss Merkerson is a great actor or is the quality of the writing delivered to buy a strong cast on Law and Order. After watching this movie, it's easy to see that she's really a very good actor. <br /> <br /> Also, joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is Alfre Woodard as the principal, Debra Winger in a career -reporting the role of Coach Jones's wife and Chris Mulkey as Protagonist, Frank Clay . <br /> <br /> We can't watch Ed Harris's performance as Coach Harold Jones. After reflecting on this film and growing up in the deep South, it is difficult to really appreciate Mr. Harris and his contribution to this film. Like Coach Jones, Ed offers a quiet and solid performance, that of a man on a mission. Coach Harris won't let the city or circumstances detach him from what he knows in his heart, it's the right thing to do. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, make sure you go around the end credits. You will be amazed how the real James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy, now in his mid-50s, is shown, still leading the T.L. Hanna Football team on the field every Friday night. <br /> <br /> One last note. If you were a teenager between the mid and late 70s, this movie is worth the admission price, just for the soundtrack!
