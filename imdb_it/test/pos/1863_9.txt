This is certainly a touching film and a great expression of Charles Darwin's personal struggle. The film is not just about his struggle to publish his book "the origin of the species", but also his relationship with his eldest daughter. At first her daughter was the only person in her family to approve her opinions, which she also had to pay. A little more than him sometimes. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, in fact I think it has managed to remain very neutral. A difficult thing to do in my opinion. obviously it does not condone the way in which the characters were treated by the church, quite the contrary. If you need me to use big words to shed light on this movie; will please both deists and atheists, but move away from theism. The film is about evolution, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course we can all think of Darwin as that old man with a funny beard, but this film focuses on the man between 20 and 30 years old. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but the actor who struck me was Martha West as Annie Darwin, daughter of Darwins. Surely one of the best child actors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and is beautifully performed. <br /> <br /> Except for some temporary jumps that were momentarily confused, the production of this film is quite flawless. Some scenes have been observed by Darwin. Nature is simply wonderful, and has almost come out of a high-production national geographic documentary. I must admit that I'm not entirely sure why they chose "Creation" as the title. I doubt it's an irony, the film is too respectful for that. Well, I'm sure this also has meaning, don't let that scare you. <br /> <br /> I give this movie at 9/10. This is indeed a great tribute to Charles Darwin, and please give him a chance.
