This was a pretty good episode. Although there were no "Trapped in the Closet" or "Cartoon Wars", he had a lot of things to do. The character of Al Gore and that strange "super cereal" thing were really fun. But the scene that made me adore this episode was one that I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman / Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious about Kyle he will steal his gold (which of course is fake!), And he comes within inches of his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up and they have that crazy conversation in which Cartman tries to behave as if everything is perfect. Cartman who was looking for the treasure in the end, even if predictably, was pretty funny.
