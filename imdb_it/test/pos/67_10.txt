This film by Blake Edwards is not sure if it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. Never mind, the mere presence of Julie Andrews is reason enough to see this dramatic-musical-spy comedy. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but more than satisfying, like Julie's romantic interest. Authentic cars and planes from the First World War are added to the appeal. Overall, the film is a lot of fun. The DVD version is a modified version (of Blake Edwards) of the original version. Presumably, this is the only version allowed by Edwards; but, Turner Classic Movies recently showed the full version (movie version). Recommended.
