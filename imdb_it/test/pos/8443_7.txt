It's been years since I saw this movie, so I forget most of the details. However, I loved it at that time and found the plot intensely compelling, the beating heart stopped. I remember being literally on the edge of my theater in 1979. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays a journalist from Los Angeles, Kimberley, who runs into an accident at a local nuclear power plant. He wants to make the story public, helped by his hippy cameraman (Michael Douglas) who photographed the event, but a sinister conspiracy tries to cover everything. Jack Lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the middle manager in conflict between nuclear power plants, split between loyalty to his company and "doing the right thing" bringing back the dangerous situation. His facial expressions speak very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to the compelling storyline and compelling tension, this film is about Jack Lemmon, his character and his superb acting. As for Jane Fonda (at the time I was a big fan of her), I suspect she went from her protests against the war to the nuclear industry. <br /> <br /> This film looks like a nuclear fright tactic. Despite Chernobyl and Three Mile Island (they are different types of reactors), our Canadian CANDU reactor is safe and respected worldwide. I would not hesitate to reside near the nuclear power plant about an hour away, where my friend works as a very competent engineer. Apparently they closed for every teenage problem, regardless of financial loss. I honestly doubt that there are conspiracies walking there. One can hardly imagine any of the highly qualified managers or operators willing to risk any type of merger or anything else ... it is absolute nonsense. Obviously the moral here is not to save costs or efforts either in the construction of the structure or in ensuring its continuous safety. <br /> <br /> If we want our western lifestyle, we must get our energy somewhere. For those who claim that nuclear power can never be made completely safe (true, of course), perhaps they should volunteer as a coal miner or go back to the pre-electric days of horses and buggies. <br /> <br /> By all means, enjoy this funny and very suspenseful film, which apparently relies (vaguely? embellished?) on a true story. It's a real cooler, a thriller, and maybe (?) Even a murderer, but please, don't take your attitude towards the operation and safety of nuclear power plants into consideration.
