As for the fake documentaries (fakumentaries anyone?), This is up there with the best! It looks very real and this is what it aims for. In light of recent events (Guantanamo) this film is even scarier, so you could say it was ahead of its time when it was released in the 70s! <br /> <br /> One can only hope that such a government does not exist! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that? Obviously the people interviewed all looked the same (mentality of the 70s): screwing politicians and politics in general. Maybe he wasn't so smart you might think ... but hey, don't forget: it's just a movie! ; OR)
