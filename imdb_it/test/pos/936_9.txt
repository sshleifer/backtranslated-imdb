This is the latest film by Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. He intended to retire after this film, so in a sense it's his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after making the film, and although it was said that he intended to return to directing, Destiny decided that this was indeed his last. And what a movie! <br /> <br /> 'Rouge' the latest film in three colors The French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Set in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a retired Swiss judge, and in Durenmatt it immediately comes to mind. But there is more Switzerland in the cool atmosphere, in the lack of communication of the characters, in the kindness that surrounds the cruelty of life. Several characters that start with a small relationship will eventually join in a moving and human final, which only a great artist could have staged. <br /> <br /> Little else can be said that has not been said and written hundreds of times. Yes, the film starts slowly, and fans of the American style of action movies or melodramas will be discouraged first and lose themselves as spectators. They deserve it. The film gets quality as it progresses, and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than cartoons and plastic scenes and Hollywood characters. The quality of the cinema is very original, the image is a 'Study in Red', as the title shows. Acting is fabulous, with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - the latest in what will probably remain the best role of his old age. <br /> <br /> A great movie. Seeing him again probably adds, and I'm glad I recorded it on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.
