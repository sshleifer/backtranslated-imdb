The Soap is an interesting and very bright film in some parts. You have to look at it for its strong characterization and for the risks that the plot of two individuals in difficulty that fall in love takes. You need to know the story through various other reviews, so let's talk about what's brilliant in this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the two protagonists are so real and intriguing personalities. The first is a woman who has given up a four-year relationship and is angry enough to be able to sleep with anyone approaching her. The second is a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness is shown with such sensitivity and brilliance. You hate the first and your heart bleeds for the latter. <br /> <br /> The second thing about this film is the whole concept of loving one for what one is, regardless of gender. So, would you still like to love your partner if he were to change his sex? The film explores that idea and is beautiful. <br /> <br /> But there is a point where the film fails. I wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way. What they feel is that love does not meet until the end. But look at it and publish your thoughts here .......
