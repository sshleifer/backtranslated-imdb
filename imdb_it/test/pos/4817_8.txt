The world is about to lose John Frankenheimer. This was his first feature film and four years earlier he directed his second film, but don't be deterred from looking for it. Frankenheimer's direction is assured, and he gets some interesting performances from his cast. <br /> <br /> Someone else has already mentioned them, but I also want to talk to James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two key support roles. Both would work again for Frankenheimer - Gregory in particular as the clumsy senator in "The Manchurian Candidate" - and do a good job for him here. <br /> <br /> If everything seems too simple in the end, this is only because Frankenheimer and writer Robert Dozier have chosen to tell a simple story, and they do it well. Be careful - Turner Classic Movies may show it again.
