Anand is one of those low budget but well-taken films. It is a "cup of coffee" entertainment, without violence, blood or "jumping out of the house" the excitement that most Telugu movies have. However, it has some massals of its own. Roopa is a stubborn, down-to-earth young woman who isn't afraid to face any kind of situation, even for her offensive mother-in-law disgust for her. He even withdraws from the wedding because his boyfriend does not defend her. However, her air of trust and independence is enough to make Anand, a rich young gentleman who lives in the city, aspire to be her new husband. His father accidentally kills his parents in a car accident, so why not pay it off? But Roopa is not the type that will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior, she puts him in a series of situations, continues to be rude and painful. It's not until she gets up for her and saves her life that she understands that she loves him too. But are there any complications?
