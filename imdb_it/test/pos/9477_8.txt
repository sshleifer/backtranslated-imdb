This is what James Cagney is all about, jokes, boldness, hard as nails and no-frills charisma. <br /> <br /> Although the plot looks serious, the film is anything but. It is done in the comic style of the 1930s and works well with his "arguing" with boyfriend Mae Clark and his reactions to the high stories of his colleague James Burke. <br /> <br /> What sets it above the norm is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it. The dialogue is good but it's nothing unless the delivery is right and can bounce on the characters involved. This is well done by everyone. <br /> <br /> Have fun and be extremely pleasant.
