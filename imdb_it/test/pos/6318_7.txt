One of the most significant quotations of the entire film is pronounced in the middle of the protagonist, the mediator of the mafia Titta Di Girolamo, a middle-aged man, physically non-descriptive, originally from Salerno, in southern Italy. When presented to him at the beginning of the film, in the last ten years he lived a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton Ticino, conducting an activity that is gradually introduced to. While this fundamental but apparently insignificant scene takes place, the employees of the Swiss bank that normally count Di Girolamo's money tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of stacked banknotes. At the news, he quietly but jealously threatens his renowned bank manager to want to close his account. Meanwhile, the spectators are told that when he bluffs, he has to bluff to the end without fear of being discovered or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway, tell the truth. Having finally done this - he only bluffed halfway and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's problems. <br /> <br /> This initially obnoxious character, a frowning, taciturn and abrupt man, on the brink of 50 years, a man who will not even respond in kind to the maids and waitresses who greet and greet, becomes at a certain point someone to whom the viewer holds a lot. At some point in his non-life, Titta decides to worry about appearing "ridiculous". The first half of the film could be described as "slow" by some. In fact, it reveals the days and nights of Di Girolamo in that hotel with a deliberately disjointed rhythm, revealing apparently banal and irrelevant details. However, the scenes that may seem unnecessary reveal how essential they are as this innovative and masterful film develops before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man without imagination, identity or life, the antipathetic character who unexpectedly end up loving and trying when you least expect it - is also transmitted with elegantly modified sequences and the use of very interesting music (one especially the theme of the Scottish band Boards of Canada stood out in particular). <br /> <br /> It was never the contrast between the way in which Hollywood and Italy deal with the mafia more in disagreement than with the release of films like The Consequences of Love or The Embalmer. Another interesting element was the way the film used the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a much more explicit way, the film Al Pacino Insomnia), The Consequences of Love uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional malaise that has been rammed so deeply into the darkness of the unconscious, it is almost impossible to pin down the cause (if indeed there is one). <br /> <br /> The young and friendly waitress of the hotel Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, nephew of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man she hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a small window on life that Titta eventually (albeit provisionally at the beginning) agrees to look through again. Even if it is never explicitly stated, the viewer KNOWs that for a man like Titta, accepting The consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that takes place in its time and does not give anything to the expectations of the viewer, The Consequences of Love is an excellent representative of that small, silent, discreet Renaissance that took place in Italian cinema from the decline of Cinecittà in the second half of the 1970s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more dishes like Il Postino, more films La Vita è Bella ... neglecting to explore excellent creations like The Consequences of Love, The Embalmer and others. Your loss, world.
