Some commented that subtitles are not a problem in this film - I beg to disagree - the annoyances in facial expressions and the subtle interactions between the characters are such that you cannot afford to look away even for a fraction of a second. I tried looking at the DVD in English to overcome this problem (don't make this mistake, the result is a parody). The only way to get the maximum benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession, so you know it and then ignore the subtitles. A master of acting - not in dialogue but in body language. <br /> <br /> It's the little things - the postmaster / shopkeeper pulls out his chest and picks up his cap before delivering a letter from! France! The confused expression of the general as his joy in a cluster of perfect grapes gives rise to a biblical reference with a depth worthy of "Being There". <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic and the minimalist village with its washed color accentuates the sumptuousness of the party when it arrives. I have a friend who claims to be a descendant of the Borgias and whose motto is "If it's worth doing, it's worth doing in excess" - Amen. <br /> <br /> I laugh out loud and cry every time I watch this movie
