I expected this film to suck, but what I got was a nice slasher / gore movie. Most death scenes are adequately brutal. Teenagers are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the group. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie except that. Kane was good as a murderer and is absolutely credible as a terrible juggernaut. I saw the "twist" that came from miles away, but I still liked the movie. <br /> <br /> But what really struck me was the management. Gregory Dark could actually have a career in the legit movie before him. Apart from the excessive use of the horror movie "speed cam" (you know, where does the boy's face shake fast?), There are some good shots here. Camera angles and environments really emphasize Kane's size, making it look even bigger than it really is. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for deep stories or characters, it's not. But that's not what slasher movies are. If you are looking for some good violence, or if you like gory movies, take a look at it!
