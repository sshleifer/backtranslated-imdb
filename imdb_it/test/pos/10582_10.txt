Okay, let me break down for you ... Haggard is probably one of the most fun and useless movies you've ever seen. It has a mixture of a unique storyline of a boy who has problems with the girl and all that is going back for him mixed with countless humorous scenes that will make you laugh throughout the movie, basically, if you've seen jackass or the CKY series , Know what to expect for humor, considering that it has most of the people of those movies. Overall ... I had to give him a 10/10 because it's one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> ~ F0rs4k3n <br /> <br /> (P.S.) Haggard Rules!
