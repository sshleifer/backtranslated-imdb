The British-born Australian pilot Alex Frayne draws attention with his strange, which requires a meticulous, visually surprising reading Modern Love (2006). Following in the footsteps of a man unable to control a drastic personality change stimulated by the death of a close relative offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. <br /> <br /> John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small southern town to take care of his deceased uncle (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward check in a local hotel, John starts to question the locals about Uncle Tom's death - some say he committed suicide, some are unwilling to talk. Puzzled John arrives with his own theory - Uncle Tom is alive and well, hidden in the nearby bushes. <br /> <br /> Were it not for the occasional lines of dialogue used to alleviate his heavy atmospheric tone, Modern Love could have easily been mistaken for a Sokurov film. Shot with a 16 mm camera, its washed color scheme is strangely evocative of the Russian director's reflective incursions into human agony. Perhaps it is not a coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where Modern Love had its preview. <br /> <br /> Looking beneath the surface of this extraordinary collage of heady images reveals a slightly different picture - while Sokurov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to the point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the environment surrounding, blurring everything into a broad touch of the director's favorite yellow, Modern Love feeds heavily on the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation depends on it and the more the story progresses the more obvious it becomes that nature is an integral part of Frayne's vision. <br /> <br /> In the second circle of Sokurov a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury his deceased father. In the shack where the old man once lived, everything is covered in dust. He picks up the few old clothes scattered and puts his father's body in a coffin. Then he says goodbye and buries him. The rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and dissatisfaction that many have left behind. <br /> <br /> In Modern Love, a little ironically, love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary, it is the pain, the loneliness and the dissatisfaction with "modernity" that suddenly invade John's life. Unlike The Second Circle, however, here the main protagonist has the opportunity to embrace his modern life. His wife and son are waiting for him, however, he leaves. Slowly but inexorably the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confused past. <br /> <br /> I doubt that Frayne wanted Modern Love to be so extraordinarily similar to what Sokurov did in The Second Circle. However, the rhythm, and in particular the disturbing framing, are exactly what turns this film into an almost meditative experience - a difficult and enormously fragile approach to the deconstruction of human psychology that the two directors have mastered to perfection. <br /> <br /> Mark Constable offers first-class performance while John adds even more depth to his extremely challenging character. His facial expressions are exceptional. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger combine perfectly with the taut visual style of their performances.
