What a beautiful film this is. I found it filled with the deliciously unexpected pain of being a single father to a teenage girl. And it's set in a heavenly paradise on the tropical island. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European touch to this story of a divorced father of a teenage girl. I'm on vacation together and she starts adding excitement to the island in many unexpected ways. But you will have to see the movie for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves. <br /> <br /> There are some cult classics that all kids should see. This film should be added to the list. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, My Father the Hero should be asked to study the film. Look at it as if you had a teenage daughter and you'll be rolling with laughter. Watch it with your teenage daughter and get ready to be mocked for months.
