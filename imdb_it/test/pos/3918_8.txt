This is one of the best horror / suspense films that Hollywood has made in years or maybe decades. Although in my opinion this film was predictable in parts, it has everything a good movie in this genre should have CHILL, THRILLS, AND yes a lot of GORE !! HOUSE OF WAX SURE DELIVERS !!! In part it was a bit far-fetched, the acting wasn't that good, but my review of HOUSE OF WAX is eight out of ten ... if you like being on the edge of your seats, this is the right movie for you, I must admit, it was nice enough to see the whole city made of wax ...... I like these museums, but after watching this movie I'll watch them now in a completely new different way!
