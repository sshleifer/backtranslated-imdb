But not too trendy. And not too witty. "Judas Kiss" nails the new right noir thing. An impressive rhythm and nuanced score complete a compelling story full of sex, betrayal and sure fire. Stimulating work all around. Congratulations in particular to HalHolbrook (his best work ever), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-what?) And Carla Gugino (the best fatal family ever ... intelligent, funny and ultra HOT) ... I give him a 9 (out of 10) and this is because 10 should be reserved for films like Humphrey Bogart and Coen Bros.
