Attention, My Lovely is an experimental studio film of the early 1950s and was directed by a man, Harry Horner, best known for his set designs. Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and does not know it. Miss Lupino is an empathic soul and tries to conquer Ryan, with little success. It is not the kind of compassion that man could help or cure. So we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can't do well because there's something wrong with him. He suffers from periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence, which he then forgets. <br /> <br /> Essentially the effect that Ryan has on Lupine is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. The public soon finds out that Ryan is a crazy killer, but it takes much longer for Lupino. So we have to live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to "win" Ryan to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. But going on with things is not in Ryan's composition, since he is incapable of any more rudimentary form of normality, and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia becomes established. <br /> <br /> As a study of mental illness, the film is not too impressive. What makes it superlative is to show the effect of the main mental illnesses, with the dangerous psychopathology in the mix and its effect on a normal person. In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, although inexorably logical in that we know that Lupino cannot "fix" Ryan, yet we want her to do it. The result is that, if one is willing, one can be extremely emotionally involved in this film if one can put aside its melodramatic structure, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Gradually, Horner shows us the Casa Lupino layout, a prohibitive Gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with stairs, kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which not.
