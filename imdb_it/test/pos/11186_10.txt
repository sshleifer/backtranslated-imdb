"The Curse of Monkey Island" is a treasure; in my opinion the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure games, not to mention LucasArts. <br /> <br /> But to go back to "Curse", what's nice about CMI is that it's not afraid of being itself. It differs from the first two but remains faithful to the productions of Ron Gilbert (if the same could be said of the 4th chapter of the series!). Vocal work is impeccable, with Dominic Armato playing our favorite protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. The animation, although different from the classic pixel characters, is performed beautifully. It is really simply amazing. And the music is fantastic! It's never annoying and you never want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Even if I'm not a big fan of romance, the romantic scenes and themes are not at all oppressive. They also have the rare ability to come out as a dessert instead of cheese. This says a lot to a girl who usually falls asleep during chick gestures. <br /> <br /> So, of course, it's the classic MI element of humor. CMI is quite adept at providing impassive lines, a completely absurd humor and simply good fun. Gary Coleman makes a cameo as a young budding entrepreneur, and world events are fairly well beaten without going beyond the limits of the game. <br /> <br /> It is not entirely fair to compare CMI with MI and MI2 because it really is in a realm of its own. Personally I can never find a favorite among the 3 as they are all very different from each other. However, if you want a good swagging moment with the charm of the classic series, I insist you give this game a shot. You will NOT be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, hands down. <br /> <br /> - Emily N
