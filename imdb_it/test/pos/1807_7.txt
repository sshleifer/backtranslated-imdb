There were a lot of stupid teenagers who had sex with movies from the 80s and a lot of slasher movies, but there were only a tip that was made of thoughts, they made you laugh and caught the right time; this was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, so is Forman who has disappeared from the limelight in Hollywood since his bio unfortuatley. I'd like to see it published on DVD with a special version with comments from Cage and Forman. Poor thought, I know. You ever want to plan a real 80's movie weekend, rent this, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club. It will take you back to "Totally Rad", which at the time seemed to be much simpler. Memo to the studios: it's time to publish the DVD!
