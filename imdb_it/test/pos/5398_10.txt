IMAGINARY HEROES is a nice little movie! Written and directed by Dan Harris, this story is a classic theater, which weaves comedy and tragedy so closely that the climax of the film takes your breath away. <br /> <br /> The Travis family is a strange group: no member is who everyone seems to be. Beginning with a suicide of the reluctant "hero" swimming champion Matt (Kip Pardue), his father Ben (Jeff Daniels) falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself while his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) turns to anger and anger and sarcasm, the daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) returns from school rejected by the behavior of her family, and the remaining son Tim (Emile Hirsch) takes the weight of all of the above by avoiding classmates, girlfriend and teams with his neighbor Kyle (Ryan Donowho) to jump into drugs and sexual experimentation. Throughout the movie Tim tries to hide the bruises on his body that have a secret all their own, but they lead his girlfriend to feel rejected, her mother rages against the trailer bully who believes it is the cause, and finally opens the window to the deep scars this family has suffered for years. Secrets and lies, here, and the resolution of them is painfully dramatic. <br /> <br /> It could be the best role of Sigourney Weaver, although Emile Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho and Kip Pardue (despite the shortness of his roles) all contribute high-level performances. The story begins slowly and seems to wander and this fact could make some viewers lose their attention, but being with this little power film and the impact of the work will stun you. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
