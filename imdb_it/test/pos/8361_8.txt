Like many episodes of the twilight zone, one of my favorite parts of this was the explicit social commentary that Serling is making with history. As in the case of a recent episode "The Howling Man", I was reminded of my old suspicion that, for example, if Jesus came to earth to bring his followers to Heaven, he would immediately be judged crazy and probably thrown into an asylum . Our main character in this episode encounters a similar problem when trying to convince the Americans of 1860 that it is of the future and President Lincoln is about to be assassinated. The episode erroneously states that this means that some parts of the past can be changed while others are not, but it is still a fun time to travel while traveling. <br /> <br /> Of course, we don't know for sure if the story could have changed from time travel, because time travel has never been accomplished and, unfortunately, it never will be. But it seems logical to me that if you could physically fit yourself into a period of the past, you could physically prevent something from happening, as long as you don't freak out like a madman screaming about murders. <br /> <br /> One of the constantly interesting things about time travel movies and TV shows, in my opinion, is the method by which time travel takes place. There's really no method here, our main character is having a conversation about time travel in an elegant gentlemen's club and then walks out and dissolves from the early 1960s to the mid-1860s, but it doesn't matter . The twilight zone so far has not affected me for its complex sets or high production values. <br /> <br /> Russell Johnson plays the part of Peter Corrigan, the time traveler, and after discovering that he was somehow transported back to the exact day of the Lincoln assassination, he manages to get himself thrown into prison, but fortunately for him John Wilkes Booth, for some reason, just left the police station and overheard the frantic Corrigan trying desperately to describe the murder he had planned that night. <br /> <br /> Booth requires custody of Corrigan for some psychiatric experiments, and the police officer sees nothing wrong with leaving this guy's custody. He had a business card, after all, how bad could it be? <br /> <br /> The show seems to suggest that you can change people's lives by slightly altering events in the past through time travel, and while I am not willing to accept that time travel includes such limitations, it is anyway a funny episode that really makes you think, which is one of my favorite qualities of good shows in the twilight zone ...
