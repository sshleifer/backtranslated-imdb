What can I say? This morning I got up and turned on science fiction and watched half of the first season and understood everything. Strange, unusual and brilliant. It gives all the potential, and first I think this is stupid. This must be the next best thing from the X-Files, but as always nothing will ever stop seeing that show in my opinion. I'm telling you, it's scary and then full of suspense and so sweet. Towards the end you have Miles like a puppy of love with a strange pet that is a new species. You have two people running away from the authorities. And a tsunami killer about to hit! Wow! And I said that Miles' pet is a potential killer (well, the rest of his kind is). Surface is a brilliant show with turns and twists offering everything.
