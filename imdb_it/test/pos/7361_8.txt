I can't believe I liked it as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than the par, but the connecting story and its surprise ending really got me excited. A lot of familiar faces will keep you asking "where did I see them before?" Forget the running time listed on the New Line tape, it's not 103 minutes, according to my VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot spits fire in his own particular way and makes an 8.
