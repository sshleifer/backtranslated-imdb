The A-team repeats itself every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team ... I absolutely love them !! It's just nice to see Justin chase after former A-Team members. Brings back memories of the old days, when I was a sweet young man. I would have given you a 10 for the excellent, but Justin seems to be chasing after former A team members alone. Of course, this is the only negative thing about this documentary. Too bad that Justin doesn't look for Melinda Culea ("Amy A. Allen"). But it's nice to see Mr. T. return to action. Too bad for him, in the end he doesn't show up at the party. But that party is too short to laugh again and see everyone in action again.
