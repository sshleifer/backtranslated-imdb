Turkish culture is complete with many different cultures. different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like the turkey mixture. it has mostly the same language but different dialects. This documentary shows us these different types of music with different dialects and different instruments. you can watch reportages with singers and groups, their performances, their daily life and learn their thoughts on music. the film includes not only Istanbul music but also life in Istanbul, how people communicate and what they eat and drink. the surprising part is that, even though I live in Istanbul, I learned a lot from this film.
