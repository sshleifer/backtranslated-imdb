I went to see this film I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised by the team of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. It was a fast movie and an hour and a half passed quickly. This certainly won't win any Academy Awards but it was a change of pace for Mr. De Niro. He's good at comedy. Overall I liked it.
