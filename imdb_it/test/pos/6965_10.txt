Sixth (and last) film in the box set. Well, it looks like I saved the best for last. Ghoulies IV. I originally did a review for this in February, but decided to make a new one. The Ghoulies series is really fantastic. I know there are some people who don't like them, and that's fine. This seems to be my favorite in the series. Yes, I know that the real Ghoulies do not appear and are replaced by 2 costumed boys, one of whom is Tony Cox from Bad Santa. Now, in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Jonathan Graves, the main character of the first film, once again played by Peter Liapis, who is now a LAPD cop and has put his past as an occult behind him . During the first part of the film, we meet Alexandra (played by Stacie Randall) who communicates with a demon named Faust, which is the dark side of Jonathan. Faust asks Alexandra for a red jewel and something goes wrong, thus unleashing the Ghoulies from the beyond. I think Jim Wynorski did a good job with directing. And Chuck Cirino's music is fun too. (SPOILER AHEAD) At the end of this film, the Ghoulies say that there will be Ghoulies IV, Part 2, or Ghoulies V. I still hope the sequel will be realized and I especially hope that Jim Wynorski returns to direct. I agree with GimboTheGhoulies on this.
