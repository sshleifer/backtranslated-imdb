If you speak French or can stand the subtitles, you'll love this movie. If instead you just want to see the most beautiful creatures of God, this is a must see. Not an ounce of silicon in sight. Zalman King eats your heart. Sophie Marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything I've ever fantasized. His part is also in English. Even the fact that she was naked with John Malkovich did not detract from her beauty. Sophie is a dozen if ever there was one. Chiara Caselli and In√©s Sastre are 9.5. Oh yes, it's a good story. Several small vignettes are woven together in a kind of Six Degrees of Separation style.
