I just saw this movie this morning and discovered that it is a great demonstration of the richness of faith. Babette gave them another way of looking at life; not a replacement, but an improvement. He shared everything he had with those who gave what little they had to her. I see the story of God here. He sent his only son to the man. The man could not give anything that was equivalent to that. So, for our little sacrifice, we are given a definitive treasure and transformed for it. In this film, quarrelsome citizens have consumed themselves with a small interpretation of God. Babette has shown them that life and God can really be beautiful in its fullest sense. The love that the son of God has shown to man is the love we should show to each other and our lives will be richer for this. The film is also a metaphor. At first it seems slow, but in the end the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded. It was really a party.
