Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic dramas, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of the most exaggerated dramas of Shakespeare and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I don't like him, and I didn't do it after seeing this. <br /> <br /> Even if you have fantastic actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of Dane, and Patrick Stewart in the role of Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, he cannot mask the lack of passion in the plot. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion, he makes the whole role incomprehensible. I couldn't connect his characterization to what he was saying, and that killed him for me. That being said, get the "Be or not to be" speech as his actions with a dagger clarify the suicidal intentions of the character at that point in the game. <br /> <br /> The secondary roles, for me better written and, consequently, better played, are amusing, in particular the hazy Ophelia by Lalla Ward and the well-detailed interpretation of Stewart by Claudius. <br /> <br /> At four and a half hours, it is very long and better looked at bites than pieces of size. Check it out if you're interested but get ready for a long watch.
