"Dope Sick Love" is a truly remarkable documentary made for HBO on two pairs of heroin addiction lovers wandering the streets of New York. I managed to get it one night by accident and found it absolutely fascinating. There is no narration and we never see any interview with the subjects, the camera simply follows them, like a third eye, completely detached. The people that are followed don't even seem to know they were filmed! (or, at least, they don't seem to care). The footage is incredibly sincere. Some of the most candid I've ever seen. This is as real as it becomes. The nuts and bolts of what it's like to be on the road and addicted to heroin. We watch them make calculations, shoot, make up, push and even impersonate cops to rob people, and about a million other little details that the less observant documentarists would leave out. <br /> <br /> Some of the footage is truly terrifying. Like looking at a boy who desperately seeks correction, he lost. I found myself praying that he would find him, just so that his suffering would end temporarily. And when he finds it, the boy literally dances on the street. <br /> <br /> The cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very evident while watching this. EVERYTHING is about getting the next score for these people, but the next score seems to be worth the immense problem they went through. <br /> <br /> I would like to have a copy of this if anyone knows where it is available. Highly recommended, if you can get it on HBO.
