I've actually seen the movie several times. And what I want to say about it is that the only thing that made this high-level film was the incredible performance of Burak Altay, absolutely nothing. Not even that foolish model named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names sometimes in the movie ... Burak is certainly very talented, I saw some works he did and lived. Even though it's kind of a horror movie, it's doing a really good job in comedy movies and even in dramas. I bet most of you saw Asmali Konak the movie and the TV series, those two would make an example ... All I'll say is watch out for new jobs coming out of Burak, then you'll see. Keep up the good work, much love ...
