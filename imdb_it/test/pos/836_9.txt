I've been really excited about the "Female Scorpion" series for a couple of days and I keep hitting myself because I've waited until now ?? which is too long ?? before buying the entire box. "Beast Stable" is the third brilliant effort in a row, and the unquestionable main triumph of this series is how writers have always found something completely new and different for each episode. Never before, or after, there has been a series of exploitation that offered so much variety when it comes to storylines, settings, themes and shooting styles. The original more or less qualified as a so-called "Women in prison" (but already atypical) film, but it is not possible to categorize parts 2 and 3 as such, given that they are unlikely to characterize the films inside the prison walls. And the general tone and atmosphere continues to change with each new episode. The first film was hard and gritty, while the second was psychedelic and the third part was almost mainly melodramatic. Don't let this last description discourage you, however, since "Beast Stable" presents more than enough themes of exploitation and disturbing footage despite the dramatic atmosphere. The opening sequence, for example, is definitely fantastic. Sasori, still a fugitive from the law, literally makes his way to freedom on the underground, when there is no other possibility than to cut the arm of the policeman who handcuffed her. He runs through the city with his cut arm hanging over her while the credits appear on the screen, accompanied by the familiar acronym, it's pure and genuine exploitation of gold! The story continues irresistibly with our heroine trying desperately to lead an anonymous life in the big city, but the poor thing simply cannot escape its past or even new types of agony. Sasori befriends a prostitute, albeit without exchanging dialogues, and takes on a job in a sewing workshop. His late brother (!) Impregnates the prostitute, while Sasori gets himself into trouble with the local crime and metropolitan crime network. Cunningly prevents a criminal from taking advantage of his body, he meets a former enemy from prison and avenges one of the prostitutes when he is subjected to a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile, the one-armed policeman continues to roam the streets obsessively, looking for a punishment against Sasori. Our talented director Shunya Ito formidably crosses all these narrative lines with a powerful sound and never loses his grip on the visual aspects or the ingenious style of shooting. "Beast Stable" features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine, editing is flawless and outdoor settings are actually depressing. Anyone who knows a bit about Sasori's character is aware of the fact that the film is really missing memorable dialogues, but this is always amply compensated by the wonderful charisma on the screen of Meiko Kaji and the threatening grimaces. There is very little sleaze, apart from the aforementioned under an incestuous plot, but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrifying and the twisted finish is almost too bright for words. In fact, I think the third part could be the largest (or at least my favorite) of the series so far. My only small and totally irrelevant criticism concerns the ridiculous sounds that one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked up in a cage. That bird looks like a ventriloquist's dummy with stomach cramps.
