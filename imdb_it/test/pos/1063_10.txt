It's fun and fast, like a falsehood leads to another and another towards an inevitable and surprising conclusion. Suspense separates this holiday movie from everyone else. One wonders how the pieces will be integrated, both during the film and in the future. <br /> <br /> The leading actors have laid the foundations and entertained us in the process. Sinkewicz (Frank Jenks) shows us what manipulation can achieve ... and ultimately what can cost manipulation! Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) measures every person for us as he tries to protect "Lishka" (Barbara Stanwyck), and this helps us decide who we're going to end up with. <br /> <br /> If we could ever reach a perfect world, imperfect people should probably undergo a series of events like these. <br /> <br /> A macroscopic weakness is that a fake child cries after presumably swallowing Uncle Felix's watch. I heard a more authentic cry from a doll in a toy store. <br /> <br /> Watch it and you'll really feel like you're somewhere!
