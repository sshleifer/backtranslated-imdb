This is a peace of art! If you like comedy you should see it! Here's a fun moment in the movie: "spoiler" <br /> <br /> Nikolai and Goroshkov are walking together in Paris for the first time. They are visiting the local market. And Gorosckov says: "Look Nikolai, how much food they have! Look! One-two-three-ten-thirty-fifty hundred kinds of meat! But if you ask for a tiny peace, just for the sake of taste, they won't give you, the French are very greedy! "Then Goroshkov takes Nikolai to a TV shop ... Goroshkov:" Tell me, who needs all these televisions? Look at this monster here, for example! " Goroshkov points a finger at the "monster" -TV and says: "And this motherfu * ker ... should dig a ditch, but no, it's on TV ... wait a minute ... it's me! Hahah!" < br /> <br /> Want to laugh? Watch the movie, you won't regret it!
