This film travels further than 8 gunshots, 2 kisses and 100 cliches of what should be possible. Yet it still works. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> While I was returning home from the theater, I tried to understand how the films went like the pages of a manuscript novel blowing on a beach or the impossible series of fortuitous coincidences without the entire audience stands up and shouts: "I've seen it a million times before! And you've pushed beyond the limit of credibility!" But the actors were so charming and the screen so full of credible elements that I forgot to worry. A friend who saw him with me said he transported him to Paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized that we were still in Indiana. <br /> <br /> Overall, a romantic-comic thriller with subtlety, spirit and elan.
