This was a compelling film, one that really attracted me. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he performs in a wonderful performance. His great sympathy, combined with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting a long time for the whole house of cards that was collapsing around him (and by extension myself, as his confidant and silent witness). It took me several minutes to relax once the film was finished, I was so taken by this. <br /> <br /> Good performances all around, not just with Macy. Arkin was pretty good, as was Cromwell (he was surprisingly proud). In short, I highly recommend this movie to all Macy's fans and / or the mystery of the murder. But you may want to prepare yourself to feel a little guilty.
