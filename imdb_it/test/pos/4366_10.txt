Yes, this film was simply hilarious and the acting was top notch for the whole cast. Except for Shelley Winters, the German accent was not great, but no matter how difficult it is in the film. So be careful if you're a fan! The two main stars of this film are Laurence Harvey and Julie Harris. Now, before this film, I only saw Miss Harris in the Eden of Eden with James Dean and I own an audio cassette from The Glass Menagerie that she did on stage with Monty Clift and Jessica Tandy, so I wasn't sure how it was "d being in this role and BOY, it impressed me. How much friend was it? I love ham! ;-) Mr. Harvey, he tickled my fantasy! Now I'm a full-time Laurence Harvey fan! That hair !!! "OMG! It's almost like Burt Lancasters, that crazy and messy look, it's no better than that. He's young and so innocent in this movie. SEE IT NOW! It's definitely in my top ten! :) I'm so happy to have found a copy that is all mine! Unfortunately this film is out of print and very difficult to find in video. :( <br /> <br /> Btw, pay attention to the scene of the hospital hotel room !!!!! It is a of the best parts! Or when Mr. Harvey is convinced he is sick and is trying to get down nocchio kicks, you know how the doctors do with that little rubber hammer ;-) Well he does it himself and his leg kicks and kicks the table * squeaks * Looks at the expression on his face, so innocent !!!! I can't describe it, but to all those people who say they couldn't do very well and other cockamamie comments, see this movie and you'll see what a GREAT actor it really was. You will be amazed! If you are not, then I fear that there is nothing I can do for you, you are hopeless. ;-)
