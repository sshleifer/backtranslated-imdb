"Cat In The Brain" is a series of extremely violent sequences intertwined with a plot that looks more like an overview, describing the most famous years of director Lucio Fulci's direction. The film could also be seen as a sort of dark comedy, which effectively falsifies the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes further, he throws himself as the protagonist, the central figure of the film, thus showing the public who is the man behind all the blood of the cinema. "Cat in The Brain" is not about presenting a clear story and following it. Instead he makes fun of some of the clich√©s that have surrounded the horror genre for years. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci interprets himself as a horror director who fights to keep his humanity intact. Years of producing violent films have finally begun to reach it. Start slowly, steaks and meat in general start to disgust him, his colleagues assure Fulci that all he needs is a little rest. But this does not help and soon the grotesque ideas for his films begin to overwhelm his daily thoughts. In an attempt to find a cure for his dangerously exasperating mental state, Lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist. Unfortunately this does more harm than good and Fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess, because the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath, who imitates the murders of Fulci's movies in real life. <br /> <br /> The film retains all the Italian splatter cinema brands, good or bad, they are all here. So any comment on acting or technical aspects and budget restrictions are quite irrelevant with regards to the quality of the film. It is a visual experience, there is no doubt. Fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily overtaking virtually everything he has done. Amputated from chainsaw arts, cannibalism, murder of children, beheading, these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in "Cat In The Brain". Some of them are obviously recycled by some lesser-known films of the director, but they do not differ from the context and feel really at home here. As I noted before, the film exists much better than a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece. The way some of the violence is presented helps establish this idea. These sequences shortly after the climax are rejected by the reality of the film, since they turn out to be scenes from a film that the character of Fulci is directing. This type of "film in film" presentation somewhat reduces the impact of blood. But in no way makes it a movie that is easy to watch. Oh no, this is far beyond and above the gore levels found in the mainstream horror, and no doubt the gorrozzi will be satisfied with this fact. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure. People hate his job or love it. "Cat in the Brain" won't convince any of Fulci's detractors in the opposite, but it's still an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really check.
