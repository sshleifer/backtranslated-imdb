Owen loves his Mom ... only he'd love her better if you were down in this dark-ride-loud-loud comedy by both stars directed by Danny DeVito, with admirable assists from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the lead role . <br /> <br /> "Throw Momma From The Train" is a fantastic comedy, even if it's not a great movie. It is too superficial in parts, and the end seems less organic than the fixed one. Most of the way it is involved is Crystal and DeVito, which uses the chemistry of the big screen while working with its own separate comic strip that takes the essence of being a struggling writer (DeVito is greedy but without talent, Crystal is stuck It's bitter). Br /> <br /> Professor Donner of Crystal believes his ex-wife stole his book (unfortunately titled "Hot Fire") and cannot write more than the opening line of his next book, which is not easy. He teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrity, including a middle-aged woman who writes Tom Clancy-type novels but doesn't know what the submarine captain is talking about; and a upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughter-for-minutes on the screen, a weirdo wearing the ascot who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus: "100 girls I'd like to do the pig". <br /> <br /> Then there is Owen Lift from DeVito, who calls himself Professor Donner's "star student", even though the teacher won't read his work in the classroom. Owen is a somewhat unusual character for acting in a movie, a thirty-year-old man-son who lives with his overbearing mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls him "lard" and other affectionate feelings. In any other film, we would be asked to feel sorry for Owen, but "Throw the mother from the train" bewitches the cruelties of life on this sad lot of laughter and expects us to move forward. This is one of the main reasons why this film probably loses many people. <br /> <br /> For those of us who love the humor of this character, even identifying with him, and taking the rest of what we see here as a Skylark, it's not the greatest time to move forward with the move bigger than this comedy, asking us to look amused while Owen enlists Professor Donner's help in a plan to kill his mother. Actually, first he goes to Hawaii to kill the former hated of Donner, then he tells the professor it's his turn to kill Mrs. Lift, "exchange murders" as seen in "Strangers on a Train" by Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> As a director, DeVito not only complements the performances of its actors with scenes that emphasize the dialogue, makes some bold visual statements, throwing fragments of funny unreality to keep the audience on thorns (and far from taking things too seriously.) <br /> <br /> It also helps matters is the writer Stu Silver, who keeps the laughs with his quotable quotation mark. "You have rats the size of Oldsmobile here." "She is not a woman ... She is the Terminator." "A little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper." Those are all Crystal's words, but some of the funniest lines, which only work in context but have to be killed, are DeVito and Ramsey. Apparently Silver never wrote another script after this, according to the IMDb, and it's a shame, because he had a real talent for it. <br /> <br /> The best scene of this film, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical presentation of the "next attraction", the only time I saw a film promoted that way . Owen introduces the professor to his mother as "Cousin Patty", and when the mother says she doesn't have a cousin, panic Owen loses him. "You lied to me," he shouts, slamming the professor's pan with the pan. <br /> <br /> Of course, in reality the professor does not groan for something witty from the floor, but "Throw the mother from The Train" works effectively in these moments, when his Looney Tunes atmosphere plays for all its value "DeVito has not disappeared from the films, of course, but it is a mystery why he has not really followed the promises of directing this film. Perhaps it is because, like the lack of traditional Throw Momma From The Train, successful performances, the his kind of vision is not for everyone's taste.This is a pity for those of us who can see it over and over again, and enjoy it.
