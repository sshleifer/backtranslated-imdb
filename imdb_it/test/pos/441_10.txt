"French Cancan" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's an excellent film. There is color, there is humor, there is music. It is an excellent portrait of the so-called Belle Ã‰poque, although Jean Renoir's priorities were always to show a creation, a fantasy. So the film is not a historical film. The final sequences in which the girls dance the cancan are unforgettable images. It's a film not to be missed.
