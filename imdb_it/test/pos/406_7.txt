You have to be terribly patient to sit in a movie with a joke so flat and unpleasant that you wonder what the fuss was when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened up to such an enthusiastic public greeting in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> In addition to weak one-liners and normal visual gags, the plot is as unlikely as the fairy tales of The Fox (Red Skelton) to its radio audience. You have to ask yourself why someone might think that he could come up with a real life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it. But then, comedy is so unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But if you are a true Red Skelton fan and you enjoy how comedies were made in the 1940s, you can at least enjoy the lovely cast that supports it. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray do their love interest well and Conrad Veidt, as always, makes an interesting villain. One of his funniest moments is his reaction to Skelton explaining the mysteries of the use of turbans. "I never knew," he reflects, impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced. <br /> <br /> All in all, typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags while we are. It is not always easy for a discriminating observer as many of them simply fall flat, as many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the gags of sight and jokes is simply gone.
