It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is all about. Or maybe not: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the biggest blow. It's a business that you give up or not. Enter the form of the world that surrounds him entirely, without a story, tied only to certain aspects of written poetry, like his camera (shot on presumably discarded films) wanders like in a pure travel diary. You could also jump to this easy conclusion, while he raises these immense landscapes, and then moves on to a more raw and civilized civilization (although not to the same "normal" culture), and to levels that are too abstract to be able to transmit correctly here. Sometimes it takes a while to get along, close to a purity through the "creation" section, but a purity in the way the parts are manipulated by nature or by broken machines. Soon the narration, the readings of the Popol Vuh (which, by the way, makes music for most of his films), with the gradual procession of really very stylized shots adds a completely different level to it. It's a hybrid film, and it's not easy, but the awards are what comes closest to Herzog's idea of ​​"ecstatic truth", images that he has been out for all his career. <br /> <br /> One wonders if the images end up, at the time of the second section, Paradise, which brings along the spoken words, or if it is the opposite. Your eyes are moving with the stills and pots, and the wording is close to religious writing, but there are also musical choices, like the bizarre singing and low-key classical music get along with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I think each part ends up complimenting the other, and it's something that * looks * like it doesn't work. Perhaps this is the fate, the possibilities of crossing desolate lands and the smaller sections of every type of civil life (in this case the shacks of the desert), which make it so fascinating. If only for the cinematographic sense it is a marvel, too indescribable for fans of random photography due to technique molds, and some of the strangest images of any Herzog film. There are pans, there are shots from afar, there is hand held while driving from the cities, there is a bus to dozens of miles that via mirage looks like just a couple, there are fire-filled close-ups and a man who he holds a reptile and talks about his radar (a real classic gonzo comedy), there are people who hold themselves in false poses, and a man and a woman who play inane music. But above all, it ends up feeling, at least for me, natural for the personal nature of the approach. I'm sure only Herzog would know for sure why he made this film, as opposed to the simple 'how'; He was already shooting Even Dwarfs Started Small, and ended up going through many dangers to finish it. Yet this is what makes Fata Morgana such an extraordinary feat, that a person will like depending on what someone actually brings them to look at. It is decidedly disturbing, but there is the temptation to want to see it again very soon, only to experience all the ideas and realities that have transformed strange abstract vibrations (yes, the word "vibrations" applies here). It is one of the truly spectacular "art films" ever made.
