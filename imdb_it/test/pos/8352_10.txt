This movie is excellent! Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable! His little yelps when he's afraid, and the funniest parts are when: Scamp is caught in the tent and when Angel and Scamp sing "Ive Never Had This Feeling Before". I absolutely recommend this movie, it will be released in special edition on June 20th. The cover has the scamp on a garbage can and Angel under the lid. <br /> <br /> I can't really explain this movie more than romantic, charming, exhilarating and adorable. The landfill scenes are fun, all the wreckage dogs have something special. Too much fun, I laughed, the kids will love it. Buy it when it comes out, it has new features!
