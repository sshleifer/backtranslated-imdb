This is a fascinating film to say the least. The main character, Fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead with whom he is surrounded. He and his accomplice go around playing tricks and getting in trouble all over the city. Meanwhile his family is in arms about what to do with him. From there you can see Fanda's relationships with his wife, best friend and son who develop. Finally he arrives at one of the best cinema endings I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are rich and profound. They develop well throughout the film. The film has a series of moods. Go from light and fun to sad and dark. All the slow parts for you in this film will be compensated at the end. <br /> <br /> Autumn Spring brings a message similar to what many other European films do: don't lose sight of the small pleasures in life. If you liked Amelie, The Eighth Day or Life is Beautiful (all great BTW movies), you'll probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
