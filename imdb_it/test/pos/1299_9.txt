I wasn't able to look like this movie, and the first 10 minutes didn't do anything to appease my fears. Start with 2 high school bands that melt against each other with bad kung-fu. A scenario found in countless other Korean films. Ho-hum. Add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote "He Was Cool" (which was barely passable) and, well, I thought I was around for 2 hours without a name. <br /> <br /> But don't give up so fast! "A Romance of Their Own" was directed by Tae-gyun Kim, who also did "Volcano High" (which I thought was very funny). However, "Romance of Their Own" soon takes a turn for the better. A high school girl, just moved to Seoul, is in the midst of the attention of two potential suitors. Every boy has his merit, and it is not clear which (if both) is the right choice. <br /> <br /> What follows is not your usual love triangle. Emotions are complex and, although you may not agree with certain choices or actions developed by the film, you can certainly understand why the characters make them. <br /> <br /> The film asks questions to the characters and the public. Who chooses? At what point is he even forced to make a choice (and he is unfair to one only if he seems to be following him)? After you (or your heart) have made a choice, how do you react (and how * you should * react) when new information emerges that sheds new light on the situation? There is a scene near the end that is very subtle but perfectly captures what I think would be a real life reaction instead of an exaggerated "cinematic reaction". The subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene. Recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed. Basically, he doesn't know what to do. Instead of doing it, "acting" something, or looking at everything in amazement, simply fixes a fixed point unable to react or say anything. It is as if someone had just pulled the plug. His reaction excited me and I enjoyed the scene. <br /> <br /> Like most Korean films, there is a mix of action, bravado, slapstick and melodrama. Korean films often take abrupt changes (see "Sex Is Zero" for a great example), which can be quite a shock to the uninitiated. Go ahead and start with yourself. I like it, love it or hate it, I think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the actions and reactions of the characters.
