I was at the premiere of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are many changes from the book to the film. The pace of this film is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things have been cut otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things have also been changed to give the film a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the film and it works well for Hanks, Brown and for society. <br /> <br /> There are some things in the book that seem very implausible in the form of the film. I'm not giving any spoilers, except to say that the end of the film is handled in a slightly different way. As has also been found Leonardo Vetra is different. Those who see the film may be interested in reading the book to get all the details of the story. Some minor details are also cut from the film. <br /> <br /> Even though they filmed in Rome, they had to recreate the interiors. Since I did a walking tour in Rome the day before the film, I can say that the internal sites are authentic in their appearance. Kohler is not in the film and is not shown much at CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes about the Vatican archives. Obviously they didn't have access to that area and I'm not sure if anyone actually knows how the Vatican archives are. Eyelet Zurer has had his break in this film as Victoria Vetra and does a good job for Hanks' eyes. <br /> <br /> This film should be better received by critics and the public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and how we saw him and the cast before the film, that this is just a movie.
