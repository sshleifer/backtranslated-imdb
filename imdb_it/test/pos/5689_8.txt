Attentive Gore hounds ... this is not your movie. This little bitter nail has very little blood and guts. It is basically a version of Open Water that is effective and useful. But what sets it apart is that we actually like the three cables (unlike Open Water) that are on a tree when an crocodile launches their fishing boat and chews their guide. We don't want any harm coming to any of them. SO, when they start entering dangerous situations ... we really do care. <br /> <br /> Now I like films of killer animals but I wasn't very impressed with Lake Placid until Primeval (although I'm still waiting to see Rogue and hope it's somewhere as good as this!) this little bugger did the job and did the job well. His fears are creative and he runs out only in the rush of the frenetic mill crying sobbing and discussing for short stretches of realism, so I never bothered myself. <br /> <br /> I remember reading the real story that inspired this, in which three guys went fishing and two ended up on a tree while their friend was killed by the crocodile. But the thing that has always struck me that is left out of the film is that the crocodile has not eaten his friend. No. For hours and hours he swam around the tree and shook the body still in the mouth of friends in the tree. Seeming to stay, if you come down here, this is what will happen to you.
