This movie was incredible! He seemed like a big budget but he felt heartfelt and original like an Indie. The most surprising part of this film was the amazing performances by David Beazely, Mark Hildreth and Paul Anthony who plays the lead role. He brought this film with ease, humor and charisma in balance with enormous depth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was really nice even though some of the subjects were pretty ugly. It wasn't very realistic that way, but it didn't have to be to make a bigger point. It was really good to see Alan Cumming in this one too. The script was tense and pushed very well with some of the best recitations I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Go see this.
