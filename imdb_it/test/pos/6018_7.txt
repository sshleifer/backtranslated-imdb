"Gypsy" is probably the biggest musical ever written, so it's a shame that his film version was such a disappointment. To compensate for this, we have this remake which, if not perfect, is a pleasant and well-made adaptation of the musical. The script is completely accurate, all the songs included and the scene remains close to the original scenography of Jerome Robbins. Bette Midler is a skilled choice for Rose, her singing and the personality of Merman-esquire, and her splendid acting. Peter Reigert is a great Herby, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a simple and natural girl, Louise. Actually, a live recording of the 1989 revival with Tyne Daly may have been a better idea, though only because "Gypsy" is simply more exciting on stage, but this film is an excellent translation of a great musical.
