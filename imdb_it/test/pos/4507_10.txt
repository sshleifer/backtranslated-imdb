Watch the director of Stranger Than Fiction The director of Kite Runner by Marc Forster is the cinema equivalent of eating your vegetables because this PG-13 of this art house, classified as epic, is perfect for your movie diet. No, this is not the kind of film I like to show off on the couch and on the eyeball at the end of a difficult day. The Kite Runner is not the typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget your problems. First of all, there are no celebrity stars. Second, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so extravagant that you don't believe an image you see. Third, The Kite Runner expires in the subtitles when the characters occasionally speak in their native language. Fourthly, Forster's film is not a romantic nonsense about boy-girl-boy, boy-loser-girl, and then boy-victim-girl back. Fifth, this foreign language film could make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your hypotheses about life, friendship and survival. The main themes here are cowardice and redemption. The protagonist commits a cowardly crime in the first half of the action that he must expiate at the expense of his personal safety and integrity. Right, the kite hunter speaks of ransom for the sins of the past. We are talking about personal responsibility, so don't rent or buy this wonderful movie for a guy's evening or something to take out of your bad taste of the day. Based on the best-selling novel by Khaled Hosseini, this culturally enlightened melodrama on the right and down seems initially to be one of those carefree teenage movies in the vein of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot. About half an hour in its 127 minutes, this escapade on two young people who fly kites in Afghanistan becomes dark and unpleasant. However, if you manage to manage the remaining time of the plot, you will emerge gratified, relieved and perhaps even amused. <br /> <br /> The kite runner opens in San Francisco in 2000 when our protagonist, the Afghan emigrant Amir Jan (United 93 Khalid Abdalla) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni of The Florist) receive two boxes of books copies of Amir's first novel. As soon as Amir has had the chance to bask in the triumph of a life as a storyteller, the phone takes him out of his reveries and is reluctantly retracted in a past that is best forgotten for him. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story) calls Amir from Pakistan to make a request. Rahim was a servant in Amir's home in the 1970s when Amir lived with his wealthy Pashtun merchant father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi of A Taste of Cherry) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. "You have one more chance of being good", Rahim informs Amir without sugar covering his request. Basically, Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and then enter war-torn Afghanistan and save Rahim Sohrab's young nephew (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari) who was held captive against his desire as a sex slave for Assef (newcomer Abdul Salam Yusoufzai) a cruel Taliban leader and once feared opponent of Amir. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner moves from San Francisco in 2000 to an extensive flashback set in Kabul in 1978, when life was idyllic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and the son of his father's servant, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), love watching movies, like John Sturges's magnificent western seven, when kites aren't flying. Incidentally, this is a kite that flies like you've never seen flying a kite. Not only do children drive them, but they also compete with other children to see who can cut the strings of another child's kite. The flying scenes that fight the kite generate the same kind of excitement that the dog fighting scenes had in Tony Scott's Top Gun. Hassan is Amir's best friend, but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the insulted Hazara minority. Previously, the young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with the young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two wolf cubs. Assef was about to beat them, but Hassan pulls out his slingshot and threatens to use it on Assef. Assef had no choice but to back off. Meanwhile, Amir was ready to put up with the hand that fate had inflicted on him. Amir's father, Baba, laments the lack of his son's spine and fears that half of the man will grow because he is a coward, unlike the annoying little Hassan who puts Amir in difficulty for his difficulties. However, Amir and Hassan emerge from the showdown with Assef without a scratch. Later, after Amir set a new record with his kite flying and his fighting skills, Hassan runs after a kite to claim it. Hassan is the eponymous character referred to in the title. Hassan supports the fallen kite but finds himself at the mercy of Assef and his two servants. Assef lets Hassan hold the kite, but his henchmen attack Hassan in mid-air, on his stomach in an alleyway while Assef sodomizes the youth. Worse, a traumatized Amir observes the assault closely but does not have the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened for him. Apart from the extraordinary aerial scenes with kites, The Kite Runner is simple and direct things. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to save Sohrab, he masquerades as a Taliban fighter but doesn't carry guns. The rescue scene in The Kite Runner is quite similar to The Midnight Express's escape scene. While Forster does not explore local politics or plunges us into the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here. In fact, Troy screenwriter David Benioff had to eliminate some parts of the book and racial and ethnic prejudices are not clearly delineated, so you have to accept some things about faith. Forster filmed the film in almost China to give it an authentic look. Forster deserves credit for making this two hours more epic and fascinating. Performances, especially by children, are distinguished by their credibility. The Kite Runner is a film that you won't easily forget.
