This film is one of the few historical documents that show the talent of so many black singers, actors, actresses and dancers. Many who are no longer with us. Those of which we are fortunate to be able to rejoice today in 1999, through this film, allow us to recognize the talents that existed then. This is why those people who still live today and those who have died are super stellar icons. Because of the educational history of music, drama, filming, design, singing, etc., this film belongs only to the people of this country. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie recently. The sound was excellent! The film seemed to be complete, the color and clarity were good, but good considering how old this film is without repairs on the frames. I agree with all the previous positive reviews. I have no negative views. <br /> <br /> I just want to make a request. Please to those interested, please make this film available so that everyone can have this historical experience.
