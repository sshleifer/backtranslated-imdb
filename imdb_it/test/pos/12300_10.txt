I saw this film for the first time in Austria when it came out, and I was ecstatic. It is a passionate and deeply moving work that should be experienced by all film connoisseurs. What a pity it was never released in DVD format. Perhaps one of these days it will be rectified, as it would be a real shame if one of the best films ever made were forgotten and left to fade away in some film vault forever. <br /> <br /> Why it is so "B" films like "American Wedding" and "Eurotrip" receive widescreen and fullscreen versions, and often a special edition with more comments and extras, while great works of art how "The Dead" are almost forgotten?
