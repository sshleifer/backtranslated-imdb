This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite horror movies of all time! I really can't believe that it didn't gain much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual Wes Craven sequels and script horrors, Mute Witness has all the style, suspense and twists. Rapid focus of a Hitchcock / DePalma film, along with a very sharp black comedy and a fantastic plot. It never promises to be more than a good pop-corn hot dog movie, but it's hard not just to enjoy the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> The plot centers on Billie Hughes - a dumb girl who works on the set of a horror film made in a Russian factory. For a series of events, he finds himself accidentally stuck and stumbles into the filming of a snuff movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the film is the lack of screams that seem to invade every horror film ever made. Since the main character is mute, he cannot make noise - something that is a blessing in some phases of the film, and a curse in others. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well, Even the opening scene is an ironic hint to "Psycho" by Hitchcock and also to quite generic slasher film scenes. <br /> <br /> While acting can sometimes be fun, the whole movie holds it together, not just throwing a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat, but some small and clear questions about how the film is about to end. <br /> <br /> All in all, a hugely neglected psycho-thriller thriller, full of action and full of action, which I would recommend any viewer tired of looking for something a little different from the usual Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Myers / Damien on Halloween.
