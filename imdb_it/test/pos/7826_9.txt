It's very easy to see why The New Professionals was a real disaster, at least in New Zealand: it didn't just follow the footsteps of the original, it followed Bodyguards, which improved the show considerably with its two-agent formula . Cmdr McIntyre was a George Cowley of the last days: hard on his team, but one who would defend them to the death against the others. The shadow of the show's cast was enormous. <br /> <br /> Well, not as huge as it should have been in the UK. Here, he was networked in prime time. It has even been marketed in the promo as "I am the professionals". Someone else has obviously noticed the difference. We were fortunate enough not to publish this show in different regions at different times. <br /> <br /> It was the high production values ​​that sealed the agreement. As other reviewers have noted, it has followed the great British one-hour shareholder tradition, but mixed in with personal elements at the same time. There is a slight undercurrent of something that develops between Liz and Ian, although this has never taken one away from the actual plot. Most of the episodes were based on inflammatory diplomatic incidents, the kind of thing that helps Spooks from time to time. <br /> <br /> Unlike many shows of the 2000s, the plot was not sacrificed to the detriment of the photograph of the trousers-direction directors such as Christopher Young maintained the rhythm and did their job. They made use of good positions, making bodyguards more agile than if they were turned on back roads and alleys. It was contemporary, it would still be beautiful today, and it was one of the best examples of the British shareholder in the 1990s, demonstrating that the UK can still do it better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Maybe except for the Germans and their Cobra 11.
