A group of teenagers decide to bring the slumber party to an abandoned school where, 27 years ago, a horrible massacre occurred. Unfortunately for them, the person responsible for the massacre still lurks in the halls of the abandoned school and is not happy with their presence. <br /> <br /> This movie is not like most of the modern teen slashers we've seen. It is much darker, much more suspenseful, no wise killer, etc., and I liked it for these reasons. From a cinematic point of view, it's not great. Acting is below average. The script was pretty ugly and full of clich√©s, containing random references to American horror films, some that didn't even make sense (like ... "Did you see Scream 3?", Asks a girl. I have, and she has nothing to do with walking through the doors of an old school, so it does not refer to this film in any way). But hey, it's a slasher movie, those are part of the fun. Furthermore, the under-utilization of the characters has been strongly exposed in this film. There were six main characters (with the exception of the Security Guard) and, to be honest, only three or four were actually used. Two characters (the black token and some other girl who wasn't important enough to get a label) barely spoke: among them, I would estimate about five or six lines in total. Furthermore, the girls (except one) were not formed well enough to differentiate them from one another. They could have replaced each of the girls with each other repeatedly throughout the film and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. The rhythm, however, works well since the horror starts from the beginning and rarely ceases. The atmosphere is well exploited and the management reveals some truly chilling moments. . . although, the general appearance is a bit cheap due to, what I assume is, low quality camera equipment (and operation). The ending, although I liked the idea they were doing, was pretty badly done. He seemed hasty and without sufficient explanations to make it effective. With the time spent running without looking for anything, they could have spent a little more time on the conclusion to make sure it didn't feel like a random event launched without a good reason (which is a flaw many modern horror movies are afflicted). However, ignoring some annoying problems and trying to focus on the first 98% of the film rather than the ending, this is actually a rather good modern slasher that should be checked, especially if you are a fan of Spanish and / or atmospheric horror. <br /> <br /> Mandatory slasher elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There is a lot of blood and blood, realistically done, but not dried. The violence is extremely well done, not excessive, but rather brutal in the points. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: A little, and with the sexiest girl in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: Well, security guards are barely considered "cool", but this guy is pretty wicked. His eerie smile was chilling. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: The suspense is top notch. . . very tense, very well done. There are also some extremely gruesome moments that have merged fear and spooky atmosphere. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> - Awkward Dance Scene: Obviously: between a couple of guys and a half-reluctant woman in the flashback. <br /> <br /> - Classic quote from the film: "Another Trophy". <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 7/10. This could lengthen it, but Session 9 fans may want to simply check the similar tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
