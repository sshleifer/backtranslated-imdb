Although the wonderful soda counter in the local pharmacy no longer exists <br /> <br />, and the clothes are definitely the vintage post-war vintage, and good and evil are easy to understand, and <br /> < br /> those old planes are really dated, this movie will never be dated. <br /> <br /> Post-war human adjustments and problems, beautiful <br /> <br /> love stories, wonderful acting (especially Harold Russell and <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews) they are as they move today in 2002 as they were in 1946. <br /> <br /> I was one of the young women who welcomed our wonderful family of veterans <br /> <br /> during the Second World War. Like so many, my memories of <br /> <br /> years of war and homecomings are fresh today as if they had been <br /> <br /> yesterday - this film is very important for our times.
