Stephanie Meyer will be so happy! Now, his book "Breaking Dawn" will not be the first with that title. Sorry, Twilight fan. <br /> <br /> Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is a medical student, Eve, who is in charge of interviewing the psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the twist, and when he discovered that they had both grown up in the same city, I was sure of it. <br /> <br /> He continued to be deeper and deeper with his patient to the point that I felt there was a shared illusion going on. Sometimes, he even behaved as if he had PTSD. I really thought he was losing it. <br /> <br /> Well, he wasn't losing it, and when the end came, I was speechless. All my suspicion turned out to be wrong. The twist was even more incredible than I thought. <br /> <br /> Overton was fantastic and the story is much more beautiful than the one Stephanie Meyer would have invented. A must see
