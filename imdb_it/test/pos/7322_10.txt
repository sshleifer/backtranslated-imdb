This is a particular short from Stooge that uses satire in conjunction with slapstick, a rarity. As mentioned, the title and concept of this short film were "borrowed" from a film of the same year with Clark Gable entitled "Men In White". It's basically about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred cause for "duty and humanity". I saw it recently and almost treated it as the Stooge version because it takes a little too seriously. In any case, "Men In Black" is so well written, direct and not to say original, he didn't borrow anything from Chaplin or any of the others, that the Motion Picture Academy named him for an award for best short comedy from 1934. A bit smelly called "La Cucaracha" passed it but stole the prize. The brother-in-law of some producers must have been on the Academy's voting board. "Men In Black" makes fun of the whole concept of the medical profession in the same way that the Marx Bros. always did at this time. It may not be a fair comparison, but I can see the Marx Bros. in this brief. In fact, in their movie "A Day At The Races", there is a scene where "medical things" occur that cause anarchy as usual. My hypothesis is that this particular short has been judged in this way and therefore because it was named in the first place. Try this: look at this short first and then look at "Duck Soup" or "Day at the Races" with the Marx and then see if there is not the same great quality of comedy.
