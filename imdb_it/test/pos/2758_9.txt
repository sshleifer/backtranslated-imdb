Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is not much different from the previous ones (except Tony Hawk 3). The only novelty that appears in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is the new selection of levels and optimized graphics. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x offers a new career mode, and this is the double career. The 2x career is basically the career of Tony Hawk 1, because there are only about five challenges per level. If you missed Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I suggest you buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, but if you've played the first two games, you should still try this. Overall, there's really nothing new, but it's still a lot of fun to go through the game. We hope this review meets your needs. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10 Overall, clean graphics are not really one of the main features of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x. The atmosphere has been changed a lot by Tony Hawk 1 and 2, and the character models seem a little better. When you think back to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 on the old PS1, the thought that those old graphics are ugly go through your head. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, the graphics are made VERY MUCH. The character models are no longer full of jaggys, the plots are smoother, but not to the farthest extent. The graphics of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is not comparable to the graphics of Tony Hawk 3, but Activision probably did not want the Tony Hawk 2x Pro Skater to have extraordinary graphics. Overall, the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they didn't put all the power of the Xbox to use here. The graphics are nice and clean, that's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Sound: 8 out of 10 Sound effects do not give much to the imagination, but skateboards that emerge from the ground look great. The main reason I gave the sound factor a score was the fact that you don't have to listen to Tony Hawk's soundtrack below average, because there's a custom soundtrack feature. The sound effects are much better than the sounds of Tony Hawk 1 and 2, mainly because it is clearer, and just the fact that everything sounds great. One of the main reasons I bought this game is because of the custom soundtrack. The grind sound effects still sound like the first two games, just a little retouched. One of the biggest problems with the sound factor is the fact that if the song is finished, it will NOT proceed to the next track, the song you just listened to will play again. I don't like the soundtrack of the game, but like I said, you don't have to listen to it. <br /> <br /> Controls: 10 out of 10 Controls are the best part of Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater. The control set-up is wonderfully comfortable and easy to get used to. In the days of the Playstation, people thought that the controls were the best ever, but it seems that 2x has done a better job with the Xbox control. Surprisingly, it is very easy to use the joystick to perform tricks. Activision did a great job with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x controls. They made the Xbox controller the best for Tony Hawk games. You will not be disappointed by the control style, and this is a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Game: 10 out of 10 Excluding the fact that Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater is basically Tony Hawk 1 and 2 combined, the game is still incredibly fun. The game factor has been changed a bit. This time, you get MUCH more air than the first two games, and it's much easier to do tricks. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, each character has three career modes, including Tony Hawk 1's career, Tony Hawk 2's career and double career. Tony Hawk 1's career is pretty simple because in the first game you get NOTHING for air. Tony Hawk 2's career offers the same amount of difficulty as the playstation version. The only difficulty that applies to career 2x, is to find out where all the objects are, but after doing so, 2x career is not difficult at all. In career 2x, there are a total of 3 levels, and the first two levels are to find the secret tapes, the collection of S-K-A-T-E, and do whatever else is required for that particular level. The third level of three is the competition level, where you have to get a certain amount of points to get gold. In the first two levels, the secret tapes and the collection of the letters S-K-A-T-E are present in both. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x still retains the atmosphere of old Tony Hawk Skull. <br /> <br /> Story: - <br /> <br /> Fun factor: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is far off, the most fun game on Xbox today. I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 and I didn't like them at the time, but for some reason, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is really fun. There's not much to say, except that Tony Hawk's 2x Pro Skater is by far the best game on Xbox today. One problem is that if you have already tried the game once, you will do it a couple of times, but it will be repetitive. <br /> <br /> Replay value: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk 2x's Tony Skater offers a high amount of replay value. There are lots of tricks to unlock and lots of character videos. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x has a lot of replays, mostly because it's so much fun. <br /> <br /> Best movie: you don't have to listen to the crappy soundtrack of the game. The worst feature: the custom soundtrack is a bit messy. <br /> <br /> Final declaration: many people have complained in the past that they didn't like the Tony Hawk 2x Pro Skater because there is nothing new, but they should stop complaining because you get a lot of game for $ 50.00. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10. Sound: 8 out of 10. Control: 10 out of 10. Game: 10 out of 10. Story: N / A Fun factor: 10 out of 10. <br /> < br /> Overall rating: 9 out of 10.
