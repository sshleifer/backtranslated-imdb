Unlike most of the people who commented, I was born after the last episode of Sylvester Mccoy and therefore I could not have compared the two centuries of doctor than at the beginning. I really enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series. Since then I've seen old episodes of Doctor Who and some where it's great, but, like the doctor, the series needed to regenerate itself to continue. The doctor of the 21st century is fantastic, I thought Martha was fantastic, almost a game for the doctor and if Jack's appearance is something, it will be brilliant when cameo in the 4 or 5 series. Jack, the spin of, Torchwood is also brilliant and you should see both of these programs (although this is definitely more suitable for children). However, if you insist that this is not the same and is not Doctor Who, please stay in your basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
