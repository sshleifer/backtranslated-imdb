Anyone who criticizes 'Jacqueline Hyde' as something more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that is meant to be is not playing with a whole deck. Precisely from the title, it is obvious that this low-cost horror comedy is not meant to be taken seriously ... it is like a tongue in the mouth like the French kiss of a nymphomaniac, and equally titillating. Female cast members are all fantastic and fun to watch. Check out this, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror. Unlike most soft-core horror films, this is fun to the hilt with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. The film does not even try to follow the plot of the classic Robert Louis Stevenson, but instead tries in every possible way to create miraculous gags and erotic situations. Blythe Metz, the brunette femme fatale who plays Jacqueline's sexier and murderous side, is a real knockout. Look and have fun!
