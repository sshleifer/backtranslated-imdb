Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema, and it is much better than I expected. Those people who say it's neither scary nor fun have a point, it's not that great. But keep in mind that all the films involved are rather amateur, so it's basically a maiden voyage. And comparing this with the other Sinan Ã‡etin films, like the 1st class "Propaganda", this film is damn beautiful. <br /> <br /> Something that MUST be said: it is about the life of high school students in Turkey VERY realistically! This is exactly how it goes! The scenes that are destined to scare are quite cheap and Hollywood. Most of them though not all. But that religion lesson scene made me laugh in tears, and Emre Kayay plays the best of this film as a religion teacher. <br /> <br /> It is NOT a waste of time, go and watch it! You will find it rather amusing, especially if you know Turkey enough to relate to the school life of young Turks.
