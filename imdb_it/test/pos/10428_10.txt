I'm a big fan of this movie and I found the TV miniseries "Children of The Dust", the version that fans should be looking for. At least 20 minutes or more are cut into the DVD version of this film. <br /> <br /> I would also like to suggest to viewers who enjoyed this film to take a look at the book, there is a more rounded plot with Corby / Whitewolf and Rachel, more on Black History and Buffalo Solders. There were two stories for the series or this film. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier shows only that he is improving with age, the talent continues to grow and the chemistry between the character of Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor has been wonderful. I also liked the plot by Billy Wirth / Joanna Going, they seem to enjoy each other. <br /> <br /> Billy Wirth is obviously the "Model of the Indian vision". The look, the attitude, the dream of every woman who wanted to be transported in one of those romance novels by a native hero. It worked for me too. <br /> <br /> He could have done much more with this plot, but he gave the viewer a brief overview of the racial problems in 1880, the white one who took over the native school, the lack of black pioneers to set the cities to the west . Michael Moriarty (Maxwell) as always a great actor presents himself as a very caring and confused teacher, it is not certain that the "whites" should interfere with the native culture. <br /> <br /> For those who love characters and watch them change this film is for you. I thought that the harmony between the character of Poitier and that of the orphan Whitewolf was very moving and I thought that Wirth and Poitier worked very well together. Billy Wirth made some of his best scenes when he worked with Poitier. <br /> <br /> It gets on my nerves sometimes when you want to stop and shake it or call it "awake and grown up". But overall it was a great evening of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Look for the two-tape version of this mini series if you are a fan you will really see the difference.
