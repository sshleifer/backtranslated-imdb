Five medical students (Kevin Bacon, David Labraccio, William Baldwin, Dr. Joe Hurley, Oliver Platt, Randy Steckle, Julia Roberts, Dr. Rachel Mannus, Kiefer Sutherland, Nelson) experience underground experiences of death and life after death, ( re) research for medical and personal lighting. One after another, every medical student's heart is stopped, then revived. <br /> <br /> In times of temporary death, every experience has bizarre visions, including forgotten childhood memories. Their flashbacks are like children's nightmares. Resuscitated students are disturbed by remembering acts of regret they had committed or had done against them. While experiencing the afterlife, they report real life experiences in the present. As they continue to experiment, their memories intensify dramatically; so much, some are physically outdated. Thus, they probe and transcend more deeply into death-life experiences in an attempt to find a cure. <br /> <br /> Although the DVD was released in 2007, this film was released in 1990. Therefore, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland were in the early stages of their adult careers. Furthermore the plot is extremely intriguing, the suspense is developing in a dramatic climax and the script is tense and convincing, all the young actors do "Flatliner", what is now a semi-ski-cult cult star cult suspense. Who knew 17 years ago that the cinematographic careers of this young group of actors would skyrocket? I suspect that director Joel Schumacher did.
