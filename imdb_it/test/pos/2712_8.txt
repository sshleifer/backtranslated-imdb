I didn't know Karen Carpenter personally, nor did Richard, because of that, so I have to go over how the film portrayed it. I think a better person to ask about accuracy would be his brother Richard. However, from what I saw and learned from Karen, I felt her pain, shared her sadness, and was a very special person for me to grow. I know I wasn't born until 1965, so I didn't get to know her as some of your older fans, but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music. I remember the song on the "Radio" (every sha la la la every whoa ... so good, etc.) And I remember "We just started!" In fact, I've memorized many, many of his songs and some people (some) tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her !!! (I'm not kidding about this). I was also anorexic during high school and part of college (1978-1987) to be exact and weighed anywhere from 82 pounds to 120 pounds in 1987. I developed some pretty serious health problems from what helped me identify with the actress who plays Karen in the film. The mother (Agnes) was very VERY like my mother in many ways and I could also feel the pain that Karen must have felt because, my mother was often insensitive, critical and disapproving as Agnes was (if that was to be precise). The film was useful to identify and get to know Karen on a more personal note not only by listening to her music but by seeing what she was going through. It is rather difficult to describe a person's entire life in 2-3 hours and to report every single detail perfectly, so I should say that there is probably no such accurate biography. I will still give this story to 8! I would like to get to know Karen personally! I would have died to meet her !! I would have liked to have shaken her hand, hugged her or talked to her. I feel her warmth and love every time I hear one of her songs and miss her a lot.
