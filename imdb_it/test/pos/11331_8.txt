The notion of conjugal fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today, but it is precisely the adhesion of the protagonists to this notion that makes the whole story so tragically tragic. It is this idea that ennobles them and allows them to stand out, as they refer to their spouses, "not to be like them". <br /> <br /> As Tony Leung said in the film, love happens. There is no need to be a rational explanation of how it simply happens. Despite not wanting to lower themselves to the level of their spouses, it happened. Loyalty, social customs and times have contributed to the realization of this relationship. Simply being in love is far from sufficient. <br /> <br /> I had the misfortune of sitting next to a young couple (still at the university with the fragments of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the film, and not started with the pains of lost love and missed opportunities ). Their great inability to digest the delicacy and the most profound emotions evoked made me realize how much a film like this, as well as other works by Wong Kar Wei, is wasted in the local audience.
