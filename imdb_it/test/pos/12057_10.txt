Many times, Bollywood has tried to redo the Hollywood hits, just to produce total hits. Fortunately, Yash Chopra's interpretation of "Sleeping with the Enemy" is an extremely elegant and well-made film. <br /> <br /> Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (who is trying his best here!). When he realizes that Juhi has a boyfriend in Sunny Deol, he stops at nothing to make sure she becomes his. <br /> <br /> Every frame of this film is a pleasure to watch. Let it be Shah Rukh who recites his brand "I love you, K ... k ... k ... kiran!" or the corny and delicate scenes between Sunny and Juhi (which make a perfect pairing), you won't feel like letting yourself be bored. <br /> <br /> Every song on the soundtrack is nice, especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne. As I said, Juhi looks like a Goddess in this movie. Darr may not be the best SRK film (that honor goes to Baazigar), but surely it is one of his most perfect performances! Sunny is OK. He's already played similar roles, but he's good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Darr is g ... g ... g ... fantastic! ;)
