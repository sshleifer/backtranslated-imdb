Recently available on DVD (11/11/08), the film by Severo Pérez ... and Earth Did Not Swallow Him (1994) is based on one of the most acclaimed and discussed novels of Chicano literature. The film by Tomás Rivera ... no no the trago the tier / ... and The Earth Did Not Devour Him (1972) is still generally recognized by many critics and serious readers as the classic Chicano novel. Originally written in the Spanish feature of southern Texas and also translated into English, Rivera's novel continues as an indispensable presence within the Chicano literary landscape. <br /> <br /> Perez's film, originally produced as a PBS production of high-level American Playhouse, took some time to be released on DVD. One can only ask this because its high quality is not a problem. The film, and now the DVD, however, as far as I know, remains the only film adaptation of any Chicano novel and clearly is a tribute to the incredible power of the Earth. This film version also strikes an exceptionally rooted nerve which, I maintain, is specifically ethnic but also generally universal. Perhaps the doubts on Earth could have arisen because they are too "ethnic", too foreign to a basic American mainstream, too much a "foreign" art indie, too limited in economic resources. Yet Perez in his version of art, in my opinion connects very effectively, artistically, and creates a strongly engraved portrait of a migrant Chicano community that focuses on the daily life of the family. As for a production made with relatively limited economic resources, his good cinematographic work and haunting music go far beyond his available funding. Just watch the movie to show the artistic value of this film (or DVD). <br /> <br /> In short, ?? and the Earth has not swallowed it neo-naturalistically portrays the situation, the suffering and despair of Chicano's migrant workers as they follow the northward crops from South Texas to Minnesota in 1952. Local priests bless the battered and overcrowded vehicles of these workers who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the migrant worker 's farm north. This Chicano community, like that of the period of depression Joads in The Grapes of Wrath of Steinbeck, forms an epic wave, driven by economic needs, a survival instinct and anguished desperation, and finally a faith that is barely trembling. A tribute to these people of the earth, a collective hero, the DVD is centered on a focal family, and above all it is emblematic of a young protagonist within the family, a boy, maybe twelve or so. This work therefore also functions as a training novel. Ultimately, the sense of identification of the viewer is generated through the experiences, subjectivity and struggles of the protagonist. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (insolation and death in pregnancy), discrimination, school absenteeism (the boy's escape from the bullies of discrimination is spent lying in a pretty and peaceful cemetery) are laid bare as a fact, even symbolically Worse still, the problematic conflict between the young man and his mother goes beyond the socio-economy and political conflict, into deeper realms of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but artistically rendered struggle, the young man fights his mother, a Mexican-American traditionalist archetype, a representative of God's will, content with prayer, resignation, consolation and acceptance. The young rebel cannot believe in a god that would allow such wicked and suffering to be visited on them. How can God be so cruel, he asks, since his little sister is certainly innocent, enough to come up with serious illnesses in the fields? At this point, the boy must overcome even more daunting obstacles than poverty and discrimination. The problems now include death, doubt and despair and lack of meaning. And he has few resources at his disposal for the strength of his character, his willpower, his intelligence and a powerful survival instinct. In this desperate but artistically rendered struggle, the nameless young man, the central figure, feels the necessity of his permanence, of his achievement of an acute sense of meaning and, the viewer hopes, a renewed and strengthened life force that can serve as a inspiration to Chicanos and others. <br /> <br /> This tough battle uses a plot device just touched by the original work to tie together the episodic work: there are no immigrant workers from Mexico who leave no traces on their death, even if this DVD is not about migrant workers Mexicans but Mexican-Americans A highly existential work: anguish and despair; a research; a focus on a project; and redemption all under the auspices of free will despite the deterministic socio-economic and religious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Perez has a long list of credits basically as a documentary director. His numerous awards are confirmation. Producer Paul Espinosa is also known and has also been honored for his work. In fact, the 1994 film won and deserved numerous awards: first place, favored by the public at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; first place at the Cairo Film Festival; and a number of other well-deserved prizes. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this film and DVD, Earth, by Perez is the best Chicano film ever made.
