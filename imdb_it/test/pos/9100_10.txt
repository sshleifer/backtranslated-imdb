This film is all that Tenacious D fans can hope for. Director Liam Lynch has collaborated with The "D" is a mixture of epic proportions. Of course it is necessary to understand the humor and format of Tenacious D. When I saw it there were not too many laughs from the public, but the reason is not the lack of humor or intelligent jokes. This film seems to have been published on an unsuspecting public that has not become familiar with the musical duo. This film remains true to its roots. For the few of you who have seen the HBO TV series and listened to the album, they have not forgotten what their audience loves. Like the TV show, people have noticed from the trailer the scenes of the apartments of JB and KG and, of course, the open microphone nights that every episode of Tenacious D would have started and ended. The soundtrack is phenomenal and every song takes you away. <br /> <br /> ... And Dave Grohl plays a fantastic devil. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie for those of you looking for a tough time and a rocking musical.
