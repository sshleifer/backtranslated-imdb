One of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. He really "filled" his part, and that's wonderful. He's such an accomplished actor that you can't think of anyone else doing his part. <br /> <br /> And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are as good as standard French, trying to defend themselves in the fight born with a murder ... <br /> <br /> The story is breathtaking and well built. You can feel the atmosphere of Paris for that period (which is around 1930-40), between two wars ... The clubs, the old small buildings, the neighbors. <br /> <br /> All these things contribute to making a great film.
