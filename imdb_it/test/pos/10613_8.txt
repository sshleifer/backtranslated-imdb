It's a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved and detached that he is perfect for the role of an unloved cad who basically uses everyone around him. However in the last mortal act (without pun), when Coward has to do as the flying Dutchman, he is much less at ease. <br /> <br /> But his way with an epigram is unparalleled, and Hecht and Macarthur gave him some gems (Macarthur, really - it was the wit of the couple). <br /> <br /> The film is superbly lit by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement in addition to a timeline. Hecht and Macarthutr took care of one thing: getting their dialogue on screen. (NOTE: The same H&M have blink-and-you-miss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene. <br /> <br /> The most important support player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott, infamous Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors who have always been waiting in Coward's publisher reception room. <br /> <br /> Curious that Woolcott would agree to make a film that clearly lights up the legendary Algonquin Round Table, of which he was a founder, and Macarthur something of an auxiliary member. <br /> <br /> The Scoundrel won an Oscar for best story, although that victory is probably due more in Coward's imposing presence that any brilliance in the plot is Coward, Woolcott and the dialogue you remember ...
