I just brought my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this film and I can't remember a movie where I laughed so hard - literally loud, bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious. Of course, the plot is predictable, but the ride is extremely pleasant, no matter if you know how it will end. The comedian senses of the timing actors were impeccable. The actors were perfectly expressed. My children said that Amanda Bynes appears to be the last actress of young women who is not ruining their lives. She is so refreshing. My kids said this is their favorite movie of 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie.
