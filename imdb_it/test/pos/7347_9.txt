I really liked this movie. It is rare to find a star who can convincingly extract the physical aspects of any sports / dance film convincingly and also do an excellent acting job. In this film you find two stars that are up to the task. Both women offer warm, touching and sometimes entertaining shows. The film also touched on a range of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. Yet the approach was not heavy. Production values ​​were also first-rate for a low-budget film. I saw him at the Philadelphia Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and went back to see him a second time. It was a real pleasure for the crowd. I loved this movie with everyone I talked to.
