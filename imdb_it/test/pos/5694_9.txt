ATTENTION: I recommend to all those who have not yet seen the film not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> This movie was on a movie store shelf and since I saw a handful of very mushy horror movies I had really low expectations for it. Well, I entered it, and almost immediately I got sucked into it. As I watched, I deepened the story and soon I was staring at myself in complete interest. This film is surprisingly spectacular and I loved every second. The story is about a boat ride along a river in Australia. He seems pretty sure until their boat is grabbed by a croc that is ready for some food. When I looked at the back of the case I thought that this movie would have had crappy visual effects like in Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I saw the crocodile for the first time it seemed incredibly real! Don't laugh when I say it, because I'm serious, but this is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. He really knew how to accumulate tension and tension with his nails and his intense situation, I mean, think about it; Your stuck, in a tree, nowhere to escape, nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the underlying waters. You can't tell me that it doesn't make you crazy a little. He even managed to give me a shiver down my arms, like when Adam was caught by the croc and Grace and Lee were baffled. This is a very attractive film. There were maybe 1 or 2 parts where I was SLIGHTLY disinterested but, apart from that, I would say this is my favorite animal attack film I've seen.
