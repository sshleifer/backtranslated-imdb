This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the biggest single film ever made. I will put this jewel against any film in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of filmmaking. Is it practically perfect in all of them ?? a true masterpiece in a sea of ​​fake "masterpieces". <br /> <br /> The structure of this film is easily the narrowest in the history of cinema. I can't think of any other film in which something of vital importance occurs every two minutes. Literally, Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a film that practically mocks the viewer to dissect it into more detailed levels. An apparently insignificant object can be shown ?? a row of clothes, two diaries, a drop of blood emanating from a crack on the floor, a bottle of pills, etc. ?? but after a meticulous inspection it turns out to be much more ?? a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene (or perhaps the film in total), which almost always contributes to an exciting reflection on the psychological concepts that are hidden in the background until the viewer's intelligence drives them to jump into first floor. Such an event could occur a handful of times during any other film, but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur so quickly and relentlessly that the viewer must watch the film in a state of perennial readiness, in order not to miss something important. In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. How can someone in their right mind ask for more from a film of this? It is simply the highest and superlative form of cinema imaginable. <br /> <br /> The most commonly cited criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is well summarized by Zaphod B Goode, who falsely claims that the story is inconsistent, unresolved disorder that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because does not provide a final set of facts behind the intriguing questions. He claims that Ji-woon Kim threw a dozen possible explanations and left it to that. In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. A story by two sisters provides a series of objectively inseparable facts that help the viewer identify the EXACT events of every single scene in the film. If our good friend Zaphod had paid attention, would he have noticed ?? for example ?? the series of obvious flashbacks that provide sufficient factual information to make sense of the film. These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod's claim of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone who is willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only question the patience of a spectator who apparently does not want to make the slightest effort whatsoever to see them. Can Ji-woon Kim really be criticized for the intolerance of viewers who don't have the desire to understand his film? I do not believe. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that I do not insult the intelligence of critics like Zaphod who cannot "get" a story of two sisters, because in reality it has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence. The film is so effectively articulated that the only possible explanation for the confusion is the lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this film requires a rather significant amount of puzzle solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful image. You just have to put them together. Remember, was the script written by someone with the image already in mind ?? he simply separated the pieces and positioned them cleverly in order to provide a magnificent brain exercise that ?? when completed ?? gives a final form of satisfaction and a state of wonder. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. There are films that seem to start with an incomplete image and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble in design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. A story of two sisters is not. It is ironic that Zaphod claims that Darko is more masterfully constructed than A Tale of Two Sisters, especially considering that Darko not only provides NO objective facts, but also a tense ending that is the classic cliché of deus ex machina that could be abandoned at the end of any film ever made in order to provide maximum false intelligence. I'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence, but the contrast is important. Although it leaves me perplexed that Zaphod mentions a film that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that becomes discernible only through a significant application of intellectual effort. Apparently he adores his "smart" films in the most superficial form possible. This is evident when he asks 17 consecutive questions in his review which is answered quite convincingly by the film itself. Just read the Opiemar discussions in the IMDb discussion forum A Tale of Two Sisters. Anyone who reads these threads carefully and still claims the lack of an objective solution to this film could also stop watching smart movies entirely because the answers are damn OBVOSE. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say more, but I reached my limit of 1,000 words. Everything that was said here had to be said. So be it said now!
