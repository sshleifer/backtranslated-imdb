There is a lot wrong with this movie. I won't lie I must say that most of the problems seem to come from a budget that has been cut from under the film, and from some ugly editing jobs. <br /> <br /> This is not Office Space. Don't wait for comedy levels in the office space. It's a lot of fun though. It's a disaster, but at the same time a lot of fun. A funny mess of a movie. In the way Caddyshack is fun. A mess of funny unrelated scenes full of annoying and unpleasant scenes. <br /> <br /> It works as a whole, and certainly deserves a wide release. This is the best comment on the Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV nation you could hope for. The very fact that a film is exploring the idea that stupid people are growing at an alarming rate while smart people are not, is great in my book. It is not politically correct but it is worth at least a little debate.
