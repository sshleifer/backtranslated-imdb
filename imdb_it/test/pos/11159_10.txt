This film is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are really hilarious. The dialogues are witty and colloquial. The tension in the film derives not so much from the plot of the "mystery of murder" as from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel. <br /> <br /> The first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an elderly tramp, with a rather ridiculous macho harshness, followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with many good-natured smiles. Many beautiful moments of the film derive from the contrast between the two characters, for example when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to intimidate. <br /> <br /> The second story tells how a salesman, played by Jean Yanne, gives his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend. Yanne plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe it better. <br /> <br /> After a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and eventually meet, in a surprising but also logical ending. <br /> <br /> The film is a successful mix of witty but superficial gangster films that the director's father (the famous Michel Audiard) wrote, and the "typical French film" with a lot of psychological depth and care in the display of emotions.
