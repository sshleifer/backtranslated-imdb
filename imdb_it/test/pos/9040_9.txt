It is rather surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, given that Hollywood in general had the collective head in the sand regarding black and white issues at the time. The film deserves a strong appreciation for having taken this position, for having performed exceptionally well from its mostly less known cast and for the super-intelligent script that does not offend the public or takes the easy way out when it comes to white racism . Moreover, with the film's rather modest budget and fast execution time, it does a fantastic job! <br /> <br /> Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played secondary roles in many films of the time) is a proud black man who is accused of killing a white man in the south. The crowd could really care less about the details - they are simply determined to hang themselves. And, despite his commitment to the law, the only lawyer in the city who has agreed to defend him also assumes he is guilty and does not really want to know the truth - just delaying hanging until they can try to convict him and then have a legal hanging! Fortunately, a young white man (Claude Jarmin) begins to wonder about Juano's innocence and starts looking for the truth. At this point, the best character of this wonderful drama is presented, played by Elizabeth Patterson (the old lady who later played Mrs. Trumbull in I LOVE LUCY). You alone steal the show as the white person with not only a conscience, but the will and determination to defend the black. At a wonderful point in the film, a crowd is trying to push her further to reach the prisoner to kill him, but she is very firm and forces them to back down. There's a lot more to this rather complicated but cleverly written story, but I'll leave you the chance to see it for yourself. Watch it with your kids if you get the chance - it will open an amazing dialogue on how the breed reports have come over the last 50 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, apparently 1949 was a great year for Hollywood to finally face racial prejudice, as Twentieth Century Fox also released "Pinky" - an equally effective and strong film about racism, interracial marriage and even rape! See both films if you can.
