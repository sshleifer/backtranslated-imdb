I remember this film like the other person who commented. I recorded on it but I would like to have it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever. Funny, in a really bad way. I remember that the label on the box was "The last frontal lobotomy". I got it from my mother, who took it from a friend at work who said it was the worst / bloodiest movie she had ever seen, so my mother said "Probably my son will like it". and the woman gave it to him only to remove it from his possession. Then I recorded on it, which I regret. I also remember that the "corck screw" thing was one of those things that attracted ball ... yellow conical things, with a red "button" at the end, and when you hit the red thing, it sends a ball in flight. Well, they used it with a crank at one end and a corkscrew in the funnel. When the killer killed, they would show it by advancing with the "weapon" and then cut to a close-up what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victim's head. I don't know what else to say about this "gem", except that if you like bad movies, there's nothing worse.
