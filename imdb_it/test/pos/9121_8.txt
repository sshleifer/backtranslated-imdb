I love a movie that mixes edge-of-the-seat suspense, laughter, style, good acting and a bit of self-parody. Hitchcock has always carried out this operation, and in "Le Cercle rouge" Jean-Pierre Melville does the same. I was sorry when this long film is over. <br /> <br /> I agree with the English commentator who found the comments of one of my chauvinist compatriots. I love French films, Italian films, English films, Indian films - and the increasingly rare good American films. I also feel that the writer who shot the film for not even being a good copy of an American gangster film, completely missed the point. But I imagine it's like jazz: either you understand it, or you don't, so why waste time trying to explain. <br /> <br /> Just look at "Le Cercle noir" and be ready to enjoy yourself deliciously.
