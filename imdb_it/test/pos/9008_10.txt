Help the characters on which this show is based are among the best that Disney has ever imagined. Writing is what really makes this show. It's a total classic. Given, it is necessary to appreciate the kind of humor to enjoy it and this is difficult to explain. Humor is similar to the old school scenarios of the 40s and 50s Disney, with modern turns. It never degrades in fart jokes or anything like that. It's not even the humor of Adam Sandler, although I liked it. It is exactly the same humor as the film, expanded only by the time a television show allows. So if you don't like it in the movie, you won't like it here, but IMO The new groove of the emperors was the best thing to get out of Disney after Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> A +
