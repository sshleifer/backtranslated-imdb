I saw it at SIFF and I loved it. There were parts where I laughed so hard I couldn't catch my breath. Glenn McQuaid's script and direction are fantastic. I can't wait to see more from this talented young man. The performances make the film. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are as delicious as the graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman turns into a fantastic performance (as usual) as a not very nice prison priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, it perfectly balances the threat and humor. <br /> <br /> This is a style of horror comedy that has not been seen since Vincent Price made "Comedy of Terrors", "The Raven" and "Theater of Terrors". of blood. "The film is really scary in some places, then suddenly it will return to the hilarious mode, remaining totally out of balance. Some parts are scary and fun at the same time. <br /> <br /> I can only afford to see three films at SIFF this year, but even if the other two are horrible, "I Sell The Dead" was worth the price of all three. I'm going to look for more films from Larry Fessenden's Glass Eye Pix. It gives the horror genre a kick much needed in the ass.
