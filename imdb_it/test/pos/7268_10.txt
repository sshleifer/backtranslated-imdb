I am amazed to have a real love for this, since I am not a lover of action and adventure. But hey ... It's pretty hard to go wrong with a Robert Carlyle movie. I have read several scarce or moderate reviews on this film, distinguishing it for period errors or the unlikely development of the plot, but no one seems to mention the transition of the rather intriguing character that shows how a hardened and unlucky rascal (Carlyle) turns into a rather noble and altruistic hero and like the gracious coward coward (Miller) develops a real taste for the life of a man of the highway, once "he has the perception". Filled with bad boyish humor, sumptuous scenes (in particular the use of "apothacary fireworks" Plunkett) and a fascinating and eclectic musical score, Plunkett & Macleane is a film with a frenetic and very pleasant rhythm. Definitely worth watching the CLIMAX SCENE ONLY! Shoot, guys!
