The film is more than a mockumentary of corruption throughout the American system. The correlations of those who vote for those who don't care are so tried on the machines that end up voting for a comedian at the oval office. Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been mocked for years all over the world. Bushism has become a way of life for Americans and it will be the only thing that will remain after it leaves no one shortly. Strangely, the only honest person is someone who is not even elected to the office and tells the truth at the end. The story is very thin and if you go there to laugh, it's not happening. Leave a lot to think. Overall I liked it.
