I've always liked Sean Connery, but like James Bond I've always preferred Roger Moore. Yet it was Connery who dictated the standards of James Bond and while in 1983 he established himself as something other than James Bond, the money had to be irresistible for him to make an appearance like 007 again and save the world from Specter's evil designs. <br /> <br /> And what designs are in Never Say Never Again. SPECTER with the help of a young air force officer who appears to be Kim Bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war exercise and now SPECTRE led by Blofeld, played by Max Von Sydow, is threatening the world's blackmail. > <br /> The man of Von Sydow's operations is Klaus Maria Brandauer who is also courting Bassinger and is a little crazy. And he has a murderer who works for him in Barbara Carrera who does Angelina Jolie as Nora Croft as Mrs. Butterworth. <br /> <br /> But before Sean Connery can even start, he has to face a new 'M' managing things for British Intelligence. Edward Fox thinks that Connery is old-fashioned in his methods and costs too much to British taxpayers' money with his violent ways. I really liked Fox's performance, he's like the great-grandson of Colonel Blimp. I also liked Carrera, it's something to look at and quite ingenious in its methods. When he dives with Connery in the Bahamas, he notes how he puts Mr. Shark in 007's case. Will Connery do James Bond again? Has Roger Moore's father been widely quoted as saying who would choose him at this point? But I think Connery would still be terrific on a wheelchair.
