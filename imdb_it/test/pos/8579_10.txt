This is a great movie. When two people from different backgrounds and social status think they have nothing to offer each other and eventually need what the other needs testament of what the heart knows. Sometimes we wonder why a man is with a woman or vice versa and outward appearances say one thing in our eyes, but what they offer from the inside that we cannot see is surprising and inexplicable. When Nimi thought that Matthew had nothing to offer her and when Matthew was only looking for an adventure (because he had an open marriage with his wife Jenny), they finally realized that they couldn't and didn't want to exist without each other. It was worthwhile for them to resist what their family and friends thought and what society said was right to be with one another. This type of film restores my faith in love.
