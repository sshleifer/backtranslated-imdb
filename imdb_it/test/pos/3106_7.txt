While they are going to a country house to listen to a new play that is read by a theater producer, his secretary and the playwright end up in the mud. They head to a nearby house, then end up in the house of the playwright's boyfriend. If you can't guess that murder and chaos are about to happen, then you haven't paid attention. <br /> <br /> This is a good entry into the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, but there are also some strange covers that cover it. The cast is excellent and I am more than willing to have fun with good material. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say that this is one of the best of its kind, it should have been, but something happened to me in the way it got me down to just seven out of ten. I can't tell you what it is, certainly not for sure. Maybe it's the feeling that I knew where he was going from the beginning, or maybe it's something else, I'm not sure what, but there was something I couldn't shake that made me look like this movie even though I wanted to love it. I simply missed having been great and somehow failed. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I RECOMMEND THAT YOU SEE IT. After all, it is a very witty film, which fully entertains, although it lacks only to be fantastic.
