Another classic performance by Maniratnam and his team. They can be proud to show this film in all film festivals because it has everything it takes to name it as an "all-time classic". The war and its impact in Sri Lanka through the eyes of a ten-year-old girl is the film, but the scenes and circumstances will certainly not be the ones that will be waiting for you. Madhavan is not surprising that he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and a unique identity to the role he plays, and he needs real audacity to act like a father for three children when he is considered a dream boy with a personality fascinating in the sector. AR Rahman's music makes the film special for those who love melodies. Above all the story and the way it is told makes it the best film of recent times.
