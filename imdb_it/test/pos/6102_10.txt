I just watched this movie on TV and it was great. <br /> <br /> he had just planned to watch it while he did some work, but in the end I watched the whole movie without working, because it was so beautiful! <br /> <br /> Actors are not very well known, but the plot makes up for it. the fact that the actors are less known only makes it more credible that events can happen. I didn't feel a prejudice against a character, because I had no opinion on the type of character, as I had never seen any of the actors in a film that made him even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I would recommend looking at it.
