The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on a somewhat pat formula now animated by Japanese theatrical souls. The formula goes quite so: <br /> <br /> 1. The main protagonist comes from a world outside normal society and has superpowers. <br /> <br /> 2. There is a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role. <br /> <br /> 3. There is a normal character who shares the main role in the story. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things occur in normal social settings. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes the story is about the main character and the normal character that connects to the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. No one has ever made any effort to get all the magical powers. They just have it. <br /> <br /> 7. Usually, people outside this narrow group of fussy people are not aware of their super powers, and continue their daily lives. <br /> <br /> So here we are. The melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi is made on these lines which has become the successful formula for comics and anime in Japan. Although it follows a pat formula, the series is superbly crafted and the episodes are always set in an interesting flip side of the coin within the normal social settings that always turn into unusual circumstances surrounding Haruhi Suzumiya. Every player in history carries an unusual vision of everyday life that we are usually not aware of. The philosophical touch of their insights is what makes this series extremely fun. The images are top notch and beautifully made. <br /> <br /> The crazy ideas that Haruhi always seems to come along with the complicated environments of the story could give you headaches from time to time. It is further complicated by the fact that the episodes are reproduced out of sequence, which further contributes to the confusion. When I looked at the episodes in the chronological sequence, some plots finally made sense. I advise you to do the same. It's much more fun to watch the series this way.

And oh, you might notice the headache while you're looking at this like I did. Let me know if you have it too.
