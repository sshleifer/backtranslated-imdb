An excellent story with the supperb that plays throughout the cast. The warmth and intuition of those who represent Joad has passed from the screen and into the heart of this viewer. Mother Madalyn's frustration and tenacity in her quest to do her work until her last breath was also done with excellence by Barbara Hershey. The plot between the personalities of Joad and Mother Madalyn grew throughout the plot with a breathtaking crescendo in the final scene.
