This film was one of the best I've ever seen. Just the other day I was reminded of this movie by something on TV. It came back to me like a flooded dam. I've never been more touched by a movie than by this one. After the movie was finished, I couldn't really stop crying for about 2 hours. No film has ever moved me before. I was 15 at the time of the film and haven't seen it since, but I hope I can find a copy to buy so I can watch it whenever I want. If someone suggests you watch this movie with them, GO .... you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Peggy Fries
