Ok, so I'm a crap from a good documentary, especially where it tells a modern story of Don Quixote. A word of warning: I met Mark Borchardt in the winter of 1995/96 while still working at Coven. But I'll save that story for later. American Movie, which began production not long after, accurately portrays the person I knew, though more thoroughly than I expected or believed existed. This is at the same time a very funny and very sad film, and it is brilliantly executed. Mark presents himself as his worst enemy: his childish ambition and optimism - which I admire - are undermined by his apparent artistic ineptitude and his bizarre fiscal expectations. But he is also a charismatic boy. His faithful companion Sancho Panza is equally likeable: faithful, if dazzled, in the center. Like Don Quixote, the American film presents an inefficient, often ignored, aspect of freedom - that people will be attracted to professions that are not particularly suitable, regardless of repeated failure. It's a great movie.
