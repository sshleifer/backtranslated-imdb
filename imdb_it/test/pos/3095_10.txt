You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this movie if you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another that plunges into a track full of mirages. You will be able to accurately guess that this film is not about a "story". At first sight, it is also easy to think that the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the sharpness of your perception, which is based on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images. If after this opening, you want to watch the movie, you won't get bored. You could also be hypnotized. The film can be an emotional experience; it could be an intellectual experience; could be both. Judging by the commentary of the DVD, which is essential, it was above all an emotional experience for Herzog, and, at a certain point, he explicitly talks about how the film is a collaboration between director and viewer. There is plenty of room for the viewer to make this film exactly what he or she wants to make of it. Take a gamble?
