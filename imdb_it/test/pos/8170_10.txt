I could be sentimental But I found this film really moving. It was the first film that reduced me to tears. And he did it more than once !! I recommend it to anyone who is gay or str8. Religious or not! Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with its linings. Even the nude scenes were beautifully done and everything was tasteful. The most shocking thing was the representation of the deprogramming of the orientation reversal established by the Mormon Church to the main character. It shocked me that this still continues in the world. However, I really enjoyed this movie. This is definitely the best gay movie from the Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movie offered that year: The Fluffer.
