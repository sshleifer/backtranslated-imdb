During the last ten minutes of this exceptional film, I was snapping like an idiot. I must say that the idea of ​​sitting down to see 90 minutes of what must have been a rather depressing material on Sunday was not a welcome one. The thought of yet another, extremely worthy chance of winning at the BAFTA did not excite me ...... However the final result struck me as 6. This is one of the best televisions I've seen in a long time. For years I had the impression that all originality had left the BBC dramatic department. Our Friends in the North was the last production that really upset me and that was 10 years ago. However, faith is restored and honor is satisfied. David Tenant was incredible! So many actors that I can think of would actually have gone to the city in a part like this, but never at first I saw Mr. Tenant as an actor or as a doctor, all I saw was Alan Hamilton. I haven't had my heart ripped so hard since Daniel Craigs played Geordie Peacock all those years ago. Sarah Parish was also incredible and I really hope this role brings her best roles in the future. The whole cast was great but a special mention must go to the director who really put us in the head of Alans. The toaster scene in particular made me feel rather sick.
