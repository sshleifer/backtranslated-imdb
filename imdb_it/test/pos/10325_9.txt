OK, the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this little gem, or the story that started in life as a material for Buster Keaton's silent classic "7 Chances". Comedy, or acting in a genre for so long, is simply interpreting a scene and the lines that someone else has written and interpreted before, if it is not a totally original creation. Here we have The Stooges essentially making material that has been written and interpreted by someone else, yet for a low budget, a short period of time in a movie, they are handling things well. Regardless of what the credits in their films say, the real "stooge-philes" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction. They took their job seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. Words spoken by the same Emil Sitka during a documentary about boys. Here, what appears to be their usual anarchy over something as simple as getting married, is actually an organized chaos. Each line is perfectly synchronized with a related physical action. How many comedians are there today that can boast such mastery? More obviously the crew of Seinfeld, but no one else I've seen in the last 35 years of watching TV. Critics will always have "pooh pooh" The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others but then again ... who ever remembers the names of the critics or what they said? Just look, laugh and have fun!
