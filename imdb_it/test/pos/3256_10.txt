So today I turned on the TV at 13:00 on Sunday, expecting to see crap and infomercials, and this great movie had just started, I didn't know what it was but it attracted me almost immediately. The film was excellent. <br /> <br /> there were a couple of things that made no sense to one I don't understand why the dead man was talking about doing things to get you out of your bad situation, but then Jimmy really doesn't do anything except basic things to survive that anyone would do in his situation, in other words it was not his initiative to pull him out of his bad situation was just luck, second I don't take the matter of the girl who kills the gangsters at the end, because the whole thing was partially borrowed from the people of the thief who steals Panda's money, and then the other thief kills Panda in the end, so they steal his money twice and kill him how good it is?
