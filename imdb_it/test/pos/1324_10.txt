One might think that a film based on the life of the Japanese author Yukio Mishima would be a daunting or even impossible task. However, Paul Schrader has made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb and complex. Although it is not a literal biography, Schrader and his co-writer Leonard Scharder (his brother) have taken several episodes of his life, including his success, and have realized what can best be described as visually scattered and amazing incisions. . Mishima's homosexuality is almost not there, due to the legal threats of his widow, but despite this, the film is still exceptional and one of the best films I saw in 1985. I would also like to mention the important contribution of Philip Glass who he made the score, which adds an additional plot to the film, and is superior to what he did for Scundese's Kundun. Also noteworthy is the finely colored cinematography of John Bailey and the great production and costume design by Eiko Ishioka who continued to make memorable costumes for Dracula di Coppola for whom he received a well-deserved Oscar. We hope that this film will soon be available on DVD.
