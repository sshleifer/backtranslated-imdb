For the first talking image of Greta Garbo, MGM wisely chose Eugene O'Neill's Pultizer Prize winner in 1921, playing ANNA Christie. <br /> <br /> Even wisely, the producers supported Garbo not with one but two members of the original Broadway cast (George Marion in the role of Anna, Chris and James T. Mack's father as Johnny the Priest - transmuted to "Johnny" the Harp "for films so as not to offend). <br /> <br /> This small change is interesting. Like too many films accused (from those who want MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins) to be "little more than filmed theatrical representations", the problem is not the game but the filmmakers who would no longer be loyal to the property. Diluting a great cinematographic work on stage so as not to offend anyone, or opening it because they MAY, too many lose their same qualities that have made the piece worthy of being filmed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the respect that the studio had had for O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably adopted generally sensible film adaptation of Frances Marion. Wonder of wonders, Marion even admits the POINT of the scene in which Garbo's Anna reveals her past in "farm" to the man she badly wants to marry and her father who sent her there with tact! What the League of Decency must have thought! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem of the source game has always been that Chris's friend, Marty, tends to abandon the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can take his place: the two sides of the really good woman men do not always recognize. <br /> <br /> The perfect interpreter of Marie Dressler (who had already entered her teeth on the Broadway stage before going to Hollywood) is the perfect balance even for Anna di Garbo in this area and the fast-moving film at just 90 minutes, it doesn't leave us too much time to miss it - one of the few benefits of the atmosphere is shown rather than eloquently described in the original - And screenwriter Marion is wise enough to move away from O'Neill to bring Dressler back two scene of the film that will remember many of the appearances of the second act of Julie Laverne in SHOW BOAT. <br /> <br /> The first scenes of Anna and Marthy on the screen (16 minutes in the film) that measure each other and show all the tension of the rest of the story are among the most engaging scenes of the entire song . Not to be missed. <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragedy and a good dramatic film. It is hard to imagine that a remake of the last few days, which will almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake (it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - even with the original Broadway Chris by George Marion) could improve on these excellent shots. <br /> <br /> The interior scenes are closer to the game, but the exteriors should not be ignored by anyone who has an eye on the atmosphere. Although the work on the background screen is not aimed at modern technical standards, the backgrounds offer a better glimpse than most movies of the real-world era where screen playback is set (especially in the port of New York). <br /> <br /> Almost all of Garbo's naturalistic performances of the sound age have held up superbly (only the scene of the too often parody death of CAMILLE, 7 years later, will occasionally attract some snickers due to of heavy direction and parodies), but this ANNA Christie, along with the variety of her films of 1932, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the sublime touch of Lubitsch in her 1939 comedy, NINOTCHKA ("Garbo ride!"), surely they stand at their best. <br /> <br /> O 'Neill fans who are brought with this comedy to the margins of his praised "sea shows" should track down the World War II-shaped movie released in the year before the United States they entered into conflict, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). He is almost skillfully drawn from those seaside dramas like this to ANNA Christie, and presents a very young John Wayne in one of his rare non-westerners who supports a cast of veteran actors who show him the way.
