Michelle Pfeiffer is ideally chosen as the widow of a frustrated crowd in this colorful black comedy. Matthew Modine plays a clumsy FBI agent who has taken a fantasy for her. Dean Stockwell steals the show as the big shot that continues to torment Pfeiffer; Mercedes Ruehl is as dynamic as his jealous wife. They are all very eighties, but this only adds to the fun. A good film, even if not for all tastes.
