Mel Brooks has really outdone himself with this hilarious stand-up in the story of Robin Hood. The cast is perfect, and Cary Elwes does a great job in his role. In my personal opinion (besides the fact that I'm a fan of Cary Elwes), this film is the best and most fun I've ever seen! It will make you laugh every time you see it!
