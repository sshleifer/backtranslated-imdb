First of all, I know almost nothing about rugby, so even though I found the rugby aspect of this film interesting, it may have been a sport and I think I would have liked it too. The fact that for rugby was neither better nor worse for me. <br /> <br /> What made this film great is the story itself, based on real events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the Highland Rugby club. Coach Gelwix is ​​the type of coach that most parents would like to have for their children, someone who cares more about the person than the sport (even if they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years!) . The more I learned about the coach and the team, the more I like this film and its message. <br /> <br /> I saw other sports films that at first seemed great, but then I searched for the details only to find that most of these films were made at 10% and 90% of fiction, with the 10% of exaggerated facts. Not so with Forever Strong. It may sound too good to be true, but this is what is so surprising. If it were fiction it would just be a funny story and nothing more. Instead, the film is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie due to some negative reviews from professional critics. I read some of their reviews and most of them gave the movie horrible reviews. These are generally the same critics who rave about films that most people hate. In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics gave good reviews of the film because they almost always disagree with their opinions. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie and post your review (positive or negative)! Currently most of the public reviews are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites), and I'm interested to see if this trend continues. Thank you!
