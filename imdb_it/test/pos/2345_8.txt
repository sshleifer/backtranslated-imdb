One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film production that has not been given the credit it deserves. His IMDB classification of 1.7 does not do him justice and is, perhaps, due to the very few projections he had, rather than to the quality of the film itself. Filmed in black and white, the film is well directed with production values ​​that disprove its small budget. The performances are excellent, in particular that of Gary Lewis who improves with every role. My only criticisms are that it is a little too long and could have done with a more humorous touch to compensate for the darker moments. Overall, though, it's a nice piece of work.
