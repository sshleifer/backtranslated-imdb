This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I didn't really understand the guests. I knew they weren't serious, but if they really were it wasn't clear why ... I guess I'm just so stupid. I don't know if this lesson is like a spoiler, but guests are not as real as in Ali g or whatever they are interpreted by one man or so I think. I love the serious look that is happening. It's like that program that was on a Sunday morning that I forgot the name of lol. I also really like the dress and mustache thing he had. It's quite hot. It is insensitive that it is one of the most amusing qualities. I also like the way it has program sub-sections. It makes it seem more authentic.
