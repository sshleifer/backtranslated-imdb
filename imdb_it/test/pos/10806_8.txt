This is a great movie to watch, since it was directed by Andrzej Wajda, but at the same time I wanted the film to have a little more depth in terms of history. It is a historically relevant film about the last days of the French revolution, but the film forgets to focus on the motivations of the character, making the film perhaps a bit too superficial to consider this film brilliant and relevant for that. <br /> <br /> Somehow it doesn't make the movie any less beautiful to look at though. It is made with passion and attention to detail. every aspect of the film looks good, like its settings, costumes and camera work. <br /> <br /> Even the story still functions as powerful, although at the same time it could have been much better and more powerful with a little more character development and in-depth historical information. Guess if you are completely familiar with the French revolution and the stories of Danton and Robespierre in particular, this film will be perfect for you to watch. <br /> <br /> It is rather typical for a French film to tell a slow and subtle story, without ever giving too many details. Often this works in a fascinating way but in this case the film could really have been done with a little more depth. In addition to this, this film is still an excellent example of French cinema, despite being directed by a Polish director and also featuring many Polish actors. <br /> <br /> GÃ©rard Depardieu is great in his role, although the film decides to focus a lot on many other different characters. The film has perhaps a little too many characters, but every performance is exceptional, so this is never really a big problem, apart from the fact that it slows the story down a bit at certain points. <br /> <br /> A great movie that could have been brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
