In this movie "Virtual Sexuality" the seventeen year old Justine is not lucky in love. One day when he stands up, he goes with his friend to a virtual reality conference, where he is presented with a machine that can change your appearance, dody and anything you like in Virtual Reality. He decides to try it, but starts to create his boyfriend, his dream state. Then suddenly there is an explosion in a gas pipe and its creation comes to life. I won't say anything else, you'll have to watch the movie, which is pretty fun to watch.
