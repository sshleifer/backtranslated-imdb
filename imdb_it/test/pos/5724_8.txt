Time To Kill (Time To Kill) by Guiliano Montaldo is a rather strange film, but it's okay in its own way. <br /> <br /> I will not elaborate with a summary of the plot. Most of what I've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who have written those do not really understand the movie. And you have to figure it out at a certain level, even if you can't describe what it really is. This film is strange in a way "Once upon a time in America" ​​- only shorter. <br /> <br /> Many Hollywood stars (whatever that means ...) have played in lesser known Italian productions. It is known that many actors who have passed their first or are slowly increasing do so. Cage was not yet a real star when he was created. I'm not his fan. He is very good in some roles (Raising Arizona, Bringing the Dead) and weak when he plays the hero. I really don't know what to think of him in this, but he certainly doesn't play the typical main character of the hero. This film could have done without him, but the fact that he acted could be the only reason this was ever done on DVD. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is good. None of them looks fake and behave as if they really were there. Solid support. <br /> <br /> I have seen 3 Montaldo films (Marco Polo, Sacco and Vanzetti and this one) and I think he is one of the greatest directors of this period. Unfortunately, nobody knows him. This film was his last in a long time (a 19-year break). I think this film may have failed in the office, but from the way it is done I think that for Montaldo it was a personal project that he really liked. <br /> <br /> Production is exceptional. It's always enough The dusty army camps, the claustophobic cities and the magnificent landscape play an important role. It all seems very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but Ennio Morricone's music is very good. It is not a piece that you will whistle when you are in the shower, but it certainly works great. <br /> <br /> So this movie looks, feels and sounds good. You don't need the lessons learned from it on a gold plate, but that could be the biggest difference between Hollywood and the euro-cinema all around. It might seem strange to give him an 8 and not recommend it to people, but that's what I do. If you are looking for an action; avoid this! If you are looking for a well done Apocalypse Now in another time and setting, but with a bit of a similar journey in a 'mood' (sorry if this sounds trivial but I don't know what else to call it) you could enjoy this
