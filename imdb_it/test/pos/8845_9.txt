Being my first John Carpenter film, I have to say that I was very impressed with The Thing. From the beginning, the film attracts you and never lets you down. The special effects and models of the film hold up well today. Besides Kurt Russell, I was not familiar with any of the cast members, but they were all exceptional in conveying fear, paranoia and desperation to survive. The universal DVD has a wealth of extras behind the scenes very interesting. Strongly recommended, 9/10.
