As a Frenchman, I found it very pleasant to be able to laugh at the old stereotype that is made of French like that, in some Western default, in Spy movies, etc ... and also in many other things, along the way ... I've seen it 3 times and every time I discovered new things and I laughed to tears ... Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, Aure Atika, the director and the whole cast, all the crew did a fantastic job. This movie is fun but it is also much more than that: it has a lot of levels. You laugh because of the simple gags, because of some critics made with wit (the film is brave enough to be critical), because of the physical comedy, because you believe in the characters etc ... Aesthetically and musically, it is also a success. Go see it if you can.
