Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, but does not come close to Bullitt's correspondence. Bullitt has a start that builds build builds. When McQueen leaves the shabby hotel, he enters his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway and notices the loader sitting next to you, you know you're about to see something spectacular. From that moment on, when McQueen starts that car, the best sequence of car chases ever filmed begins. Adding you is a fantastic Lalo Schriffin if I remember the soundtrack well. This goes on for a long time before you really feel the first tires squeak. That shot of McQueen's Mustang that suddenly appears in Bill Hickman's rearview mirror is unrivaled for its visual impact. Hickman's look of surprise and the double take really adds to the effect. So, of course, San Francisco has no equal for the setting of cars that run up and down hills and in corners. In addition, Bullitt was shot in the 1960s when the cars were still "hot" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) made for a better set of wheels, then two boring and smog loads of Pontiacs in the 70s. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad car in both films. I saw him sitting at a movie preview in the Univeral section when I was shooting film reviews for a newspaper. They gave him a good performance in Seven Ups even though with the chase scene. Seven ups had some "jumps" on small hills, (Yawn) but obviously they were not San Francisco hills. The pursuit of Seven Ups, where they are going really fast, is longer than the Bullitt go-stop sequence. But the scene of a single shotgun that explodes totally in the hood of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the culmination of absurdity. Closely Hollywood, I would say, except that it was shot in New York.
