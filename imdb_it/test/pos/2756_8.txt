This is a "revised" presentation by Riverdance, staged at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Of the three Irish "dance" musicals I saw in the mid-90s (which includes the first "Riverdance" and "Lord of the Dance") I really enjoyed this. <br /> <br /> I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, has a more varied and colorful stage and eliminated two pieces for that original which was not good to begin with. This is just a very solid show with few weaknesses. To be sure, there are some songs / dances that are simply "right" but none poor, which is surprising considering there are 20 numbers in all. <br /> <br /> The cast is similar to the first Riverdance with the main exception of Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as a prominent dancer. Both are extremely talented. The main difference could be in their appearance with Dunne, a guy with black hair, while Flatley is the shaved blonde. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big that it sometimes gets boring. The female protagonist, Jean Butler, fortunately, is still there and it's nice to look at: what a pretty beauty and talent! Butler and the rest of these women have the most beautiful legs I've seen on the dancers. I also liked the dance of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco show and two boys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. A number - with these two pairings against Dunne and two other dancers -0 is called "Trading Taps" and it's really fun to watch, maybe the highlight of the whole show. I don't have any complaints even for the violinist Eileen Ivers. <br /> <br /> The "fast" Irish songs here attracted me more. I appreciated the audience that did not obstruct the performance with screams and screams like those of women in the "Lord Of The Dance" video.
