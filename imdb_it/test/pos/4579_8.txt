This movie is fun and sad enough I think it's a bit true. If you love Office Space, then you'll love this movie because it's another Mike Judge hit, but it's nothing like Office Space. I told everyone to watch this movie. I just hope he would have been in more theaters so that he would get the recognition he deserved. I love this movie and would love to see more from Mike Judge. Luke Wilson is also what makes this film what it is. I am so happy that I will not be alive in the year 2505, because if this film turns out to be true we will all find ourselves in a lot of trouble. I just hope more people see this movie because I know they'll love this movie too.
