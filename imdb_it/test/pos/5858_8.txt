Murder by Numbers is a pretty good movie. Even if the plot proceeds at a snail's pace, with the character of Sandra Bullock who has confused herself with her partner and the film that reports on a previous situation of trauma in which she was, she manages to keep the viewer involved in the film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I think it does a good job in creating that eerie atmosphere like "who did it". It makes you think of which one was really behind the murder, if not both. I think Ryan Gosling and that other guy (lol) do a good job selling that bully relationship against dork. I'm not sure that Gosling made a bad joke, but for a guy who later starred in a movie like The Notebook, he did a great job. Once the film starts spinning, however, I really found myself involved in the story, as if you were asking me "Oh my God, what would I do if I were in that situation?" Like I said, a good CSI movie, maybe not for the drug addict EXTREME crime drama movie, but a good movie all around. <br /> <br /> 8 outta 10
