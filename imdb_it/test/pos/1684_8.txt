Over the years, there are some movies that pass and almost no one sees. <br /> <br /> Choose Conner is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> This little gem has played in some festivals and had a short 2-week period in a small theater in West Hollywood, making everything about $ 5500. <br /> <br /> Now it's in DVD I hope many others see this. <br /> <br /> It is a strange drama of a shrewd young politician who influences a very bright 15-year-old boy. This politician also has a handsome nephew (around 17) who befriends the 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The previous paragraph is slightly vague about what happens, SO is the film, and this is what I appreciated, we don't have all the facts, much is left to our mind. You will hear a dialogue that makes this logical .. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is slightly vague, this is another point on which the public can reflect <br /> < br /> Alex D. Linz is our fifteen year old, he was about 17 when he made this film, but he can easily pass for the younger ones. He's been in movies and on TV since he was a kid, he's a very good actor and he's pretty convincing. <br /> <br /> Escher Holloway is the oldest teenager, this role is his first major part and he too is excellent. <br /> <br /> Now I'm saving the best for last, the writer / director, <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For a first effort a big thumb up. I hope both he and our 2 boys have a long career. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
