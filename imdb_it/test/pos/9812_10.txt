Simply a fantastic bittersweet movie that portrays one side of life is often overlooked with beautiful films. I saw him as a child and came back very recently and fell in love again. <br /> <br /> As a child he aroused my interest exclusively for the construction of a plane, as an adult he captured me dark world and a young man flee from that world. <br /> <br /> The portrait of the King was great, the style of the camera chosen with low shots and shots focused on actions and hand movements was thought to be well done, personally I can't remember anything done enough in that style and adds to the character and portrays it as an almost non-human force (which may not be far from reality) that makes developments interesting <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at any day
