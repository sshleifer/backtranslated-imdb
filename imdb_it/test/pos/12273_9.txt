"Zen and the Art of Lanscaping", written and directed by David Kartch, is a short film about a young man named David (his friends call him Zen) and what transpires in a strange day of his life. Zen functions as a lanscaper for a middle-high class family. The landlady tries to convince Zen to help her betray her husband. Unfortunately, her son comes to them instead of her husband. From this point on the film begins to accelerate through many revelations among the characters together with the possible involvement of the man of the house. "Zen and the Art of Landscaping" is witty, intelligent and overall very well written. Even the comedic timing of the actors is very strong. It's a fun and light film that I highly recommend.
