I thought the plot was done very well. I really enjoyed this movie. If you are going around on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought tearing up movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently someone doesn't think so. I really liked the movie. I'm also thinking of buying it. I want it to be my first DVD for my room. This is how I like it. I prefer not to start an online discussion with someone I don't know and it's over for a movie. If someone could kindly retract what they said about the plot, I would be more than happy to withdraw my insult. However, if they feel that I am not worthy of a retraction, I could simply feel that they are not worthy of it. But I can't control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, they don't have to do retractions, but I'd really appreciate it.
