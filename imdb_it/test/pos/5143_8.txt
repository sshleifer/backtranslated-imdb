In "Hoot" Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the new boy at school who has just moved from Montana. But Florida is very different from Montana. Despite the problems getting mixed up, Roy discovers a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant arrives in the city and the families of burrow owls are in trouble. Can the new baby, a tomboy (Brie Larson) and a fugitive (Cody Linley) stop big business from destroying these owls' homes? <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty good. The guys (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the real stars of this film. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) is fine, but he really doesn't have a very important part. Not even Robert Wagner (mayor) or Jimmy Buffett (Mr. Ryan). <br /> <br /> However, this was a fun movie that the whole family will enjoy. For the first time producer, I thought that Jimmy Buffett put together a quality work. Also the owls were really nice.
