The last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what is probably insanity was In Dreams. In that movie, you didn't see the madness, you were there. Now The Cell arrives with an updated and much more disturbing portrait of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a boy in a coma, and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying. The things he later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are incredibly imaginative and fascinating, most of these things have never been seen before in the film. <br /> <br /> The history of The Cell is not exactly something that is truly revolutionary. In fact, it's basically the same story as The Silence of the Lambs. You have a murderer in custody and these people must enter his mind to find a victim who is currently in danger of losing his life. The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim, while in The Cell, you have to enter the mind of a killer to find your victim. However, despite the unfortunately weak history, The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of psychological thriller. No one who has ever been done approaches it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film has had a good direction and has been extremely well played. Vince Vaughn offers another of his extraordinarily excellent performances (he was also as good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 remake of Psycho), and even Jennifer Lopez does the second good job of her career (the other is the great Out of Sight) . Nothing can be said about cinematography in The Cell to give it sufficient credit, it was imaginative and fascinating and unparalleled in everything that has ever been seen in the history of cinema. The Cell is an incredibly well made film and deserves to be recognized.
