Rock Star is a "cute" movie. Everyone is nice Even the guys who shouldn't be kind are really nice. Chris is a good boy, learning a life lesson. He returns to his girlfriend Emily, who is also pretty. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful film, despite all the kindness. Maybe I'm used to all the anguish of X Gen music. In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and it wasn't hard enough to be credible. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg's acting is pretty good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well, but it wasn't complicated. She was a good girl. <br /> <br /> Go see it. If you've ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, go see it.
