How do you know if a movie is good or not? It's the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "Dead Man Walking" shocked me a lot. I looked at him twice. I don't know if I'll be strong enough to watch it again. No, I didn't feel well after seeing it, but the film had the success it had. <br /> <br /> Robbins did a great job incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided making a discussion that could easily be seen as partial or subjective. I hope many people see "Dead Man Walking". I believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty with so much enthusiasm must see the film. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else it could do to finally convince everyone that this relic of ancient times has no place in modern society. <br /> <br /> The film itself does not make a debate for or against the death penalty. Describes the reality. Reality is the best argument against the death penalty. <br /> <br /> A 10/10 for great shows, good cinema and the most important film made in the years <br /> <br /> Thanks, Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
