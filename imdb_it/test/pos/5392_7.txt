Gary Cooper and a marshal change identities, since both agree that Cooper would be more efficient in the face of outlaws. What is remarkable in this film are the costumes, both of the marshal and Steve Cochran, who is the villain. Cochran wears his rifles backwards, probably to be able to move backwards. The film starts quite exciting with a showdown with Wild Bill Hickok. Ruth Roman, who looks very pretty, is the marshal's girlfriend. There is a lot of action, never a dull moment, but you have to concentrate, because the plot is a bit complicated. Good entertainment
