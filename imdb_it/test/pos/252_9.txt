He borrowed from Columbia for Gene Kelly's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his films. Cover Girl also became the Rita Hayworth film for the GIs and their fantasies about the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where Rita is a dancer and Phil Silvers the comedian. Obviously Kelly does a little hoof there. <br /> <br /> Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when he discovers that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother. In some flashback sequences of the gaslight era, Hayworth also plays the grandmother with Jess Barker who plays the young Kruger. It could be remembered that Jess Barker was the husband of that other legendary red head, Susan Hayward. <br /> <br /> Broadway producer Lee Bowman is also attracted to Hayward, but is not interested in nostalgia. He wants her for his Ziegfeld Follies magazine and in fact the biggest number of Cover Girl is the song of the movie's title. It is well done in Follies style. <br /> <br /> Hayworth will also sing A Sure Thing in a gas light era number and in the only song on the show not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, Hayworth also makes an old English music hall number Poor John. When I say sing, as everyone knows Rita's words. The singing here is done by Nan Wynn. <br /> <br /> The biggest success of the show is Long Ago and Far Away, presented by Gene Kelly. It was one of the greatest successes of the Second World War era and one of the greatest salesmen that Jerome Kern ever wrote. In fact, it happens to be the favorite of my aunt who with my uncle will celebrate 60 years of marriage this September. Long Ago and Far Away was nominated for the best song, but lost Swinging on a Star. <br /> <br /> What really sets Cover Girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for Gene Kelly are the two Put Me numbers, the test and the Alter Ego number. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer had refused to MGM to give Kelly creative control over his material. Kelly later said that the alter ego number was one of the most difficult things he had ever tried in his career. In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. <br /> <br /> Indeed, after another film on loan, Christmas Holiday at Universal, Louis B. Mayer never loaned Gene Kelly for the rest of the time he was at MGM. From that moment on he obtained creative control. <br /> <br /> With that dazzling cinematography in technicolor, Rita's red hair and the boundless creativity of Gene Kelly, Cover Girl was and is a classic and will always be.
