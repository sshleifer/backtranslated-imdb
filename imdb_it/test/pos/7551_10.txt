FOUR FRIENDS was advertised for the first time on HBO in 82 years. Having heard the term "sleeper" when I was 14, I was anxious to see one. (!) Boy - I was surprised! That film! I had never fallen in love with a film with special effects outside of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MOTHER - much less a "hippy flick" ... but having grown up with a couple of hippies - I understood the power behind Mr. Penn's movie. FOUR FRIENDS is certainly one of a kind. The script is so nice - and that cast !!! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor SO well! He simply personifies the "type of writer" in a t-shirt - both clever and clumsy (the window scene ...) and strong but very vulnerable. For me, he captures what it means to be so busy with agility that lasts over a decade ... and I have always found comfort in the character - and in the film. Throughout the 1980s FOUR FRIENDS was an accomplice to crime for me - and I took the film whenever I could on HBO - even though I had to stay awake until 5 am! Yet, always at the end, there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters separate from the spectators on the beach. Jodi Thelen plays "that girl" all the way - it's so hard not to be fascinated by her. This film is really the test of time. Sometimes I watch my video ... or monster to a friend ... and AGAIN gets a solid reaction. I have known women who fall in love with Georgia absolutely! So many levels ..! Only an incredible piece from 60 years of humanity. Very special, very magical. I recently found THE NOVELIZATION of FOUR FRIENDS by Robert Grossbach - and it's even more detailed than the movie! Actual dates of events, etc. A real find! And what's more - haha ​​- I found the novel while flipping through a used book store ... in Omaha, NE of ALL the places !!! I suppose you should have it by eye! When I was in Los Angeles in 92, working as an extra, I went to a tiny trimmings shop - and there were lots of photos from the movie !!! Unfortunately - I was broke and I could not indulge ... but boy, those photos of Georgia and all together they crossed me! I met director Joe Sergant on the set of SKYLARK in Emporia, KS in the summer of 92 ... and we talked about FOUR FRIENDS - very cool! Also ... working in a video store in Omaha in 98 - I waited for a female who was a relative of Jim Metzler ..! I told her to report that there was a child in Omaha who was just a fanatic about the movie - and she got the most out of it. Once again, the film captures everything that is in the heart of Danilo's character ... great, great job --- one of Mr. Tesich and Penn's best efforts. Steve Tesich really missed it. An incredible writer. "Isadora Duncan !!!" <br /> <br /> - C.
