Well, I've been watching this movie for over 25 years and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is certainly one of the most unique films ever made. <br /> <br /> I still think Martin Sheen was "dissed" even in the billing. It dominates the film, but has a lower billing than Marlon Brando, who appears only in the last 30 minutes of this 2-hour and 17-minute film (theatrical version). How unfair is this? <br /> <br /> Sheen is fantastic here, especially her storytelling, which runs everywhere. It's one of the best narratives, if not the best, I've ever heard in a movie. His voice is just disturbing as he tells his thoughts in this incredible nightmare adventure. I have never failed to appreciate his work in this film. <br /> <br /> The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years is the number of memorable scenes, which I have never forgotten, like .... .. <br /> <br /> Sheen he loses it in his hotel room in the first scene of the film; Robert Duvall and the totally inappropriate surf scenes and then the next attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music that exploded from helicopters; The Playboy bunny who entertains the troops; Frederic Forrest has gone mad seeing a tiger up close in the jungle; the strange scenes on the long river boat ride; the appearance of the hippy journalist Dennis Hopper who greets the crew in Cambodia and then the bizarre character of Brando. Go on and on with strange scenes. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that I liked everything. No, there are some very unpleasant scenes, like the one in which an ox is cut in half (you can't see it anymore), an innocent family is massacred on a small boat by the young group of Sheen and the crew is a bit 'too silly sometimes. Then, there is the enormous amount of swear words, conducted by too many f-words. <br /> <br /> So, there are a lot of good and bad things in this movie for almost everyone who watches this. One thing is for sure: it's a movie you will remember!
