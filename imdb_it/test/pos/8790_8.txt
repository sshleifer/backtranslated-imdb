Hitchcock has made at least 11 films about the common man, unjustly accused, on the run (sometimes really running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control, the first is "The 39 Steps", which made it really popular in Britain. It is really his main theme. <br /> <br /> Others include "Young and innocent", "Saboteur", "Enchantment", "Stage show", "Foreigners on a train", "I confess", "To Catch a Thief", "The Wrong Man "," North by Northwest "and finally" Frenzy ". "Saboteur" begins Robert Cummings in the role of Barry Kane, an aircraft employee during the war accused of killing his colleague and his best friend during an act of sabotage on the plant. Meet the model Patricia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane, during her run by the law, and later, of course, the various Nazi-fascist sympathizers along the way. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is mainly as "The 39 Steps", including similar plot devices such as handcuffs, the blonde who does not trust the main character at the beginning, a race across the country (in a case of London in Scotland, and in the other California in New) York), and meeting the "colored" locals along the way. And so, just like "The man who knew too much", I think this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's early works. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he presents himself as an American ordinary, a kind of "ordinary man" with whom the public can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is more involved in Madeline Carroll's action in "The 39 Steps" and Ruth Roman in "Strangers on a Train". As mentioned elsewhere, however, Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also liked Vaughan Glaser's performance as the blind uncle; his jokes are great. There are some fun touches along the way for some comic relief, such as the signs with the character of Priscilla Lane on them, and circus performers and the truck driver, Murray Alper. Contrary to other opinions here, there are not too many characters who immediately believe Barry Kane's innocence. <br /> <br /> There are some slow parts, especially when the action moves first to New York, but it rises quickly when the last programmed act of the fifth columnist gets underway. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite Hitchcock movies (I put it in my top 5), especially in these days of the new war on terrorism. I think you get home. <br /> <br /> Makes you think: "Could my colleague be involved in something evil?" In fact, one of the poster for "Saboteur" proclaimed "Attention to the man behind you!" Imagine how this played in the minds of adults during World War II.
