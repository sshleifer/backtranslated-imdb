Having seen the original when I was 13 (and, yes, I was stupid enough to watch it while babysitting!), I was excited to see this remake. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell did a great job as Jill Johnson. And the fact that a horror movie for teenagers could be made in 2006 without terrible vulgarity and gore, made a film even stronger. I had so much fun trying not to bite my nails! <br /> <br /> This film will win no one at an Oscar, but it's fun and worth the price of the matinee ticket I bought to see it. I think girls all over the world should look at the original and the remake ... and therefore decide never to babysit. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that I'm glad I'm too old to babysit! There's just something about being in a creepy dark house with sleeping children that makes this movie classic. No blood, no blood ... just good psychological fun! WINNER!
