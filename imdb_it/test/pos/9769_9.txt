Apparently this Australian film based on the novel by Nevil Shute exists in more than one form. Pay attention to the cut versions very often displayed on cable or satellite, running from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full 5-hour miniseries version tells the story correctly. It is a very close realization of the story, which suffers only from editorial flaws commonly found in TV movies: choppiness and episodic progression. But this excellent cast carries on the story very well with generally good production values ​​that accompany their work. Yuki Shimoda is known as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards responsible for accompanying women on their agonizing journey. Eventually he becomes a friend. You will torment yourself when his face loss leads to death. Helen Morse as "Jean Paget", pretty but not very beautiful (she looks a bit like Sigourney Weaver) records the right amount of sperm and beauty as the occasion requires. The miniseries correctly highlights the beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean", and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" in a captivating way, but as a slightly younger man than Nevil Shute indicated in the novel. The third love story I mentioned does not get enough of the emphasis that is due, and the full meaning of the title has diminished. "Jean" is dedicated to bringing companies to Willstown that will attract young women and girls and their civilizing influence in this God-forgotten city. It wants to make it "A city like Alice"; Alice Springs, that is. We receive only a few suggestions in different scenes. If you have five hours in advance, this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute based his novel on the cruelty of the Japanese army in sorting a large group of women and children from one place to another on the Maylay peninsula in a real fact. It happened on Sumatra, according to Shute, however, rather than on the peninsula. The crucifixion of "Joe" by a Japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed women is probably fiction, but the Japanese's cruelty in dealing with prisoners is certainly a record issue.
