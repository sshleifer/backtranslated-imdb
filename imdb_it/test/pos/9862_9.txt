After reading some of the previous bad comments, I had to enter my two cents. This show was NOT, in spite of what he believes in Essex, the worst thing that was ever broadcast on TV. I think most of today's TV is much worse (when this stupid "reality" will ever end?) And there's not a show going on where I can watch. Give me the things I grew up with. I am a child of 1965 and I am not ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> This show has been my all-time favorite for almost 30 years. I was in high school when it was originally aired and I think it helped me resist those miserable days. At the time I was very maladjusted and I really liked "Fantasy Island". Since I was a budding writer in those days, he provided me with incredible opportunities to practice crafts. What a wonderful premise! I won't say that it doesn't have its flaws. Sometimes the scripts were pretty ugly, and some of the problems seemed trivial; but it could also be beautiful, and it was great to see it and it still is. As for the cheesiness factor, well, I think it is unfair to label every single product of the 70s as cheese. There was a lot of great things back then and this was in the ranks. (By the way, most of the seasons aired in the 80's !!) My favorite episodes came mainly from seasons 2, 3 and 4. <br /> <br /> To those who denigrate Herv√© Villechaize for his forte French accent and his short stature: GROW AND LEARN SOMETHING! It's so easy to make fun of yourself when you're "normal" and "perfect". That man did the best of what was inflicted on him in life, and if you don't like it, it's just hard. Have some compassion. He has been dead for 15 years and how easy it is to take down someone who cannot defend himself. There is no more shame. <br /> <br /> I love this show. So it looks dated. I hate to tell you this, but we didn't have splashy special effects and Blu-Ray discs. We were lucky to have VCRs. Convivici. Accept it for what it is, and this is simply fun. "Escapist TV" describes it perfectly, and that's what it was for me - an escape from my rotten life. And it's still a lot of fun to watch.
