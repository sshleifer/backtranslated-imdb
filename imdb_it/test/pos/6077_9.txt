There have already been several comments on the site focusing on the film's "prestige" feeling - and there is a lot of heavy talent on show: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to beautifully rendered design and scoring, to masterful direction. No wonder that Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for "Evita" at that year's Oscars began "Well, thank God that" The English patient "had no songs in it." The writing of the Oscar winners leads me to Juliette Binoche, who, in a stellar cast, gives a beautiful performance. It is heartening to see that the dynamics that seem to influence the award for best actor (often to exhibit pyrotechnics) are not at work in the women's categories. Just like Emma Thompson's Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in "Howard's End" showed that one of the most difficult things an actor can do is make the portrayal of "goodness" engaging, so Binoche's victory proved that could be that - and seriously sexy. His performance in this fantastic film is a thing of beauty.
