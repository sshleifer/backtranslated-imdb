This movie is fantastic. He's funny, sexy, violent and sick, but he holds everything together for a brilliant interpretation of Romeo and Juliet's Troma. If you don't mind being a bit disgusted (ok a lot, but it's a little weird), watch this movie. It's worth it! There is no level where it is not published. I've seen it three times now, and it's still great. I advise. Leave! Take it!
