I read a fiercely hidden commentary on a previous comment stating that this film showed a group of gay guys who were going wild in their being gay. <br /> <br /> This could not be more misleading. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. He has only three gay characters and one of them is a victim of the prejudice of people like the one who wrote the comments, despite his confession of fairness. <br /> <br /> Pip's grandfather was not gay. The tender scene of the soldier and his sergeant is a male bond at the crucial moment of death. But some people are upset by a kiss and a welcome scene of guts that flies from a man killed by a bomb. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is the direct relationship between Pip and that sweet girl and they face their social obligation and parenting. <br /> <br /> Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info
