You have GOT to see this movie ... I saw it, at 13, at the theater, at my very first date ... Fast forward for 20 years and now I'm gay (Thanks a lot One Dark Night !! LOL!). This film scared me as a kid (the mausoleums still do it!), But as an adult, the thrill of this movie is not in the plot, but rather the hysterical laughter that holds ... The Highlights are listening to the movie the names of the teenagers they call each other, from "nerdlebrain" (my favorite) to "turkey". Also, keep your eyes open for the scene where Carol (the blonde, the older sister) tries to hang the phone on a can (I can't believe I didn't raise it!) ... Other highlights include excessively Adam West explosions dramatic and sticky corpses. If you're a fan of real horror, I'd suggest this movie just because, to me, it's almost a parody of horror. There is def. a disturbing factor and the plot is good, but don't look at it if you want to be scared of your wits (unless you're 10 or something).
