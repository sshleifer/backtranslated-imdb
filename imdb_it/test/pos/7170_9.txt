I thought I had written a comment on this film before, but I can't find it here. anyway, I'm writing it again. I accidentally found this film in my college library collections. He was free to look, so why not? <br /> <br /> I am certainly happy to have seen it. I love this movie. I've seen some Russian films in the past, many of them have serious arguments. I'm surprised this was a good comedy. I had a great laugh as I watched him. and this is a movie I want to buy. this thing is so funny and it's not just funny nonsense, those plots were very original and well thought out, so they don't seem like nonsense at all. I'm surprised this movie didn't attract many viewers. This is a classic that you can watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> Even those actors were very authentic, their acting is real, not false. if you haven't looked at it, go and get a copy soon! definitely recommended
