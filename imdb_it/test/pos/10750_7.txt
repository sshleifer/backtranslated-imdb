Today this film would be considered controversial, but it's still a lot of fun. Racial stereotypes are made from the point of view of humor and not hatred. This film strips and shows how corrupt politicians were already in the early 1930s. This film shows that it started before the 70s and beyond, when it accelerated in the United States. Lloyd is still in his typical genre here, although his character grew up in China. <br /> <br /> The meaning of a cat's paw in this case is a person who is looking for a political office, but is used by the established political machine to advance its agenda. In other words, they think this guy (Lloyd) is harmless when he runs into the office. Then, when elected, he surprises them. <br /> <br /> This same theme is used later in the James Stewarts movie that Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Stewart is more famous and has a stronger message. This film is smarter and thinner than are the brands of Harold Lloyds. <br /> <br /> There is still the heart of the romantic comedy hidden with the film's facade, but today's mainstream audiences would still appreciate political humor and the ending is absolutely priceless. I wish someone could beat the political system of today in this way. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film and found myself wishing that Harold had enjoyed more during the 1930s. <br /> <br /> At least we have this. I think the person who is most cited in the film is the imaginary Ling Po. I always thought Confusicus was the essay, but this makes me believe that the wisdom of China was not limited to him and is a vast field of comedy Lloyd extracted in this movie.
