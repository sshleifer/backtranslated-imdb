For me this wonderful film rollercoaster brings repeated pleasant visions. It's about the intricate lives of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the obsessive producer of the workaholic. Albert Brookes plays the unattractive but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is the affable but stupid new son on the block, still in the news. <br /> <br /> The classic love triangle emerges with the extraordinary witty and self-deprecating Brookes in love with Hunter, but she is obviously attracted to Hurt. <br /> <br /> This film works on many levels. At least it's a brilliant comedy with the one-liners flying so often and fast that every vision brings a new crop of what you may have missed last time. It is also a film about attraction and unsatisfied romanticism. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the most important thing is that the film examines the modern obsession of the physical aspect and its latest triumph over the intellect as an estimated human attribute. This is personified by the meteoric career success of the character Hurt in contrast to Brookes's relative decline. <br /> <br /> Despite being fifteen years old, the film has some current messages on the values ​​of modern news and the continuing decline of journalistic standards. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected
