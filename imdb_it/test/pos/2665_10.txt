A review I postponed for too long .... <br /> <br /> Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science fiction films made to date, if not the best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a director and this is one of his best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively undervalued, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I will have to agree. In 1968, nobody had ever done anything like this before, and since then nobody has done it anymore. It was a wonder of a turn of special effects then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it's no wonder why. The film still looks wonderful after almost forty years! Take note of CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lights, Kubrick has created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost by itself created the icy emptiness of the spatial atmosphere that is also attributed to music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another movie where you can't do anything here in space, like it's in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, but it is used intelligently as a means of establishing mood, and it works perfectly. <br /> <br /> In addition to the magnificent display of brilliant special effects, there are other factors that play a role in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classic, compliments what the eyes are seeing and makes you feel the meaning of man's journey through his evolution from the monkey to the traveling space. <br /> <br /> The story, although apparently simple, is profound. In sequence, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain integral events of the film. What are they? Where they come from? What are they doing? These are all questions that arise when one looks at the history that develops and asks oneself to find one's own way. While most come up with a general idea of ​​what happened in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way in which one decides to answer these questions translates into deep solutions. It is not left entirely to interpretation, but in some respects it is. Try it for further clarification. The end result is rather chilling, regardless of personal solution. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a long film, and sometimes it slows down, it must be able to accurately represent the journey of man. It is not a subject that would have performed well in a shorter film, characterized by faster rhythms. Those with short periods of attention should not be applied. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, it is the epitome of a ruthless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine had such a cold presence on the screen. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there's surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best films made to date and one of the best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone has to see this movie at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
