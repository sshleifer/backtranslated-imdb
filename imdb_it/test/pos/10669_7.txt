This film is a jewel ... a Gerry Anderson classic still unknown. <br /> <br /> The origins of "UFO" and "Space 1999" are evident from this film, including the cast list that includes the late Ed Bishop and George Sewell, both of which went on "UFO". It is a pity that Anderson, despite his numerous television successes, has not had the chance to develop his talent on the big screen. Think about what you could have done with the film version of "Thunderbirds" (which you rightly disregarded!). I'm sure that if you give a "JTTFSOTS" / "Doppleganger" a fair chance you will appreciate its good qualities.
