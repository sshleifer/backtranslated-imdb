Maybe not the best work of Miyazaki, but I couldn't help loving him until he died. A five-year-old finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle. He saves his life and keeps it in a bucket like a pet, but in reality it is a magical being, the daughter of a human magician and a goddess of the sea. Ponyo, as the boy calls her, is brought back to the sea by his father, who tries to discourage her from returning to earth and becoming human, but enters her magic elixirs and does what she wants to do. The story is simple and pretty. But where the film really comes to life, it is in its enormous work of art. The drawings are more childish than in any other work by Miyazaki, but there is beauty in its simplicity. As with all his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination of which I was so intimidated. Seeing him in the theater he brought back memories of how he was when the initial notes of Jo Hisaishi's soundtrack for Princess Mononoke washed me and gave me goose bumps just before ten years ago (the score here is just as wonderful ). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.
