I watched this movie on Saturday afternoon via cable. Friend, he dragged. I got metaphors, symbolism and all that stuff. No, I didn't care in one way or another about the sexuality of the characters. But the rhythm of the story and the script almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> That is ... until Ruth Marshall is naked. If you are a man-breast that is not homo-phobic, you may want to rent it. Ruth has a hot lesbian sex scene, and then a straight sex scene that is a notch higher than most standard movies. His jiggly D-cups made the film worthy of note. <br /> <br /> - The Mighty Avatar
