It was 1983 and I was 13 years old. I saw Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents worked. After it was over, I wanted to talk to someone about it right away. I discovered that even my best friend looked at it and it became our favorite movie. We watched it every weekend until we could recite it. We woke up his parents late at night laughing hysterically. We started to worship the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying this is a great classic. Even if it's for me personally. And I understand that the whole Valley Girl conversation becomes annoying, but it was the 80s. But deep in the heart of the film - it's a love story, and a family one but good. The girl meets the boy and there are sparks on both sides, an instant connection. He doesn't like Julie's friends: he doesn't like it, he doesn't go to school, he has no money. They like it very much with his former boyfriend, the football player, even if he is an idiot. She makes the ultimate sacrifice, her own happiness for the happiness of her friends. And he has these really fantastic and supportive hippy parents. It is one of Nicholas Cage's first films and his first leading role. One minute is absolutely exhilarating and the next incredibly moving and romantic. His friend Fred is also pretty funny. If you were a teenager in the 80s you will love this movie or at least it will bring back memories. It's not my favorite movie anymore, but it's still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. I look forward to its release on DVD if they release it. You can visit Deborah Foreman's website to sign a petition to have it published on DVD and there are 2 movie soundtracks that are indispensable if you like 80s music.
