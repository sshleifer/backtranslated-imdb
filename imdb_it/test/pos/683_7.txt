I saw it for the first time as a child (THE LITTLE RASCALS went on TV for the first time the year I was born) and I recently bought it on DVD. In between, I looked at it on the occasions when it was and I took careful notes to 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as a Nubian slave, doing voodoo, for example. I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they tried to do it now. <br /> <br /> Notice how the cake fights in The Three Stooges 'HALFWITS' HOLIDAY and IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE look like this ... and this movie came out a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. There was obviously a bit of inspiration from SS and Laurel & Hardy in THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these films ... remember, at that moment, everyone stole the best, each other !!! <br /> <br /> Another note: the fans of Laurel & Hardy, who made the vendor, were none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in TBOTC - the "flapper" that came into her car and put it on in the back. Always escapes me because it has never been accredited?
