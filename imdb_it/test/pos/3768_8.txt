Better than it has the right to be, this film died a quick and painful death at the American box office. Sometimes sophomoric, sometimes satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde are mostly just an almost perfect reflection of the times, laden with drugs and sexual humor, reminiscent of one time or another of everything, from Woody Allen by "Everything You Always Wanted to Know Sex" to Mel Brooks of "The Producers", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong. Watch it, listen carefully because some lines pass very quickly and remember a time when the comedy could be offensively funny.
