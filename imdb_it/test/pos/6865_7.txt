I saw (unfortunately) the dubbed version on Encore. <br /> <br /> The student Paula Henning (Franka Potente who was also in the cult "Run Lola Run") is a serious medical student who enters a prestigious school in Germany. But he soon discovers that some students disappear and that the bodies they work on in the anatomy lab are incredibly fresh ... <br /> <br /> I was stuck seeing the dubbed version on Encore. It hurt a lot (the words that didn't correspond to the lips were annoying, very fast), but I still liked what I saw. The acting was good, it was beautifully photographed, it wasn't too creepy and I never got bored. Even more refreshing was a nice heroine who fights when the bad guys chase her. The nudity (mild) was, in a refreshing touch, male! An earlier poster mentions Benno Furmann (who is excellent) showed his butt but I don't remember seeing him. Regardless, this is a well done, scary and excellent thriller. From everything I've read the original German version is the best (I don't doubt it for a second), but the dubbed version is watchable. I give this a 7.
