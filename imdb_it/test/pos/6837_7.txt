Although this film resembles a Crime Thriller Noir, the plot is actually a bit simplistic and with very few surprises or surprises - and those that appear are not exactly shocking. <br /> <br /> However, if you slide out of the 'intense action thriller' and 'mindless entertainment' mode, then this is really a fun movie, with lots of fun moments. Most of these can be attributed to the witty dialogue between the characters of Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson - but having said that, Sadie said it all in her hilarious opening greeting to Friedman, and didn't leave much else for the development of anything else these two characters. I did not find this respected version of British accents of the southern accents so bad (Ok, Thompson sounded like he was rolling marbles in his mouth as he tried to talk south, but Rickman was surprisingly pretty good with very few minor shots in his usual English accent) - if you want to criticize the accents - let's talk about Coco's - you only spoke southern Italians periodically! <br /> <br />
