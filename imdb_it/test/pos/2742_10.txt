This Oscar-winning short has generated two sequels and a television cartoon show, has a tiny animation but an adelightful script (by Theodore Geisel aka Dr. Seuss) and a more memorable and enchanting main character. The UPA has pioneered an animation style that has even influenced Disney during the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated short films made between the late 1940s and the 1950s. This is the most beautiful. God to have it printed. Highly recommended.
