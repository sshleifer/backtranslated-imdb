A formula for murder is not a well-known mystery, but it is not said that it is not very good! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics like The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late in the Yellow cycle, but more than can be said of many of the films shot around the "golden" period in the early 1970s. Despite the lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly thanks to the competent way of mixing Silver-style death scenes with some really amazing twists and a series of well-defined characters. The film, perhaps, is not as exciting as many other films of the genre; but this is more than compensated for by the secure way in which the central situation is fed to the public and the resulting tension. The plot begins by showing a fake priest rape a girl named Joanna before pushing her down a staircase. We are therefore advancing for several years and the girl is now a woman, who unfortunately is in a wheelchair. She is trained for a sporting event by Craig; a man who also has romantic designs for her. However, her proposal is not welcomed by Joanna's personal assistant, who also has romantic drawings about her. <br /> <br /> The film presents a plot halfway that constitutes the backbone of the film, and while it is not exactly logical; it's nice to watch and suggests that you're interested in an interesting movie. The director Alberto de Martino clearly is not afraid to show some outrageous gore scenes, and the best of which in this film sees a priest being beaten to death by a spade - and personally I would not hesitate to name that sequence as one of my killer scenes favorite of Yellow! The plot can be a bit bumpy at times, but generally the action is very good. The director spends what seems like an eternity at the end of the film; but it is absolutely full of tension, and the way it works is good as it exploits all the points of the plot that preceded it. The soundtrack, taken from Fulci's The New York Ripper, also works well in this film and, breaking a Yellow tradition, Martino's film also features some rather interesting interpretations of cult veteran David Warbeck and Christina Nagy, in his one cinematographic role. Overall, this film is not one of the easiest to find yellows; but it's worth tracking it down and is recommended to fans of this type of film.
