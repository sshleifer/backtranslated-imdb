At first I found it really shocking to see William Shakespeare's masterpiece of love reworked into a sensual, violent and vicious film adaptation. But after looking at it once, it's like growing on you when you look at it the second and third time, while you lose the shock and start enjoying the film for its merits - solid acting, good dialogue, good sequencing and choreography , not too bad soundtrack and some of the (special) effects that occur. Oh, and the ending too. What a fight!
