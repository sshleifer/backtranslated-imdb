I've seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and every time I watch it the movie is just as fun as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of anti-war "hippies" from the 1960s and 1970s who live in large areas in New York City. This small group succeeds a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage) who was drafted into the US army for service in Vietnam. Despite the best efforts to dissuade him, Claude eventually reports for basic military training. Still anxious to have left them, the hippie group steals a car and travels across the United States to visit Claude "... for a couple of hours", in the words of George Berger (to a deputy stationed at the entrance gate del Army base Claude is temporarily stationed in Nevada). The result is really moving, so I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen this fantastic film yet. The score is equally fantastic! Don Dacus (of the rock group Chicago), who plays the role of "Woof" - one of the hippies, is not a key character, but the film would not have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, a uptown girl who became friends with the hippie group) is sensational in her role! A film MUST SEE !!
