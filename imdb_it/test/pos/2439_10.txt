this is one of my favorite movies of all time! together with Casablanca and the cannibal holocaust, this is an almost perfect cinema. rex allen tells this fabulous story of a puma who just needs some love. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy and river chaos! SEE THIS FILM IF YOU HAVE TO KILL TO DO IT !!! you won't find a better cat photo anywhere, with a "space cat" coming in a second not very close. charlie's performance is magnificent. even includes animal cruelty and intense deforestation! I must love disney, for all moral failures!
