I think that COMPLETE SAVINGS are a great television program and should do many other episodes. It is one of my favorites !!!! It's a lot of fun and it's really good acting. I say you should give them the chance to do more episodes. I know they can and should !!!! They should put the COMPLETE SALVATORS on NICKELODEON more than they do! I'm sure many people will agree with me !!!!! I like the TV show because it's a great program for people of our age and it's a lot of fun. I also like COMPLETE SALVATORS because it's not always the same thing and the things that happen could be real, unlike other YV programs. When they advertised it, I didn't like the sound, but I watched it for the first time and loved it. COMPLETE SAVINGS are an excellent comedy and I miss being on TV !!!!!!!!!! I really can't compare COMPLETE SAVINGS with other TV series because it's different !!!!
