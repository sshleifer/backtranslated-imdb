Many years ago I saw this movie (maybe on TV?) And I loved it. So I decided to rent it on DVD the other day to see if it was still taken into consideration. He did it. <br /> <br /> Located in the infamous King's Cross area of ​​Sydney (where prostitution, drug abuse and sex shops thrive), tells the story of "Jimmy" (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... perhaps in late adolescence or around, who has not had a stable family. It is on the margins of society and works as a "tout" for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). He is aware of a character from the underworld called "Pando", who is a local bigwig of the Cross. It is Jimmy's hope to be on Pando's radar and to "in" with him ... a brief upward social mobility, he hopes. <br /> <br /> One night Jimmy meets the beautiful young woman Alex (played by the charming Rose Byrne). You just know that there will be a love story between them. Also that night, Jimmy is contacted for the first time by Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pando has a "job" for Jimmy. It is the "foot in the door" that Jimmy was waiting for! <br /> <br /> To reveal much more it would ruin the many surprises that this film has in store for the viewer. Stylistically, if you like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movies, you should be in tune with what to expect ... twists and black comedy. <br /> <br /> What is so beautiful about this film is the Australian -ness'. It is not a simple defeat for Tarantino or Ritchie, but an authentic Australian contribution to the genre. <br /> <br /> A fascinating aspect of this film is how everything hangs together. Sometimes you are introduced to the characters you wonder what the hell they are doing there. In the end, all these "free ends" come together beautifully. It's a bit like a celluloid strip of Moebius. <br /> <br /> A highlight of the film is the character of Pando by Bryan Brown. Pando likes puzzles, and it's fun to watch him play with his friends. It's the little details revealed about him that are so funny ... his musical tastes, for beginners! <br /> <br /> Of the Heath Ledger films I saw (The Dark Knight, 10 things I hate about you), this is perhaps his best role. It was not taken with "10 things". If you're a fan of Heath Ledger (Ledger recently died a tragic accidental death), this is the chance to see him in his biggest Australian role, I think. There is a great harmony between Ledger and Byrne in this film - so, at one level, it works like a beautiful love story. <br /> <br /> This film does not have the horror of the Evil and Ritchie movies, but has some adult themes ... scenes that surprise you with their coolness and beauty. In this sense, it is not an ideal film for very young viewers, but it is not a film that even gore-followers will get excited about. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must say that it's great that Australia can make great films like this. Usually the type of film that my home country produces may not be interesting. This film has strengths where many Australian films have weaknesses ... that is. has a great story, great acting and a fantastic script. We need more popular and quality films like this that will be made here in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. Other Australian films I loved include: <br /> <br /> Morant Breaker (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My Brilliant Career (not reviewed here by me yet) Proof (nr) The Devil's Playground ( nr) The year My Voice Broke (nr) Bad Boy Bubby (nr. A great dark comedy) The Dish (nr. A great fascinating comedy)
