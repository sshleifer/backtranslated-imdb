I love love I love this show. Whether you say it's because I'm crazy in the brain or not. I think this show is very funny and fun even if sometimes Bam Vito's uncle scares me .. so, all in all, I give this show a perfect review. And so I really think that if you like the kind of humor "omg .. what an idiot", this show is for you. It's really fun to see the gaze on people's faces of the joke and there are many musical guests who come to Bam's house. Buy this cause it lashes out! You should buy it. Yup. And Bam's brother is in the CKY band and they are really good and sometimes they come on the show. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is .. please watch the show.
