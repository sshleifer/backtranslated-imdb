What are the movies? I mean ... what are the films made for? Shootings? Killings? NO. They are made for life stories and this is what this film does. Presents how life has changed between two eras. The father and a son, the father who needs a job and asks his son for help. <br /> <br /> Even if there is another generation, there are some features that continue to include caress for the family. <br /> <br /> The main subject is, in my opinion, the love of the child for the father and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of ONLY a dialog box, but that dialogue is more than I could ever have wanted. This film is pure art! Once again, after "Marfa si Banii", Cristi Puiu gives us another beautiful film. Very well !
