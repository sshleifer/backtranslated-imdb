The omission of Jazzy Jeff, the creator of the chirp and the scratch transformer, raised a few eyebrows, but it's nice to see that he got to the DVD extras, after all. With SCRATCH, Doug Pray, who previously told the 90s grunge phenomenon in HYPE (1996), made an excellent documentary on the world of hip-hop DJs and the evolution of turntablism. His latest documentary, INFAMY (2005), explores the contemporary culture of American graffiti. After a couple of views four years ago, my DVD had collected dust since then, but I recently looked at it again and in addition to the material in question, I was surprised that the documentary was well shot and edited. An immensely pleasant soundtrack and not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school movies, parties, break dancing, you call it. One of the best things about the film is that it mainly examines where the art of turntablism is today (ie 2001), without obviously neglecting the pioneers. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Darkroom --- 8/10
