While Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly observes her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) murdered by vengeful killers Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), his bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of his favorite music soap opera. In a state of complete denial and disappointment, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her dissatisfied town life to search for "Dr. David Ravell" (Greg Kinnear), the beautiful and loving hero of "A Reason to Love", a soap work set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles. Immune to reality, Betty arrives at L.A. and becomes "Nurse Betty" while trying to belong to the hospital world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, the irritated Charlie and Wesley follow Betty, convinced they are a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising relationships with Del. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting the extreme innocence and optimism of the protagonist with the obvious hypocrisy and violence that surround her. By clearly defining the difficult life of the protagonist, Nurse Betty justifies her character's tendency to distance herself from reality. Thus, while offering a commentary on the popularity of the soap opera in the film, Nurse Betty also makes a comment on the widespread dependence on television and its celebrities. Furthermore, Nurse Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of her protagonist's mental state, particularly in those scenes in which she is unable to distinguish between "Dr. David Ravell", the character, and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who plays it. Betty's inability to recognize George as an actor leads to amusing misunderstandings, which underline the magnitude of his delirious state. However, despite these successes, Nurse Betty suffers from the disturbing characterizations through which the narrative evolves. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are constantly portrayed as a comic couple, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance that the viewer might have initially experienced. Likewise, although the initial scenes define Del as a detestable man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his killers outweigh all the humiliation and violence that caused his wife Betty. <br /> <br /> Finally, towards the end of the film, Charlie undergoes embarrassing transformations while developing an obsession with Betty; an obsession that translates into noble feelings of love and that ultimately destroy it. Consequently, since the roles of the characters as victims lack coherence, the victimization processes of history seem random and not substantial. All in all, the indeterminacy of Nurse Betty - rather than creating suspense - weakens her characters and pollutes her plot. <br /> <br />
