In the 80s, in the wrestling world, the world was simple. Hulk Hogan will face Roddy Piper, or friends of Bobby Heenan or Ted DiBiase and will be released victorious most of the time. Occasionally he would have an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but mostly he was about Hulk Hogan and Bobby Heenan, and so he should be. <br /> <br /> But this night was about to change, a new champion, a man that the WWE thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. It did not work. But the WWE was right about one thing: Hulkamania was over and a new order had to be established. <br /> <br /> This historic Wrestlemania, the first to be set outside of America, began with Rick Martel defeating Koko B Ware. Koko never had much luck with Wrestlemania and was shot down here. <br /> <br /> Next the Colossal Connection Andre the Giant and Haku have lined up their tag team against Demolition Ax and Smash and lost. New champions of tag team crowned. <br /> <br /> The next game saw the defeat against the Hercules earthquake. Hercules was another guy who didn't have much luck in Wrestlemania. A lot of luck for Brutus Beefcake when he finished Mr Perfect's unbeaten streak. Well, I guess someone should finish. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown fought for a double count in a slow but fun game, the next Hart Foundation defeated Nikolai Volkov and Boris Zhukov in the 19 seconds. Unfortunately it is not a game. The barbarian then defeated Tito Santana in a short game. <br /> <br /> The American Dream Dusty Rhodes and Saphire then defeated the Macho King Randy Savage and Queen Sherri in a mixed match of mixed tags. This was the only female wrestling going on in the WWE at this time. <br /> <br /> The next one was a fun encounter as the Rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheals defeated the Orient Express in a quick bout. There have been a lot of good tag teams right now. Jim Duggan then beat Dino Bravo in a worthless match. <br /> <br /> The next Ted DiBiase has put its most precious possession, the Million Dollar Championship in line with Jake Roberts. Roberts was distracted by Virgil and counted on allowing Ted to keep his title in a fun game and one of the longest games on the show. <br /> <br /> The twin towers collide as the Bossman defeats Akeem in short order, this is followed by Rick Rude who wins a short game with Jimmy Snuka. <br /> <br /> Finally we arrive at the main event with Hulk Hogan putting the WWE title in the front row against the intercontinental champion The Ultimate Warrior. It is a fun round-trip game won by the Warrior after Hogan lost a stage. The crowd was extraordinary and the game was a great show. <br /> <br /> And so the torch was approved, but would the Ultimate Warrior prove the Champion that the WWE hoped it would be?
