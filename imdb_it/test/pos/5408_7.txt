It occurred to me as I watched "Imaginary Heroes" that any screenwriter trying to do a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing a child or two in the initial wheel as a way to open up his characters and reveal yourself. There must be something in this plot, because it seems as if every other family drama descending from the pike uses this device in one form or another ("Paradise" and "Moonlight Mile" are just two of the most recent examples that pop up immediately at which look after, even if you could go back to a golden oldie like "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?" to make the point as well). It is not that the death of a child is an illegitimate argument for serious films to be explored. Away from it. It's just that, like any topic, it can be so abused that it becomes just another movie cliché, a comfortable piece of narrative shorthand to roll the ball and give the characters something to deal with for the rest of the time we arrive spend with their. <br /> <br /> The last work of the genre is "Imaginary Heroes", a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the first and, perhaps, the most well-known examples of the "family facing death" of a genre as a child, the Academy Award "Ordinary People." Like the characters in that previous film, the Travises seem, on the surface, to be the ideal suburban family, until, on a fateful day, their eldest son, Matt, which is the athlete of the "golden boy" and, therefore, the apple of the eye of his father, he kills himself without any explanation (a small difference is that the son in "Ordinary People" dies due to an accident not a suicide. "It is the younger brother of Matt, Tim, who ends up finding the body and assuming the leading role in the film. Each of the remaining family members faces the tragedy in his own way. Matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, he becomes increasingly estranged from his father who has practically ignored him for life and begins to devote himself to drugs for reasons of illness. Ben, the father, is swallowed by feelings of remorse and guilt, moving away from his job and his family. His wife, Sandy, is the most complex character in the film, a child with a free spirit from the 1960s who feels strangely adrift in the role of mother and wife while enduring a basically loveless marriage in a sterile suburb. He spends most of his time after the tragedy that tries to reconnect with his past as a smoker. <br /> <br /> As written and directed by Dan Harris, "Imaginary Heroes" emerges as a wildly irregular film. For every scene that seems real and authentic, there is another that appears as arbitrary and inauthentic. Sometimes one has the feeling that Harris would like to cram every possible life situation he can think of into his script, an admirable goal, perhaps, but that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process. Instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their situation, we often find ourselves thinking, "Oh, come on now? For teenage suicide it's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot topics covered in this movie the script also touches on drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, conflicts of sexual identity, life-threatening illnesses, even involuntary gay incest, it is this "everything but the kitchen sink" mentality in writing that robs the film of much of the credibility it needs to make us really interested. <br /> <br /> It's not that "Imaginary Heroes" is a bad or unrewarding movie. Much of what it has to say on family relations and values ​​in the 21st century is insightful, original, acute and profound.The main merit of his success goes to the actors, Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who offer incisive and sensitive performances in their respective roles i They are the ones who triumph over the narrative excesses to stimulate our brain and touch our hearts. Furthermore, Harris, in his direction, reaches an effectively melancholic tone everywhere, but one that is often augmented by some useless flashes of daring dark comedy. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary Heroes" may seem blurry and derivative in time, but its excellent performance and subtle changes in mood make it a movie worth watching.
