Aaron Sorking raises the same questions that Shakespeare has asked or does. How could they know so much about the inner workings of palace life. Here as in The West Wing, Sorkin opens surprising doors that are certainly not a shock but seem to confirm our worst fears. Everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for the lives of so many people. A nap Tom Hanks tells us in one way or another that things can be manipulated with pure seed intentions but without weighing the consequences and Julia Roberts in a blonde hairstyle from the south reminds us of the powers hidden behind. The subject is serious but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like the invisible middle man, steals every scene he is in, just like Charles Laughton did in every movie he was in. The dialogue is fast but not fast enough not to let us recover and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy. The seemingly random rhythm, full of strokes of wit and provocation, confers another badge of honor in Mike Nichol's collection.
