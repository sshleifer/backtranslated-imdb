When it comes to those disturbing and disturbing little crime films, the genre that revolves around characters that border on scum and live in equally fragrant environments, and in addition they bring that trembling and desolating feeling thanks to a rather ugly cinematography and to some very comedy Black; Dead Bodies is the kind of movie that Paul McGuigan wants me to do. Alas, the exasperating and sporadic Gangster n. 1 as well as the same everywhere in the store, but the interesting exercise of surrealism mixed with realism, an effort called The Acid House are the only ones we have to go on until now. Dead Bodies is the piece by Robert Quinn based on a script by Derek Landy, a film that straddles psychological horror and neo-noir; intermittent elements of crime and terror with themes related to morality and obsessive and unnatural disorders. McGuigan's British criminal efforts bring that undulating and distorted atmosphere, like witnessing someone's nightmare and having front-row seats in the process. His films are capable of disgusting some areas and entertaining others with their extravagant and all-encompassing approach. Do they carry a very dreamy sensibility despite being rooted in a very realistic, trampled and dirty world? the real world with so much emphasis on horror and the terror of situations that its characters generate more than anything else. Dead Bodies is a film that addresses both situations of a rather harrowing nature, and a brief inclusion of a study on a delicate psychological mentality, only that here the film balances both the eccentricity of its characters; the terror of the scenarios in which they find themselves and the questions of morality that present themselves much better. <br /> <br /> Dead Bodies is effective and rather simplistic without ever feeling manipulative. His suggestive and conscious tendency to want to beat at home exactly what people think and feel does not detract from the experience. At the beginning we meet Tommy McGann (Scott), a young boy whose girlfriend Jean (Davis) dominates him, his life and the screen every time she is active for the short period in which she is. The point about the fact that his situation of living in a less desirable home; with a work that stacks shelves and a partner with whom he does not agree at all is put in a distinct way. How is the way in which the public is given permission to disapprove of Jean, with the braterly, spoiled and waiting attitudes he possesses so clearly. Later the film will, rather obviously, focus on the face of a police officer, while suspicions and tensions increase in what is clearly an economic and easy way to tell the public that our hero is not yet out of trouble. <br /> <br /> But compare it to Gangster No. 1, where this is the episodic and misleading approach that McGuigan applies to the material; that a vital and vital point occurs when a character is identified while leaving a building by someone else on a "random disk" in a scene set several months after the previous one. The feeling is not so rooted or rewarding. The production of Dead Bodies is dominated by Jean by Kay Davis; an aspiring femme fatale who only itches to choose a fight of some kind but is not really able to find one. He took Tommy to jump through the rings; going there, doing this and that without Tommy, he never reacted the way he could, mainly because he's controlled by his promises of sex. The beginning generates a certain tension due to Tommy's underestimated reaction to what is happening and culminates in a distinct version when the initial incident occurs, and Jean dies. <br /> <br /> If the set up is simple enough then this is one thing, but the pinch of the project is the way Tommy decides to free Jean from his hands by burying it without informing anyone of his death bar like a best friend. Things come together when it transpires that there is a second body in the exact same place where Tommy buried Jean, with suspicions, denials and general troubles about the ingredients in the round of the day. It is at this point that the film blurs the lines between noir and horror; in fact Tommy rather lives in a large, threatening, spooky and even gothic house that he shares with an elderly relative who lives in the upper areas of the house. This evokes memories of the 1960 Hitchcock movie set, Psycho and Bates, which he has with his mother and where she is positioned. It is no coincidence that this aspiring place of horror is the setting for Jean's unfortunate demise. <br /> <br /> The placement of a corpse in the hands of the unfortunate male protagonist to make it act as the initial incident is a classic set-up for any noir; from the 1945 Ulmer movie Detour to a more recent one, and more contemporary than Dead Bodies, a 2006 movie called Big Nothing. What this film develops is twisted; a rather unpredictable and rather frightening story of gender hybridism and mental games told under a palette of decidedly drained visuals. The off-screen voices and the trampling on the thin line that the protagonist makes for most of the film between good and evil help to push him into a realm of the neo-noir; if we consider the fact that lead is, in essence, innocent and his accusations of murder are not right, then it is one thing, but his attitude towards Jean saw him initially act without thoughts and his coverage of his death is the antithesis to bring down the murder charges Dead bodies are taught; fun to watch without ever feeling exploiters and provides a coherent tone for the rather unpleasant physical and psychological content to explore.
