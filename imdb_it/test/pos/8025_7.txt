I saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. It has its moments that I imagine you would say. Some scenes with special forces were fantastic, and some of the shots were very authentic. I will not put this movie in my DVD collection, but it is fair enough to recommend for rental. I imagine that nothing has set the film to another level than others of the same genre. The action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the plot is quite interesting. 7 out of ten
