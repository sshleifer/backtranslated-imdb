A delightful story of two displaced people has been turned into a good movie by the BBC. Most children who like a good story will appreciate this. The characters are played really well by a very good cast. I'm not sure our American friends will appreciate it, but they're mentioned, since Aunty Lou runs off with a magnificent American soldier.
