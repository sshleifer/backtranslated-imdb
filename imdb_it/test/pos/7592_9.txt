Although it is little more than a pleasant musical diversion of 11 minutes (it is rightly considered a "tabloid musical") EVERY SUNDAY is one of the most famous and precious documents in the history of cinema, given that it provides an inestimable glimpse to the great talents of most musicians talented and beloved of the screen: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> Although often cited as a sort of screen test, produced by MGM to test the adolescent attractiveness of fellow comrades Durbin and Garland, whose options were according to the renewal statements, this statement does not it's completely accurate. When EVERY Sunday was produced in July 1936, Deanna Durbin's contract with MGM had already expired and she was immediately signed by Universal a month earlier, in June 1936. <br /> <br /> However, a provision in Durbin Il contract with MGM allowed the firm to exercise an option on its services for a maximum of sixty days, provided that it had not yet started working on a photo in its new studio. While Durbin's debut vehicle, THREE INTELLIGENT GIRLS, was not yet ready to start shooting, MGM chose to exercise its option and, although officially under contract with Universal at the time, Durbin found himself on the MGM lot for to take up this brief pleasant argument with Judy Garland, the young teenager who hopes. <br /> <br /> This, along with Garland's previous experience / professional training (which included appearances in several previous short films), could explain why every Sunday he often seems to prefer Judy Garland over Deanna Durbin, giving Garland more lines to talk and an original song ("Americana") to sing, while Durbin offers the famous classical art song, "Il Bacio" by Luigi Ardiiti. Certainly, it would be perfectly logical that MGM would prefer to favor one of his contracted players over another from a rival studio. <br /> <br /> Ironically, although the character of Garland is the most openly pro-active of the two girls in this short, it would be the disturbing and impulsive character of Durbin's "Little Miss Fixit" at Universal that the would push to the instant world super star like the first "Teen Idol" in the world with her debut, THREE INTELLIGENT GIRLS, while that of Garland the more passive adolescent image of "melancholy wallflower" would generally see her playing secondary roles in front of the frequent partner of the screen Mickey Rooney and (in ZIEGFELD GIRL) the promising Lana Turner. Not before his fifteenth edition of the MGM, 1942 "FOR ME AND MY GAL" (which was also his first "adult" role) Garland would have reached the solo above - the billing of the title and the status of "solitary attraction" of a real superstar that Durbin had reached instantaneously six years earlier. <br /> <br /> It is therefore completely imprecise, therefore, to state that Garland was the only "superstar" attraction of the two girls, since Durbin reached this state with the press' n public, almost a decade before his rival MGM. Literally in foreclosure at the time of his signing, the on-screen evidence strongly suggests that Universal was much quicker to realize Deanna's potential superstar than MGM was with Judy, and it's worth noting that Garland achieved almost all remarkable results obtained from MGM, from superstar billing, having interpreted vehicles specially written to showcase its talents and charm, to be invited to plant its footprints in the square of Graumann's Chinese Theater, to receive an "honorary" Oscar in recognition of his talent, Deanna Durbin received long before her MGM contemporary talent. <br /> <br /> In any case, every Sunday is a delightful and absolutely unpretentious short film: the plot (Durbin and Garland use their singing talent to save Durbin's grandfather from the city council's forced retreat by conducting his concerts Sunday in the park), foreshadows the plots of both of the Garland musicals "Let's Put On a Show" with Mickey Rooney and Durbin's 100 MEN AN DA GIRL. Unlike Garland's later BABES films, the short film never seriously treats the inconsistent plot and, consequently, its eleven-minute execution time flies. <br /> <br /> Of course, the true magic of EVERY Sunday is in observing the already remarkable exhibition of talents / film appearances by Durbin and Garland at the start of their legendary careers. Both girls, even in this initial phase, possessed extraordinary cinematographic presences and are absolutely natural and insensitive in their presentation both as singers and as actresses. The garland explodes unobtrusively off the screen with vitality while literally beating the lyrics for the captivating "Americana". While wearing the number with appropriate hand gestures, Judy seems to literally chew the words of the song as she pisses her mouth and looks into her intense impatience to show what she can do. <br /> <In contrast, Durbin's presentation of "The Kiss" is much more demure and subdued. Although it is entirely appropriate for its "classical" selection, Durbin's delivery of the Arditi waltz is much more than the traditional "stand" and "sing" variety compared to Garland's physically emotional turn. However, even if "miniature diva" Deanna does nothing to draw attention to herself, with her candid eyes, her dazzling smile and artless delivery, she easily holds the screen with Judy, the "jazz girl" , and their delightful duet of "Americana" in the short. the ending makes him regret that producer Joe Pasternak never managed to fulfill his dream of combining Durbin and Garland in a musical film (because Universal refused to lend "Number One Asset" to Durbin). <br /> <br /> An invaluable document of the nascent talent of two extraordinary and absolutely unique talents. See this if you have the chance!
