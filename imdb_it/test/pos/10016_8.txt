I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. Of course it's a bit slow to move in parts, but what else could you expect from Rollin? Also there is a lot of nudity, nothing wrong with that, especially as it includes many of the beautiful, Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some women who died spectacularly eroticized, a little more dodged, perhaps, but more effective. There is also a science fiction storyline with a brief explanation at the end, but I wouldn't worry too much about it. No, here we have an interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to what extent one is still "alive" without memory. My DVD cover mentions David Cronenberg and although it may not be as good as his best films, there is a certain similarity here, especially with the great use of an apparently threatening architecture and the effective and terrifying use of space indoor. As I have tried to point out this is not at all a roaring thriller, it is a captivating and nightmare film that makes most of its locations, including a stunning railway setting at the end.
