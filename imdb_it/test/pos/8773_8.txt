I'm a huge Hitchcock fan since I saw "Rear Window" on television. "Saboteur" is not the best of Hitchcock for me, it is very good but not a masterpiece. It has its flaws, some parts are rather slow and, as a result of its cancellation quickly, the script is rather incomplete. But the direction of Hitchcock is superb and the performances are not so bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane both do a pretty good job, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very close to stealing the show. The story is good, speaks of a wrong on the run, very similar themes used in "39 Steps" and "North By Northwest", and cleverly provides a certain escape. The soundtrack was absolutely exceptional; the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I liked the excavations at Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto and Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Even the photography is sharp and smooth, the landscapes and landscapes are almost dazzling and there are also a series of very effective scenes. That is the climax of the Statue of Liberty, but also the meeting with the circus troupe and the Radio Music City Hall shooting are paid. Overall, not the best of Hitchcock, but definitely worth a look. 8/10 Bethany Cox
