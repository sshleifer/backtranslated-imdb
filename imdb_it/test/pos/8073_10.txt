For those who appreciate the intersection of silent cinema and social commentary, this is a unique film. Partly a tribute to German Expressionism, partly to allegory, the film is full of visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the 1920s. Furthermore, the attention to detail of the period and the visual composition of the scenes as a tool to advance the story is surprising. In addition to this, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of media in society and its effects on the social voice, perception and public opinion. In reality, it is not so much the silence that permeates the film as the loss of the voice and the loss of words to communicate and express the thought that inevitably follows. In conclusion, this film is something that is not often seen and, as the producer of the film said in the following Q & A, will leave you thinking about its meaning until the next day.
