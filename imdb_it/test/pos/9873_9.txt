This film is pretty good, but the unprecedented Producer's Cut is my favorite film in the series after the original. The story of Jamie is handled differently, the scenes of death are made 10 times better, there is more ritual type material that gives more history about Michael, Jamie and his child. There is also an alternative ending that is even better. Because they didn't release this version, instead, I don't have any damned clues. If you can find this version, see it.
