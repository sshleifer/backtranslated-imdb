No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic representation of the police system in India and based on a real "meeting" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. This is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolizes how many criminals the leader "Sadhu Agashe" killed "- well, you already know a little) Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role of a relaxed and calculating Indian policeman. His one-liners are simply exhilarating: The plot, although slightly predictable on the review, is intriguing all the same. Another of the films of Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory. The films that are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan is very close, but remains one of the The best 70 movies released from India, including commercial and artistic ones. <br /> <br /> What's great is that the narrative is relaxed and finally shows (in an Indian movie) how the police network works. seriously the one liners are fun to die for (although I don't know if the subtitled version will look so funny) The producers are rehearsing for a version of Cannes, which is interesting. Made by debutant Shamit Aman (I think it's his name). <br /> <br /> Again 55 years, Nana Patekar i Is brilliant away from his stupid roles of the past, shows only what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff If you are interested in Indian films and are disgusted by the absurdities that some of our guys are talking about, then this is definitely a relief. <br /> <br /> Still Patekar is the guy who happily carries the film on his shoulders and embodies the style of the film: relaxed, fun, intelligent and calculating. Good dialogues, good acting, good director all in all Great things. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma's Company (both Indian films)
