There are a lot of people who put down these 80s movies but those people might not have come of age during this period. I had just started college when this film was released, so I could really appreciate it at that time and my friends and I, to this day, occasionally joke about certain jokes in the movie. As much as I liked the character of Sean Penn, Jeff Spicoli in "Fast Times", I really like the character of Chris Penn "Tommy", because he is the main character with more than a real roll of words contrary to a series of Spicoli. Chris Penn should probably put this film in his VCR and use it for motivation reasons to lose weight. Yes, the subplot with Randy Quaid, the Vietnam veteran, seems a little out of place, but plays a convincing role in the role. If there is anyone out there who has not seen this movie, but liked the other similar films like "Fast Times", etc. I highly recommend it.
