I'm a great ex-heterosexual scarred male bouncer, former rugby player and former boxer, and I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It is not a "Mystic River". It's a piece of hair. But there is space in the life for the fluff, and when that fluff is filmed in an engaging way, well played by attractive and nice people, cleverly drawn and full of good dialogues, there is even more room for this. <br /> <br /> I am not Tom Selleck's biggest fan. But he is good at it. So are Julianne Nicholson (loves bald head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (That Th You You Do!). <br /> <br /> The scenery is beautiful, the mood is optimistic, there is anguish and melancholy and farce and even a little redemption. <br /> <br /> Any reviewer (male) who disagrees with this film is, let's say, not entirely sure of his masculinity. In the meantime I will continue to capture fragments of it without apology whenever it shows up on cable.
