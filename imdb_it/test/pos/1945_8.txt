River's Edge is an extremely disturbing film, written by acclaimed American screenwriter Neal Jimenez. It is based on a real event that happened at a time when most young Americans tried to make sense of their lives. This is one of the most important films made by the American director Tim Hunter. Much of the film's attention focuses on a rash murder committed by a reckless teenager. This unfortunate event sets in motion a whole series of questions about the real motivations of young people in American society. Those who saw this film during its initial release must have vivid memories of the great actor Dennis Hopper in a confused role as a socially sympathetic outcast. Matrix star Keanu Reeves also looks like a teenager before reaching star status. In an age where teen movies are made without any serious preparation, it is hoped that "River's Edge" cannot simply be ignored as another stupid teen shot. It had a huge impact on people living in the turbulent times of the past when being inhabitants of a sleepy city was similar to not being born. For today's generation with their heady overdoses of props on the Internet like Facebook, Twitter and Orkut, River's Edge may seem obsolete but its importance cannot be denied by any serious admirer of cinema.
