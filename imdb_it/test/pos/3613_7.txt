Once again John Madden gave us a magnificent film. A simple but beautiful story located in a true paradise and the music cannot be better, Stephen Warbeck delights us once again, and good deeds but ......... why in this film Penelope Cruz? I asked myself the same question while watching this movie. Obviously his Greek accent is not credible, he is incapable of acting decently even in a scene. Not even in the end did he do a good job, after so many events, after years he finally saw Corelli again and failed to change the same face of stupidity we had to endure throughout the film. However, Cage was very good at one of his best characters; Hurt is also fantastic in his and the rest of the cast has done a great job, so the end result is a film that is really worth watching. This is a beautiful film that not even Mrs. Cruz was able to ruin. So far I think it's Madden's best job, so no fans will be disappointed.
