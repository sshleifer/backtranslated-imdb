Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I will see any film, regardless of how bad it may seem. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites of that year, with his plot full of emotion and realistic and fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this second-year effort. The cast looked fantastic, the trailer used music effectively, but there seemed to be a good chance that it would turn into an absurdity, and quickly. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan affects all its brands permanently. The acting is amazing, the writing superb and the editing style, as well as the juxtaposed music, which fascinates all the way. Brewer seems to be a master at convincing his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they move towards redemption. <br /> <br /> The first moment I knew I had a surprise was during the shortened credit sequence at the beginning. As he did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer puts music on the big screen shots perfectly with the simply titled fonts that arrive statically. The aesthetics of the 70s was welcome and helped to show that this would be another great piece of characters in the vain of those of that decade of some of the best in cinema. From here we continued with the short fragments in the lives of Lazarus and Rae, each vignette reflecting the other as they travel at the fateful moment when their streets finally cross. The montage between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly interrupted before the scene was over with its purpose. Rae's boyfriend leaves for the service and Laz's wife leaves him for his brother. Everyone feels lonely and returns to what they know in that situation. Rae to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is left dead on the side of the road and his savior comes from his farm to take her inside, the reasoning for their actions finally begins to become clear. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson is as fantastic as the old bluesman farmer who tries to reconcile his life with God and that of the flesh and the pain that brought him. There are moments of stoic severity and those of good heart with his prisoner / patient. You never look at the setup as comic or unrealistic because it sells what it is doing so well. Moreover, the character of Rae is not chained for a long time, despite what the trailers would have you believe. The situation starts a little awkward until we see that the assemblage is for his own good and is actually used only for a day or two. As for that chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I've never seen it as something special, but this role is a real turning point for her. This girl is so worried that her past sexual abuse has marked her very deeply. Whenever she is away from her love, she begins to see the flashes of the man who took away her childlike innocence and itches to be touched by any man willing to let the image disappear. His nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather to survive from the haunting nightmares that always hide behind his eyelids. Ricci completely plays the role and shows all the emotional trauma with great effect and realism. Mention must also be made of Justin Timberlake, showing some real acting talent again. Where this boy comes from, I have no idea, but I hope he continues to take other films and move away from the mostly lousy music that turns out. <br /> <br /> Although not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan still seems the same to me, in my opinion, because when it is turned on, it is spectacular. Towards the end we have a really compelling sequence with "This Little Light of Mine" singing, and before, the interaction between prisoner and kidnapper, when the chain is first introduced, shows a high level work. The truly magical moment, however, is when Jackson sings (yes, he is in everything, as if he were Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titrated song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker. If I don't see a nicer sequence of the whole year, I won't be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. One thing that I think I enjoy very much with Brewer's work is the fact that he doesn't show sinners as redeemed heroes. Instead it shows us that no matter how bad you have been, or how bad your life has been, everyone can fight for redemption and to be better people. Here we have no saints, but fallible people who try to straighten out their ship. If the course remains true or if it falls into darkness, no one really knows, but at least they can say that they have tried as much as they can.
