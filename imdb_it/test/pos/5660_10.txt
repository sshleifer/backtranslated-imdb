I finally managed to see this movie ... after so many years of expectation ... <br /> <br /> I was so curious to see if this movie is as bad as some say .. <br /> <br /> And my opinion is that this film is not bad at all, on the contrary it was INCREDIBLE ... <br /> <br /> I liked every second from it ... from the beginning to the end ... <br /> <br /> The actors were fantastic, they sent me the feeling of living the story at the same time the film was playing ... <br /> <br /> The landscapes were so beautiful the film was shot ... and it fascinated me .. Even the music was amazing and I have nothing to blame .. <br /> <br /> I think the plot was very original, I don't think to have seen a film like this ... <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not recognized all over the world ... to bad for those who have not done it t have the chance to see it. I give this movie 10/10
