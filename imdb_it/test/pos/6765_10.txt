This is actually a brilliant film. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially Mads Mikkelsen's performance as Svend is magnificent. It's a simple story of two boys with the impulse to make it on their own, but it develops into a strange and absurd story, with a lot of people being accidentally killed and served as chicken steaks. If only more people understood Danish ... This could be a great candidate for an English version. It is also worth remembering Ole Thestrup, who always offers that extra touch to the plot, with his slightly crazy character Holger. I can only recommend this film to the Danish public. Also take a look at Adams Ã†bler (2005), a film by Anders Thomas Jensen, also with Mads Mikkelsen accompanied by an excellent Ulrich Thomsen.
