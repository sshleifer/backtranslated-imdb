A brutally simple story of murder and capital punishment by the state. So painfully slow and precise in describing the death penalty (from the preparation of the gallows to the victim who sticks in his pants before he dies) he has the power to change his mind about the death penalty. The entire Dekalog originated from this story: Dekalog's screenwriter was the helpless lawyer who tried unsuccessfully to defend and then comforted the accused.
