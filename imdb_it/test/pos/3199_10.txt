I saw it for the first time when I bought a random DVD of short films some time ago. this is the only short film on the DVD that I liked, but I don't like just that I like it ... if you spend all the time with me, you'll see it. it's beautiful, simple and passionate, no bells, no whistles - it could have been done with a sharpener (but don't get me wrong, the animation is elegant and insightful - this person has clearly spent a lot of time with cats - but it's simply black and white ) and then there's writing and music ... it's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, drink wine and look at it again and again ... <br /> <br /> nothing else matters, I'm waiting for Pedro Serrazina to come up with something else.
