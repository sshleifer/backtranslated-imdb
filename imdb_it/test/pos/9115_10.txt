If you are like me and you bought the new album Tenacious D the day it came out, and you entered the film knowing all the lyrics of all the songs ... then you will surely like this movie. Yes, I'm a huge Tenacious D fan, but I really enjoyed this movie that made me laugh a little. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty much everything I expected. Comic genius supported by a great songwriter and some great cameos by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I particularly enjoyed the part of Tim Robbins. <br /> <br /> If, however, you are not familiar with the HBO series of Tenacious D'e and the fantastic debut album, then this may not have the same comic impact on you. However, I advise you to go and see it because it is still worth every cent of the admission price and it will make you smile even if you're not ready for it all the time.
