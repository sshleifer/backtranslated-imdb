It is important and right to recall that, at the time of production of this short film, there was a state of war between the United States and the Empire of Japan. Add to this the enormous malevolence that the beginning of the war created, as well as the March of Bataan's death and other incidents and the only surprising thing about this short and others is that there were no more. Another thing: my only problem with this short is that it seems to try to be fun, but it isn't. I'm not sure if someone he's connected to really tried to make the jokes work, or even worry about them. It would have been so much better if they had done what Disney did with education for death and it was absolutely serious. But this short has a bad blow and should not be judged out of context. The times were different then and this is an important consideration. Anyone who spends energy trying to save the world from a 60-year-old cartoon must take a step back. As I do, using energy to defend the same cartoon. This should be available to interested parties, although not widely used. It's not a nice cartoon, but sometimes life isn't good. Recommended
