Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I like it so much is because of how smart the script is, it's not your average comedy show there's no pause after a continuous joke, if you missed it lost. And it's not like a soap opera drama because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid and stupid looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the best T.V. of his time. It's funny because they talk so fast that you can't get everything the first time it's nice to go back and laugh at the other lines. They also have so many references that it is surprising how intelligent they are. <br /> <br /> And you can relate to the characters even their so real and the actors are superb from the witty Lorelai to the hermit Luke to the immature Kirk the show is simply fantastic. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun and spend some time with the family, this is definitely the show for them. There is only one word that can describe Gilmore Girls .... CLASSIC !!!!!!
