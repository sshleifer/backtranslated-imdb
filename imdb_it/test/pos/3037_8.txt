Our America is multicultural, with so many subcultures. This film simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people who live their lives forgetting the rest of the world. In general, a good movie. He entertained, provoked thought and showed lives that would not have been seen otherwise, right in our backyard. It should be seen by everyone. Having lived in the United States all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here who didn't know they were citizens. This film helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. The obvious conclusion: if this is really real, then what else is out there that we know nothing about?
