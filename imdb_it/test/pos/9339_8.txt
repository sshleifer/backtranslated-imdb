I don't particularly care about Michael Jackson. Apart from being a pedophile, I don't really like his music, with the exception of some songs from his historical album, THRILLER. This is one of them. I like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by John Landis, better known to horror fans as director of American AN WEREWOLF in London. This music video is not so much a music video, but more or less a short horror film. M. J. and his date are in a werewolf movie. When they leave the film, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies, when Michael Jackson makes his famous "Thriller" dance. <br /> <br /> You know, this is really a beautiful song with good synthesized rhythms. This and "Beat It" are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs that I can tolerate again and again. In particular, I love Vincent Price's cameo as a storyteller. His distinctive voice is perfect for a horror-themed music video. Even if you don't like the music of M.J., you have to see this video at least once. By the way, he was good before he became a haunting white woman with a fake nose.
