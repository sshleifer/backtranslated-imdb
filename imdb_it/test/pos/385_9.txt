In Strangers On A Train, it is obvious that Playboy's Walkman, Robert Walker, chose Farley Granger as an involuntary accomplice of a couple of murders. Granger is a semi-public figure, a tennis professional, but not particularly tall. High enough for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman. <br /> <br /> So when you meet as a Strangers On A Train one afternoon, Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be quite intrigued with the possibility that if the two, complete strangers, commit murder on parties, the other it would conveniently be due to their disappearance. Although Granger is rejected by the idea, one of the nice things about this film is that you can see in the performance that Granger could simply submit to temptation. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Walker kills Laura Elliot Granger's wife, of whom he was two to be christened and even got pregnant by another man, expects Granger in turn to kill Walker's father in so that Walker can inherit his property. Today Walker would have been called a rather malicious and child trust fund. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his title role, ironically in his latest complete film. Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished. Even Hitchcock doesn't hurt Farley Granger. <br /> <br /> Obviously when Granger does not object to committing murder on people who have never done anything to him, the tension. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by a great assembly, first in the tennis game in which Granger must finish the game and Waylay Walker before planting trials that condemn Granger at the crime scene. And also in this final culmination of a fight over a fleeing carousel between Walker and Granger. <br /> <br /> Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at its best, it should not be missed and should be requested during film studio editing lessons.
