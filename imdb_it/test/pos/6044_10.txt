I went through the training camp at MCRD Parris Island in 1953 and this film is an accurate representation of what the boots went through at that time, even to bury that sand flea. Many of the "actors" in the film were marines on active duty. This movie could be more fun than Marines than others, but I feel that the movie itself is very well done and Jack Webb has made a "good DI". Always Fi!
