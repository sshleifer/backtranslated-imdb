Lights of New York was the first feature film. There was, of course, The Jazz Singer, published in October 1927 as a first feature film that incorporated a synchronized dialogue. However, this film released in July 1928 is virtually unrecognized for its place in film history. It started as a short, but little by little it was attacked until, with a 58-minute timing, it became the first full-length movie. It opened to a run at home and to the surprise of Warner Bros., made over a million dollars. It was a good return in 1928. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Two country barbers naively deceive a barber on Broadway who ranks like a crazy-easy for "The Hawk", a gangster. When they learn the truth, they can't afford to go out, because the younger barber, Eddie, has all his mother's money tied up in the place. Kitty is the girlfriend of the younger barber, and the gangster Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) has an eye to turn his older girlfriend (Gladys Brockwell) into a newer model - the chorus girl Kitty (Helene Costello). A policeman is killed while trying to prevent the Falco's men from unloading a smuggling liquor shipment, and Falco sees it as an opportunity to frame Eddie, thus obtaining Kitty for himself. <br /> <br /> This first talkie is full of fun for fans of this pioneering work. Of course, the plot is elementary and the dialogue is drafted, but there is something that is not seen much in the first speeches - musical score in the background. The vitaphone was originally used for this purpose, and here they are still using it for musical accompaniment along with dialogue. And there are numbers that sing and dance! The scenes in Hawk's nightclub are used as an opportunity to show what movies could never do before: musical numbers. There is also a wild-eyed emcee with a heavy make-up left by the silent era which is a real treat to watch. <br /> <br /> Vitaphone could not go outdoors at this point due to the static cameras of the cameras, so scene in the park between the two lovers Eddie and Kitty is simulated - and cheap. The vegetation resembles something from an Ed Wood film or perhaps a school production of "Our Town". <br /> <br /> Gladys Brockwell, as a girlfriend of the hawk's castoff, offers her punch lines. It is a real trooper considering which lines it must deliver. For the hawk - "So you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck!" Eh? metaphors mixed anyone? And then there are his final lines "I lived, and I loved, and I lost!" Has anyone been paid to write this dialog? Brockwell has achieved good success in her talkie career after scoring some triumphs in silent films (the bad sister of "Seventh Heaven"), when a fatal car accident caused her to lose her career. <br /> <br /> Then there's Eugene Tavolozza - the oldest of the two barbers in our history. His frog voice, the naturalness of the lines and the cuddly appearance gave him a long career as a character actor who usually appears as a family man / businessman with a surly exterior and a heart of gold. In fact, Mr. Palette is the only member of this cast who still has a remarkable film career just three years after the release of this film. <br /> <br /> Finally there is the question "where is that microphone hidden?" ? "The microphones were still at this point, and it's fun to find out where they hid it. There's a famous scene, though, where everyone can figure it out. Hawk is in his office talking to his two henchmen - that seem to understand slowly as they talk - to "take Eddie for a ride". If you look at this scene, you swear that the phone on the desk is a character in this movie. It's frontal and central throughout the conversation. The microphone is probably inserted into the phone. <br /> <br /> There is something heroic about these pioneers flying blind in the face of new sound technology, you have silent actors who are used to using pantomime for expression, the Vaudevillians who know play in a live audience, but don't know how to make the same impression on a Vitaphone camera booth, and you also have dialog writers who try to write conversation in a compact way like they did the opening credits or fill film with n endless chatter. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this. It's not boring, it moves fast and it's a lot of fun if you know what to look for. And no, I don't expect this to ever come out on Blu-Ray, but I hope Warner Brothers will soon add it to Warner Archive so everyone can see it.
