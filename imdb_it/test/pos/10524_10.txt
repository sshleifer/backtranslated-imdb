Considering that this film was released 8 years before I was born, I don't feel too bad for watching it for too long for so long. In January 98, however, I attended the second annual Quentin Tarantino festival, held in Austin, Texas. The particular theme of tonight's films was "Neglected 70's Crime Films" and the boy was his righteous one. "The Gravy Train (or The Dion Brothers, as this print appeared)" was a real gem. Wonderful shows, bizarre characters, brilliant plot, hilarious comedy and just a great moment. You rarely see a crime film that is so fun and fresh. Margot Kidder is extremely sexy in one of her first film appearances. I hope a cable network will be able to capture this movie and let many others see it. In the meantime, go to an independent video store and hope they have it.
