The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far from the Paul Kersey of the original film. If you remember the 1974 movie, you will remember that Kersey was a "Conchie" during the Korean War and that he was physically ill after committing his first performance. Ten years later, Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti-tank weapons in his spare time. But I neglect that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels, the bags of lowlife waste are shot dead, burned alive, their teeth destroyed and thrown to death by middle-aged housewives with brushes. Yes, I know the gang members are multi-ethnic and therefore they deserve some credit but even if they are not racists they are still murdering scum that deserves everything they get from Kersey and innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy when you have Paul Kersey, an antitank rocket and a group of retired old people to reclaim the streets from criminal crimes. Paul Kersey, I greet you sir
