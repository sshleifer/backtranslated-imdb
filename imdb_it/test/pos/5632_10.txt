This could be the best movie of 1999. No, I'm not kidding. This documentary directed by Chris Smith captures the spirit of artistic compulsion. Smith does the clever thing any documentarian should do: he remains invisible and refuses to judge his subject. <br /> <br /> While the spectator looks at Mark and his efforts, no matter how aggressive they may be, could finish his films. He refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result. But not to forget, remember that Speilberg, Scorsese and others started just as humbly. <br /> <br /> And what a nice person he chooses. Mark, his family and friends are all fascinating characters, much more than any other character created in last year's fantastic film products. This film fluctuates between comedy, tragedy, moving compassion and ultimately leads us to inspire any viewer with the desire to create, despite the problems with talent, to take off the butts and do something. <br /> <br /> The film is about unconventional artists and their passions. It's also about families, no matter how co-dependent and dysfunctional they are and how unique and beautiful that body is. Mark shows in the film that he is completely devoted not only to his dreams, but also to his family - and they to him. <br /> <br /> Because this film was not nominated for the documentary of the year it is beyond me and criminal (assuming it was eligible last year). This film must be sought after and appreciated.
