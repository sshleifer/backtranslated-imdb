The show starts with the boat. I was Desmond. Then they went to try to save Walt. And blocking things that push the button is a big joke at the same time, Desmond found out that that's what crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon has locked on him, and Charlie helps him find the bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan this, Sasyid must first find the others and see who and what the others are. And find out if they are armed and have weapons. <br /> <br /> Michael takes Jack, Swayer, Kate and Hugo in a trap. And they are captured. <br /> <br /> After the show there were more questions and then answers, but what makes the show great. And I can't wait until the third season
