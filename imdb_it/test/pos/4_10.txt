This film was sadly underestimated but turned out to be truly exceptional. Entering the theater I knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> I was caught off guard by the high quality of the film. I couldn't play Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance really exemplified his character. This film is exceptional and deserves our monetary support, unlike many other films. For me it is not advisable to recommend a movie, but in this case I highly recommend everyone to see it. <br /> <br /> This film is truly exceptional!
