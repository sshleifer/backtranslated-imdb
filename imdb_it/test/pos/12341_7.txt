Thorn-BMI is out of business, before they stopped making films they made a movie chiller. Using E.S.P. and telekinesis as the basis of the daughter whose father was the master of a terrible power. Only in the death of his father did Olivia find out that his father surnamed Raymarkovitch's 'Raymar' had actually killed 6 girls and was designing two more using the psychic Vampirism technique. <br /> <br /> Our photo begins with 6 coroner carts entering and music to match the grotesque discovery of the 6 girls. All dead with eyes wide open in a closet. In the walls there were all kinds of objects, the coroners were pulling up an old man, when blue lightning struck the ceiling which caused a circular hole to form only the most bizarre film! <br /> <br /> If you like extremely chilling scenes this is for you. Unless you can see the corpses of years ago in every level of decay, don't see it without a friendly companion. Like "The Changeling" it has a certain heart that stops the horror in it. I gave this vote to 7 is in color, the actress Meg Tilly debuted in this movie if you can find it.
