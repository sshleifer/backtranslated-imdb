Chucky (the killer doll of "Child's Play" and 2 lousy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using "Voodoo for Dummies") revives him. Then, through circumstances too complicated to enter, SHE is killed and her soul is put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a beautiful couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again ... <br /> <br /> Much better than it looks. After the last two sequels of "Child's Play" (both horrible) I expected the worst, but this was actually a lot of fun. The film doesn't take itself seriously for a second (seriously - how could it?) And the lines and situations are actually quite funny. Also there are some VERY sad murders launched to satisfy us horror fans and the movie never stops. The film also has some things that are not usually found in a horror film - a gay best friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is intelligent and does not play for laughter and a sequence in which Stabile takes off his shirt only to show his body muscled. Even John Ritter has a nice sheriff's cameo. <br /> <br /> The acting is good - Stable is young, VERY beautiful and nice; Heigl doesn't have much to do but pulls it out and Brad Dourif (Chucky's voice) and Tilly are hilarious as the killer dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (don't ask) and she asks for a gum and he says, "But I'm made of rubber!" The special effects are good (there are no disgusting CGIs) and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in a fun way. Worth seeing. I give him a 9.
