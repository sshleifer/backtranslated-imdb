Anthony Quinn is a master at capturing our heart and our understanding. Portrays a Romanian farmer with an IQ below average, harassed by his wife to do more. It is the second world war and the Nazis have taken control of his country. Soon he will find himself digging trenches hoping to take advantage of his wife's eyes. The Nazis have different ideas. In the coming years we will watch events unfold through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. His manipulations and his misfortune simply bring him into additional hot water. Finally, because of him, we see his picture on the cover of "Der Spiegel" as the perfect Aryan. The war ends and the allies put him on trial for war crimes. But all our farmer wants to do is go home to his wife.
