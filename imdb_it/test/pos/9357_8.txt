After a man dies, a soldier becomes the first suspect. Undoubtedly the best film with three Roberts and all are in excellent shape. Young is the friendly smoker cop who is investigating the murder, Mitchum is the friend concerned about the murder suspect, and Ryan is a hot-headed soldier with something to hide. Grahame has a short but effective role as a femme fatale. The future Tarzan Barker has a part as a soldier. This film touches on anti-Semitism, a theme also covered by the Oscar for best film "Gentleman's Agreement", published the same year. It is directed by Dmytryk, which creates an effective film noir atmosphere.
