I thought this was the most interesting film that JCVD ​​has done for a long time. I loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit gave a different tone to this movie. IMHO, JCDV could really be about to move on. A little more lightness, some obvious tributes to other films, mixed with some great fights ... I'd like to see more of this style of film production from him. One of the other posters thought the bar scene was a Desperado rip-off. I immediately saw also the connection of R. Rodriguez, but I thought he was very intelligent and made me want to see the film again to look for other subtle signals from other films. JCVD breaks !! <br /> <br /> Other things after reading other comments: <br /> <br /> No music in the dungeon fight? At first I didn't like that either, but then I thought it was interesting because it slightly off-balance giving me something we didn't expect. It made everything seem more real. <br /> <br /> I always laugh when the directors cry like two years that their film was "stolen" from the studio. Directors are paid to do a job. The studio is the boss and they want the product they want. Very few directors have an absolute final cut on a film. In this case, JCVD ​​is THE talent and the only reason why anyone is watching this movie. I'm sure he had a movie he was happy about. I have a relative who works in a mail house who knew a little about history. PRESUMABILE, the director worked and delivered his cut of the film. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... then JCVD ​​and the studio modified the film. This stuff happens all the time. He also saw the final cut (which he claims he didn't do) and his "delicate genius" ego was seriously injured because he hated his cut delivered. If this director was intelligent, he would have to take credit for it because he would have been the best.
