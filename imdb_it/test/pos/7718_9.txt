I just came back from seeing this amazingly funny movie. <br /> granted, part of the reason why I liked it this way was because I could point to people and places I knew ('I walk every day!', 'work there!', 'I drank something there!' , 'hey! this is our postman!' etc ...). but, anyway, if you're out for a 'feel good' with a little spice (excuse the pun) - this is just the right answer. relationships, culture and, above all, love are all intertwined within the plot. <br /> <br /> with preston (where the film is set) it has recently become a city, it's nice to see this work with the place and adding to the feeling of uprise. it is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north. <br /> fabulous!
