I was very curious about Anatomy (aka Anatomie) and if I were to see it, I had to buy it since no video store in my area brought the film. Since it wasn't a cheap DVD, I took the chance and thought I'd check out other comments on IMDb. Many of the comments didn't give me enough hope to shell out a lot of money for a film I had never seen and had no clues about. Basically I got the idea that it was a sexy youth-oriented fun compared to many teen-cookie thrillers. Well, something in the back of my mind told me to ignore those kinds of comments and buy it! I did it and I was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> If compared to any other film, I'd say it's a variation on Coma and Extreme Measures. I could not see any comparison with films like Scream, Urban Legends, and others. Yes, the cast is young (it is because they are medical students!) At least they are not the boring type of high school characters any more, and yes, some are lustful (in practice the character played by Anna Loos is, and is managed enough well in the German version), but Anatomy is well built, there is a tense mood, the sets are fantastic, the makeup effects are a wow and Franka Potente is very credible in her role. I found myself enjoying all this despite some holes in the plot! The story of a student who discovers a kind of secret society that performs autopsies on living patients is a rather disturbing scenario and what happens to those patients afterwards is quite intelligent. Sure, could you ask why she hasn't just left that city? Ok, but the movie would be finished in half an hour. <br /> <br /> This was the first effort of the German side of Columbia Pictures, and it is actually quite impressive. There was a bit of attention in production and actually offering genuine thrills is a result. It is a bit mature in mind, as it does not resort to constant opportunities for sexual encounters (a breast party) or juvenile drug jokes. The character of Anna Loos, while making sexual remarks often and looking for some fun, was actually a nice touch: having a character who was a smarter woman than all the men in the school. He discovered that sex was just a distraction for her and the rather lacking men. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT STUFF: Watching this film in original German language with English or French subtitles is the best way to enjoy it. I saw the theatrical trailers dubbed in English and I was disgusted by the change in the tone of the film. I've never seen a film properly dubbed in my life - they never find voices that fit the actors or characters in the movie. Sure enough, I tried to look at some of the dubbed Anatomy in English and its level of intelligence collapsed badly, making it seem more like a comedy. A good example is when a boy was out of his mind for being cut and screamed to be sewn up - hearing it in German sounded frantic, but in English he sounded like a comedian. Frankly, I'm sick of hearing people say that they can't handle reading subtitles or watch a "letterbox" movie. Anatomy turns out to be stupid with supernatural voices that look like octaves too high for the people you see in the movie, and Anna Loos's sexual comments seem just terrible comments right from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. I wonder if the negative comments on Anatomy come from people who have seen him dubbed, but it doesn't look like the same movie at all! This is not an economic horror film and deserves to be seen as it was created. Interestingly, some of the English subtitles are different in function scenes and in the "making of" supplement. <br /> <br /> As it turns out, I bet and won with Anatomy. It is a competent thriller with cute characters and does not try to experience chills at low cost.
