The plot: Michael Linnett Connors did everything in the movies but directed, and is looking for his first big break. He discovers Molly in a comedy and knows immediately that he will be a great movie star. He signs a contract with the clause he has to direct. The producer agrees and their great careers over time are underway. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and the first sound films with great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there is romance and even a little sadness. The performances of Don Ameche and Alice Fay are first rate. Music is a real advantage even with some old familiar songs heard. A lot of extra DVDs also in this restored version, published in 2008. It should be emphasized that this film is a story 1, not just a tribute to silent films. The following years would bring similar films like Singin 'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner's, The Comic (1969). What is special about this film, however, is recreating silent films in 1939. We see some parts like the cinema audience in that bygone era (although some sound effects are included) in glorious b & w, while the rest of the film it is in pristine color. One of the greatest in the age of silence, Buster Keaton, who at this point was uphill, is used superbly in 2 recreated silent movie scenes and is at the top of his game! It is said that he also had some input on his scenes. But the real reason to watch the film, if you're a fan of film history, is that beyond all, Hollywood Cavalcade is the film legacy of Mack Sennett. It doesn't take a genius to understand that this film is a "positive" reworking of the lives of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand. The character Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course, is Mabel. Sennett had cake tosses, bathing beauties and Keystone cops. He worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (cameo), Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (double body) and fell in love with his protagonist. Not only that, but Sennett has been a technical consultant for this film and he also appears. Since most viewers today prefer sound characteristics, those who have been associated with short subjects and silences are left to pasture. As Mack Sennett fell into that category, it's fortunate that there is Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett was obviously very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies. His career began in 1908 as an actor, then as a writer, director and producer. He retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit. He had worked with the best, like Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle, and even Roy Rogers (in Way Up Thar). As a film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career, Mack played seriously and only did selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931 he received an academic award in the short thematic category and another in 1937 for a working life. In the 1940s his presence was still perceived, eg. Here Come Co-Eds (1945) where the oyster soup scene used in Mack's Wandering Willies (1926) was recreated. In 1947, The Road to Hollywood, he used some of the Sennett's Crosby films. Two years later he brought a little nostalgia with the film Down Memory Lane in which he participated. With his ability to always associate with the right people, he played a guest role with the very famous Lawrence Welk and his radio program happened later in the year. The 1950 brought a re-edition of his greatest triumph, Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914) with sound. In 1952 he was honored on TV, This Is Your Life, then his autobiography The King of Comedy (1954) was published, which is a great piece to accompany on Hollywood Cavalcade. 1955 brought a more concrete association with Abbott & Costello, since it had a cameo in A & C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally in 1957, another tribute with the compilation, The Golden Age of Comedy. So when you look at Hollywood Cavalcade it's the legacy of a film pioneer. In the film at the banquet scene, the camera gives an overview of the guests at a long table. As we arrive at the silver-haired Mack, he alone turns his head towards the camera as if to say "here I am!". When he gets up to give a speech a little later, he is in his most subdued tone, underestimating the words that are transmitted to him as if to convey mentally: "I know that my influence on the comedy will never end, but people will forget the individual at Mack Sennett. Maybe this movie will help. "
