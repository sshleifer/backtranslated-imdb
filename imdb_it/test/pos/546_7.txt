This film is about a single mother who is happy and lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensitive teenage daughter who is experiencing a teenage turmoil. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is an engaging film from start to finish. Both Ann and Adele are well described at the beginning, so we know how different their personalities are. Clashes inevitably ensue, and are presented in an appealing way. I find myself so attracted by their state of mind and their circumstances. it's like I'm living their lives, feeling what they feel. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon offers another excellent performance in "Anywhere But Here". She is charismatic, happy, lucky, hedonistic, warm and loving at the same time. I have always liked Susan Sarandon, and I think she is very undervalued. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is an exciting emotional journey.
