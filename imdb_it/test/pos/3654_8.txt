I saw this movie at the Seattle International Film Festival in a house full of movie fans and former Indian fans. The film is incredibly beautiful and smooth for a first film. The management is safe, especially with the locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bits of bits. While the plot and the plot are elementary for non-existent, the pleasures of watching performances and the landscape compensate for the lack. The soundtrack of this film is a great attraction for lovers of world music. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different position every day, take a look at Hari Om for inspiration. It was not disclosed in the Q&A, but I imagine that Hollywood could take a lesson on making the film in economy by learning from this director.
