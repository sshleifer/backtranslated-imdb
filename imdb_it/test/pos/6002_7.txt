This was a truly epic production that had all the elements you would want in a fantasy film. Costume, music, cinematography - all the artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience. <br /> <br /> Ted Danson, best known for his TV roles in "Cheers" and "becker", was excellent in the role of Gulliver. Mary Steenburgen (Time After Time, Cross Creek) behaved equally well in her limited role as his wife. <br /> <br /> Other performances that I enjoyed were James Fox as Dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard as Queen of Brobdingnag, and Peter O'Toole as Emperor of Lilliput. <br /> <br /> This would be a fun film for children, but adults will certainly like it for its deep social commentary.
