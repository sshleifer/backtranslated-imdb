Iron Eagle may not be the most credible film in terms of plot, but the characters are well written and very well interpreted. If you can't believe the characters, the movie is a flop. <br /> <br /> I believe that photography, especially aerial photography, is superb. I believe it is far superior to Top Gun to which it is compared to infinity. It's one of the best pieces of aerial photography I've seen. The soundtrack by Basil Paledouros (forgive the spelling) is fantastic and juxtaposes well with rock songs. I would like that part of the soundtrack to be available. <br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick does well as a teenager who suddenly has to grow up quickly and with the reality of life, death and responsibilities. Lou Gossett is fabulous as Chappy, both hard and human, as the pilots' deaths remind us. <br /> <br /> There are many movies out there that you watch once and you don't care to watch again. Then there are those movies that take you for one aspect or another and you can watch it again and again! Iron Eagle is that kind of movie!
