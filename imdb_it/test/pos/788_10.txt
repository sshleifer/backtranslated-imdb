This is a wonderful short film - one of Keaton's best ever. Through a long series of stupid mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. And as a result, most of the film consists of him escaping from the police and in particular from a detective. Although I am generally NOT a fan of movies with many hunting scenes, this is the absolute best for pure athletic and acrobatic skills. I have seen some that have had wilder acrobatics, but none in which the star was so agile and capable of moving with extraordinary grace. In particular, there is a scene where he runs across a table, jumps on the shoulders of a man and dives through the transom as if it were humanly possible. In addition, many of the gags are fun and perfectly synchronized, such as how they really think they actually killed someone. By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, even by Keaton, but quite original and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of what I probably liked even more is THE PLAYHOUSE - where Buster plays every role in the theater.
