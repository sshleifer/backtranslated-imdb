For some perverse reasons better known to themselves these IMDb tables seem reluctant to credit the great Billy Wilder as co-writer on at least two (this and Ninotchka) of his early classics when a buff can detect Wilder's hand at work. As it happened, this represented the first time he collaborated with Charles Brackett (who gets a credit) and it was a great start. One commentator noted how satisfying it is to see this type of film in old-fashioned cinemas and I couldn't agree more. In Paris, one of Revival's smaller houses shows a more or less continuous retrospective of Lubitsch in one of his silles and I am pleased to report that this has been played to a very grateful audience throughout the age group although I doubt any of them was actually alive when it was first published in 1938. The famous Wilder Schickk the meet-cute is particularly tasty here when millionaire but-careful-with-him Cooper tries to buy half pajamas in a department store on the Riviera and encounters resistance to sales until Claudette Colbert shows up and agrees to buy the other half. The gag is milked even more when, after having exhausted the chain of command in the shop itself, the manager makes a phone call to the owner, who is in bed and leaves him to reveal that he also wears only the top of his pajamas. The film is full of visual gags like this, balanced by a verbal spirit that makes it perfect. Claudette Colbert is terrifying and gets great support from Edward Everett Horton as his impoverished father by the title. David Niven at the fourth billing has some fun 'business' like Franklin Pangborn and if Gary Cooper doesn't live up to his bad role as does verbal dexterity and the sophisticated character that Wilder writers demanded at this stage of his career, it's possible have everything and what you have is damn perfect.
