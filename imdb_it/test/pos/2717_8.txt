Our family and friends really enjoyed this movie. The theme was well managed by the director with great performances by Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by the good performances of the other cast. The climax was built well, but for the ending it was far from being called "Good". Are we still trying to figure out what the manager was trying to convey? Were they out of ideas or was it the end beyond the understanding of lovers of ordinary cinema? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the public and increased visibility. However, this should not take away the credit that is due to Konkana and Shabana Azmi for relating so well with the characters!
