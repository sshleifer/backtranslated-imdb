I really like this movie. It's not very funny, but it's a party of bizarre and breathtaking images! There is no dialog box, just some background sounds and noises. If you are in something completely different and original, and enjoy the dark and bizarre ... then you might like this artwork. Ik looks like a film made with the very first camera ever made, in an age when strange human beings seem to live and realize their bizarre habits. God killed himself with a razor and gave birth to mother earth. Mother earth became impregnated with God's sperm after an act of fellatio and gave birth to a son "Flesh on Bone". What follows are inhumane acts of ritual torture, rape and murder for purposes we don't know ... or not?
