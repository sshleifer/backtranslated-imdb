Perhaps the most beautiful moment of TV, at least in my memory, given that millions of spectators could see Shakespeare's cycle of Kings (Richard II - Richard III) playing on prime-time TV (I think it was Friday night). No words were left out, and the performances awakened in me (who was then in elementary school) the thirst for history and the hunger for Shakespeare and the drama. <br /> <br /> We see these reprints on DVD. What a set this would be!
