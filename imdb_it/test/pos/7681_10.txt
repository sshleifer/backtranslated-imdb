Surely the Gershwin family understands that this is one of America's greatest works. You have thousands of fans of this work waiting for it to be released on DVD. Please don't be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and wonder you can bring to an audience hungry for quality music, releasing this fantastic GEM. Don't wait for the film to be irreparable. The cast is top notch, the music is simply fantastic, we need wonderful music in today's world. He may never be filmed again with such an exceptional cast. With today's home theater systems, wonderful sound systems and the need for good music, I plead with the Gershwin family to reconsider and publish this fantastic film. thanks a lot
