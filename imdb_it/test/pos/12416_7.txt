I recently saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel. Actually it turned out to be pretty decent with regards to B-list horror / suspense films. Two boys (one naive and one yelled loudly to **) make a trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a crazy tank / truck hybrid decides to play cat and mouse with them. Things get even more complicated when they take an incredibly ugly hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror really works in this film, unlike many others. The two boys are quite nice and there are some chase / suspense scenes. The pleasant rhythm and the comic rhythm make this film more than passable for the horror / slasher buff. Definitely worth a look.
