I would give this film a good level 7. Although it is certainly not the biggest film, or even one of the best films of its kind (The Killing Fields is better), at least it tries to tell a necessary story. > <br /> I think the way Laura was introduced to Burma was a little forced. First of all, Burma is not exactly the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 1980s. Secondly, if you did become Burma, your passport would not be lost. A healthy person would make sure they knew where their passport was at all times. With that in mind, I'm sure the writer knew he was weak, but he needed something. Patricia Arquette's performance was underestimated, and I didn't buy her to be a doctor. However, at least she has not exaggerated the role, which often happens in films like this. U Aung Ko was good, but also underestimated. The end is difficult to follow, since much of the dialogue is in Burmese, with people translating for Laura. It would have been difficult for Laura, and it's difficult even for the viewer. Another advantage is the strong Asian SE scenery in the film, which was nice to see.
