I saw this movie for the first time accidentally when they showed it on TV and I got up too late ... I was really lucky out there. It's really incredible; from the position (isolated as it is possible to be on this planet, made the "abyss" similar to ET in the council pool), through interesting characters (Keith David is particularly good as the reactionary Child - "And if we are wrong of him? "-" Then we are wrong. ") and the effects (more disgusting than Alien). <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the real tension and fear in the film has nothing to do with the effects. They are the people you start to be scared of; knowing that one of them could - or might not be - "All that they appear to be". He certainly has the feeling of "who goes there?" <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is fantastic; really plays on the isolation, the fear and the gravity of the situation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the epilogue scene really, really cuts. Even more than "But then again who does it?" Bladerunner's final punchline. Enough said.
