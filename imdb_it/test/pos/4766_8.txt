One of my favourites. As a child, raised in the New York metropolitan area in the late 1960s and early 1970s, I was often offered the opportunity to visit New York with my grandfather or father, who ran the business there. The gritty, lively, human reality of that city, especially in winter, remained with me. <br /> <br /> This film captures very well the rigid, cold and concrete feeling of the New York winter season, while sharply exposing the weak point of the infamous underworld of crime and the police. An excellent snapshot of a place, a time and a culture. <br /> <br /> And the car chase is simply fantastic. At least on a par with that of "Bullitt", and passing the pursuit on "The French Connection". I can see, over and over again, as the suspension unlocks on that Plymouth Fury police cruiser that creeps towards the GW Bridge in pursuit, as it climbs up that curve to the right, bouncing and scraping the incoming traffic . The acrobatic driving coordinator for that scene did "Bullitt" and "The French Connection" and many other prohibitive cinematic pursuits. Good acting and decent plot. The soundtrack is sharp and compelling, and the cinematography and the direction are first rate. A great police drama, albeit undervalued in the 1970s. A custodian. Not yet on DVD, though. <br /> <br /> Comparable in style and content to: The French Connection and Super Fly. The first police dramas of the 70s are set in the desolate winter months of New York.
