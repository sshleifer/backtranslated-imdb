No matter what this socially retarded person says above, this show is hilarious. It shows how many single men are in a bar atmosphere, and also shows that women are not as naive as men believe. <br /> <br /> The appearance of how the contest is really beautiful and original. It's not the standard reality show we've all been used to for a day. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance to everyone, we are only in one episode, we finally have a Canadian program that is not absolute crap. As Canadians what we normally get, Bon Cop, Bad Cop, or Corner Gas. Come on, people show that we are not all as cautious as the previous review. <br /> <br /> The way to go to Comedy Network, giving a chance to a new show. The panel is fun and the competitors are pretty good so far.
