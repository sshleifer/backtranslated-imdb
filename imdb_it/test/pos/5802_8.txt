I have to admit that when I first saw Madonna performing in Holiday in Top of the Pops many years ago I told my wife "another American wonder that did it all wrong !!" Well, she was wearing a scary wig and she was creepily dressed. I never learned to love her like my daughter does, but I have to eat my words. I like some of his stuff and sometimes I enjoy his concerts. This tour of Confessions is great, even if the music is not (and is not). I was impressed by the staging and the concepts. Madonna's performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers who chose to support her. My daughter was at London concerts and she was crazy about it. The lady (Madge) showed that my initial assessment of her was so wrong !!
