Rules of Engagement is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It is well built, perfectly assembled together and provides excellent footage to support the assertions it takes. The best quality of the film is that it is not based on being in solidarity with the Dividians as much as it illuminates the public on the blatant errors and lies of the government surrounding the whole situation. I was left with feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger about the way the government managed and then covered a tragedy of this magnitude. The cover up is what really left me irritated. It is one thing to fail in an operation and to admit a sense of guilt, but another is to look at Americans and lie to them. I guess it shouldn't surprise me with the story of our beloved country that saw the assassination of JFK, the Vietnam War and other significant events that have a bad cover smell that you have to keep your nose in whenever you drive Washington DC a plane with special heat detection technology and autopsies on some bodies clearly show that the FBI is lying to the public. One of the things I try to keep in mind when I watch a documentary like this is that I'm usually just getting testimonials from a point of view. But again, this is without doubt one of the brilliant successes of the Rules of Engagement. He presents his evidence so conclusively that even if an FBI statement is presented to you, how could you really believe it. I clearly remember when the stalemate was taking place in the way the media presented the Dividians as this crazy group of cult rebels with David Koresh, the self-proclaimed reborn Jesus Christ, as their leader. None of this was really real, but rather a story taken from fragments of facts. They were simply supporting the rights to bear arms and practice their religion as American citizens. If you were the ATF and wanted to do a search in the compound, are you attacking the building with a unit of men armed with rifles and body armor, how to do it? If you are the FBI, why engage in psychological warfare and offer little in a real negotiation to help solve the situation? Why pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children? Why open large holes inside the composite structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire? Why lie about not firing weapons when it can be clearly shown on video? Unless. Unless you want to see the situation end up like it did. The scene at the end when the flag of the Dividians Star of David blew up the flag pole in the fire and the ATF was raised shortly after it was an emotional climate scene that made my head shudder with disgust and mine stomach become uncontrollable. Director William Gazecki deserves my heartfelt congratulations. It takes a lot of courage to make a film like this and I'm sure there have also been many repercussions from the government for this. Because of people like him, the public can be shown the real truth rather than the crap that is filtered through a media that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine. When I look back at how I felt about the Dividians at the time because of the media representation of David Koresh and how I felt after watching this film, it's really amazing. It reminds me of the Bible's joke about a man who was healed by Jesus and asked by the elders how it happened "before I was blind but now I can see" he kept telling him. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You may need to look for it but it's really something special.
