Begotten is black and white distorted images. It looks like it could have come from the nineteenth century. However, the sound is crystal clear, minus the synchronization and the addition of calm natural sounds. <br /> <br /> This film has been very critical of life's struggles. Show a single mother and a child in a violent world that thrives on the innocent. The mother is very unaware of her surroundings. This leads to many tortures, pain and death. You can watch it many times and see different symbolisms, plot devices and basically "what does it mean?". <br /> <br /> If you appreciate art in movies, then you'll like it. Otherwise, don't worry.
