While caricatures and / or references to the entertainment industry, people or things or even product brands are usually a base product in short films like this, they are not used in quantity here. Most individual gags are quite generic. As I will give examples, there will be spoilers below: <br /> <br /> There are only three caricatures (well, technically four - there's a fast one at the end of the cartoon) that I noticed, which is quite low for this type of short, even if one is a character in evidence with a fair amount of activity. I'm Jack Benny (like Jack Bunny), Leopold Stowkowski and the inimitable Ned Sparks (like a crab can-chances are very good that, if a crab was involved in a Warner Brothers short in the 30s and 40s, the caricature used would be Ned Sparks). There are also references to Billy Rose's Aquacade and a riff on a radio character called "Henry Aldrich" (Coming, mother!), A Superman game (Superguy here) and the villain is taking off on "King Kong". That's all for that kind of gag. <br /> <br /> The products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more played on basic objects in unusual situations, such as turtles that come out of soup cans to attack the villain like tanks, cans of soup of tomatoes that make "the can-can", gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers, use parachute handkerchiefs and so on.The gags are very good and is an excellent example of a cartoon Bob Clampett. manager at this point and although he is nowhere near his best work, there is nothing to sneeze at either. This short can be found on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Vol. 3, which is an excellent set that I highly recommend. is also recommended.
