Despite some really panoramic locations in the East and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film does not quite reach the level of similar efforts by Joe D'Amato while remaining a bit shabby. The author of the original book "Emmanuelle: The joys of a woman", Emmanuelle Arsan, has directed and played a rather small role in this film, which mostly shows a very young Annie Belle pornographically while in a variety of sexual situations strange. Her boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver, actually approves of her sleeping and even convincing her to continue his practices even after two of them are married! Orso Maria Guerrini falls as a professor who is generally married with two women, one of whom is interpreted by Arsan herself. Despite promisingly starting and having some hilarious line of dialogue like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I can see you better naked!", The film runs off without a plot until the end is less than spectacular. Just like the EMANUELLE AND the LAST CANNIBALS of D'Amato, the main characters are all looking for a lost tribe, but they do not delude themselves, there is absolutely no violence in this film, and not even much sex. Just a lot of nudity and stupid dialogues. I could not help but find a little appreciation for this little film, if only for the logic of the film's runoff.
