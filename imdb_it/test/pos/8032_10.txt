The 2002 Bourne Identity is one of my favorite movies of all time. however, many fans of the book complained that the film had little to do with the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Assignment is the real deal. It is strange that no one in the "Bourne Identity" threads mentioned this film. (Well, I did it.) <br /> <br /> Besides the excellent plot, I personally found this film to be as good as any spy movie I've ever seen, with the possible exception of The Bourne <br /> <br /> Identity itself. <br /> <br /> The action is completely realistic. I particularly appreciated the training regime of the protagonists, which was very creative. <br /> <br /> The feeling is dark and gritty. There are some amazing twists. The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I can't recommend this movie well enough.
