anyone knows where I could get my hands on this video or the movie for this. I searched for a long time to show my daughter to show her and I can't find her anywhere. probably because it was only on video and never made the DVD or VHS or idk. <br /> <br /> I saw it in distant Disney in 1996 and I think it would be the best video to show. a movie so beautiful that it shows every kind of emotion during the whole movie. he also has many actors who started their careers with this film. If anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy of it and wants to sell it to me for about $ 50 or something, call 201-566-0148. thank you
