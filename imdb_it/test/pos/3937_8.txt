I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. He was only 19 and wonderful. What a pleasure to see her dance with George Murphy. The plot was typical of his times, but the dance was very special. I will never get tired of watching Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner in this film was fantastic. I always thought of Lana as an actress so good that she tended to act. The roles of Maddam X and Peyton Place would have had to dance more and less. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dance. Too bad that "the Academy" does not give an "Oscar" to dance.
