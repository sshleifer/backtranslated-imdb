I have a lot of hope for the Gen-X sequel. Fortunately, my hopes have come true. You have a lot of action, comedy ... stupid comedy and surprises. I think the newcomer, Edison, is really a hit in the movie, but I really find that Sam's Alien is stupidly annoying with English. Although the film had some flaws with the robot graphics and silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The set-up of the shares is much stronger than the first. <br /> <br /> This film is becoming more of an American touch since 60% of the film is in English from Cantonese. This film will not disappoint you. I recommended it to young 'uns who care about pure fun full of action. <br /> <br />
