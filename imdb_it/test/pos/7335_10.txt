Wow, what can I say that was a good movie, very different from all the boring remakes we see lately, the only thing I would have liked to see an ending a bit like when Jane left her husband, I guess she would go to cause of Serena she is in love with her, not only with her, but with all that she is, I hope that the producers really show that kind of final instead of letting it go to your imagination, in a sense I'll end up really hating it when I will. Air acts seemed fun but I guess you should be light and muscular, I'd like to see more movies like this, maybe you could do some sort of sequel to Jane and Serena. If I were in the shoes of Jane I would have gone for the girl she was also attractive.
