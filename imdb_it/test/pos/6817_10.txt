I was lucky enough to see a screening of this extraordinary short film by Joshua Leonard before his preview at the 2005 Sundance Festival. In twelve short but exquisite minutes, Leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial social problems and contemporary ethics that afflict our society. The film embodies elegant direction, moving performances and a harrowing story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate like the two lovers. And, in his first adventure in dramatic fiction, Leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future. I feel that this short should be expanded into a movie. It is difficult to describe talent, but as this debut film demonstrates, you know when you see it!
