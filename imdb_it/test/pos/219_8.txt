The creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker had their roots in the improvisation theater in Madison, Wisconsin, I believe it was. They had a group called "Kentucky Fried Theater" (or something similar). They put a group of their pieces on celluloid as "KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE" (1977), which was long, irreverent, sophisticated and really fun. > <br /> They followed the very popular, PLANE! (1980), which really put them on the map. In it, they took some well-known veteran actors in Robert Stack and (especially) Leslie Nielsen, and put them in prominent roles, parodying every cliché of every aviation film since John Wayne (Batjac) Production of THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (1954). * Money-filled pockets and now notice, the trio has made an agreement with Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company TV Network to make a half-hour comedy of the almost countless Police Crime Drama show that have come and gone on our TV screens over the years. Recalling the good work done by Mr. Leslie Nielsen on AIRPLANE, he was chosen as the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Like Sgt / Lt. / Captain Frank Drebbin (the rank designation switch is one of their bit comics), he presided over a great series of successive word games, sight gags, not sequencers and overlapping police / crime clichés. All of these have been put together by some seemingly standard scripts. Added to this is the overly dramatic opening narrative, expressed on information that contradicts printed visual information. They always used it in giving the title of the episode titles, in which vocal and printed titles never equaled. <br /> <br /> They had a great soundtrack, which although it was a bit exaggerated, would have passed the music in a drama as a theme and as an accessory. The musical score, the opening titles and the format of the episodes divided into Act I, Act II, Epilogue, etc. they were all part of the obvious, but affectionate, rib of QM (Quinn Martin) Productions. (They also had the same announcer of the real Q.M.). <br /> <br /> One thing that wasn't exactly too short of a series was a technically increased audience laugh. And, boy, surely they didn't need any fake. The nature of the parody was such as to require the close, almost undivided attention of the viewer, which turned out to be the ultimate reason for the downfall of the POLICE SQUADRA. <br /> <br /> With regard to the cancellation of the series, an ABC executive explained that the episodes "... required too much attention from the viewer". So, isn't that what you would like? <br /> <br /> So, after only 6 wonderfully extravagant episodes, hilarious towards the afterlife of the series cancellation, POLICE SQUAD! went, only to be reborn in THE NAKED GUN trilogy, made for the big screen in movie houses . Once again, they did quite well at the Box Office. Oh well, the loss of the TV is the gain of the cinema, thanks to you Mr. Idiot TV Exec! <br /> <br /> * THE HIGH AND MIGHTY was produced by the Duke's Batjac Productions and published by Warner Brothers. It was not available for a number of years and, finally, Mr. Wayne's family made arrangements to release it on television and video.
