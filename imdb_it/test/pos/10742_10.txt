"Kramer vs. Kramer" is a terrifying drama about an unhappy woman going out with her husband and her son. The husband must now take responsibility for taking care of the boy. While doing so, they know each other better. But then, the mother and wife come back, and she wants custody of the boy. "Kramer vs Kramer" has a lot of drama with some wonderful pieces of comedy thrown in good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Oscar for best actor for his brilliant performance here. Most people say that his performance in "Rainman", which earned him his second Oscar, is his best. It was great in that movie, but I don't agree that it's his best. In my opinion, the best interpretation of Hoffman's career is in this film. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. It's also fun sometimes. Meryl Streep, who did an exceptional performance, was not as well known when he shot this film as it is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (as best supporting actress) for her work on "Kramer vs. Kramer" as a wife and mother trying to find herself after walking with her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 when the film came out, is as wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and still today is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (best supporting actor). Jane Alexander also goes well as a family friend. She also received an Oscar nomination (for the supporting actress, where she lost the Streep co-star). "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a great film from beginning to end. Screenwriter and director Robert Benton has made an absolutely unforgettable film. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
