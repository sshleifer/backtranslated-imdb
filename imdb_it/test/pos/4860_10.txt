Most of the people who frequent this film have no idea about the great Arthur Miller novel that is the basis of it. It is a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and changes people's lives. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, Lawrence Newman is a normal man. His boss's glasses make him change everything he worked for and his whole world collapses around him, little by little. There could be no actor more suited to bringing this intelligent performance by William H. Macy to the screen. Not only is he a talented actor and screenwriter, but he projects honesty behind every character he plays. He is an everyday man caught up in his own insecurities. His anxiety intensifies when he takes a position and leaves his job. Suddenly, he has to face the problems he tried to avoid all his bourgeois existence in Brooklyn in the 1940s. He is Jewish, isn't he? The cinematography in this brilliant and suggestive film, directed with a sure hand by Neil Slavin, reminded me of some of the paintings by Edward Hopper, in particular a sequence at the beginning of the film when Newman leaves the scene from a building and the night shoots when he and his wife are followed with long black shadows behind the couple, threatening and anticipating the clash with the bullies. Laura Dern, David Paymer and especially Meat Loaf, who instill incredible depth to the bully next door, are excellent, but they are all pale compared to the stellar turn of William H. Macy (H must represent HONEST ..) If you don't have read the book, I would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more true and convincingly than Arthur Miller.
