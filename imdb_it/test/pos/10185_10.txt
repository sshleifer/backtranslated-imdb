The three-part series ended last night on PBS, which I believe was his first extensive exposure to an American audience. The richness of his text and the unique quality of his shots are the highlights. It seems very original to see and listen to an action game that uses the vernacular of Georgian England, Jane Austen's living rooms are the main example of that form of word. Yet it is the aim of the drama that overwhelms the senses that makes the picturesque language perfectly suited to every scene. Such bold exposure to an old reality is evocative of giants of literature such as Tolstoy or Shakespeare, while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a saga of C. S. Forester or Patrick O'Brian. The universality of the basic human condition is at the center. <br /> <br /> Talbot narrator played by an actor with the almost perfect name of Benedict Cumberbatch (surely not even Dickens could beat him!) He alternates between heavy jingoism and extreme vulnerability, an acting tour de force. In fact, I can't remember any false interpretation in this very fine cast. This is a tribute not only to the actors themselves, but also to the director. <br /> <br /> The most impressive element, however, is the way in which perfectly life on board a warship en route to Australia in the early 1800s is presented. This is especially true for the way in which the movement of the ship almost becomes a character itself, something that sea stories rarely take into consideration except as a background. Anyone who has ever witnessed mal de mer in person will recognize it instantly and will appreciate even more how difficult it was to recreate in the context of the shoot. <br /> <br /> Pirates of the Caribbean is not imaginative. Some effort must be spent to reach an understanding of its nuances.
