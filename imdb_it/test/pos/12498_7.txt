I'm torn for this show. While most of it turns out to be HILARIOUS, other parts of it seemed stupid to me and simply shocked by the shock. The parody of the wall of some of the cartoons is brilliant, as are many scenes with children. However, I don't think it's smart to convince children to say rude things. It's not that I think "oh poor children, they are exploited" - it's just that it's not really smart !! It is something that anyone could do, making it as simple and useless as making a paper airplane. To make this show better, they should stick to the children's natural responses, which I think can be more fun than scripts at a time. <br /> <br /> By far the most fun part of Wonder Showzen is Clarence, the blue puppet who marvels at the talking streets and annoying strangers. It's really fun and it's mostly improvised. Seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience testing the patience of an EXTREMELY patient man, was by far the most fun scene in my opinion. <br /> <br /> You should see this show because all in all it's a lot of fun, even if it's stupid sometimes.
