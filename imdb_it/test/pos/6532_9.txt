I know what most people will think of this film without even seeing it ... "The typical film of a famous singer ... It will be a pink movie, a movie for teenagers, it will be stupid ..." and stuff like that ... And yes, it's ... I mean, it's a pink movie ... But, you know what? ... THE AMATO. Seriously ... It's a very romantic movie ... I think every girl in this world has dreamed something like the 'Popstar' storyline ... She met her favorite singer, she knows him as a person ... and he even has a love affair with him ... right? ^^ I really enjoyed watching it ... Besides, it's really fun ... <br /> <br /> I think the actors did a great job ... There are many loving characters ... And, Aaron Carter (JD) is not the exception ... To be honest, in the first five minutes of watching him acting, I thought 'this will be terrible' ... But then, it really surprised me ... <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I must say that the musical performances of the film are FANTASTIC! I particularly liked the part when JD (Aaron) sings without music, (only with a guitar) a very beautiful song ... This guy is really talented ... Time will tell ... <br /> <br /> My advice to you? ... Watch it! Don't make bias ;-)
