The first time I heard about the last days was when I was renting DVDs and I was interested as a member of the LDS Church. I found this film very much and in different areas it made me cry. The reason for this is that too many years ago I met a young man who went through what Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) does in the last few days, but unlike Aaron, this dear young man did not survive the test. He ended up taking life after his church, his friends, and his family denied him because he was gay. There have been many people who don't think that the things that are shown in the movie really happen in this day and age, but the sad and sad thing is that they do it. For those of you who are gay and young, you have to watch this movie and if you are a gay Mormon you really need to see this movie. Also, if you get the DVD, there is a help listed on the DVD. Teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this film touches it, but that part is hidden to some extent. The acting and the music are excellent. This film has sold out all the manufacturers it has shown, but it has only shown in major cities and has had a very limited release, so for those who would like to see this film, I would recommend the DVD version. The only people I know who did not like the film are members of my own church and have not seen the film because of the gay and the LDS Church. Watch the movie, experience the story and feel the emotions that are shown in this film that, in my opinion, you will not be disappointed.
