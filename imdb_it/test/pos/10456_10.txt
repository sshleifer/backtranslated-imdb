I saw him in a theater in 1982. I was expecting a stupid T & A movie. This is not what I got. <br /> <br /> Practically there are about three teenagers trying to have sex. We get the expected jokes and sex scenes - but, for once, they're really fun! <br /> <br /> Yes, they are stupid but I liked them anyway. Furthermore, there has been a surprising amount of male nudity. <br /> <br /> Then the film, halfway, takes a sudden turn when one of the guys (played by Lawrence Monoson) falls in love with a girl. Then the lines stop and things get very dark. I'm not going to give away what's happening but I was very surprised by the sudden turn of events. The film brings out very important topics and treats them realistically and intelligently. And it has a really heartbreaking ending. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 10 because this is probably one of the best teen sex comedies / dramas ever made. It combines fantasy and realism together and it works! What more could you ask for? It also has a GREAT soundtrack.
