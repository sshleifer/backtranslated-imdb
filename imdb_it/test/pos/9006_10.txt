Forever strong is one of those sports movies that you can actually see. It reminded me a lot of Remember the Titans because it included comedy, sadness and simply awesomeness. I saw him at a pre-screening and all my friends liked him and they easily put him in their 2 best sports movies. The acting is great in the film. Although it is similar to Remember the Titans, there is something really unique about this movie. I feel this is definitely a worthy Oscar and will receive many awards. Everyone should definitely go and watch this movie and it's worth $ 10. I'll have to see it again when it comes out because it was so beautiful. I can't say a bad thing about the movie.
