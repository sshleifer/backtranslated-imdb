This is one of the biggest tributes to Julie's music, along with her album "Trapped in the Body of a White Girl". To quote the great Medusa "Dare to go naked, wear only underwear, you'll make a ride home every time" - Wow !!! This is good advice. "You can dance, at my party! Yes, justify your dancing shoes! ..... You are invited to the party in my pants. Yes, about boy, we dance, to the party in my pants" Julie Brown is hilarious !!! It's almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long, but every minute is fantastic !!!
