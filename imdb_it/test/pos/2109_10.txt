Without a doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of "AAA" level stars and musicians ever assembled for an estimated family adventure and "G". This is a MUST BUY for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the drama of the 4H rodeo competition for the "GRAND CHAMPION" cow with a touching and entertaining story of perseverance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams offers her typically solid performance as a well-meaning mother, but the protagonist of the show is EMMA ROBERTS, 12, whose presence in the room is as bright as that of her famous aunt, JULIA. A lot can be expected from this young Roberts-protected "as is already being demonstrated in his new successful series Nickelodeon," UNFABULOUS ".
