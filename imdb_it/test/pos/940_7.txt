I saw this movie by chance. It was shown very late, or more correctly, very early, one morning on television. I woke up and was having trouble sleeping and this movie came out. <br /> <br /> It deals with a topic dealt with many times elsewhere (it is certainly not as good as Educare Rita, despite a couple of further twists) and has a very predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Despite his obvious shortcomings I enjoyed the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of his players rather than the plot or piece as a whole. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Sam Neil and have seen him in many different films including: Dead Calm; Plan; sirens; The children of the revolution; Event horizon; Bicentennial man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park. He was very good, but he could have played this part with his eyes closed. <br /> <br /> Some recitations were, in my opinion, terrible Rose Byrne for example and some of the evasions were quite heavy (all the shipboard woman in empty lives is dressed totally in white, for example). <br /> <br /> However, two actors (whom I didn't, or don't remember, seen before) impressed me a lot Sin√©ad Cusackn like Frances (Frank) Kennedy, and in particular Matthew Newton as his son David. He, in particular, was very convincing and I would like to see him much more.
