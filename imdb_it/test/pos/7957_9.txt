I always had the idea that Korean films were about comedy and drama, but "Christmas in the fall" changed my point of view. This movie is so simple. It has no melodramatic scenes or top comedy scenes. Not a single scene where the actors scream loudly. Not even a scene where the actor and the actress kiss, not even a simple kiss. Yet this film is able to reach its viewers in ways I don't know existed. The end of the film left me speechless. I even cried, but my eyes were red. This film left me with a feeling that I can hardly describe in words. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can recommend this film to everyone, but I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see real cinema. 9.4 / 10
