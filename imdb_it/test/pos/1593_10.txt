Death in Venice is a film I have to see once every ten years. It's always different, because I'm always in a different phase of life. <br /> <br /> The film is about art, beauty, desire, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others simply annoying to watch, especially if you've seen them before. Yet I wouldn't want to miss a single frame. The music is repetitive, the main theme of the Adagietto from Mahler's fifth is used again and again. Yet I wouldn't want to miss a single note. When the last image fades, the last note dies, I remain numb and exhausted. <br /> <br /> This film is a monument to film production. As with most really good movies, the Saturday night crowd should stay away from it. And this is simply the best film ever.
