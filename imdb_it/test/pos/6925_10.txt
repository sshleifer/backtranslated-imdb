Although the plot of this film is a bit far-fetched, it's only worth seeing for performances by Michaels Caine and Gambon. The latter offers a wonderful Dublin accent. Caine sums it up ... which is exactly what the character he plays should do. Fun and entertaining, this is an hour and a half easy to observe.
