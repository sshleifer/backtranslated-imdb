The "good news" is that the circus is in the city. The "bad news" is right above the underground house of Bugs Bunny. He wakes up while his place is shaking like an earthquake, when workers hammer out the sockets in the ground and the elephants trample, etc. <br /> <br /> To be more precise, the lion cage is located exactly above the insects "hole. The lion sniffs the food, and by process of elimination, he understands that he is a rabbit. Bugs, curious about all this concerning the racket, it winds through the tunnel and ends up in the lion's mouth. <br /> <br /> To say what I'd say for BB: it's totally fearless, at least in this cartoon, and at least for 30 seconds. he comes to his senses, he runs like crazy and we do a battle between a lion and a rabbit for all the rest, once again Bugs faces a stupid opponent, one who calls "Black", but Leone is fierce and Bugs will need all his wits and a bit of a false boast to repel this beast. <br /> <br /> About half of the gags are stupid and the other amusing, but always fast, colorful and good enough to recommend. say, it's not every day that you can see a lion on a trapeze or do a hula dance!
