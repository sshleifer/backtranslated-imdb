I, for example, absolutely loved this movie. <br /> <br /> It is not a "typical Asian horror" in which you would see a creepy-looking ghost (usually a woman) that is spinning around scary people. You barely see ghosts for most of the film, but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and the characters is brilliant. This is not the film for you if you are passionate (for example, Saw, Hostel) or "surprise surprise" where something comes out (Hollywood horror, slasher film), but this film has an underlying "disturbing" factor throughout the entire movie I loved. Noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amidst the ridiculous makeovers and non-original crap that is released by Hollywood in today's society. <br /> <br /> Please don't let the filming documentary style turn you off (why not?!). It is much superior to the Blair Witch Project because, for example, acting in Noroi is brilliant and really makes you feel like you're looking at something you shouldn't see. <br /> <br /> Noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Only a few films have entered my horror Top 5; and this film contains a solid number 1 on my list.
