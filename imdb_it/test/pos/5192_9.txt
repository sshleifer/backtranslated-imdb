I found the movie very real as much as Saving Private Ryan and gave an initial bill from the German point of view. The graphic action and the individual characters gave this film a lot to keep me interested in the whole film. Stalingrad was a very brutal battle and the scenes gave this film the harsh reality of this battle. I recommend it to anyone interested in military history. This was my second vision of this film in a few years and was again fascinated by its realism. The weapons, uniforms and hearing him German as they read the subtitles gave him a lot of credit for a good military movie. In reality, being a German perspective of the battle, I was rooting for the Germans, even though they were the aggressor and the last loser of the war.
