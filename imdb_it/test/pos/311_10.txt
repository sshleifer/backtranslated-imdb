This film has changed the art of making films, telling a complex story in a powerful new way. The film blends brutal realism with fantasy, weaving a modern war with strange technicolor smoke-filled scenes. The film uses music not as a soundtrack set later, but as a practical part of the scene that plays from speakers, radio, etc. Coppola uses a piece of classical literature as inspiration, taking scenes and characters and placing them in a completely different environment. This is a difficult and courageous thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune, and takes it back so you can barely see his face. The pure gut that requires such a move is stunning and works beautifully. This film belongs to the top ten.
