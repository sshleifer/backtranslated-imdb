Valentine "Dogkiller" Dussaut and Joe "The Judge" Kern join forces to clean up the bad streets of Geneva! Chills while putting the kibosh on international heroin smugglers, Polish fugitives, voyeur of mice, unfaithful girlfriends, renegade dogs and charlatans too lazy to recycle their recyclables. Don't be fooled by the deceptive Miramax advertising campaign that depicts it as a fake artist film. This film is 100%!
