This is a solid Randolph Scott Western. Play Bat Masterson and go to Liberal, Kansas, to clean up the city. Become a good friend with Robert Ryan who played a very direct leading role. It was only after Robert Ryan began to play much darker roles. In fact, in 1947, Randolph Scott made another film that was not a western and never did more westerns until he retired in 1962. This film has a good rhythm and develops constantly until the climax. I can't say anything else like it would give the plot. Make sure you see this. 8/10
