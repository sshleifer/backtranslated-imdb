ROCK STAR is a rendition of the well-told Hollywood story, based in reality on how Ripper has become Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his likeable boyish charm and performed with credible admiration, something he was known to do after the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS. <br /> <br /> Stephen Herek, no stranger to music-themed films, takes the audience through the wonders of the stray lifestyle of an extinct species, the God Hair-Metal Rock. Wahlberg's "Izzy" acts as the master of the film that interprets the ordinary man who sees his wish fulfilled. His cute character quickly conquers the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and have the chance to give him the "goat horn sign" Metal several times. <br /> <br /> The only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, ie the other members of the band, were not enriched, or even introduced, correctly. Greater interaction with these long-time rock musicians would have amplified and made Izzy's new environment more solid. <br /> <br /> Of course, ROCK STAR is full of great music. The soundtrack of Rabin, the original work of Steel Dragon and many Metal hits of the 80s make this soundtrack a must! We all hope that films like ROCK STAR will not only give credibility to a musical style that has helped define a generation, but also aroused a very necessary awakening.
