I saw Pola X because Scott Walker composed the soundtrack of the film and I really admire his music. Frankly, I was expecting a rather pretentious and perhaps inconsistent French film. I was wrong. Watching the movie quickly caught my attention to the maximum - starting with the opening sequence, which shows black-and-white footage of military planes throwing bombs on graves to the sounds of music and Scott Walker's beautiful whining voice. The film explores the crisis of identity of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and his consequent (self-) destruction. Is the story divided into two parts? the first describes Pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house in the French countryside and the second follows his total personal disintegration after he leaves everything and moves to Paris to live in squalor with his supposed half-sister. Do both parts contain an extraordinarily stunning photograph ?? the first very colorful and bright, the second absolutely dark and almost apocalyptic - which adds to a true aesthetic feast. Pola X is a fascinating and truly unique cinema experience.
