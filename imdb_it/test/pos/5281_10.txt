Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a wonderfully animated film and a relief from the many heartless CGI made movies. Pastel and colored pencil backgrounds were a surprise after Sen in Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) and Hauru no Ugoku Shiro (Howl's Moving Castle) were so similar in style. The style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well. The time and effort required to animate this film are much appreciated as they give the characters much more life, the detail and care they require make the film much more beautiful. There are many great scenes throughout the movie that have a lot of movement and action. The biggest for me was the scene where Ponyo's sisters turned into huge fishy waves as she ran over them. The story is simple but well written and played. The plot remained focused on the relationships between characters and while it was not played as well as in Tonari no Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro) it is still exceptional. I felt that each character had an adequate amount of time on the screen, unlike Spirited Away, which was so full of distinctive characters that it could have been extended into a whole series. (The Radish Spirit. There was another whole movie right there!) My only real problem with the film was the end. The way his text in the English version makes it seem that there will be a great test given to S≈çsuke, which turns out to be the only one to promise Ponyos that he will love Ponyo. Even if putting more thought into this leads me to think that the translation might not be so precise to the real meaning since the test is the promise and that in the end really means it. It seems that the film ends abruptly. Apart from that, the film was fantastic and I highly recommend it.
