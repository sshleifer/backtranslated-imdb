William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never seems lazy and never seems to prefer to be somewhere else. In short, it is what most actors should be. "A Slight Case of Murder" is directed by Steven Schachter, who has continued to make two other great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap). <br /> <br /> Television movies have long been a dumping ground for excessive acting, bad cinematography and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to watch a TV movie that does exactly what a kind of movie was made for. To tell a little story (not a simplistic story) that does not require viewing on the big screen. <br /> <br /> "A Slight Case of Murder" is light, fun, and a great watch. <Br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
