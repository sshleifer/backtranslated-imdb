I love the Sarah Waters Fingersmith, and I was worried about the television adaptation, as I was disappointed by the BBC version of Tipping the Velvet (which although beautiful to look at was disappointed by Keeley Hawes who can't sing, and Rachael Stirling not being able to act). Fingersmith is a very well structured novel, with breathtaking curves and curves and I wondered if this could be done justice in just 3 hours. <br /> <br /> I don't need to be worried. The adaptation was excellent, very little clipped, and proceeded at a rapid pace (although I was wondering if you had not read the book, would you miss it?). He had the look and feel of a costume drama from the BBC and I kept reminding myself that this is a contemporary book. <br /> <br /> The acting was stellar. Sally Hawkins who plays her heart like Sue Trinder, and Elaine Cassidy, a slow burner, who at the end of the story was as hot as Maud Lilley. The love, the passion, the realization of the acts of betrayal that both had to perform, were written on their faces. It was a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachael Stirling is watching: that's how you play a Sarah Waters character!
