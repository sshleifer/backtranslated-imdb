Sam Elliot is as brilliant as a tough San Francisco detective, Charlie Fallon. When his partner is killed while he meets an informant Fallon, he shoots, beats the informant to death and dumps his body into a river. The following day, Fallon is given a beginner's partner and given the task of investigating the murder of informants. Sam Elliot does a good job of portraying a man tortured by the fault of his own murderous actions and by the pain of the death of his companion who may have been involved in police corruption.
