Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can express the big topic to the ambitions of the youth, but Herzog does a great job. The point of the film is to show humans, and even the world, from a non-human point of view. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into three parts: Creation, Paradise and The Golden Age. The image of each is in counterpoint to the off-screen voice. Although the text of "The Creation" (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primeval desolate land, the scene does not go beyond illustrating the myth. It focuses on waste and various examples of destruction (fire, smoke, destroyed vehicles). The images of "Paradise" are anything but, and "The Golden Age" is darkly comic ?? the highest culture is the strange musical act on the roadside. <br /> <br /> The Popol Vuh suggests that humanity is the central object of creation, but the film does everything it can to undo this notion. Its mythological structure has no referents in human historical time. There are no human characters to talk about. When a boy is with a dog in an extended shot, the initial suggestion is from the boy's point of view; in the end it is much more than the dog. In the same way the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it, and the tortoise's partner looks just human with its large fins. <br /> <br /> Stories of animals and documentaries on nature always anthropomorphized, but Fata Morgana has none. Certainly the dunes look like a female body, but the similarity cuts in both directions. Presumably only humans can easily distinguish between their creation and nature, and here airplanes and factories are presented alongside mountains, lakes and waterfalls. People and civilization are all part of a wider natural landscape. <br /> <br /> In 1979 Herzog gave a new twist to the idea when he redid the Nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.
