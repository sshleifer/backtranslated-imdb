The Cure is one of the few films I rated 10 out of 10. I mean, everything is perfect for me in this movie. I saw it almost a year ago, yet I remember many of the scenes, in particular the touching final scene that comes with the credits. <br /> <br /> The two actors clearly gave everything they could and this contributes greatly to excellent plot, which makes the movie perfect. <br /> <br /> The message is clear - friendship, and is displayed throughout the story. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to say here. Simplicity is one of the things I love so much about this movie. And of course, it's fun and moving at the same time, suitable for people of all ages. <br /> <br /> 10/10, well done!
