President Harry S. Truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the story you don't know. <br /> <br /> Seven years before Richard Rhodes' excellent Pulitzer Prize "The Making of the Atomic Bomb", the BBC produced a seven-part miniseries, "Oppenheimer", which was a study on the characters of the people who designed and built the weapon that inaugurated the Atomic Age, permanently uniting science and technology to the state (and, in particular, the armed forces), not only by making history, but by changing the world forever. <br / > <br /> The production is impeccable, the casting is miraculous to say the least, not only the main characters, but also secondary characters bear strange similarities with the people portrayed, in particular Sam Waterston in the title role of the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project, which was based in the Los Alamos laboratory, NM (the site for which he personally chose), Manning Redwood in the role of General Leslie R. Groves, who supervised the entire engineering district Manhattan eria (formal project name); David Suchet as physicist, and Oppenheimer's final nemesis, Edward Teller (who, almost forty years later, whispered in Ronald Reagan's ear and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative - "Star Wars") and Jana Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer . Attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughout. <br /> <br /> Part thriller, part love story - and ultimately a tragedy, this series faithfully recreates a chapter in the history of the world - and that of science - that we dare not forget. The highest recommendation. <br /> <br /> (NOTE: Viewers who appreciate this series will also appreciate Jacob Bronowski's 13-part series "The Ascent of Man" and Michael Frayn's BBC film, "Copenhagen".)
