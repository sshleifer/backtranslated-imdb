As already noted, the short film "Every Sunday" (1936) could be considered the first music video. This was a happy accident resulting from MGM's need to churn out a variety of short films to show off with its feature film material. They had available a couple of talented young singers (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) available and essentially slapped a mixture of musical styles in a sort of Norman Rockwell concert in the park. <br /> <br /> Who would have ever dreamed of capturing the best collection of images from Eisenstein's "Odessa Steps" sequence. <br /> <br /> It's Sunday with some inattentive people sitting around a small wooden bulletin board in the park while a tired-looking group plays Strauss. The events take place and next Sunday Judy and Deanna save the day. The opera Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (The Kiss) and Garland follows with the contrast "Waltz with a Swing". The climax combines the two styles well in a duet of "Americana". <br /> <br /> To see. <br /> <br /> Then, again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
