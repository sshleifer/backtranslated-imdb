This is the story of a long and awkward love. The daily life of a 50-year-old woman and some people around her is depicted. His daily life is so ordinary and routine that I doubted who the real protagonist was at the beginning. Then the public knows that the woman and a man who was her high school classmate had a very small connection. The woman did the same job - a milk-woman and a supermarket stall - for so long. There are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job. The man had married another woman, who is now dying of cancer. He works at the town hall and takes care of her at home. They never seem upright or speak, but they never forget. <br /> <br /> The original Japanese title means "At some time the days when you read books". But obviously when the man said "Now I want to do what I always wanted to do", it was embracing her and making love with her. He writes to a radio disc jockey that "If God gives us time to talk, we need at least an entire day". Dreaming of that day, he sublimated the desire in hard work and reading books. I personally know a woman who loved a man for long years, even after marrying another woman and died of an accident. So the setting of the story is not so special. Rather, this film well describes the untold novels in many ordinary men and women. Through this film, you will remember your love story that was lost a long time ago. This is a film with lasting effects.
