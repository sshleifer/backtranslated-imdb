Andaz Apna Apna is a film that I treasure and its only film, I don't mind seeing at any moment ... well almost at any time! This film is simply wonderful and in my opinion it is the funniest film I've ever seen! And yes, I put it on Hera Pheri ... the reason? Hera Pheri has scenes that you will watch but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you have to watch out for! Aamir and Salman share a great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes, but I will put the characters in favor of favoritism: <br /> <br /> Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (the best performance of Shakti Kapoor up to date and yes , this success before the launch couch): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to the well-known family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually the grandson of Mogambo, but for Mogambo he is more than a fascinating, beautiful, charismatic charming son. Gogo, commits the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (who as Balla had once said, "A fraud and a scam!"). Now, Gogo's only goal is to recover what is his and on his journey to recover his lost money, Gogo realizes that there are more than 36,000 that he needs to reach and start like this ... The fight of Gogo against the sinful world. /> <br /> Rank # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is the twin of Ram Gopal Bajaj. Originally called Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, as a child, had always envied his brother and then one day things got worse when his father gave all his wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father but in the darkness of the night, instead he killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's father), although Teja did not regret his actions. Teja's only mission now is to somehow get her property back and start her own poultry and bakery farm. Teja must also repay the loan to Gogo (but he has no intention of doing so). To achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, the clone and Ajit's son ... who is a very intelligent boy!) <Br /> <br /> Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): He wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena, so he sells his father's cheap sedan and leaves for Mumbai. Amar, he has no problem dealing with the great undertaking that Raveena's father will deliver to him after their marriage and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and move to London if necessary. <br /> <br /> Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the film and the way Amar tries to take advantage of it in a friend's mask is tragic. <br /> <br /> I won "to reveal other characters because Jesus Christ! I would simply not stop writing! The film is absolutely stunning! Go get the DVD now and watch out for those cheap VCDs because they have omitted many good scenes of the film. <br /> <br /> The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the last one encountered between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for this), appears in the climax Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and it teaches us a lot about life, values ​​and ethics It teaches us courage (because otherwise Amar would have asked Prem to stay behind when they went to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem complained having to go to the bathroom ???) Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes in which Salman is targeted by Aamir and is given overdose of pills to upset the stomach, the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings about because he could not go to London and in the part where Gogo is arrested in the final, without even recovering his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is overall a complete package .... relax and enjoy the journey! I bet there will be a second round later ... and then a third! <br /> <br /> The film was considered a flop and I don't think anyone liked it, but tie it up guys! This film is a great success! Although it has not had enough people to come to theaters, the film is one of the best-selling home DVDs and one of the most frequent films on most channels, so the producers have laughed their way to the banks for a long time!
