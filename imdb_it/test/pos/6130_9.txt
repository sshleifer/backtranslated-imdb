"Pink Flamingos" is a cult classic. The plot of this film revolves around the challenge of launching the supremacy of Divine as the most filthy person alive. "Pink Flamingos" contains memorable scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where Divine eats fresh dog feces. Yes, the film is shocking and fun at the same time, but the biggest laughs come from the lines of the actors. Discover this joke of the Divine above all: "Kill all now! Conduct first-degree murder! Promote cannibalism! S ***! Filth is my policy! Filth is my life!" Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Still the slogan "An exercise in bad taste" should be taken to heart and even those accustomed to gross films today could find this gem difficult to digest. Highly recommended.
