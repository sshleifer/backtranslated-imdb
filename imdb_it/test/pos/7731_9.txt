An extremely delicate reinterpretation of Shakespeare's comedy (and much more explicit than the Forbidden Planet). Cassavetes is always a joy to watch, and even more so with Gena Rowlands sharing the spotlight. His interpretation of the role of Prospero is suitable for the kind of reckless and omniscient expression that leads to history. This in particular comes to the fore in a scene in which, after identifying the separated wife and her lover in a motorboat, she evokes a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from "Go" by Stomu Yamashta). This is just one of the moments in the film where the borderline between reality and fantasy becomes pleasantly blurred and the viewer remains the feeling that magic is as possible as one might think. Add to this an excellent interpretation of Raul Julia, as well as a good work by Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film becomes a little surprise to occupy the space behind your eyes.
