I agree with BigAlC - this film prepared me for many cultural differences and practices before going to live in Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here, as always, and the film is very fun and educational . I'm a big fan of Tom Selleck, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma for this part, giving life to the film in a way that I can't imagine any other actor capable of realizing. <br /> <br /> This film saw some first-rate Japanese actors and it was a lot of fun watching them interacting with Selleck - I can imagine the fun it had during the shooting of the film - Japan is a great place to go , if you want to celebrate, see or just try to take it all.
