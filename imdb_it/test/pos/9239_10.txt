After seeing A Texas Tale of Treason, Cox's miserable correspondence efforts could not even afford the massive Stu collusion without a budget. Tell a story of dedication, sweat, wizard, fire and punk rock. I love it! My favorite parts are the interviews with Marci (she's such a hot girl and she digs me but doesn't know it yet). The Japanese employee intent on muffling his jokes, made me collapse. The sex scene was really fantastic. I'm going to see if Stu will come sometimes and he'll do the light wave thing when I do it with my woman. The intro and obviously my 5 seconds during the credits. I know this will get me chicks. I hope to see more from Antstuie because I know I can expect the unexpected.
