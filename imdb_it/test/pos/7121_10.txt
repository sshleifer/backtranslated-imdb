Players: DR is not a fantasy film, it's more like an amateur video. Horrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made prison, castle, village ...... sword, ax, shield, robe, plate ..... okok ... everything. You'll need about 10 minutes to adjust your visual expectation, so you'll get 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I come from Hongkong and it's really hard to find RP, none of my friends play RPG and I always want to be one of the characters in the world of D & D. Watch the players: DR show me what it would be like be a player. See rule books, dice, game sets, etc. Etc. etc; You hear terms like "fighter", "magician", "hit point", "level", "character", "flaming hand", "chaotic evil". <br /> <br /> What I like most is the role of RPG let you do whatever you want, not tied by the RPG software. Players: DRs provide the same element, you will not know what will happen next and will probably make you laugh until you die. The film tells both the real life of the players and the world of D & D. You will feel the player throw the dice when the character in play acts, which makes you feel really involved in the game. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil anything, but in short, the players: DR is a film to watch absolutely for role-playing lovers. For people they never play role-playing games, I'm sure you'll have fun again.
