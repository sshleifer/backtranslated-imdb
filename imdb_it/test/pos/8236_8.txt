More than 21 the film version of the Ruth Gordon comedy that detailed his experiences in trying to keep the marriage together with Garson Kanin after he joined the service, provides Irene Dunne with one of her best subsequent roles on the big screen. It is also in tune with what was then a positive spirit in America about how we would not have ruined peace as we did in the First World War and sowed the seeds of yet another global conflict. <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon wrote and performed herself for 221 performances in 1944 on Broadway and was confined simply to the bungalow that Gordon and Harvey Stephens, who was the male lead, had a training base. If you look at the list of credits on Broadway it is said that the production was "staged" by George S. Kaufman instead of being directed by him. I'm not sure of the distinction, but I can imagine that with an intelligence and a strong will like that of Kaufman, it must have been an interesting time to put together the production before opening the evening. <br /> <br /> When Columbia acquired the screen rights, Sidney Buchman had to perform a considerable reconstruction of the scripts to move the action beyond the bungalow. The film bears very few traces of the origins of its stage. <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the husband and Charles Coburn the employer of Dunne and Knox who are writers. Knox graduated not only as an editor but as a columnist. His words and thoughts help sell the paper and Coburn is at a dead end. But Knox feels he must enter the war, the seminal event of his time to speak authoritatively of the kind of post-war world he wants. This was not an unusual topic in those years. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne has some good comic moments, the kind she once had when she appeared at Cary Grant's side. In fact Garson Kanin directed both of them in My Favorite Wife a few years earlier. Coburn is his usual old boss water buffalo who eventually has a good heart. <br /> <br /> Over 21 was an optimistic picture that sad to say was not precise about what the Allies and I mean all of them could lead to peace conferences to create a better world. We still hope that a new generation is right.
