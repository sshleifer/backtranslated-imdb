Changi has a deliciously fresh script, played admirably by young and old actors. John Doyle did a great job bringing humor into a tragic true story, maintaining a sometimes sad and compelling story, particularly for those of us unfamiliar with the events of Southeast Asia during World War II. <br /> <br /> Doyle's parallel storyline bridges the gap between past and present, allowing the public to understand the long-term effect of the war on prisoners and their family's life, as well as providing the basis for an excellent narrative that completes the stories well, both individual and collective. Doyle deserves praise for this effort. In the past we have been delighted by his abundant and witty humor, as evidenced by his long collaboration with Greg Pickhaver as "Roy & HG" <br /> <br /> As the series approaches halfway, we are looking forward to how the history develops with anticipation.
