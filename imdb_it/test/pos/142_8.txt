We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen Oldboy (or the trilogy of sympathy for that subject) you're missing out on some of the best films made in this century. But I'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you would expect. Yes, it's a vampire movie, but at the same time it's also a very twisted story of romance between a priest and a girl. I will not enter the synopsis (you can read the one above) but instead tell you what this film has to offer. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this film is no exception. With some very surreal scenes supported by intense lighting, it manages to create the atmosphere perfectly in almost all the scenes. The film starts a little slow, but I felt it was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. Once things start moving, they almost don't let go until the credits arrive. "Sete" is predominantly a love story, but not in the same sense that one would think. the relationship between the protagonists is very intense, but at the same time almost disturbing. Chan-wook Park is no stranger to controversy as we know it, and this film touches almost as much as oldboy taboos. The final scene is by far the most powerful of the film, and perhaps one of the best conclusions for a film I've seen. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is an exceptional film that I think all movie fans should see. It's an exciting (and certainly different) take on the vampire world, and the romance is anything but boring or boring. This film is gritty, selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways. Obviously it's not for everyone, but it's likely that if you're reading this review you're already interested. Watch it. Do not hesitate
