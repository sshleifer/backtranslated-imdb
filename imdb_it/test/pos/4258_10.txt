Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this film portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who became CEO of a company after the death of the white CEO (white executives hate each other and fail to decide who should succeed Previous CEO ). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did! "Putney Swope" is the final blow to the American power structure. It's the kind of thing that seems to have come out of Richard Pryor's mind. This is a classic of comedy in every sense. A true masterpiece. Funny.
