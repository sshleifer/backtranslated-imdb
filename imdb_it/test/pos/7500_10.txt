36. THE HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies has gripped the hospital in Manhattan. Patients die left and right due to overcrowded conditions and ineptitude staff. When a resident doctor is involved in counting deaths, the principal medical examiner, dr. Bock (George C. Scott) is called to investigate. Having worked as a doctor for too many years and going through a mid-life crisis, Dr. Bock finds it difficult. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a young hippie beauty. His deep insights into life help the depressed Bock. <br /> <br /> Criticism: The black comedy presents a "tour-de-force" performance by veteran actor George C. Scott. He is good at playing serious and serious characters, whose rigid morals are severely tested. The first half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a pretty good account of hospital life, and chaos is sometimes. But then, as things seem set for a dramatic climax, it turns into a slapstick comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky's script had maintained its drama, I wonder if Scott would have come up with another best Oscar as an actor (he had previously won it, "in-absentia", the year before). His breaking scene (suicide) is one of the most real in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> CITATION: Dr. Bock: "... last night I sat in my hotel room to review the chaos of my life and contemplation of suicide, I said" no Bock , don't do it, you're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, life is meaningful ", then ... I discover that one of those my doctors were killed by a couple of nurses ... how can I support my feeling of meaning in front of all this?
