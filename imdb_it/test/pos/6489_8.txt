I bought it some time ago, during a massive phase of martial arts movies. Although this is certainly not the best, I love this type of film, and there was a lot to entertain in this. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, I always appreciate the fact that while martial arts training was lacking, she usually offered more than capable combat performance. He also has a nice beard. This film has a good and heroic role and although he doesn't have the ass as much as in some of his other films, he still performs well. Even the first appearances of Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are beautiful, especially due to the fact that Chow Yun Fat takes the bad guys without his firearm. He may not be a great fighter but he does it well. Eddy Ko is a bad villain as always, plays the same villain as in many of his other films and does it great, as usual. Even the guy who plays Bu is good, I don't remember his name, but he's also in Magnificent Butcher. Although the fights are not as good as those of other films of the time, The postman fights against it with much imagination, cinematic quality and a pleasantly eccentric environment. There are some very beautiful scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mix of Hong Kong talents that come together in a decent way. All in all, I would recommend it to kung fu and general Hong Kong fan action. It may not be a stylized classic like the Shaw Brothers films, or a welcome crowd like Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's rock entertainment.
