I must say that some of the other reviews of this film I read show very little understanding of it or the original TV series from which it was derived. Dad's army was a sitcom and therefore had humor and therefore is destined to have a smile on the face of the terrible situation. However, the series brought many serious messages such as the episode "Branded" on bigotry and ignorance that was attached to conscientious objectors. The film was faithful to the series and was simply like an extended episode. So I'm afraid the reviewer who claimed Columbia improved humor was completely wrong and let's face it - the BBC's sitcoms from this period beat everything that came out of America. Even the comments referring to propaganda have been very far from the mark. The Homeguards were people considered unfit for the first line service they still wanted to serve. They were very brave men who knew they had been sentenced to death as soon as they registered, since Hitler had announced that anyone who did would be executed if and when Britain was invaded. Thank you for allowing me to make things clear, as it's always nice to talk and comment on what has been seen, rather than doing it as you go along.
