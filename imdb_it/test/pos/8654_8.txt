The Scandinavians are pretty good at making me laugh at the nothing gray of my soulless life, huh. <br /> <br /> The making of the film here was incredibly meticulous, every fragment, every impassive gaze, every element of the palette color, every fragment of muzak or whooosh of those scavengers was there to hammer the calm of this world. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think I could have found the general sense of overbearing emptiness if its absurdity hadn't been really fun and recognizable. Like when Andreas is telling his boss that he misses children and looks up and that the boy is smiling halfway out the door, it's kind of a sad but true reflection of working with people, spending 7/8 hours at the day with them, seeing more of them than the people you love, but in the end knowing that in the end they don't give a damn about your problems and you the same. <br /> <br /> This may have been a movie the Coens had made if they were born in Oslo and not in Minnesota. I think their humor is more aggressive and more wrapped up in the past than cinema, but they have the same mastery of technique and their films have the same basic sense that life is rather irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I'll stop before I tell myself to take a bus to the winter desert.
