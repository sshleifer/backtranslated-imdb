This wonderfully witty dramatic comedy wowed the crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival, sparking them wild applause at its conclusion. Supported by perfect interpretations of a nuanced cast, sturdy performance by director Jeff Hare, a lively rhythm, and one of Peter Falk's best shows in years, the film emerges as a loving homage to the highs and pains of family life. <br /> <br /> Falk excels in the role of Jewish ninisys Morris Applebaum, an eccentric Shakespearean theater who decides to end his life, but not before he gathers his three grown sons and launches a "big suicidal Jewish party" . The film is full of indelible pleasures. There is the "tushy room" by Morris; The passionate interpretation of Laura San Giacomo of the cynical daughter of Morris; a rapid-fire comic dialogue that recalls the work of Neil Simon and Woody Allen; the ironic times of David Paymer, who plays the psychotherapist son injured by Morris; and Morris's patented egg creams (but be careful, drinking too fast will cause a bad brain freeze). It's all wrapped up in an intimate atmosphere of well-being set in New York. <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare proves himself a master craftsman, who has achieved memorable performances by his cast and lent the film a miraculous humanity. I was lucky enough to see a previous Hare movie: the dark and powerful "Perfect Little Man", played by Neal McDonough ("Minority Report") as a man of Los Angeles spiraling into madness. The visceral spirit of "Perfect" and the nostalgic breeze of "Checking Out" are a testament to Hare's eclecticism and wide-ranging talent. I look forward to taking a look at his future work. <br /> <br /> I heard that "Checking Out" is missing a distributor at this point. Some wise company would do well to collect this gem pleasing to the crowd, because it is a potential box office titan in the wake of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". Very nobly, it would give people all over the world the chance to experience the joys of this film.
