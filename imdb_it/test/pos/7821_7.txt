I saw this movie because of Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I loved them together on Picket Fences, so it was a pleasure to see them together again. This was not the best film ever, but it was nice. Films that are very predictable, but sometimes irrationally funny are just what I need. <br /> <br /> The desserts were fantastic, and I wanted to eat them all. I loved it when that broke apart. I bet it was still good. <br /> <br /> Costas and Lauren still had the great harmony they had on Picket Fences, and I fainted while kissing in this film. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't look at it anymore, but it was a great filler for one night.
