This show is pure entertainment and does not attempt to be a Greek drama. It certainly contains elements of one with all the twists, but it is immensely engaging and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and you will certainly never lack for material to work with! Everything and everything happens there! The actors in this show are extremely personable and you really want to see what they are doing every week. The show is also a lot of fun. Humor comes from the characters and situations. Not only thrown free. It is a well done show in this regard. I certainly can't wait for Friday night and I'm happy to have the first two seasons on DVD!
