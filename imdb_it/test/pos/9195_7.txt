Isabel has just been released from prison. He decided not to come back, but life is difficult for the ex-convict, especially if they are homeless, like Isabel. When he finds what was her boyfriend Rufo, he can see a light of hope, but Rufo is not only a drug addict, but also a person with AIDS. This will not make Isabel surrender, because, if there is a will, there is a way and she will fight for her future, to have a normal life, with a home and a family. A very hard and touching film that has gone unnoticed by most Spanish cinemas, the actors are fantastic and the story is very touching, perhaps a better treatment of the secondary characters would have made the film better, but it's really good. I highly recommend watching it, but know that this is not a Disney movie, it is difficult and dramatic.
