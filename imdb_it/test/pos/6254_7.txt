The slasher subgenre was practically sold out - in fact, even in 1979, just a year after the alleged "first slasher", Halloween was released (which was released seven years after Bay of Blood); the subgenus was not far from being exhausted; but Tourist Trap is one of the most original releases. The film follows the same basic formula as most loggers - that is, the mate kills a lot of children, but draws its originality from the fact that the madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an invisible attacker or a man in an mask) and actually have an idea of ​​his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities, including the ability to control the wax mannequins that fill his home, adds to the originality. Let's start with a great opening sequence, which sees a young man fall foul to get a flat tire after finding himself in a service station of terror. The scene is incredibly creepy, as wax mannequins taunt him and things fly off the shelves - and gives the public a great vision of what's to come; that is to say, a very creepy horror movie! <br /> <br /> Recitative credibility is non-existent as one would expect from a slasher in the 1970s, but to be honest; it's not so bad. The girls look sexy, the boys don't really count; and Chuck Connors is more than quite terrifying in the role of the psychopath. It's not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still, quite good. However, acting is not the protagonist of the show, and as one might expect, the eerie atmosphere takes that prize. The wax models, as shown by artists like House of Wax (Vincent Price version ...) are very disturbing; and the film makes the best use of this fact. There are very few things in the cinema that can be scary simply by being there - but wax statues are definitely one of those things. The special ability of the killer could easily have interfered with the atmosphere, but the film makes the most of this, even by making various things fly on the shelves and goes well with the rest of the film. Overall, this is a great movie. While Tourist Trap may not be an absolutely essential vision; worth seeing and I can recommend it.
