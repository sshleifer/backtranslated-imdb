I really appreciate what Jung-won had done before his death. Everything. I mean his choice for love is selfless. If he chose Da-rim, it will be fine for him. But Da-rim will need more time to recover from his death. Obviously he doesn't want to let it happen. As he did in the film, he chose to surrender. So it was just a temporary agony for Da-rim. <br /> <br /> As a comparison, My Life Without Me is very different. Their behavior shows a great difference between oriental culture and western culture. I can't say which one is better. Everyone can have the right to choose. This totally depends on you. Life is the same for everyone We can only live once. Any choice is acceptable if you think it is right for you. <br /> <br /> In truth the slow pace of the film cannot be the excuse to reject the film. Take it easy. You'll get more out of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean films I've ever seen. 9/10
