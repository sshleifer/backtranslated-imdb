Who else besides Troma can take the classic tragedy and change it with today's standards ???? Nobody ... in my opinion the Leonardo DiCaprio sucked one. Tromeon & Juliet is a precise trait of Shakesperan's original tragedy, but it holds up well. He is sick, insane, twisted, but at the same time insanely amusing and rewarding. For the most part it follows the true story of Romeo and Juliet, but many elements of Troma are added. Will Keenan will give a great performance as Tromeo. The acting is solid and the story is great. Many people look past these films, not just the Kaufman Troma movies, but all those they distribute. Of course, the Troma movies are an acquired taste, but you have to see some of them. It is a film reneged at its best.
