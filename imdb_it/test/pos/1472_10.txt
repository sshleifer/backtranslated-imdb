Ok, when I rented it several years ago I had the worst expectations. Yes, acting is not exceptional, and the image itself seems dated, but as I sat there, a strange thing happened. I started to like it. The action is fantastic and there are few scenes that make you jump. Brion James, perhaps one of the greatest B-level actors alongside Bruce Campbell, is as fantastic as ever. History is not bad either. Now I wouldn't want to rush and buy it, but you wouldn't waste your time at least looking at this good b-grade post-apocalyptic western.
