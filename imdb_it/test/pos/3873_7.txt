I watched this movie due to the lack of anything else at the time. The film quickly captured me with the depth of the characters and the subtle plot. I was rather surprised to see that the rating provided by my satellite provider showed no stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give spoiler to the plot or result but most of the characters have had at least redeem value. Until the last I didn't know how it would end. Frequently, you can take the formula and predict a direction of history. I couldn't do it with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it as one of the best films of this genre.
