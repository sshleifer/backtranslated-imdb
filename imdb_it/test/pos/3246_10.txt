This movie gives you more than one idiom about how Australians work. Although The Castle is a great Australian film, it's a little out there. This film is by far the best Australian film I've seen (I haven't seen Dirty Deeds yet) and probably would have been my favorite movie. The point is, if you haven't seen it, go see it. If a crime / action / comedy is your thing.
