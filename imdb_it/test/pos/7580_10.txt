I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story and get it involved in just seven minutes. I think a good movie is one you don't want to end. Eric did a great job developing the microbe character and making it look "human". I love the music and the voice used for the microbe. I can't wait to see what Eric has in store for us in future films. This is a film I didn't want to see at the end. Good job.
