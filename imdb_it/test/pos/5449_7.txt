I remember that this film received a lot of criticism from the reviewers when it was new. Letterman and Leno also had objections. Letterman called it (to paraphrase) the greatest waste of film he had ever seen, and Leno opposed the simplistic portrayal of himself. But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as a guest in his show, so it looks like he didn't take anything too personal. A re-release of DVDs, with opinions and the like from those involved, could be interesting, even if I suspect that the days when the talkshow wars have fascinated the nation late at night are gone and won't come back soon . <br /> <br /> I preferred the Letterman imitation for the Leno, but it was never possible to buy it. They never exceeded the caricature and I never simply accepted them as actors. To make a comparison: Paul Sorvino in the role of Kissinger in "Nixon" by Oliver Stone comes to mind as an imitation that may seem ridiculous in the first moments but that seemed at least plausible after the first moments of fun were exhausted. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the show for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams' speech to Letterman was not exceptional but he recalled the entry of Alec Baldwin (and his rapid exit) as Blake in Glengerry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> They could have done more with the role of Johnny in all this. I know he was mostly not involved in the events portrayed in this film, and most of the audience will know his reputation in such a way that Johnny Carson needs no introduction. But more context about why Dave and Jay and all the comedians worship Johnny would have given this film the substance it lacks to be a gossip movie. <br /> <br /> Guess I should read the book ... <br /> Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson, unfortunately, he came across something more than Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what, after watching this movie, then watching the Letterman or Leno show, all I want to do is open my Johnny Carson DVDs and see the real thing.
