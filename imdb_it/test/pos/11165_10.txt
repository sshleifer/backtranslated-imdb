When I first heard that this film would be made, I was very excited to see it. The ideas for making a film of this caliber, however good it may have been, must have been very difficult. I wasn't really sure that anyone could understand all the many extraordinary qualities of the Pope in a film, but the film did justice to his memory. In my opinion, the most important task was to reveal to the people that the Pope had started as. In his days in Poland, until his last days in the Vatican, this film followed every aspect of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, the man who played the pope in his adult life and then, did a great job of conveying the emotion. Overall this film was educational, but also a lot of fun.
