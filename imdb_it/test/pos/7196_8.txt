I just managed to find a copy of "Mission Cleopatra", which is not as easy as one might think for someone living in the United States. So far, I've only seen the first 10 minutes of the movie, and I can safely say that I laughed more in those 10 minutes than I watched the entire * first * Asterix live action movie. <br /> <br /> I am looking at the dubbed version, and while the dubbing work is a bit disconcerting, I found the film very funny and true to the book. I see that people here have said that the dubbed version is much lower than the subtitled version, which could also be true, and after seeing the subtitled version (even on my DVD) I may have to come here and change my revision. At present, however, I find it a very funny film, and it is more than compensating for the mess they made of the first movie.
