I recently rented this video after seeing "Final Ascent" by the same author. I was not prepared for the intensity of the film. I found it compelling from beginning to end, and I was rooting for teenagers to get away with their attempted crime. The finale was decidedly disturbing for some of its implicit violence, but well done. I highly recommend this image.
