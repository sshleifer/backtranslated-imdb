I would suggest that Only the Valiant is one of the most original, intriguing and somewhat strange films Peck has ever made; bold, surprising and one of his few best westerns (- no, no, of course, not a western in reality, but a military chronicle, which is sometimes better--). It's quite low budget, but, oh, very original and surprising. It is one of those tricks that a real buff sometimes gets; film that nobody has told you yet that exist. You say it "looks intriguing, or interesting" and exceeds your expectations. <br /> <br /> All in all, the script shows an unusual level of maturity for westerns ?? and somehow he reminded me, in an oblique way, of ULZANA; it is also straight without suspense. <br /> <br /> Peck looked like a young and tough man, a little dark and stoic; and there are many unexpected touches like the blonde who kisses and flirts with the one she has decided not to marry, perhaps her feeling for justice and retribution ?? <br /> <br /> Even the wise genre, ONLY ?? it's much more than a military tale, it's also an action drama, a suspense film, a commando / action thriller, the strangest combination imaginable; a group of soldiers on a special mission to counter and stop a possible native attack ?? - the crazy decision not to bring all the available troops to the place where these natives could be stopped ?? but only a handful of people ?? - and this plot never takes a crap way ?? as most would have done and done ?? The interest in humans, people and their reasons and actions never wavers. <br /> <br /> A few words about Peck himself; he performs with brio, and although I usually find his famous films rather bland and boring, in such small exits I find all of Peck's dark and even chilling charm intact. It was an unusual star. <br /> <br /> I gladly recommend this extraordinary film.
