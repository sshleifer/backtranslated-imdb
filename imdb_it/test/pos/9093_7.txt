Flatliner's basic premise is quite simple. Several medical students get to the point of death to find out exactly what the brain does during the event. It seems like something a crowd of bored students would do for a joke, but it forms the basis of some very disturbing substations. In today's world, where Hollywood has to conquer foreign markets for ideas for making a horror film, Flatliners is one of those rare gems that show that Hollywood can do something different when it tries hard enough. <br /> <br /> What separates Flatliner of many films based on this premise that will come out today is that it does not bend to be condescending or arrogant. Flatliners recognizes that people go to the cinema to be entertained, not moralized. In this type of supernatural thriller, the difference that this moderation produces is truly incredible. What is even more incredible is that Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or proving she can only play Julia Roberts. The theory of darkness, which performing artists do their best with the smallest audience, is in effect here. <br /> <br /> The subplots about what the characters find during their loss of practically everything that makes them alive, and how it comes back to intrude in their present time, are surprisingly well done. The moments when the character of William Baldwin finds his collection of personal videotapes coming back to haunt him are particularly intriguing. The fact that William Baldwin seems so perfectly chosen in the role says a lot about both the script and the direction. I'm not sure which one. <br /> <br /> Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, really shines as a protagonist. One really feels for him like the mystery of what past experience is intruding into the present and why it develops. As the character of Kevin Bacon goes to find a pier of the old school whose life has made hell and tell her how sorry he is, it becomes clearer what the movie is about. We can try to change the past as much as we want, but it is what we do with the present that matters most. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of Flatliners is how you get an atmosphere without the use of expensive, elaborate visual effects. Unusually for what is essentially a horror movie, Flatliners didn't spend his budget in places where it wasn't needed. Much of what we see during the most surreal sequences is a case of professional fiction, photography of simple makeup or repertoire material. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the film, it is that you feel about ten minutes too short. The ending seems more superficial than conclusive, as if someone in the studio were asking the director to wrap the film so that he could take it out at a given market moment. Of course, many films have been left with sore points for this very reason, so Flatliner shouldn't really be different. The one hundred and fifteen minutes we get are very satisfying, though not too bright. <br /> <br /> I gave Flatliner a seven out of ten. Works well as a date movie or a kind of popcorn movie late at night. Apart from that, it occurs to me that low-budget horror shows weren't always sad pieces of trash.
