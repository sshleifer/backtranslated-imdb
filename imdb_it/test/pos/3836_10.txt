"Balance of Terror" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the movie "Enemy Below" (played by Robert Mitchum), a film that deals with a cat and mouse game between two captains during the Second World War. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play a similar game with a Romulan ship. This is the program that notoriously celebrates war-hungry Romulans, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. It's an incredibly suspenseful episode, built strictly for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add further levels of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his debut with Star Trek as Captain Romulan (later he will play Spock's father, Ambassador Sarek). An unmissable episode!
