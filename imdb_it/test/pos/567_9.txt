I saw this movie with my mother. She is 81 years old and was raised to become a bigot. He even recognizes it. I don't think she really understood what was happening, she had already decided that the boy was guilty. Frightening. I have tried for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. This is the true faith. Return to the film. I was disgusted by the police and their ineptitude. I'm so happy that this public defender was chosen to work on this case. It was fortunate for this family to have a person who cared enough to see through the crap that was given to them. I could tell when one of the cops was lying. He would not look the defender in the eyes. His eyes moved sideways as he answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person should be punished because of the color of his skin. I read the book on the black man dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I can't remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites do whatever they want with blacks. I'm sure the child in the film will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comment from her. I want to commend the director and producer of this film. I feel that the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I'm a passionate indy film viewer. I feel that they are well written and have substance. I'm glad I happened to take this movie on the shelf. I felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly I feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society.
