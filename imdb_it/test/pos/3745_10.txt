Before talking about the ending of this film I'll talk about the plot. A guy named Gerald breaks his engagement with Kitty and runs to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months, Kitty and her aunt venture into Scotland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty discovers that Gerald has aged and that he has become worse. Gerald has some rules for the castle (the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald doesn't want them to stay, but Kitty insists on apologizing. One night his aunt sees the monster crossing the corridor. It scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) they have to stay longer. Kitty becomes more worried about Gerald after she tries to enter the maze, but Gerald surprises her and is even worse with her. Kitty then sends reinforcements, calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his broad. So to make things not look suspicious, they invite another couple of friends (who actually do nothing). Blah, blah, blah Kitty and her aunt end up in the labyrinth where the greatest suspense in history is. Somehow they separate and try to find each other again. But my aunt stumbles on the creature ... here it is the moment we were all waiting for, what is the creature lurking in the shadows? ... is a giant frog !!! OMG what could be better! After seeing the aunt the frog literally gets mad and runs, oops I mean jump up the stairs to the top of the castle. The frog jumps out of an open window. Then we go for a shot from the ground and we see the frog leaping towards us (oh yes, this movie was in 3-D). But you want to know what is funny the frog that falls out of the window is actually a toy because it is 1/10 of the size of the frog before it makes the leap. It is then revealed that this was all due to the evolutions, blah, blah and Kitty and Gerald got married. So the last shot of this masterpiece is that of the tomb of the frog in the labyrinth, the only place where it has ever been really happy;).
