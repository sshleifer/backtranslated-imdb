I've seen some movies in my time, but this is great. You'll have to see it more than once to really appreciate it, it's emotionally very complex, it explores love and passion in its most extreme moments and its cinematography is simply breathtaking. The character of the Count is intensely passionate and tragic without having to raise his voice or leave his bed, the film is perfectly fused and perfectly acted. The film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection, which is rare these days. Combine action, love, tragedy, drama and politics all in one. This film is not to be missed, all the clamor that surrounds it and all the prizes cannot begin to do justice. An affectionate greeting to Michael Ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is based.
