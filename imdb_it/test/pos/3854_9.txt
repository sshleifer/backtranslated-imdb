This movie is fantastic. I loved it. <br /> <br /> This film is about a mother cat named Dutchess and her 3 kittens. Dutchess and kittens love music. They have to play the piano every day. But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and his kittens try to get them to sleep. But it fails. They Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. Cats break into the song. With the song everyone wants to be a cat. Thomas loves music like other cats. Thomas and Dutchess like each other a lot. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and I like cats!
