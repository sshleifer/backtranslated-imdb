I feel privileged to have seen this movie by accident. Actually I found this movie by mistake. One night I was recording another movie on Showtime during the night and this movie came later. So I sat down to watch it and the boy was wiped out. The acting is absolutely superb. Kathy Bates ... who has been my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes gave an outstanding performance as a bullying mother desperately trying to keep her old school values ​​(religion, family) at the risk of alienating her family. Martin Sheen is as superb as the "hard" patriarch who does not really control anything in his life or family. The only thing I really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes return home. Show the real damage being done to our soldiers after fighting aimless wars to gain a political and financial advantage. This film upset me and I feel lucky to have accidentally recorded this movie and seen it. This is a must for anyone who wants a real drama, this is not too melodramatic and beloved, but it attracts your heart strings like no other
