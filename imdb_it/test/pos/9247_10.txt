All the trials and tribulations of making a film without a budget directly from the mouth of the people involved. You feel all the sweat, courage, determination and dedication that Stuie has put into this work of love and the frustration of being hung up after all her work. The interview clips with all the actors involved offer a fluid and transmitting narrative, such as the ball-out, the hardcore punk, the almost anarchic attitude that was necessary to film "Waldo" and later the documentary. Stuie and company deserve all the props in the world to not give up when the going gets tough and get "A Texas Tale of Treason" so we can see what it's like for the budding director on the street!
