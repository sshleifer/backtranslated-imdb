Blade is probably one of the best vampire / action movies ever made. It has everything: action, horror, blood. This film is for action fans. It's that you like it a lot or you hate it and if you hate it, it means you don't like action movies or vampires. Wesley snipes takes his role seriously and he is the perfect boy for the blade
