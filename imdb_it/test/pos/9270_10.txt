There are so many episodes that make me howl about the stories <br /> <br /> that I wish I could choose the best ones, Rocko and Bill do for a strange couple that is beyond help but manage to play the victim and BS the their way out to drag Dan into their criminal life. <br /> <br /> Canadians will notice the strange joke for Toronto or the federal government, and because the CBC has dealt a really good show by Frantics that Dan was part of, the show takes them back and in the episode "Dan's Umbrella "the CBC is raked between the embers. <br /> <br /> When Dan says that CBC would never waste taxpayer money on a useless business, Rocko enters the room and returns Dan with his Tape of Friday-Night with Ralph Benmurgue, this show was a flop and most people wouldn't understand the joke unless they knew the history of CBC to do shows to people who didn't watch or taste the good shows they watch
