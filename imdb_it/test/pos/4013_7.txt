Oh, I remember watching this show at 4:00 pm during my junior days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I did my homework. <br /> <br /> However, the show caught my attention when Alex showed his special powers and faced the typical problems of the junior class. <Br /> <br /> But the show was not just about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational endeavor for a younger audience to be more interested in school and biology in general. <br /> <br /> The lead actress (I don't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) produced a fantastic performance. It made the show watchable. <br /> <br /> They simply don't do shows like this anymore ...
