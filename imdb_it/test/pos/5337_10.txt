A great animated film that reaches the level of old hits like "The Lion King". <br /> <br /> I went to see him with one of my best Belgian friends, who also watched the series on TV. I was lucky because I didn't know that people in Belgium knew about "Wallace and Gromit". <br /> <br /> When it started and the good old theme started, he started bringing me memories of me watching him when I was 5 years old. <br /> <br /> The humor itself was a lot of fun. Some nice scenes in sitcom style, some word games or simple jokes. The animation is not so impressive if you know the series but it's still fun to watch if you notice how it is performed. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: not only can it keep my happiness and fun, some of the humor can easily please old people, so I say: go see "The curse of the werewolf" as soon as you can.
