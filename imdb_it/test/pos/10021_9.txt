A gem from a cartoon from the silent era was rediscovered by CARTOON NETWORK, and was probably broadcast for the first time in decades, if ever. <br /> <br /> What makes this pleasant is the various cameos ... Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitoes; Will Hays makes a visit as "head" of Static Studios; as well as the appearances of Chaplin, Keaton and William S. Hart. The image of the chewing gum that decimates the shoes of the population (an idea to make money for the head of the seller of Felix, almost bankrupt) cannot be described: it must be seen. A formidable cultural gem.
