Peter O'Toole, one of our best actors, is as magnificent as a reserved school teacher who is dedicated to teaching young boys. Meet a show girl and fall in love. The story is of love and devotion. Petula Clark adds spirit and sensitivity, does not even mention a remarkable voice. You will like this movie even if the ending may not be happy. I liked it.
