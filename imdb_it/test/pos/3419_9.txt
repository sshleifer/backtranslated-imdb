Where this film differs from the traditional Hollywood film is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe, for example, we have had years of war and although one nation can never eradicate the other, old enemies always ended up living next to each other or with each other at the end of the conflict. In the United States, the white population of immigrants exterminated the aboriginal population until extinction. the US citizen never had to live with his enemy. This explains, in my opinion, the often simplistic nature of the Hollywood film when trying to explain the conflict of a foreign country. But in this film, the director and script didn't fall into this clich√©. It turns out that everyone in history is right and wrong. it is a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.
