For those too young to remember, or too old to have been part of the "advertising campaign", Michael Jackson's fashion in the early 1980s was at a fever pitch, like the clamor on the Titanic, except that he didn't let go. Every song, every video, every word Michael uttered was important. Nothing like this had been seen since the Beatles' golden days. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this video for the first time, on a roller skating rink. Everyone stopped skating. There was no doubt that you were a fan of Michael Jackson or not; you were. Everyone crowded around the projection screen and watched the video ... <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the longest music videos ever made, and certainly the best. He always gets the n. 2 on the MTV videos of the 100 best annual videos (the # 1 is always the flavor of the month, and somehow the # 1 of all time has slipped past No. 2, to make room for the new # 1 figure.) , and Thriller has become a phenomenon in and of itself. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, you have to watch the video; not just the excerpts shown on MTV or VH1. If necessary, you should look for Making of Thriller in a video rental store. Hey ... your parents probably made you watch Beatles and Woodstock movies because "it was important" ... well, that's important too.
