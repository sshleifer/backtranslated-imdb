I was ten when I saw Subspecies, I immediately got the impression of Michael Watson and Laura Tate, they really have a lot of chemistry on the screen in the early parts of the film. I ordered a copy in 1993 from Full Moon and learned this: Ion and Rosa, the servants, have much more important roles in the script with the king. What most people don't know is that there was an alternative sequence that should have happened in the final scene: Michelle and Stefan find themselves confined to a room and Michelle has the idea that Stefan turns her into a vampire to help fight Radu and his former demonic controlled friends. However, for one reason or another, the scenario was never realized on the camera. Another scene from the script, which can be confirmed by the original trailer, shows that Stefan drinks blood from a wolf, or actually in the trailer you see him coming with blood on his chin. <br /> <br /> This film gets a 9 because it's one of my childhood and I have good memories of the characters; although my favorite characters were Stefan and Michelle, I think Anders Hove's Radu is pure feeling-evocative acting, so much feeling in his work there.
