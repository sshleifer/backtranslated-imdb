The first, and much better, of Kevin Kline's two gay roles. (The second is the depressing "De-Lovely" in which he plays Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks' emotional acceptance speech for "Philadelphia" in which he came out with his school acting teacher, the film nominated in this version was obviously more "Forrest Gump" than "Philadelphia". Here the character of Hanks is played by Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> The reaction scenes in most of the film are very funny and, as has often been pointed out, are particularly effective as Kevin, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck himself (a brave move since he was himself the target of such rumors, which he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the future girlfriend eventually abandoned. <br /> <br /> The current teacher of Tom Hanks criticized the graduation scene by saying that people do not act that way in real life. But this is a farce and not real life. That being said, it's not as effective as it could be and the wrong direction of the final "wedding scene" that makes it look like Tom and Kevin are about to get hitched I found rather useless, annoying and a cop. > <br /> The highlight of the film for me is, of course, Kevin's scene with the How-to-be-a-real-man audio cassette and is hilarious but certainly not entirely realistic when the tape reacts to Kevin actions. <br /> <br /> Overall, a real hoot!
