This was a very faithful presentation of Lewis's life in the mid-1950s. The dialogue on theology and the jokes with his later colleagues was exceptionally good. Michael White's book, "C.S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia" deals with this period in a very parallel way. Joss Ackland's acting was superb in capturing the intrepid Lewis. The film required great efforts to be presented in an accurate English setting. The development of a strong bond between "Jack" (his favorite name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, son of Joy from his previous marriage, was pleasant to watch. The film avoided the unpleasant element of the problem of drinking "Warnie" Lewis (Jack's older brother), but he wouldn't have moved the story, so it's best to leave it out.
