First of all, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I have to say that I expected more comical situations than I had. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrait of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly interpreted and uniquely interpreted by him. Furthermore, Gheorghe Muresan (like Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on the spot, he has the world turned upside down. He never expected that he would find the only person who could change his life. Sammy's and Max's journey is unique and moving, sometimes even fun. Furthermore, the position in the Czech Republic, where parts of the film were shot, was absolutely beautiful. I must say that this dramatic comedy made me feel a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and would recommend it to everyone.
