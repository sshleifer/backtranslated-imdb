This is not really the best Canadian film of all time, IMO. I will not go down the track and I will name 3 or 4 better. Only a couple of nights before I had seen "The Bicycle Thief", the most voted Italian classic, and there are some parallels. Both directors shot their film at a specific time and in a specific place, with minimal resources in terms of sets and casts. And the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to watch for the realistic setting and for the characters alone. Persistent strokes on faces and landscape make it worthwhile to look alone. That being said, this is not enough in the same league as the Italian classic. The film is shot in a cold and desolate mining town of Quebec's asbestos. This frigidity is in contrast with the warmth of the people and the attention of the director Claude Jutra. Basically, what you get is a series of cartoons that are probably nostalgic memories of Jutra - it doesn't have, it's funny - but moving, and probably sometimes difficult at the moment, but now heated with the patina of nostalgia. The film unfolds; there is little tension. Somewhere around half or two thirds the story begins. Everyone you've met up to this point is involved and you've learned about these characters pretty well; so be patient at the beginning. The story is good; will let you think, and involves sex, love and death, all the basic elements. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, all that sort of thing, you won't be disappointed by this.
