In fact, the nature of the entire series is incredibly fun! But not always fun ... there are moments of extreme intensity while the deepest aspects of human emotions are touched. <br /> <br /> Again and again, the comments of the series on the fragility of human nature and on long life, or in this case eternal, struggle to overcome them. Monkey is both intelligent and stupid, his arrogance and confidence in his martial skills lead him into trouble in almost every episode. Pigsy is simply normal. Sandy has a philosophical mindset. He has many of the wisest jokes. <br /> <br /> The English translation is a delight. "Ignorance can always be improved," Sandy says in his relaxed way, "but you can't do anything to help stupidity!" "Who are you?" the group of travelers is asked. "We are three kings of the East," says Monkey. <br /> <br /> This is not just for children, it is a magical party for anyone who can suspend reality
