Dolemite is fantastic. Rudy Ray Moore's ruff kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is as close as possible to becoming a parody of a genre without actually being a parody. Citizen Kane this cannot be neither Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly brilliant in its own right. The production values ​​in this film are so bad that they could qualify as special existential effects. The plot drags a bit in the middle, but the power of such an inexpensive premise as the kung fu battles is enough to get all movie lovers out of the world. The infamous ever-present boom microphone evokes the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood's hues and never becomes little fun. Sometimes I wonder if the boom microphone was left on purpose as a comment on the ridiculous aspects of the films in general, but I usually get distracted by the erotic scenes that lack eroticism up to the high life of high art. Everything is a lively and frantic film, which drips with a desperate desire to be both loved and outraged. It works. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
