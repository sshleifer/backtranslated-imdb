I just want to say that this film was excellent. <br /> <br /> I loved it from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The acting was great. The director has done a fantastic job and I'd like to see him again. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly performed very well, the guy who played her father (Manny) was another great actor, BUT I CANNOT RECALL HER NAME. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for El Padrino II. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa looks so good and I think he is one of the most talented actors around. There is a multitude of Latin actors who do a great job as shown in this film! <br /> <br /> Rent It !!! Rent it !!! Rent it !!!
