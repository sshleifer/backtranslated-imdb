The opening scene of this film is truly incredible. I saw a number of science fiction films with great special effects but my roommate and I looked at each other after the opening sequence and he said clearly: "sensory overload". The plot of the film is pretty simple, but the great thing about this sci-fi movie is that it allows the public to understand most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to explain it "subtly". Even the creatures of this film are very interesting. Don't look at them really well up to about two thirds of the way. Overall, a very funny movie.
