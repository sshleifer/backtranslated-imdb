Black Scorpion is Roger Cormen's Batman. Which is nice and there are many interesting things in this movie. As if the Breathtaker were a cross between Doctor Doom and Darth Vader, it's a bit cool. The mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the Mad Hatter. The C-movie B style is all this puppy which is not always a good thing. There are lots of stunts and sexy girls to make any action fan happy. This film, good out weighs evil. But if you are not one for the comic films, then I would advise you not to watch Black Scorpion, however if you like comics like movies and you don't care if it was a comic book before. So take a look at BLACK SCORPION, since for me I give them 8 STARS.
