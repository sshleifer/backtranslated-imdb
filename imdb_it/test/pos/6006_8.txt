I saw it for the first time when I was a teenager in my last year of Junior High. I was nailed to it! I appreciated the special effects, the fantastic places and the test aspect and the flashback method to tell the story. <br /> <br /> Several years later I read the book and while it was interesting and could absolutely see what Swift was trying to say, I think that while it is not as perfect as the book for social commentary, as a story the film is best. It makes more sense that it's a long adventure to have Gulliver back after each trip and make a profit by selling the little sheep Lilliput or whatever. <br /> <br /> It is much more interesting when everyone thinks it's crazy and the sheep still make a cameo. As a side note, when I saw Laputa I was stunned. It looks a lot like the Kingdom of Zeal from the videogame Chrono Trigger (1995) that made me even more like this miniseries. <br /> <br /> I saw it again about 4 years ago, and I realized that I still liked it a lot. Really high quality stuff and started an excellent series of Sweeps miniseries for NBC that followed him with the solid Merlin and the interesting Alice in Wonderland.
