An astonishing and careful observation of modern life for young people in Japan, Like Grains of Sand explores themes such as rape, homosexuality and pubescent anxiety in a subtle and meaningful way. It takes a look at the youth culture that struggles to define itself outside the confines of its parents' generation, with its strict conformity and facade. Typical of Japanese cinema, often what is not said is more important than what it is, so for those who are not experts in Japanese cinema and culture, be careful. It may seem boring and minimalist (almost like every movie that comes out of the Japanese Mangas bar) if you don't know what to look for. I saw it for the first time when I was 15 and it was what originally aroused my interest in Japan, it's culture and language. Considering that I am now 22 years old and learning Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years, it goes without saying that it is a powerful film. To enjoy!
