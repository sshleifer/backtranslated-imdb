This is an OK adaptation of Dan Brown's breathtaking book. I can't say it's new or very beautiful, but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent history, the result could have been better. The film is quite long but in the end I felt like some things were missing. Sound effects and soundtracks were very good. The acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who haven't read the book, things might seem too fast. From my point of view, instead of trying to put all the material in the book, they could have tried to make the most important scenes. What makes the book very good is the whole plot of the puzzle combined with the excellent portrait of the Vatican. You don't see anything else in the movie. Too much hurry and using time not in a positive sense, these are the main problems of the film. So, it's worth watching, but could have been done better.
