I saw Jimmy Stewart in all normal roles, but the "Spirit of St. Louis" was reported as one of his favorites. A poor performer at the box office when released, this film has been largely forgotten today. Telling the famous story of Lindberg's famous flight in 1927, Stewart seems to be initially little known and his known voice never lets you forget who you are watching; it looks like George Baily again. But Stewart obviously worked hard for the role and did everything right, so soon you don't care anymore that Stewart was 20 years older than the man he plays. Stewart's Lindberg is so gluttonous, all-American, a nice apple pie you get caught in history, and you realize that Stewart intended to portray Lindberg with all the aw-shucks, the Yankee know-how he could muster about. Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the United States, and Stewart seems determined to keep up appearances. <br /> <br /> Flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is really a rather boring story going on, and I was struck by the subtle references to Faith that were missing in the film; Lindberg tries to teach a desperate priest how to fly, only to be confronted by the priest about his beliefs, or Lindberg refuses to bring a St. Christopher medal to save weight on the plane, only to find the hidden medal in his lunch bag after crossing the Atlantic. For me, this is a film not about the epic journey of a man in the unknown, but about his awareness that this life is much greater than the things we can see and hear.
