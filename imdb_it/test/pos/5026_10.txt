honestly, I loved Michael. even though there were "Give me a pillow I need to take a nap" parties, it was nice. I think everyone has done a great job in this movie. and nora ephron is in my list of directors "ok". <br /> <br /> it's nice to see John Travolta like a pot-bellied angel. it's not very often I see one in a movie. some people might call it a boring film, but for me I loved it. angels and all
