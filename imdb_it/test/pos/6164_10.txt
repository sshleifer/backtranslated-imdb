Absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all time on so many levels. The hardware addicts will stun for the biggest single cluster of flying Spitfires outside of a re-enactment of the Battle of Britain. No less than eight flying spits are at hand for highly accurate land and air sequences. <br /> <br /> Those who marvel at the passion of flying and get the flight from above where the veiled eyes will identify with the reverence of the central characters for the freedom to be fast, free and high in their blue world dark. Be careful: romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very exciting ride in this film. The main message is that shared by many war veterinarians, as their best hours, their period of life in which they felt most alive, was actually during the war, when everything else was sad and gray. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the Czech pilots who flee their country when the Nazis invade and join the free Czech RAF squadron. There are some subplots, which deserve special attention. This is just a simple old super movie that will love even the most passionate anti-hardware romantic (keep the Kleenex at hand). Beautiful photography, first-rate acting, accurate details of RAF life during the Battle of England. Easily a candidate for the collection of personal DVDs of all aviation enthusiasts.
