It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and cheerful humor of this year's family film ... Grand Champion. The story of a 12-year-old boy (Buddy) who with the help of his sister, his mother and best friend is determined to raise a Grand Champion beef. It is an extravagant journey for the great competition. After crowning Hokey Pokey, Grand Champion, he is auctioned for $ 775,000. pay for college education for kids. Buddy finds out that the next time he sees Hokey ... he would be on a sandwich! The boys conspire to steal the winning beef, promising to save it from the barbecue. This is where the fun begins ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Natalie Maines, Steven Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman and so many other stars create the background for all the antics. You won't believe who actually won the beef at the auction !!! (looks beautiful with a mustache) The soundtrack is full of tracks by George Strait, Natalie Maines, Willie Nelson and others. Where else can you meet movie stars, Country & Western stars and Rodeo stars ... only in Texas ... only in Grand Champion. <br /> <br /> It's a small "simple" film masterfully crafted that could be the best movie you see this year. The film opens in certain cities on Friday 27 August. 2004. <br /> <br /> Another great film by Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions is IN A WHISPER. Keep an eye on cable networks for this!
