Burt Reynolds has directed this action movie and (surprise!) Is actually a good director. This film starts well while Burt's attempt to sell off a drug dealer has failed, and he is relegated to the vice team. The ensemble cast has some pretty funny scenes, as Brian Kieth always eats something, Bernie Casey has more class than all his collaborators put together, and Charles Durning loses control of his team. <br /> <br /> The deputy cops stumble into an expensive price ring that could have something to do with a series of murders. Sharkey spends his days beating Dominoe's apartment (Rachel Ward), and he really starts to worship her from afar. <br /> <br /> Just when they are approaching the crime leader, Dominoe is killed. I won't give away any of the surprises in the plot, but the first hour of this movie is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script becomes very clich√© and incredible later. <br /> <br /> Why would Burt Reynolds face the crime boss with his big secret? Sure, he makes the boy sweat, but he makes many other policemen get killed. And it is not credible that Dominoe and Sharkey would make love after meeting for a day, much less while their lives are in danger. And in the end, what happened to all the police running in the building with our heroes? Isn't there a SWAT team? Furthermore, the film never actually tells you how all the bad guys are connected, and why they have to kill so many people. <br /> <br /> There is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the film, which is probably the only really disturbing scene in the film. It is a pity that the climax is a typical shooter. However, this movie is definitely fun if you like action and crime movies. Don't think about the holes in the plot, and you'll have fun.
