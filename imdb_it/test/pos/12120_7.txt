One of Fuller's early works (the same veteran of combat) of medium quality, but strikes with precision the many conflicting aspects of life in post-war Germany. The main character starts the film in Apr'45 as Sgt with C Co, 157th Inf, 45th Div, which actually ended the war in Monaco as in the movie. (The same unit had fought heavily in Aschaffenburg the previous month and then freed up part of the Dachau facility). For those not well informed, the film may seem confused with the flip flopping between showing the good and evil of the German people. But whoever was there or at least read it well would know that most of what is portrayed in the film are things that really happened in 45-47 Germany. The only inaccuracy I noticed was minor: while on a boat cruise on the Rhine, passing the remains of the Remagen bridge, he commented that he crossed there. But his unit actually ran very far south of it - north of Worms, in Germany.
