With a film starring the twins Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen, nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema. What you get, however, is a fun movie that is easy on the eyes and the brain. There are a lot of Hollywood-style vampires (not hopping Chinese bloodsuckers here), pretty girls, good heroes and the time, sometimes very funny. And Jackie Chan. Of course, kung-fu depends a lot on wire work and CGI. Of course, the script reminds you of Blade. And of course, the whole thing is immediately forgettable. <br /> <br /> But for a really fun piece of movie fluff, you would be very pushed to find better.
