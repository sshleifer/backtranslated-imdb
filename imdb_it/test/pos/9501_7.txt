No more beef and canned cabbage for her! <br /> <br /> This small romantic comedy follows from one scene to another with some exotic twists (some imaginary scenes and a costume party). All this is centered on the wife of her husband (s) who is trying to get out of stasis, played by Gloria Swanson (she's twenty here!). Both protagonists have a natural air that is convincing and, of course, Swanson is perfect in all kinds of moods, from frivolous to worried to hopeful. <br /> <br /> Behind all the games and the apparent carelessness there is that old serious problem of being in love and not getting lost in love. There is a bit of a bad mood, but director DeMille is on top of keeping it snappy and credible in everything. As with many films of this period, subtitles not only tell what they are saying (or think), but often give a kind of philosophical insight, almost to justify the tragedy (or racism). And here is a higher purpose, probably better without the didactic text, but it's part of the narrative style, and it's a bit bizarre. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for visual or formal astonishment, you will not find it here. But like a story, well acted and shot with precision and economy, it really is a great example. The events may not be a total surprise, but it is such a modern love story, set almost a hundred years ago, it is a gas. And did I see that Swanson was perfect?
