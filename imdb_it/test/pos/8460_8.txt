Although the premise of the film implies a "coincidence", all the actors do a worthy job and look great bringing the story to life. I found myself rooting for the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, empathizing with both and wanting them to reconcile. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson also do well in their roles, doing a decent job with the stereotypical relationship of friends. While history tends to jump over time, sometimes leaving the public perhaps a little hungry for missing details, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. This interesting plot has all the elements for a good "chick flick".
