I love this movie. The chemistry between the two leaders Miller and Carlisle is incredible, they light up so well from each other, creating an unlikely Duo comedy. Alan Cumming is hilarious, his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he plays it. The acting is superb and it's a really fun and moving film. It is not the greatest film ever made, I admit, but it is great fun, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy the other gritty British films. Includes some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you can't go wrong. Look for the cameos of David Walliams and Matt Lucas of Little Britain and Rock: Profile fame.
