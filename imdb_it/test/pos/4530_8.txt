This film is a funny story of private eye detectives as if they were no longer made. It's all there: Tom Conway is the sweet detective called The Falcon, Goldie Locke (what's in a name) is his weird, disconcerting companion, Louisa Braganza is the damsel in distress, and of course there is the maid, the professor with the secret formula, the villain who wants the formula, and the police inspector looking for The Falcon. There's a murder and The Falcon gets involved. The scenery is of nightclubs, expensive hotel rooms, a luxury train, suburbs and beautiful cars. Go and watch this little gem when you see it go on TV in the afternoon!
