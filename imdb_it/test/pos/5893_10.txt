Sometimes, but very rarely, a film tells a story so well that it becomes almost difficult. This film tells several stories so well at the same time that they were the first times a film I couldn't see until the end. It was too real ... and the SO STRONG characters that saw it became a personal struggle. Seeing these three men and their families face their difficulties, one in particular, often struck me too much. Now, I looked at it in its entirety without interruptions several times, and I realize what I have always suspected. This film is a masterpiece. The writing, the acting, the fusion of different stories without being in the least moved, all of this film is exceptional. Seven Oscar Awards? No wonder, it certainly must have earned them.
