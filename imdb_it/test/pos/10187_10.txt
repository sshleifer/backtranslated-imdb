It's not a movie, but an experience! <br /> <br /> It's not the usual eye candy I thought it would be. Too many things happen at the same time, your senses almost don't make it. A cutting-edge technology product (we were divided between sitting and enjoying the show and wearing our 3D glasses to decipher the magic), the music is fantastic (it's a concert!), The Disney characters are inside (and you come in be part of their world), it's fun, it's magical, it's exciting - I know it's starting to look like an ad - but it's really cool! Beats Christmas to bring out the child in you! <br /> <br /> This attraction alone already makes it worth going to Disney. ;)
