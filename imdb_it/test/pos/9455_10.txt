If you have not seen this film than you need. Shake and watch it. It's so fun and it's gonna make you laugh out loud !! so you have to watch it and I've seen it about a billion and a half times and I still think it's fun. so you have to. yes, I memorized the whole movie and could quote it from start to finish. you have to see this move is also nice because it's half the movie. if you don't look at it, then you're really missing out. This movie also has nice kids and this is always a bonus. so, in summary, watch the movie now and trust me you won't make a mistake. I said that music is good too. So you should like it if you like music. This film has been properly evaluated and will work for everyone.
