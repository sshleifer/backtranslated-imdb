This is a typical Sandra Bullock film in which she plays a mousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble but finds a way to survive and be the hero. Does it sound familiar? <br /> <br /> There are many holes in this story. Things do not add up and a little suspense is a bit trivial. But - that suspense is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story that has a strong paranoia that runs through it. The story begins slowly but starts early and stays that way, making it an engaging movie for the viewer. This is why I give it a pretty good rating - the movie involves you. Bullock is nicer than annoying, which is normally for me, so this is my most voted film with her.
