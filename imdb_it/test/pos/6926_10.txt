I know this film has had a pretty tough run from the critics, but I have to say I liked it a lot. The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. He never fails to be both exhilarating and convincing in all his various disguises. He also manages to radiate a sweet charm that belies his scandalous pratfalls. A special mention must also go to Michael Gambon, who plays for laughter with an incredibly precise and moving Dublin accent. The only weak link is Caine who, despite having a good laugh that softens him, plays the character less interesting and more unpleasant. It probably won't sound so good overseas, but it's worth looking at the same.
