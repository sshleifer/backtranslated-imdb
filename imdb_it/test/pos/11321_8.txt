"Dirty War" by Daniel Percival, a BBC production made for television, was recently screened on cable. The film has a documentary style in the way it goes after the people who caused the near holocaust in one of the great metropolis of the world, London. In fact, this film, produced in 2004, is almost a warning about the events of the following year, in which terrorists placed explosive devices in public transport that killed innocent people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. /> <br /> The film impresses with the rhythm that the director and the production team gave to the project. There are no boring moments in the film as we watch the preparation of the terrorists and the people who are following their dirty work. Although the inevitable happens, it is surprising to only think of what the consequences would be if a real "dirty bomb" were planted in such a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The latest film images have a chilling effect. The scenes of the crowd and the way the whole area is contaminated transmit chills of fear, thinking of how it could happen anywhere.
