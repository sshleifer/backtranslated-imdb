"Unconditional love" begins with a great promise. As directed by P. J. Hogan, the film works great until the last third of the film, when it falls to the surface. The screen starring Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse showed a myriad of possibilities that end at the end. It seems that the art team behind the film had high hopes that it might sound different. The reality is that this is a film that looks in different directions on how to bring it to a resolution that ultimately fails. Don't get me wrong, the film is extremely attractive and will resonate with a lot of audience. <br /> <br /> Based on the strong cast, we decided to take a look. Kathy Bates, of enormous talent, is the perfect choice to play Grace Beasley, the woman who finds at the beginning of the film that all is not well in her marriage. Ms. Bates is an excellent actress who deserved much more, even when her character is not helped by what the authors did in the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett is always reliable in distribution. His role, as the lover of the late Victor Fox, is well written, until Dirk is induced to come to Chicago to find Victor's murderer. It is bizarre and escapes all the rules of logic. Dirk doesn't seem able to hurt a fly, let alone hunt down a killer with the help of Grace and his daughter-in-law, the incredible fun, Maudey. <br /> <br /> As played by Meredith Eaton, this little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things about the film. She is cheeky and tells her how she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best actors working in films these days, has nothing to do with the film; is completely wasted. Even Dan Aykroyd has nothing to do. We see it at the beginning and end of the film and its Max doesn't make sense. He seems to want changes in his life and in his marriage, only to return to grace without any explanation, all forgiven. <br /> <br /> British actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better opportunity like the hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing bland songs. Julie Andrews makes a fun contribution in a couple of priceless scenes. <br /> <br /> Ultimately the TV show hosted by Sally Jesse Raphael is a turn off and adds nothing to the film. The best part is listening to Kathy Bates while singing. What a beautiful voice she has! Indeed, Mrs. Bates is the best excuse to stay until the end.
