Having just borrowed the DVD collection of the One series from my somewhat obsessive brother, I expected to pass the first couple of episodes and return it to him. I just found myself screaming at the screen for finishing the first season on an overhanging hanger - just a week later and saw the whole season. Where I found the time for this I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This show is fantastic. He doesn't take himself too seriously, he has nice characters that are well-starred, and the special effects (ignoring the odd vulgar puppets here and there) are "special" enough to give him that shiny touch. At first, I didn't realize it was mostly shot here, and it seemed strange to hear so many Australian accents in a science fiction show: it was great fun for the main character (John) to return to Sydney halfway through the first season. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest strength of this show is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had. They gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that explained the previous actions and continue to spread John's conversations with jargon in a fun and unforced way. Beyond that, after seeing the entire Voyager and Next Gen series, I see a small intrusion in the plot - so he managed to keep a sense of originality throughout the first season. I hope the rest is just as good. <br /> <br /> Farscape is not like any other Sci-Fi I have enjoyed in the past. I heard that the fourth season was not as good as the first three, and now I'm quite annoyed that they canceled it before the 5th. I hope they revive this show - with the same actors in a movie or another series. It would be a shame to leave so many unfinished lines of the plot, because I imagine that with a show that has been thought of so much, having it cut without an adequate warning will make me feel robbed. <br /> <br /> go now ... back to my brother's place for the second season. <br /> <br /> V.
