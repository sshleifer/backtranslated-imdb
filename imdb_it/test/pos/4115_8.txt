I really enjoyed this movie, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important to show them the life of the other, besides Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. Since this film needed to show Bobby a cold and vengeful person. <br /> <br /> I agree with another review that was a sick love, not a true love. He didn't need to do anything to kill his wife as a child. He should have been honest with her and told her he was sterile and decided to adopt a child together. Some reviews say she was naive, I think it was when the adoption came, but the best actors in the round. Great movie to watch !!
