The red powder is well acted and well made, but what the film is about, I think it bores many viewers like it did to me. There was a film that had previously been called "in my country" with Sam Jackson and was not so well received and both films were almost the exact same thing, I think Red Dust was better because of the more interesting interpretations especially of the future Oscar winner Chiwton Ejofor, but the plot is just missing, it starts pretty strong but then the film hits viewers with countless and uninteresting classroom sessions, this could have been a great film if the writing wasn't that bad. But see if for the performances.
