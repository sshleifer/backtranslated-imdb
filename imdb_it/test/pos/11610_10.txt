I saw this piece of perfection :-) during the filmfest fantasy in Berlin and when I left the cinema I felt like "drugged"! I have seen many movies, but there are some that I would call perfect as koyaanisqatsi or fight the subconscious cruelty of the club is definitely one of them !!! half of the people came out of the Berlin screening and I can understand them absolutely! this is not a film for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! a person who lives in his dreams day after day without wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this movie! if someone reads this now who has seen s.c. and he also thinks it's fantastic: contact me, for the moment I haven't met anyone who shares my opinion, it would be nice !!! this film earns 10 points out of 10 !!! I'm really sorry for my bad English, I'm not a studied person !!! (und das ist auch gut so * g *)
