Being an independent director of Long Island myself and having had two movie releases under my production / direction belt I was always told how much I could learn from watching a production of FRED CARPENTER, so I was lucky to have his " Eddie Monroe "" as my initiation to his superb budget, production, casting, setting and masterful talent as a director. My heart went to his characters, it's a story and was completely conquered by the final trick / switch that led to complete the plot of the film! The locations have been wonderfully chosen and the human emotions in his characters have brought a realistic link to my connection with all the elements that Mr. Carpenter has used in everything, for the benefit of him and his film!
