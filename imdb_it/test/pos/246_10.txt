This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. The glorious Technicolor shows off the beauty and spectacular hair of Rita Hayworth. He should have made more color films, but then Columbia was unable to spend money on Technicolor ghosts. <br /> <br /> Rita is a WOW like Rusty Parker - she's more than keeping up with Gene in some of the brightest numbers ever. She also looked beautiful in turn from century clothes, so she was given the opportunity to play the grandmother. <br /> <br /> The film opens with "The Show Must Go On" - it sounds fantastic - but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maurine (Lesley Brookes), is determined to improve herself and is going to audition for Vanity's Golden Wedding Cover Girl Competition. Rusty also happens to be at the auditions. In a very funny scene, Maurine has just had an audition and seen Rusty, gives her some advice on how to impress the judges !!! "Don't be shy and modest - chat and glitters". Rusty does it tastefully !!! <br /> <br /> They decide on Maurine and go to the show to see her, but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) is still having nightmares about Rusty's audition. "Whose Complaining" presents Genius (Phil Silvers) and the dancers, dressed as working girls - (Rusty is a taxi driver). <br /> <br /> John is remembering a long lost love (Rusty's grandmother, Maribelle Hicks) the first time saw her sing "A Sure Thing" - set at the races. Meanwhile Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local restaurant. Then they launch into the most cheerful song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "Make Way For Tomorrow". <br /> <br /> "Put Me to the Test" is a number of songs and dances with Danny and Rusty. Meanwhile Rusty was chosen Cover Girl and Danny McGuires' is the place to be seen. Lee Bowman appears as Danny's romantic rival and puts things on hold. Lee Bowman is probably the most boring protagonist ever - so Danny never needs to worry. <br /> <br /> Rusty (nicknamed by Martha Mears) sings "Long Ago and Far Away" and is danced wonderfully by Danny and Rusty. The clothes Rita wears are beautiful. Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling designed them. Danny wants the best for Rusty but he's afraid he'll lose her. Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the issue "Alter Ego" where he dances with himself. <br /> <br /> "Poor John" is another look back at the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and it is extremely amusing song that makes fun of rich relationships - Hayworth looks great in an extraordinarily dressed characteristic. Look for Al Norman in both "Povero Giovanni" and "Una Cosa Sicura". He was an incredible eccentric dancer, who appeared in several early musicals, including "King of Jazz" and "Paramount on Parade". It was easy to spot. <br /> <br /> The "Cover Girl" dance is simply wonderful. Rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. After a flock of beautiful models parade through the covers of the best American magazines, Rusty breaks into a beautiful golden robe that dances down a ramp for the captivating song "Cover Girl". Damn, I love this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
