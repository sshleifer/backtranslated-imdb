This is a film about passion. The passion he describes is largely misdirected, even for the protagonist. But here is the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe can be contaminated by absurdity, and can even lead us to do things that are destructive - to ourselves or to others. Moreover, those who try to escape the acquisition of passion (look at the drug addict who visits the studio) also risk self-destruction. <br /> <br /> The world needs to hear the message of this film more often.
