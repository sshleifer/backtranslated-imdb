People have often been uncomfortable with "The Merchant of Venice" because of his anti-Semitic arguments. Fortunately, this film avoids it, opting instead to show how anti-Semitism reigned supreme in 16th-century Europe. The story, of course, is that Antonio (Jeremy Irons) needs money to help Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) ask for the hand of Portia (Lynn Collins). He gets the money from the useless Jew Shylock (Al Pacino), who asks for a pound of Antonio's flesh if he doesn't return the loan. When Antonio cannot repay the loan, Shylock is determined to get his due. <br /> <br /> We expect this cast to do a good job, and will not disappoint. It is yet another testament to what a great actor Al Pacino is.
