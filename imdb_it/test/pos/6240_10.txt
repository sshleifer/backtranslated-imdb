Is fantastic! Everything from the score - to when the role of the final credits. This film is a masterpiece. It's really creepy and its hysterical environment is enough to give everyone goose bumps. It is clear that the film was NOT rushed and that David Schmoeller (who later collaborated with Fullmoon in the puppet puppet series) had a clear and concise image of what he is trying to direct. The professional aspect of the film is surprising considering it is a relatively low budget. It is based on fright without effects (mainly due to budget restrictions) but still creates an atmosphere full of tension. <br /> <br /> Stephen King stated that this was one of his favorite movies and I can't seriously blame him! It's one of my favorite horror movies and it always will be. This is my favorite Fullmoon movie and it has been since I first bought it a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> Money Well Spent! I own both VHS and DVD versions. <br /> <br /> 10/10
