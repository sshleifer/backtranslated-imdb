Look ... I've come to expect this level of acting from William Macy ... the boy continues to perform in formidable performances ... but MEAT LOAF? Just when his weakness decided to leave Jim Steinman behind and throw his decidedly lower weight into Stanislavski's wonderful world? Well ... what can I say? I am duly impressed. To paraphrase an old adage: "It is not meat, it is emotion" ... and the Sandwich is quietly polishing his acting chops late .. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern plays the look 40 perfectly here ... great job for the costume and hair departments ... David Paymer is typecast but right in the money. The camera's solid work throughout the film. The plot is similar to "Gentleman's Agreement" (post-World War II anti-Semitism). It's worth your time ... especially for the growing legions of Bill Macy's acolytes. <br /> <br />
