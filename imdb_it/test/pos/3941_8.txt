are you crazy or what? this film has talent who are you to criticize a film that was made by famous directors and producers? I mean you are looking at a crappy version because if you had a correct version you wouldn't think it is a low resolution graphic. <br /> <br /> this film is for people who love hongkong cinema on the other side what Asians love to look at .. you are such a fire sale .. hongkong cinema is completely different from Hollywood, hk il cinema is in a class of its own ... <br /> <br /> so if you don't have fun watching hongkong producers' movies don't go and loaf about how it's a waste of time to watch .. let other people enjoy the movie .. <br /> <br /> and personally I saw this movie and I love its story and the way it was made ..
