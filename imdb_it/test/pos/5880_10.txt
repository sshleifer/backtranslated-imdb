I was speechless when I saw "The best years of our life". The acting, the script and the direction of Maestro William Wyler (winner of the best director in 1946) is Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This film is about three World War II veterans returning home from the war and reuniting with their loved ones, but facing the difficulties of going home from the war. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar role) returns home to find his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and the children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are larger and different than before leaving for the war. <br /> <br /> The second man Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews) must find a good job and return home to a wife who had been married for 20 days before leaving for the war. Begin to discover that she is not the same. <br /> <br /> Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his Oscar role) lost his hands in the war and must confront his family's boyfriend and girlfriend 'Wilma's (played by Cathy O'Donnell) reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands. <br /> <br /> All these men and their families are brought together in the film in different scenes. The stories of these men are all beautifully woven together. <br /> <br /> This film truly defines the meaning of a "Classic". This unforgettable drama (winner of the best photo of 1946) is a film that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If asked to choose a favorite movie, this would be it! <br /> <br /> Out of 10 I would like to give "The Best Years of Our Lives" to 10. <br /> <br /> So the next time you go to your local video store rent this movie you don't sorry! <br /> <br /> NO unpleasant material a good family movie.
