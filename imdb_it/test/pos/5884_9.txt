Many great talents have been used in "The Best Years of Out Lives", the result must be somehow miraculous. Think about what his director, William Wyler, faced; in the aftermath of a military victory over the statist powers that had committed abominable crimes and engulfed the world in battle, he was making a film that claimed that the leaders of the United States were deeply anti-individual - that they had "lost their best years of those who had been drafted or deceived in fighting the war - that since ignoring the rights of individuals had been for nothing outside of the discussions about the degree of slavery that men had to exist under ". There are beautiful sets by Julia Heron, the cinematography of Gregg Toland and a script by Robert E. Sherwood, author of "The Road to Rome" and other defenses of individuals against tyrannical ideas. The ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael in a large-scale but thematic drama. The clever plot was the experience of "couples" after the soldiers (three in the light) tried to return home in a "culture of victory". Their bitter experiences and their realization of their need to fight new against what was happening on the homefront puts a strong and sober counterpoint to the conventional notion sold that "it was all right with" America "." March and his wife have a terrible period of adaptation, and he is drinking, O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life can also be worth living, and the worst wife of all Andrew throws it for a guy with pasta and has lost years, making employers ignore or deny his rights to a job his individual merits, to also have what he had before he was torn from his life and pushed into the arena of risk - for nothing, and for the loss of everything he had ever had. The shocking climax of the film comes when each of the three has to face the n to fight again, each for his own happiness; and all three manage to find the courage to continue fighting - each for their own happiness, which is now threatened by a curiously anti-self, indifferent and un-American anti-reality of the United States. Directed by Wyler, in particular of the scene where Andrews sits in the cockpit of a B-17 in mothballs, alone and Russell's wedding scene is really wonderful. This is a very powerful and great movie in its own right, a woman and a man can agree for once. The music of Hugo Friedhofer and the costumes of Irene Sharaff add to its splendor. One of the best and most unexpected films of all time, in the splendid black and white.
