This film, a first William Wellman, has an important message, particularly today. The idea is that sometimes there are more important things than your personal safety or your well-being. The film, starring Walter Huston, is stolen from the performance of "Chic" Sales by Grampa. He is the most completely drawn character in the film and a joy to watch. You will recognize some familiar faces if you watch many films from the 1920s and 30s. Wel worh your time to watch if you get the chance. Recommended.
