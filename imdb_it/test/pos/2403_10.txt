"The next Karate Kid" is an exceptional film full of adventures and new surprises. It has a wonderful and moral plot that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job as Julie. I saw the actor who plays Mr. Miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The film is fun and fascinating and I can't stress enough how interesting the film is. I definitely call this a 10 out of 10. I suggest the film to anyone who loves a good movie.
