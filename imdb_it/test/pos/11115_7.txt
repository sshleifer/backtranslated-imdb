I expected the movie FAME to be an uplifting film, but the opposite is over. The general plot that follows the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has strong potential. However, FAME builds his characters beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when it's over. I was very surprised when the graduation scene appeared - we thought the DVD was skipped or something. All the characters have internal and external conflicts of some kind and practically none of them are solved when the film ends! You may think there are too many characters, but probably too many scenes. It is clear that the film has been cut and shortened because it sometimes lacks a transition. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I really connected to his character's ambition and his heart. Boyd Gaines like Michael, the poor student stereotype who can't read but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I didn't particularly like the character of Coco from Irene Cara, but it's not the fault of Cara, since her script is weak and her character is not detailed. His voice is beautiful and hearing his songs deserves to watch the whole movie. In summary, the film could use many improvements, but quality actors and great music earn their place in the history of cinema.
