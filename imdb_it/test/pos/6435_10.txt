OK. Whoever ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all cut their throats. This "film" was an absolute and total filth. What the hell was going on with the bizarre eyes of the old bags? Seriously, were you in some kind of horrible drug and did you just like to think you could control people? He was running with his evil evil eye and was it like? Do I have a booger out of my nose? What are you looking at? Are you like the sea witch or something? All in all though I thought the graphics were top notch. Only for this, I would give a ten. But just cover your ears when you look at it. The pure and complete evil that comes from that film will make your ears bleed and your eyelids will fall. Who knows? You could even have a knot in your small intestine. You better watch the fools out.
