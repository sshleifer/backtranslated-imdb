A real respectable rumble event <br /> <br /> 1. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 A very strong opener ... the edge heel performance was as sublime as it was during the rumble event .. overall id say EDGE NIGHT .... <br /> <br /> 2. Undertaker Vs Heidenreich CASKET MATCH <br /> <br /> 7/10 a lot of people hated this rivalry although I liked it, I thought Heidenreich had really played his character well. the game was not surprising for the excitement until kane and snitcky were involved. It will get better as it continues. <br /> <br /> 3. Kurt Angle Vs Big Show Vs JBL (WWE CHAMP) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 a surprisingly good match, as there was only 1 thriller in one ringtone in it ... angle obviously .... ..very good title matches .. good rhythm .. although a predictable end. But it's not all predictable real rumble games. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (WORLD TITLE) vs. Randy Orton WORLD TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 actually not so good for the guys involved, it went on too many dry areas , orton sold his emotion surprisingly, but ended up being something of an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> 5. ROYAL RUMBLE EVENT ... btw during the other games there were some segments ... two that were really fantastic ... dinner rapping on Christian and guerrero stealing flair number 30 ticket entrance. the event was good 7/10 would have gotten a 9 if dinner won but unfortunately my biggest enemy batista wins (GOOD I UNDERSTooD WHY '...) goes down and takes a drop and the whole arena is likely to burst out laughing .
