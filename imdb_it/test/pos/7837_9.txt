I found the episodes fascinating and well written. As a TV show, it was fun that is what I expect from an imaginary entertainment. I like the "relationship" between the professor and his female security guard ... although sometimes her Scottish accent makes it a little difficult to understand what she is saying. I was hoping there would be more than four episodes. I recognize that a commentator / reviewer of this series had comments regarding his medical opinion. I understand this gentleman's comments; however, this is an imaginary television series that aims to entertain ... not to present precise facts like a documentary. Patrick Stewart behaves well and makes his character credible. If you want to see a documentary, this is not the series for you. But if you want to see unique scientific theories in an entertainment-based medium, you'll enjoy the four episodes.
