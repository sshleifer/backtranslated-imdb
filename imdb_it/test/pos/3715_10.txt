Two Soldiers is an excellent example of film production. The director and producer took a compelling story and brought him to life with a very experienced and dedicated cast, excellent photography and a very creative art. <br /> <br /> The relaxed lifestyle of the brothers was represented with great details, and in stark contrast to the militaristic lifestyle in which they were inserted. The interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a harsh but peaceful life in the woods of North Carolina and an even tougher war life. <br /> <br /> The acting was great, particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful perfomrance of the Colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was extremely well done. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers and I highly recommend it to audiences of all ages.
