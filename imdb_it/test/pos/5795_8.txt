A gritty presentation of the decadence of family values ​​and human dignity in the wake of Soviet communism, Vasili Pichul's 1988 film Little Vera is a landmark film of modern Russian cinema. Pichul's brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of sterilized idealism promoted in the Soviet era (as in the Circus of Aleksandrov), abruptly shifting the social chaos of his time into the public spotlight. A contemporary Ukrainian setting further intensifies the effect, first from the immediacy of the film to its period of time, secondly from its use of a local not only in a struggle for identity in place of a Soviet system, but also as a a nation distinct from the Russian idiom that had dominated the Soviet Union <br /> <br /> Vera, the protagonist and protagonist of the film, is a rebellious teenager with a "dysfunctional" family that includes a hard father and a consummate mother . Rejecting her would-be boyfriend Andrei, Vera begins a destructive (and above all sexual) relationship with a university student named Sergei. Despite his parents' dislike of the lazy Sergei, and despite Sergei's rough contempt for his parents, he moves into their cramped apartment. Tensions intensify until Vera's father stabs Sergei drunk. Vera must decide whether she will remain faithful to her intolerable family by testifying that her father acted in self-defense or continues to support and defend the ever aloof detached Sergei. <br /> <br /> Unbearable almost in every way imaginable, Little Vera captures and masterfully communicates the inescapable void left in social life after the collapse of communism. The sexual aggressiveness of the film (it was the first film to show explicit sex) combined with the inexorable presentation of social reality (a clear distinction from the socialist realism required by Stalin) effectively addressed the conditions of ex-Soviet life. More interesting, however, was public reception. While many wrote hate letters to the director and star, the film was very popular. Here emerges the dual nature of the "film as social criticism": if done correctly, the film will make the audience uncomfortable. Since no simple solution presents itself, some viewers will hate the film and the directors to "raise" the problem. Many films come to mind somewhat comparable in this regard: Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korine's Gummo, even popular films like John Hughes's Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> I commend this film to those spectators for whom the prospect of nearly two hours of internal conflict and unbearable social miasmas is not overly daunting. The film is absolutely beautiful and incredibly challenging. Despite the difficulties of watching the film, some moments in it are deeply beautiful. Of course, the historical-social and cultural significance of the film cannot be overlooked, and in fact it works as an even more assertive reason to watch this film.
