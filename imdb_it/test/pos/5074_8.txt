Think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting and taking a position on US foreign policy, the Extraordinary Rendition process involves hiring people suspected of terrorist activity in a foreign country, an opposite to extradition, if desired, in a place where torture it is not a crime but a means to illicit information. Instead of staining your soil with the blood of potentially innocent parties, you do it on foreign lands where such tactics are accepted as interrogation techniques. <br /> <br /> Of course, given the gravity of the tactics and attempts to bring down a person, sometimes you get what you want when you overcome the resistance, or you get nothing, or worst of all, you get a confession just because the mind has been violated to the point that the subject will agree with whatever you say. It's a bad process, and what better way to do it when you're the champion of human rights, making the sign of using whatever means necessary in the name of protecting more lives, in an age where information is the key to the battle against terror, and do it in a country where the rights record is probably questionable. <br /> <br /> Revenge is this year's Syriana, although in the period preceding the new year we have a number of contenders for political thrillers to win that crown, with Rendition first of all, followed by the film Robert Redford Lions for Lambs, with Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, though now on the other side of the fence), and The Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, although this would probably be more driven by action. Directed by Gavin Hood, who made Tsotsi and will lead the new Wolverine spin off, Rendition is a decent thriller with a first-rate cast, in a narrative that has proved very popular these days - the split, which involves a wide differential perspectives to be presented through a cast of ensembles. <br /> <br /> Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer, is turned into a route to return home under the orders of the CIA Highest Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep). In a detention facility outside the United States, Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA analyst, Douglas Freeman (so prophetic), embarks on his first interrogation session, no doubt finding himself in a position for which he has not signed up. Back home, Reese Whitherspoon, very pregnant, frantically searches for answers to her husband's disappearance and seeks assistance from Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), working for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin). Pulls in J.K. Sinmmons, an investigation into a terrorist plot and a love story forbidden between Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), you have a lot of stuff in a busy photo. <br /> <br /> Given a number of launches, locations, timing and the like, Rendition was not at all confusing, and behaves with skilful manipulation of the material, never quick to judge, presenting ideas and thoughts on both sides of the equation. Each character has his own agenda, and the presentation of this agenda is challenging enough not to bore or confuse you. And the best part of everything is how, very sincerely, they yield to self-preservation in different forms, and in the end, in various situations of defeat, unfortunately. He kept guessing too, or maybe not, and constantly played with your mind that Anwar deserved what he's getting. He exploited an extremely clever sleight of hand that I didn't see coming until it was too late (so the credit goes), even though he succumbed to the usual stereotyping of terrorist militants, and without spending much time in depth to explore their reasons . <br /> <br /> Maybe he didn't find the need, since so many movies out there are already touching the base on this theme (Paradise Now, Day Night Day Night, Syriana too). Even though it turned out to be rather one-dimensional (personal tragedy until the bombs were arrested to become a kamikaze), I felt that Rendition was right not to provide any sweet, mushy end, that this struggle against negative and destructive ideology is not something which can be dealt with in a two-hour film, and I am glad that he clarified such fabulous implausibility. <br /> <br /> What we have instead is a well-made story that puts its gun visions on the issue of Rendition, and probably quite capable of provoking discussion once the lights are turned on, in which field you belong - you support that does it inflict severe pain on interrogation? Yes or no? This is the quintessential question of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I'm already oriented for Lions for Lambs)!
