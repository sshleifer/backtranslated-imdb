Cheerful and elegant science-fiction / horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose latest game - "eXistenZ" not only attracts the attention of those who volunteer to try the game, but one that almost kills her (and her game). Since she is forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is blocked with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing apprentice ("PR nerd") as her bodyguard, even though she only has a gun made of flesh and bones and bullets are teeth Director David Cronenberg has, well, used some parts of his previous films ("Videodrome", "Scanner", "The Fly", etc.) and put it in some parts of the story with good timing. Law and Leigh are doing well here and so are some of the supporting casts (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston and so on) that has an international touch. Dafoe is anything but diabolical like Gas, a deceptive garage mechanic. One of the best scenes in the film is to testify that Ted eats (fish and frogs) and builds a gun and admits to Allegra - "I can't do without myself". "eXistenZ" manages to show that he (Cronenberg) is up to his old tricks and still works like a spell.
