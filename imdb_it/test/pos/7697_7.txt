Seems to have been made as a vehicle for W.C. Fields and Carol Dempster and dominate it. Fields has already developed his cinematic character. Carol Dempster seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of Mary Pickford, who has also worked extensively under D.W. Griffith. Typical of the later Griffith films technically. <br /> <br /> It was later reworked as Poppy (the original title) with Fields in the same role.
