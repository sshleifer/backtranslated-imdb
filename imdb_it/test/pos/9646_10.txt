I felt compelled to give feedback on this movie that I rented from Blockbuster. This film has it all - comedy, drama, crime, suspense and "realism". <br /> <br /> This film also had a lot of action with the right amount of humor! I will definitely watch it again! There were some fun parts and an action packed drama. I like movies that are asking you what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The writer / director, Travis Milloy, should make more movies !!! In my general opinion, this film was fantastic! I can't wait for your neighbor to come! Travis Milloy has a real talent as a writer and director.
