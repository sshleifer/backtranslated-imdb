SPOILERS AHEAD ?? For the first ten minutes or so of Star Witness we are presented with a typical quote from the urban American family in a city without a name, which is another way of saying the version of Warner Brothers in New York. Except for small children, including charming Dickie Moore and lively Sally Blane, they are a rather depressing group, and their conversation at the dining table is boring and we want the story to move and bring the star, Walter Huston . But wait, people, wait. Suddenly a serious gangster movie action is unleashed, which draws the family against their will, and after this baby never gives up. There's suspense, an Oscar nominated screenplay, good acting; whatever you want the old movies to be, is here. I question the performance of Chic Sales; it must be an acquired taste, but its presence is crucial for the plot. He got a special status in the credits, so the Warner Bros. must have really been in style in Sale, but the way his crude, old routine suited the audience is something that is lost to me. Perhaps it is lost in the period of time, an unknowable factor that you had to be a spectator of 1931 to understand. Furthermore, the climax is typically melodramatic. Nevertheless, this is now the best result of the study in that year that I have seen so far (however, I've only seen eight of them, so maybe it's an inconclusive view). Not to be missed when TCM shows it. 8 out of 10.
