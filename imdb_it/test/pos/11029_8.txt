This is one of my favorite movies, dating back to my childhood. Set in the remote wilderness of Siberia at the beginning of the century, a small community is unleashed when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to come down from the mountains in search of food, preying on the surrounding farms. In this atmosphere we are introduced to Avakum, a hermit hunter, who lives in the wilds, as he arrives at the village to sell his annual catch to Boris, his close and rather unique friend in the village, who runs a memorial. At Boris's request, Avakum accompanies Ivan, his friend's arrogant son, in the hunt for threatening tigers. Personalities crumble and spirits light up as the older and more experienced Avakum criticizes Ivan's amateur methods, a meeting also noted by other hunting members. On the second day, hunters sight their prey and hunt. In a dense forest, Ivan wounds one of the tigers, which then attacks the unlucky man. Avakum, seeing Ivan tangle with the angry beast, shoots, but accidentally hits Ivan. It kills the tiger while it flees. The other hunters arrive on the scene, suspicious. <br /> <br /> In the village, the doctor works to save Ivan wounded. Avakum tries to leave the village, but is confronted with Ivan's friends. The trapper sweeps them away anyway and accelerates with his dog-drawn sled. The young villagers swear to him that they will come for him if Ivan dies, which he will later do, but before he dies he explains to his father that it was an accident. The old Boris, after discovering that his close friend escaped from the village, straightens the "lynching" group and leaves after Avakum, to find him and fix things. And so the main story begins. <br /> <br /> A simple film raises the conflict between man and civilization against nature, mainly the struggle of Avakum to survive alone in the desert. The winter landscape is very well filmed. Perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by Jimmie Haskell. Very sentimental and evocative, the main theme recalls Adagio by Albinoni. Other movements reflect Russian styles, as well as a couple of folk music pieces. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is not available for purchase, to my knowledge, which is rather a shame. The copy I own, recorded by TV almost twenty years ago, is slowly deteriorating. This film is a must see for those who can appreciate it, if they can find it. 8/10
