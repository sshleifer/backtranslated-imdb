This is certainly one of the best films of Mel Brooks, along with Spaceballs (although I will openly admit that I haven't seen many others, at least so far). It is very foolish and very funny, there are no more than a few minutes during the entire two-hour period when you are not entertained. Almost all the gags have a great comic effect, some of which fall flat. I saw this film immediately after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two fake films, I realize exactly how high quality this film really is. It's fun from beginning to end, none of the comedy is exaggerated or boring. The music is wonderful, as is the choreography of dancing and fighting. Acting is practically what you would normally expect from this type of film ... Elwes is a great comedian and makes a good Robin. The plot is typical of Robin Hood, more or less everything that is legendary is suitable for this film (and also for a spoofed one). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of silly humor, or you're just dying to watch a good parody of the Robin Hood legend, this is definitely the movie for you. Even the special HBO First Look on the film deserves to be looked at and, in this sense, you might want to keep looking at the credits too. I would recommend it to all fans of Mel Brooks movies and to people who love silly humor. 7/10
