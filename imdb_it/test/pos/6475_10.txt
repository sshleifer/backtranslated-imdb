The real life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known. Knute Rockne led the game of football out of the Stone Age with innovations such as moving forward and offensive training rounds. But he is probably the best known for his motivational speeches in the locker room. Along the way, he brought fame and glory to a small, unknown Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O'Brien is incomparable in his role as Rockne. A formidable cast that includes Ronald Reagan who exceptionally plays the first true Notre Dame superstar, George Gipp. <br /> <br /> For football fans, this is the biggest football movie ever made. Do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version. (Some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) If you have the good version, look for a short cameo of immortal Jim Thorpe as he sticks his head into the locker room telling Rockne and the team that there are only a few minutes before the second half starts.
