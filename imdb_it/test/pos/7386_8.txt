Some things to touch as a response to the previous person's comment. You just have to pay attention to what's going on in the movie. <br /> <br /> (I guess they are spoilers) <br /> <br /> Red things under David's mouth? Poison ivy, the wife says not to scratch it otherwise "it will spread". <br /> <br /> David becomes "crazy" because the stranger is telling HIM to leave the house, which probably shows David's theory of a deal happening between his wife and the stranger; he runs after the man. <br /> <br /> David doesn't lose it in the woods, he simply hits the stranger a couple of times and leaves it to his wife to pick up the pieces. <br /> <br /> Only the wife eats the mushroom. <br /> <br /> I must say, after that one point with his wife and stranger, I began to feel disappointed. But the ending made up for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And for that and the last scene ... this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I should have put it together first, but let me get swept away. I was really surprised, honestly. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting, to say the least. But if you're not looking at this for the performances that the actors give, I'd say you'd better let it go, because that's all that keeps this movie together.
