To this day, I have thought that only three people, including me, who considered Heaven's Gate (1980) to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western (since 1970), after, Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972 ), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). I was amazed and pleased to see that 22.5% of those who vote for IMDB judge this film as a 10, like me. A recent book, the worst movie of all time, includes Heaven's Gate. Through his production and his release, he was vilified, like no Cleopatra film, almost twenty years before. It was once considered the most expensive film in excess of all time, surpassing even Cleopatra. He was accused of the fall of his studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios fall. Michael Cimino, fresh from his glory with the Deer Hunter, was hated and scorned for his success and the film that made excesses, but clearly, that was the petty jealousy at its worst. <br /> <br /> Cimino ended up creating one of the great exhibits of the American experience. This film is not to be missed, but any serious student of American cinema.
