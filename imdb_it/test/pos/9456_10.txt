When I saw the first preview for this, I almost fainted with excitement. I have long been a fan of twelfth night - he turned me into Shakespeare, so having a modern adaptation is a dream come true. My prediction has not been disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot basically follows the original plot and that means: complicated! I don't even want to try to relate it, the plot will probably cover the basics. Imagine that you have a girl who pretends to be a boy in a boarding school and thinks about all the possible situations they might create. I won't even stop to question the plausibility of such a plot; reality is NOT the point of the film. <br /> <br /> However, what is is absolutely fun. Almost all the scenes nail the comic set. Congratulations to the writers, the director and the actors of that film. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is the star of this film and she wears it wonderfully. She is super-pretty, not a fox and can make a comedy without errors. I admire her for not having made the tramp full in her films or in public life like so many stars today. I'm glad there is at least one good young actress left in Hollywood. OK, I'm out of my soap box ... <br /> <br /> Channing Tatum, yes, he's sexy and built like a flippin gorilla, but he really makes me laugh! My favorite scenes from the whole movie are when he tries to talk to Olivia first about cheese and then about his training regimen. <br /> <br /> Even the rest of the cast did not fail to perform, with wonderful additions to the characters in the form of the debtor inane mother and Monique, the classic evil girl. <br /> <br /> In general, lots of fun, laooot with laughter and a very attractive cast. Perhaps not like the original, but it beats the modern versions of other comedies, including the much-cited 10 things I hate about you.
