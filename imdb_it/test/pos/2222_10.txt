One of the funniest films I've ever seen in the theater in the early 1970s and, unfortunately, has been broadcast on TV a few times since. This film should be published on video. It's Sellers, in its poorest and weakest way of a dishonest hospital administrator. Great cast, great film. If anyone has a good VHS copy, I'd like to buy it.
