I loved this movie, I saw it when I was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, tonight I saw it again. I really thought it was an interesting idea, the only thing that upset me was the ending I heard being a cop. "This movie is hard to find here and I was lucky enough to have seen it on BRAVO. I also expected to see more Drew Barrymore here too!
