My favorite show of all time! Yes, I thought it was so beautiful, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWW). It was well written, funny, except when he wanted to be serious and just a great show in general. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after February 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. For me it is more the epidemic (now that it doesn't seem really written!) To have to say "Goodbye" to someone you love, and SAPPIA you will never see them again. And I still think so, because as far as I know, there are no plans to release this DVD any time soon ... yes, life is bad! I found out for sure (although you can find a strange episode here or there ... but I never liked the bootleg copies of things). <br /> <br /> So enough of my sad life: (.... Most children in 7th grade don't NEED powers like those of Alex to make them go through life (certainly not realistic) , but then again, how many cities have a super-bad chemical plant that is willing to do anything to "progress to ANY cost?" Gee this show was fun to watch! Although I would agree that the diaglouge it's a bit too developed (and even a little politically correct at times). My favorite parts were when the kids had some reason to penetrate the plant (a videotape or something) like the children's version of "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six "(which years later I became fond of that series of games probably for the same reason) almost! The" security "team of the establishment that is desperately trying to find the" guy from the accident "... very mean guys (at least when I saw the show for the first time ... they look nicer to me now). I feel a little sad for Larisa Oleynik, I'm not sure she's worried about this role ... I'll write it ... but that's what I'll always remember from her. <br /> <br /> Oh and BTW, the actor who plays Aaron Peirce from "24" also here as a school coach or something like that .... too good! Maybe he can get the producers of that show to get Larisa in the next "24" season. I only do it because Jack Bauer is my other TV hero and I'd just like to see things crossover, lol :). Both are set in California, so I will continue to dream ... Now I can see it, "Let me be with that suspect for a few minutes ... no, I don't need a car battery!"
