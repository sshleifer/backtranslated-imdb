One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 1930s was the variation of the detective fiction known as "the mystery of murder", since the addition of sound to the films contributed to making a translation more faithful to the film than what the audience experimented in the original plays. And because horror films were very popular in those years, improving the horror elements of the plots, the mysterious films of the murders had a popularity almost equal to that enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first films of the genre were produced). The aspiring playwright Charles Belden saw this renewed interest in the mysteries of murder as a chance to make a name for himself after Warner Bros. chose his three-act drama, "The Wax Works", to create the horror 1933, "Mystery of the Wax" Museum. Belden joined independent director Frank R. Strayer to continue making films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of his best. <br /> <br /> In "The Ghost Walks", John Miljan plays Prescott Ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new play Ames brings Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) at his country home for a reading of his show, but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm. The three men ask to take refuge in an old palace that seems to be owned by one of Ames's old acquaintances. inside the house, Wood and Homer are witnesses of the strange relationship between Ames and the owners of the house, however, this is all a plan designed to impress Wood: everyone in the house is an actor who plays a role in his murder. Unfortunately, the murder committed is done for real, and while Wood and Homer think it's all fake (after discovering Ames' original plan), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real killer. <br /> <br /> As expected, the script by Charles Belden for "The Ghost Walks" presents the classic elements of the mysterious stories of murders of his time, as we have the stormy night in an old dark house like setting, the group mandatory of suspects and the touch of comedy. However, what is interesting here is how Belden makes the film a true parody of the genre with the many twists and turns that it incorporates into its story to play with the clichés of the yellow murders. The dialogues are excellent, full of wit and carefree charm, and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam in the end (it still follows the routine of the crime), it never fails to be interesting and fun thanks to its clever twists and eccentric characters . It is interesting to note that there is an obvious gay subtext that, while stereotyped, never denigrates and, at times, is really funny. <br /> <br /> In 1934 the director Frank R. Strayer was already an expert craftsman in the Poverty industry of the film industry, but his collaboration with the writer Charles Belden would have given him a couple of his most interesting films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of them. Although obviously made on a limited budget and with the typical production values ​​of the independent films of his time, Strayer manages to exploit his set and creates an atmospheric film that perfectly fits the mood and tone of the story . The pace is a little too slow at times, but Strayer knew that the power of his film was on Belden's script and took advantage of it, allowing his cast to get the most out of their characters with excellent results. Surely the execution is a bit typical and not very original, but Strayer is an effective work, even if moderate, in this film. <br /> <br /> As written above, the script is full of broad lines that make eccentric characters shine, and fortunately, most of the cast play with this to their advantage. The veteran character actor Richard Carle is extraordinarily funny as the prodigious producer Herman Wood, adding much charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the showy secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the best scenes, and gives an exhilarating performance as a cowardly but witty assistant. John Miljan is as effective as Presocott Ames, nothing extraordinary, but nothing really ugly, and the same could be said of June Collyer in the role of Gloria Shaw (the obligatory love interest), which is fine. However, Donald Kirke is really funny like the evil Terry Shaw, and it's a pity he hasn't had more screen time. <br /> <br /> As usual with the films of Frank R. Strayer, the low budget hurts the film, while while Strayer does the best he can, sometimes the film still seems quite clear. However, the main problem is the problem of the very slow rhythm that it has, because even when the film is full of brilliant moments of witty dialogue, it moves at such a slow pace that it can become boring and boring for moments. It must also be said that while they are effective in their roles, Miljan and Collyer are rather boring and mediocre than Arthur and Carle, and one wants the film to be more focused on the pair of comedies they make on the main pair. Finally, as written above, the ending is a bit weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle part, although the credit must go to Belden to keep the creative twists appearing until the end. <br /> <br /> It could be said that Charles Belden is a not-celebrated hero of the mysterious genre of murder, since among the many horror and mysterious films released in film studios B nicknamed "The Poverty Row", "The Ghost Walks "is easily among the best (alongisde Strayer previous film," The Vmapire Bat ") despite its flaws. And even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it enjoys its own origin as a game of murderous mystery. A highly recommended film if you like the genre. 7/10
