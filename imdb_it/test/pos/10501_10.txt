I took another look at this movie and still consider it pretty good. Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars that can really act. Occasionally appears in soft core as "Body of Love" and "Lady Chatterly's Stories" on Showtime. I thought that Nicole Hilbig also behaved well with her beautiful body and her charming accent. Too bad it's not in other films.
