This is a cute little movie that offers pretty much what it promises: good entertainment. After all, when a movie proclaims that it features the best SASS shooters, you have to understand that it is not a likely candidate for the "Best Film" Oscar. Those guys are shooters, not actors. Your next clue is that the movie is not played by Nicholas Cage or Jennifer Aniston, which means you shouldn't expect to see the most current names. It had to be simply old entertainment and in this sense it is just as good as many of the old "leftovers" I've seen over the years. <br /> <br /> WHAT DO YOU HAVE WITH "Hell to pay"? Get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. You have the chance to see some stars of past years, which act in a very similar way to what they did in their first, but a little bigger. You can see some good SASS shooters in important roles and some SASS hams in the background. It was a lot of fun for me to see people I toured with, visited in their homes and who are my good friends who do something that many people only dream of - they are in a reality, they honestly live gosh movie. They are doing something that a lot of aspiring actors and aspiring shooters will never have the chance to do and I think it's worth the effort alone. <br /> <br /> Of course, not everyone is a member of SASS and so I've seen a lot of fun and humor that others might miss, but it's still good, old-fashioned entertainment, and frankly, there are many movies in the theater right now I wouldn't give a nickel to see, so save the money to go see "Brokeback Mountain" get "Hell to Pay" and see some real cowboys having some fun.
