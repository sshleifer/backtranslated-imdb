The summary line is the wet dream of some men for the ideal woman ...; o) Seriously though, going back to the film, which has the classic cinema written everywhere (the play on words was written and shown in the picture, you too can see)! <br /> <br /> How could someone make a silent film in this year and age? It is not completely silent for once (take music for example). With great cinematography is the answer. And it's no wonder you won prizes (as another user stated) in this area! But sometimes it is also ruin. Although the images are great, they sometimes dig too much on them instead of moving forward (plot and wise time). If you can do it, then you'll like it even more than me. I didn't tell you anything about the story, but I'll never do it, because I don't want to spoil anything for you ...
