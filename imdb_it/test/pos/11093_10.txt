"The Falcon & the Snowman" offers some of the best acting from its two protagonists. Hutton, in a brilliantly underrated role, calmly portrays the confusion and anguish of a man who apparently transforms the traitor for no other reason than as a rebellion against his father. Penn, as a co-conspirator basically running around running and drug money, explosively turns into one of the strongest performances of his multi-talent career.
