This film is a disturbing but interesting film. I'll tell you why it's later in this review. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because it was the first film to contain sounds. No, it may not be an hour and forty two movie, no it can't contain great action scenes, but for me it's still a wonderful movie. It sparked a whole revolution if you knew about it, sound films. This can be a little creepy to watch, knowing that everyone in that movie is dead, I can hear the voice of a man at the beginning who no longer walks on visible Earth, and that the sound is cracked and broken. <Br /> <br /> I recommend this video to everyone to watch. This created films as we know it today!
