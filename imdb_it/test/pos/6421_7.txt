Did I hear about it for the first time while searching for the network for reviews of another Italian crime / horror movie, the contemporary THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK (1974, of which I recently purchased the R2 SE DVD from Raro Video)? ? where it is referred to as being in a similar vein, but also equally good. Having seen FOOTSTEPS up close, can I see where that reviewer came from ?? as both films face the psychological crisis of their female protagonist. Stylistically, however, does this owe much more to the Art-house cinema than anything else? in particular, the work of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonioni (and, in particular, LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD [1961] and THE PASSENGER [1975] respectively); consequently some have accused him of being "deadly boring" ?? an epithet often attached to a "pretentious" tariff (read: cerebral)! <br /> <br /> However, does the film involve the search for a woman (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements in the previous three days? of which he seems to have no memory. Following a series of cryptic clues, does he travel to the "mythical" land of Garma (nearby places, therefore, bear the equally fictitious names of Muda and Rheember)? where he meets several people (including Lila Kedrova as a regular aristocrat of the resort) who apparently remembers the heroine who stays there during his 'blackout'! The most important, however, are a young man (Peter McEnery) and a child (Nicoletta Elmi, of BARON BLOOD by Mario Bava [1972]) ?? the first always seems to happen on the scene at propitious moments, while the second seems to confuse Bolkan with another woman (with long red hair and a bad vein!). <br /> <br /> Although essentially a mood, this is nevertheless a compelling puzzle: inevitably, vague events manifest themselves at an intentional pace? and where much of the film's power comes from the remarkable central performance (which can be seen as an extension of Bolkan's role in the beautiful Lucio Fulci yellow A LEATHER LIZARD OF A WOMAN [1971]). However, there is no denying the contribution of the filmmaker Vittorio Storaro (which provides an unlimited number of extraordinary moves and an effective combination of colors by using orange / red / blue filters to create atmosphere and create a saturated look for the disorienting and bizarre finish) and the melancholic soundtrack by Nicola Piovani (the composer is better known today for his Oscar-winning work on the tragedy with the theme of the Holocaust by Roberto Benigni LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL [1997]). <br /> <br /> With this in mind, it is worth discussing how FOOTSTEPS was presented in the version I saw: well, apparently difficult to get in its original form (I can't be sure if it's here or not, except to say that the film worked for 89 minutes while the IMDb lists it at 96), this edition was selected by a rather battered English VHS (dubbing is surprisingly good, given the international cast) with Swedish subtitles burned to boot (in addition, the DivX copy frozen for a few seconds in a crucial point in the history around the 82-minute mark)! Nevertheless we receive a welcome bonus, such as "Highlights From The Soundtrack" of 9 minutes in MP3 format. I realize that I have not yet mentioned the subplot of the lunar mission, to which the presence of Klaus Kinski is restricted: incidentally, around the same time, he had an equally brief but fundamental role in another good artistic thriller with sci-fi inclinations (and set in a distinct position) ?? that is, LIFESPAN (1974). While I was watching the film, I could not understand what the possible connection with the central plot was, except that Bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a film he had once seen, though not until the end, entitled "Footsteps On The Moon" (an alternative title somewhat misleading for the film itself) ?? in a funny way, at the beginning she remembers that the film is called BLOOD ON THE MOON (which, of course, is a classic noir western of 1948 with Robert Mitchum and directed by Robert Wise!). That being said, did I take this 'diversion' more than anything else a more extravagant touch to the film (given also the former Bolkan employment as a translator in a conference that discusses the future of the Earth) ?? and certainly did not expect the astronauts to appear on Garma's beach right at the end to chase the female protagonist, where the sand then turns threateningly on the surface of the moon ??! <br /> <br /> The plot of the film will probably make more sense in a second view ?? even if, to be honest, it is better to approach a visual / aural experience and one should not expect it to provide a narrative that is in any way clear and easily rationalized! For the record, the only other Bazzoni effort I had managed to capture before this was the live thriller THE FIFTH CORD (1971), played by Franco Nero (whom I had recorded late at night on Italian TV); some time ago, I took possession of his western version of Spaghetti by "Carmen" entitled MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968) ?? also with Nero and Kinski ?? like DivX (after having already lost a matinee broadcast of it) ?? but the conversion had somehow proved to be defective and, consequently, the disk would not have worked properly!
