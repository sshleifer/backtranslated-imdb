I've seen Love Jones over thirty times. It is one of the rare films that portray a love story of people who are African-American. The dialogue has been realistically written and delivered with honesty. It was so nice to see a movie where the plot was focused on young African American professionals. This is practically an untapped market. Even Love Jones was visually appealing. The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring memories of past and present love. The feel of the film is jazz and blues, and brings to my sensuality a creamy hot chocolate with a spray of Kahlua and Butterscotch. If I hadn't guessed, I loved it!
