We usually think of the British as experts in making great adventures from the imperial age, with the likes of The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the imperial era was, for the most part, British. Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendition of the American imperial age. <br /> <br /> The projection of America's power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional story of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her kindness, is struck by the rough masculine nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by its beauty and its contempt. (Prisms politically correct and eager to see some "indigenous" peoples or cultures can rest assured, that the way Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is much more flattering than the way their modern counterparts portray themselves on the scene current world.) What makes this story different from the fantastic production values: impeccable photography, composition and editing - exceptional casting - the undecovered Brian Keith who plays a Teddy bully - and a vivid story. <br /> <br /> Although the Wind and the Lion is largely said through the eyes of the child, each family member can identify with one of the characters, whether it be the noble brigand of Sean Connery, the gritty heroine by Candace Bergen, by the clever John Hay of John Huston or by Steve Kanaly's lieutenant and ruthless lieutenant lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick". There is a transcendent scene at the end, when the boy is symbolically swept away by the fleeing Moro on his white steed. This is high adventure at its best.
