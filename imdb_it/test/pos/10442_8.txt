When I saw this movie in my teenage years, I tried the soundtrack. Some bands of the soundtrack that I didn't know yet. However, during the film, I have already noticed its quality. U2, Blondie, Police. , Quincy Jones, Commodores. Sensational soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In Brazil, there has been a long time since this film went on TV. Today he switched to cable TV and I remembered to access the site to comment. <br /> <br /> The end of the film surprised me a lot, but that's what happens in real life. Not always, what he thought he was ideal is what happens. <br /> <br /> Life brings us many surprises.
