When I first saw this film, I also expected "our boys" to be nice and more like an extended version of the TV show. Then I didn't "understand". But years later, at a party YEARS later, in a PAR-TAY of the 70s, in which certain substances had been smoked, inhaled and with lots of tequila, "HEAD" was late at night. We looked at him and finally we looked at him and understood what "HEAD" was. He spoofed his show, as shown in a song called "a produced image". As Davy Jones wrote in his autobio, "They made a monkey out of me", he openly admits that everyone in the film had stayed up all night smoking grass. They have made fun of themselves, of society, of everything! Great movie! Tho, like a 52-year-old grandmother, I no longer "induldge", I STILL watch this movie when I want a good LOL !!!
