This is one of the best TV movies you can ever see. The values ​​of acting, writing and production are first class. The shows are as passionate about Beverly D'Angelo as superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes just as perfect as the young boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was the way it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going to the usual happy ending. He has shown that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and the wreck lives. It's inspiring and fun. Congratulations to all those interested in this exceptional film. <br /> <br />
