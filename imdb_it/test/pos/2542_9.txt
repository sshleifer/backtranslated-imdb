Gray can blow up the English language like no other. It tells a series of events, linked together by his writing of a manuscript (the "Monster" of the title), some sad, some incredibly funny, all in its characteristic, sarcastic manner. If you enjoyed "Swimming in Cambodia" you will love this. Actually I thought it was a little more interesting and better than "Swimming in Cambodia". A true masterpiece.
