If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this version of the BBC. In fact it lasted four and a half hours, but Jacoby's performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart as Claudius is worth it. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to amaze me how clear "Hamlet" is when you see it in its length and order as set by the Bard. Each film version of "Hamlet" has tinkered with its structure. Olivier focused on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to pull all these aspects of Hamlet's character together with the help of Shakespeare's complete script. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Hamlet kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says "I am very proud, vindictive, ambitious ..." Hamlet is extremely upset, not only for the death of his father (and the suspected murder), or for his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and above all , because Claudius usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious with his mother for marrying Claudius (marriages between royal relatives are not unknown, done for political reasons) but his marriage solidifies Claudius' claim to the throne before he can return to Wittenburg to claim him for himself. He is therefore powerless to do something about it. And this is true even after hearing the ghost of his father shouting revenge. He cannot simply kill the King or lose the throne in doing so. He must "get out" of the king's secret and here is the tragedy! At the moment Hamlet manages to show Claudio's guilt in public, he has the opportunity to kill him and he doesn't. WHY? EVERYTHING wants it! He wants revenge, the throne And the damnation of Claudio's soul in hell. Hamlet is SREBRA about himself in the classic tragic form. His HUBRIS is his downfall. He kills Polonius thinking that it is Claudius and the rest of the game spiraling to the final death of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ofelia, Laerte, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet himself.
