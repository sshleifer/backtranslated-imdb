Ben (a good Charles Bateman), his young daughter K.T. (a nice Geri Reischl), and his new girlfriend Nicky (the extremely attractive Ahna Capri) are on their way to a birthday party for K.T. Unexpectedly they are in a remote southern city where nobody is able to leave, and with the exception of Ben, K.T. and Nicky, nobody can enter. Finally, the children are disappearing and the adults are killed at an alarming rate. Ben helps some locals - Sheriff Pete (LQ Jones), Tobey (Alvy Moore), and Jack (Charles Robinson), the local priest, try to solve the mystery. <br /> <br /> The devil's early 70s actually the horror theme comes before "The Exorcist" and combines a "Bad Day at Black Rock" plot of a rural town with a large skeleton in his wardrobe with horror elements, for interesting results. He actually sent a few shivers down his spine at this observation, as he moved inexorably along his threatening path. The moody and solemn atmosphere is established quickly and lasts for the whole duration; the ever increasing sense of panic gives him a real kick. Some memorable sets include the bizarre opening of a toy tank that turns into a real crushing machine, not to mention Nicky's incredible nightmare, vividly and elegantly crafted by director Bernard McEveety and the crew. The music of Jaime Mendoza-Navas is subtly sinister and gives that extra sense of unease. <br /> <br /> The constant and professional cast does a good job, especially the always engaging Strother Martin as the affable Doc Duncan, and the producers / actors LQ Jones and Alvy Moore. <br /> <br /> The fact that the whole plot is right under the nose of our heroes makes it even scarier. Jack the priest begins to lead them in the right direction, but will they be in time to stop things? It's a nice little cooler that is worth revisiting; only by speaking for myself, I was able to appreciate it much more after giving a second chance. I can say that yes, it is really undervalued, which tells a good story in an interesting, unconventional and effective way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
