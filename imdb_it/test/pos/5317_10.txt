This film was a masterpiece of human emotions and experiences. I think many people are involved in Leland's apparent mental illness as a plot, but I have been drawn to the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the strength of human emotions. Much of the film's message is that we never know beauty without the ugly, which is a bit clich√©, but what makes this film so beautiful and original is that it portrays the devastating and devastating force that the bad guy can have, if you see the bad guy everywhere like Leland, or you're experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that simply won't work, no matter how you want him to do it. This film captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie you've ever seen, and it's just as depressing as the movie.
