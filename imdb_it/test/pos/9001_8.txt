Forever Strong is a type of film that we have seen many times, only in different genres of genres. However, having said that, I really thought it was a great movie, Sean Faris is showing the kind of potential that actors in big-time celebrity usually land. Apparently this film got a limited version because I wasn't even aware of it, but I saw it in the video library and decided to hear it again after recalling Sean's performance in Never Back Down. I ended up making an exceptional decision, I'm not a rugby fan, but the film is not entirely true for rugby, it's about taking a stand in your life, challenging yourself, reaching your goals, there is much more than just the simple plot suggests. At first he doesn't give a damn about what happens to Rick, it's a bite full of himself and completely arrogant, we feel that he has completely marked his destiny as a trouble maker. Along the way we see the changes in his character, he starts to be around with better people, he starts to improve himself, we learn how much his father had a negative impact on his life, it's just a big turning point and the film did a great job in turning Rick from a cock to a good-hearted person. <br /> <br /> The rugby action itself is not bad at all, unlike the things I played and seen in high school, this was really fun to watch and beautifully choreographed. A great young cast, combined with some veteran experience, helped this film immensely, he did only a fabulous job of avoidance in what could be a way to direct the mill genre to a moving and effective drama. I also liked the contrasting contrast between The Coach | Garry Cole | and Rick | Sean Faris |, has created a very interesting storyline, and I enjoyed watching him help Rick in the way he was moving and moving at the same time. This is a real hidden gem that I'm really happy to have discovered and that made me think about my life and many times I need something like that. <br /> <br /> The Performances. Sean Faris is as exceptional as Rick Penning. It reminded me of a lot of young Tom Cruise, but charismatic and talented. It was a difficult role to transform from a mawkish teenager to a young man with a tender heart, but Sean made it perfectly. He clearly put his heart and soul into this film, so great compliments to Sean for dedicating so much effort to this great film. Gary Cole is excellent as the favorite but nice coach who wants to help children. I've always liked him, he always has a sort of presence that he brings to his films. Neal McDonough is as fantastic as Rick's selfish but pressed father. For most of the film, the script leads you to believe that he is nothing but a selfish egoist who wants Rick to be exactly like him, but in the end you start seeing the real guy that comes out, I'm sorry for him a bit Julie Warner is a good character actress and plays the good-hearted mother well, yet without a trace. Penn Badgley is asked to play a real jerk, and the boy never does it so well. On numerous occasions I wanted to present him a song, so I have to say that it's a great performance. Arielle Kebbel is the love interest not much of a party, she did well. Nathan West plays a somewhat mysterious character, he did it quite well. Sean Astin is considered an important actor for the film, but barely does anything, he did well with what he had to do. <br /> <br /> Bottom line-Forever Strong is a film of great impact, it will surely make you stop and think about how your life was much better than I thought. Don't miss this, you won't regret it. <br /> <br /> 8 1/2/10
