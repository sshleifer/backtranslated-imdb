The elegant universe brings to light many ideas about the universe and existence. After seeing this documentary, one cannot help but take a step back and reconsider their point of view on the existence of everything. There is a vast array of scientists, mathematicians and others on both sides of string theory. It is continually challenged as unverified, unverifiable and probably wrong. The closest to the proselytism that someone makes is to explain that quantum physics, the set of mathematical ideas that provide a very good approximation of what happens to subatomic particles, has never made wrong predictions. Not so with string theory; nobody is willing to say, on camera, that string theory is the truth, and in doing so, the piece maintains a certain respectful distance from the subject.
