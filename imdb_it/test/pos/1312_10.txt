This film is a haunting tale of the life of the author and poet, Mishima. He jumps through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories but is cleverly constructed as he moves from one section to another. Capture the taste of man, his work and his times ... the difficult 60s. <br /> <br /> I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are extracts from his works. The sets (specially designed to work with the camera) are incredible ... stylized, beautiful and effective. They could be used as examples for any set designer. I woke up at night dreaming of the Golden Pagoda. <br /> <br /> The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and art. After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the artist's works. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in Japanese art, poetry, theater, politics or history.
