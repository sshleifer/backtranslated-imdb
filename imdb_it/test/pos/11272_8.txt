Begotten is one of the most unique films I've ever seen. For me, it's more a study of sound, light, darkness and movement than a true story. The kind of thing you see as video instillation at the modern art museum of a movie enjoyed at the local theater. I will not try to interpret the images of mother nature, the beasts in cloak, the twisted and tortured body of her "child". Some things challenge interpretation.
