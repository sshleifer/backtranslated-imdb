I want to start my review by thanking the creators of this documentary, it's obviously a labor of love and I think they did a great job putting together a funny documentary about a person who had so little information available about him. He certainly has a sense of fan worship about it, which is good. <br /> <br /> I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about it and found the beginning of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talking about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept too far away. I wanted to see this guy from Bruce Haack !! It seemed to me that the producers thought I already knew him as well as these on-screen musicians I didn't have, so I felt a bit left in the dark. <br /> <br /> When Bruce was finally shown in action it was great and he gave me a taste of who Bruce Haack was, but it was just a taste. We were treated by more musicians and I felt like they said "Look - all these musicians are excited about him, so he must be strong!" I didn't care much for the musician's comment on Bruce. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Bruce, as a person. You know, the important things - more interviews with people who worked with him or who knew him. More on his life, and yes, his use of drugs and other problems. I would have liked to know more about his "Hackula" project. I wanted to get into his mind. Even if they did it through some comments and photos of the "voice of god" it would have been OK. <br /> <br /> The animations were good, but again I felt that they were used as fillers, they didn't really do anything that wouldn't allow me to listen to his music and see some images based on Dimension 5 records. I thought he was intelligent and creative, but still ... I wanted to learn more about Bruce! <br /> <br /> Maybe Bruce Haack was so elusive in real life? <br /> <br /> However, in the end I liked this documentary and felt a kind of sadness for the pioneers and such extraordinary geniuses as Mr. Haack forgets how the march of time always ends. I'm glad this movie is around to educate people about Bruce Haack, even with its flaws.
