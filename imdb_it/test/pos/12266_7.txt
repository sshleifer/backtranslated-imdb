Essential display for anyone watching TV news as it could help you become a little more skeptical, or even cynical. On a personal note, I remember attending a course a few years ago to be interviewed for TV - what to do, what not to do. The instructors of the course impressed us that television news was a "show-biz branch". This depressing vision, which is probably even more valid today than when it was produced, is reinforced by this film. Don't worry about journalistic integrity, what matters is the ability to look good and smile well. And make sure you don't sweat on the camera. <br /> <br /> The interactions between the three main characters form the center-piece, each with its own ambitions, abilities and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and puts them in the volatile setting of a television studio and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mix. The result is a complex portrait, even if a little too long, of the way in which every day we compromise to satisfy our ambitions and bring others with us. It's always fun, even if the final scene was, perhaps, useless given everything that had happened before.
