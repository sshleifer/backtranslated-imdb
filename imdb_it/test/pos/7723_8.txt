This film is a fairly fair adaptation of Prosper's novel Merimeé. In the novel Merimeé himself is a character, Don José is from Navarra (in the north of Spain, and historically an area of ​​the Basque Country, he can speak the Basque language). They are located in Seville (Andalusia, southern Spain) and speak only Spanish with an Andalusian accent, in no way speak Basque, but Carmen explains to Don José that he lived in Navarre. You can believe it or not, however this is the version of the book, so you can't be critical of the film on this one, be with the book! Note that the novel by Merimeé and the work of Bizet are different, and this film is an adaptation from the novel, however in the work Don José is still Spanish from Navarra, never French. Why do so many people still think that Don José is French? I don't know, but I guess because the novel and the work are in French, although it should be in Spanish. <br /> <br /> The only important difference between the film and the novel is that in the film Don José also kills Carmen's "bullfighter" and in the novel he doesn't (not even in the opera). I imagine they wanted to keep the film a little more gore! I think the film is pretty good, though.
