Fred was a great show. It was simple but somehow very compelling. I can remember the days when I watched this on Kids WB on Saturday, but then Kids WB made the unforgivable. Kids WB became like that older relative who searches of acting "hip" and "funky fresh". * shudder * They have become like that relative who tries to behave well, but the attempt is a disaster of cheese. They pulled the Fruit Salad from Coconut Fred inland and all the other good shows to put on some of the most useless shows I've ever seen in my life (Johnny Test). The only thing that keeps me watching KWB are the occasional pieces of old shows and anime on 4kids. It was a huge mistake to pull this to show the program. This brings me back to my first point ... TAKE IT BACK !!!
