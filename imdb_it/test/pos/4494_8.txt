Kite Runner is without doubt one of the most incredible books I've read in the recent past. Maybe I had very high expectations from the movie, but nevertheless the film was good, the whole setting seemed realistic. nothing has been done to the imagination. the dialogues were not very attractive or powerful, they were right. The film was not at all a bad experience, especially in the last 15 minutes, where it became very emotional and probably even the most difficult man would cry. But my imagination was much better than the film ... I cried more by reading the novel to see the film. but overall a good movie to watch for those of you who are not readers. but the readers - the novel would be a better experience, so if you absolutely want to watch the movie, first read the novel and then compare it to the film.
