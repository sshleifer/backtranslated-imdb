Even though I'm not a golf fan, I participated in a preview of this film and loved it. Historical settings, distinct class distinctions and seeing good and evil on both sides of the dividing line have attracted my attention everywhere. The actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing. And I was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting but easy to follow. Towards the end of this film, "Seabiscuit" came to mind, although "The Greatest Game Ever Played" is a much less complex story than that movie. In both cases, the fact that the events actually happened deepened my interest.
