At the beginning of the film, Cagney's Johnny Cave character tells his gumshoes in the Office of Weights and Measures that, in the previous year, unscrupulous shop owners had tricked the American consumer with more money than the National War Debt complex ! Then he goes out and tickets with a particularly fat green grocery store to sell him a bag of sugar that is four ounces (oh, the horrors !!) and a skinny chicken that his butcher's scale has generously proclaimed six pounds. , after which the fur - or in this case the feathers - flies. Er, fly. When a criminal in political garb tries to derail an investigation into poor poultry practices, our hero becomes a lone wolf who fights the war of weights on behalf of housewives across America. After all, four cents here and a quarter add up and before we know it we have anarchy! The word of his intransigence soon reaches both the mayor and the governor's offices, and Cagney becomes a marked man. If it sounds silly, it's not - dishonest retailing practices are just a plot tool (or as Hitchcock, McGuffin would say), and while they're not familiar, it works just as well here as any treasury agent or G-man anthology in which the struggle is carried to shady scammers who operate outside the interests of the common good of the country. Production standards are decidedly Grade-B, but it is Cagney who makes this film the pleasure it is: this was his first film away from Warner Brothers after he searched his unreasonable contract in court, and seems to be at ease having fun tremendously - the performance performed here is intelligent and crackling with its unique energy and its sure charisma. The presence of Mae Clarke gives a decidedly Warner touch to the overall production. Supporting players turn into solid performances and the story moves elegantly after a rocky introduction that seems to start three or four reels in history - but sit back and enjoy it for Cagney's shop window and the engaging time capsule of the Depression that it is.
