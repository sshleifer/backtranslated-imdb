After five years in prison, Tony le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his closest friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and the Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel) and invite Tony to steal a pair of jewels from the window of the famous Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he refuses. Tony finds his ex-girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who has become the lover of the gangster nightclub owner L 'Âge d' Or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and humiliates her, beating her and taking her jewels. Then he calls Jo and Mario and proposes a burglary of the jewelery safe. They invite the Italian specialist in safes and the elegant wolf Cesar (Perlo Vita) to join their team and draw a perfect blow. They succeed in their plan, but D. Juan Cesar makes things bad when he gives his lover a precious ring. <br /> <br /> "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes" is a magnificent film noir, certainly among the best I've seen. The script is credible, supported by a fantastic direction by Jules Dassin, extraordinary cast performances and great cinematography. Jean Servais has exceptional performances in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the rules of the underworld. The famous long silent sequence of the robbery is surprising and extremely tense and certainly among the best in the history of cinema. I'm listing this great movie on my list of favorite movies ever. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rififi"
