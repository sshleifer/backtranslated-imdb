This film is not the typical Hollywood ticket, even if the choices are so negative that I often tend to stay away from the movies rather than be disappointed. However, this small low budget gem is extremely lovable and pleasant and definitely a caretaker. The actors are as varied as the characters they portray, the setting of Buffalo is fascinating (what a beautiful city) and the story shines. The lack of gratuitous violence, sex and the word "f" takes nothing away! Grab the kids, take the grandmother, take a break from Hollywood! I give him an 11 out of 10!
