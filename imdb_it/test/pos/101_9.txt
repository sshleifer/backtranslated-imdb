This is a very, very strange film ... one that is so strange is better than you see it for yourself. The film begins with a tired professor who appeals to his class because the students have the audacity to not be incredibly brilliant like him! It can be understood very quickly that this man is a total cynic: finding the value practically in nothing, but sticking to his own inner sense of personal importance. Moreover, he seems tired and bored by the monotony of life. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, he enters a bank robbery and manages to annoy the thieves so much that one of them shoots him in the head. Strangely, this is only halfway through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narrative of the last seconds of his life. This is when the film becomes exciting because the narrative style is just like one of the novels of this literature professor - one that is written intelligently and says things the way we would like to be able to tell them all. <br /> <br /> Watch this bizarre movie: it's incredibly compelling and I don't like anything I've ever seen before.
