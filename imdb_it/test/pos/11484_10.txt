I've seen this movie at least ten times. I disagree with the previous comments. This is an ironic film and some of the plays are meant to be rigged. Men like Paul Cowley are few and far between, women like Linda, unfortunately, are a dozen dollars. The sad thing here is that even though similar reports like this rarely lead to murders and frames, it is a scenario that is entirely familiar to them. The boy loves the girl, the girl does not know that he exists, they grow up, the man sees the woman who has fantasized up and down and saves her. In short, she never loved him: he arrived at the right time and she used it. Thomas is as excellent as the fearful but adequate Paul. His interpretation is sensitive and moving. Madsen is perfect as a femme-fatale. What really moved me was the final scene. Paul says that in the end he cried, but not for Linda, his wife, but for the unknown girl he had observed from afar many years ago ... and he wanted ... and loved. And I loved Thomas's close-up at the end.
