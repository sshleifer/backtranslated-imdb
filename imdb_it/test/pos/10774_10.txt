This film is totally mindblowing. It manages to be stimulating, fun, tragic, cinematic but claustrophobic. <br /> <br /> Although flashbacks are not necessary, the film maintains a powerful and sharp sting and the performances are excellent, in particular Alec Baldwin, and the hypnotizing Eric Bogosian as the film's anti-hero, Barry Champlain.
