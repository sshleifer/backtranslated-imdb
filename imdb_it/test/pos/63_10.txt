It's really a great movie (after being able to ignore the references of Blake Edwards Pink Panther that he seems to be obsessed with and which are enormously little fun). Julie is, as usual, wonderful: she sings and plays brilliantly. I remember seeing him at the Haymarket Odeon Cinema, outgoing in London. However, the appearance of Julie at the British premiere of STAR! he was very unlucky and (apparently!) due to aerial footage for Darling Lili on Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she appeared in one of these aerial shots, but she didn't. Two box office flops in a row have ruined his film career for several years. But Darling Lili, just like STAR!, Deserves much more public appreciation.
