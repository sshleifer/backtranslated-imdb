Probably the best serial ever made (no topic so far) on Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and the beautiful Dale Arden who travels on a spaceship to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, in fascinating chapters, spectacular and action-packed, Flash and his friends along with new friends like Prince Barin, Prince Thun and the fantastic King Vultan gather their resources to fight the evils and armies of Mongo's ruthless Ming and the jealous betrayal of his daughter Priness Aura (now it's a car!). This serial is not just a step above most periodicals in terms of plot, acting and budget: it's a few miles forward in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios it has many previous sets available such as The Bride of Frankenstein's lab set and The Phantom of the Opera's Opera House, just to name a few. Production values ​​across the board have advanced, in my most modest opinion, to 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are truly creative and first-rate. We take male hawks, sharks, lions, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids and tigrons (oh my!) And many, many other fantastic things. Are they all credible and first-class special effects? There's no way. But by 1936 most are very impressive. The soundtrack is impressive and the beginnings of the chapter are well written, long enough to revitalize the memories of the spectators of the previous chapter, and expertly marked. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job putting everything together beautifully and creating a movie worthy of Alex Raymond's phenomenology comic. Finally, the acting is pretty good in this serial. Too often, the serials don't have names without talent that surround one or two former talents - most of them have some abilities here. Don't get me wrong, this is not a Shakespeare company by any means, but Buster Crabbe does a work as a laborer, likeable as Flash. He is ably helped by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson, and the rest of the cast in general with two emerging artists. But before I get to those two let me add as another reviewer has noticed, it must have been great for this serial to get from the Hayes office. I see more meat on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in the movies decades later. Crabbe's short films (and unfortunately for all of us, Professor Zarkov (Frank Shannon) wear a pair of shorts that girls can wear. Girls wear dinghies and are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers can have limited acting talent but she's a blonde bombshell .The Lawson is also very sensual and sensual, but for me the two actors who make the serial are Charles Middleton as Ming: officially sardonic, ruthless and funny Middleton is a class act. "Tiny" Lipson plays King Vultan: exuberant, amusing, exhilarating, a symbol of pure joy in life and of every essence of hedonism, Lipson steals every scene in which it finds itself: the plot winds here, there and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial, the space work and the basics for a lot of science fiction to follow.
