My first film Mamin, I saw it on IFC a long time ago, and I really enjoyed it. It looked absolutely artistic, original, fun and fun. Not a moment in the film disappointed me or made me bored, and I was laughing a lot or had a smile on my face. I mean, this movie is really fun. But here's the trick: it's also very artistic and creative - if you don't know Yuri Mamin (probably, unfortunately, because many of his BIG films are not available here) he has a very original style like no other, and for me this is not even the my favorite movie of him (right now he is the fool ("Saideburns / Bakenbardy"). Also, I have to say that I am Russian, this film is fantastic because you really see what the Russians are like. Russian to me, NOT a foreign film that tries to be American or tries to appeal, Mamin has not sold out (nor has it been since then that Gorko (1998) was good if not better. It is a real filmaking in style Russian who came out of the communist socialist realism. <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, I think you have a high probability of loving the other Mamin movies, actually I like many of them more than this , I imagine this is your most accessible film le: a similar film is Fountain, which takes place 6 years earlier during perestroika, has the same actor in the main role, and more than the usual ones of Mamin you will recognize from Window in Paris; this has a supernatural turn at the end but it is above all a realistic comedy, a great one. Viva Mamin, I hope Criterion will join all his movies one day, he's still working, and his catalog is fantastic! See all his films, if you can.
