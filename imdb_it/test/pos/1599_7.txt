I'm not sure where to start. In short, it was a disappointing film. Having taught the novel, I was aware that it would be a difficult story to turn into a movie. The film has a couple of interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach) but does not represent the debate on art that fundamentally shapes the novel. <br /> <br /> For one, I was expecting an old Aschenbach and a young Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, while in the film he feels sexuality and is a spite. He is an accomplice of Aschenbach, he always looks at him, almost provocatively. In the book, it is Aschenbach who steals glances at the boy. As for Aschenbach, I imagined something closer to the professor turned into The Blue Angel (based on a story by Thomas Mann's brother Heinrich) of this forty-year-old with very few gray hairs. In all honesty, I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but someone else should have done it, or should have made him look older at first. <br /> <br /> I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important for history, but the film minimizes the discourses on art and duality between Apollonian and Dionysian inspirations and focuses instead on Aschenbach's obsession with Tadzio and does not justify it. I liked the fact that Mahler's music was used, because in the end he inspired Mann to write his story. I'm not sure that turning Aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move. Or Alfred's creation that I don't remember in the book. <br /> <br /> And one thing that really struck me was the sound and the way it didn't fit the lips of the actors. I wondered if he was nicknamed because I expected him to be in Italian. But then I remembered that every Italian movie I've seen has this problem. It only disturbs me because these directors (Fellini is the other person I'm thinking about) should represent perfection in Italian cinema, and here their characters laugh without sound, so you hear a noise that doesn't match their faces (I'm thinking of the scenes in which Aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing. This scene could / should be the strongest, but instead it was annoying).
