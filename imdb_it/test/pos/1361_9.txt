I think Golden Boy is one of the sleepy / lost soul treasures out there. A sexy comedy about finding a young man to find his core in life and making mistakes in all kinds of strange jobs that somehow has this pretty sexy girl who eventually falls in love with him but doesn't really make it bill! It is really something that can easily be lost if you are the name, but once you look at it ... it will fall for the comedy / nonsense that lies inside. Truly a crime that produced only 6 episodes of OVA and pilot film. However, be unique as it is. I'm surprised he survived to produce so many. If you want a good laugh, with high quality anime (100% CGI free), check out this anime. Boy who could one day save the world ... or maybe not.
