I have seen this film countless times and I have never failed to be fascinated by its simplicity, sincerity and goodness. Great features of the whole cast, and the adorable little steam trains that play such an important supporting role. I confess that I fell in love with Roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today. Shown on TV in New Zealand on Christmas day, the best gift I could have.
