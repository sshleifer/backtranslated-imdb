"Crossfire" is remembered not so much because its three stars all had the name "Robert", but also as one of the first Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> The story opens with the murder in silhouette of a man we will later learn is a Jew named Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene). The captain's smoking police, Captain Finlay (Robert Young), is assigned to the case. A former soldier, Montgomery (Robert Ryan), comes across the murder scene and we learn through the flashback that he met Samuels in a bar along with other soldiers who were about to be withdrawn from service after World War II. > <br /> According to Montgomery, he and his friend Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) had followed Samuels and Cpl. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) at Samuels' apartment for a drink. Montgomery tells Finlay that Mitchell left the apartment first and that he and Floyd followed him shortly after with Samuels still alive and well. <br /> <br /> Unable to locate Mitchell, Finlay suspects him of murder. Enlist the sergeant. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) to help him locate Mitchell. Mitchell meanwhile wondered in the streets in a state of daze. Meet the prostitute Ginny (Gloria Grahame) in a bar and reach a friendship. She gives him a key to his apartment and he goes there to rest. Unexpectedly a man (Paul Kelly) shows up to search for Ginny. Mitchell, still groggy, leaves and returns to meet Keeley and his friends. Keeley manages to keep him from the police and hides him in a movie theater all night. <br /> <br /> From Mitchell's point of view we learn that Montgomery hates Jews and is probably the murderer. Finlay begins to focus his investigation on Montgomery trying to prove his guilt. He organizes to have one of the soldiers, a child named Leroy (William Phipps) has created a trap for Mongomery. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is considered one of the best in the "film noire" genre. In fact, he received several Oscar nominations, including Ryan and Grahame for Best Supporting Actor. It was made on a modest budget in about three weeks. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements of the classic "film noire", the shadows, the low level lighting and the plot that takes place mainly at night. The "femme fatale" required is the Ginny of Grahame who plays a secondary role, but is still your classic "femme fatale". The unnamed character played by Paul Kelly (excellently) was chewed and spat out by Ginny and was about to do the same with Mitchell? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan steals the painting like the brutal Montgomery even though he would have to cast it in similar roles for years to come. Robert Young is a good low-profile detective, but Robert Mitchum has little to do except make friends with the character of Mitchell. Others in the cast are Jacqueline White in the role of Mitchell's wife, Lex Barker (who will go the following year to play "Tarzan") as one of Mitchum's friends and Richard Powers (who was previously known as Tom Keene) as an assistant to Finlay. <br /> <br /> Director Edward Dmytryk would gradually come into contact with the non-American committee of the House as a communist affiliate and spend a couple of years in prison.
