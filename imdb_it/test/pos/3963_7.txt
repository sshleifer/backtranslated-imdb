This film has something that most other films of its kind don't do: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, it is the story of a boy named Bartleby (Justin Long) who is rejected by every college he addresses. His parents are incredibly severe, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and some other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to engage with their parents as college students. Not everything goes according to plan, and the film is about them winged. But behind this plot that seems ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new perspective on the American educational system. The colleges that create "South Harmon Institute of Technology" accept those who have not been accepted anywhere else. The message is that you don't need "money, tradition or fantasy books - you just need the desire to improve yourself". they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the film teaches is that it is still OK - and different (whether it's a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that everyone should not be given the opportunity to to improve, even if they are "strange". it is a message of non-compliance and also has traces of anti-authority. But not only the messages are fantastic - it's hilarious! haha I laughed very loudly. humor can be subtle but can also be brash, and is a great mix. The fraternities are attentive.
