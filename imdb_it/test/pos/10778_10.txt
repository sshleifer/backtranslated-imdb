With infinite energy and uncompromising vision, Talk Radio brilliantly explores the public's passion for reducing the private problems of strangers in radio entertainment. <br /> <br /> Eric Bogosian is as sensational as Barry Champlaine, a rude, conversational radio host. It's natural for this kind of role and develops one of the most impressive and interesting radio personalities I've ever seen on the screen. The timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are strokes of genius. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry's boss. It demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that would later show the Glengarry Glen Ross of 1992. But the supporting role that really stands out is the apparently cerebrally stoned teenager played by Michael Wincott. You have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a great job with photography, which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcast room. The claustrophobic feel of the film perfectly reflects his tone. After all, one of the main points of the film is to use people's private moments to attract an audience. Stone shows that these moments are often too reserved for the whole world. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is a film with a strong emotional and cerebral impact, rarely seen today.
