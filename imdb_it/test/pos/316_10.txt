During the last spasms of Vitnam's war, our main character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent by the CIA in an unilateral illegal mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who presumably gone "completely crazy", but who is successfully conducting a private cross-border war from its base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore off-limits country. <br /> <br /> The whole story told of what Willard sees and does as he is ferried across the Da Nang River by an unruly and terrified sailor ship on a ship assault, Kurtz is a great metaphor for excesses , of the decadence and, ultimately, of the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we do not understand something, and we are not able to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz eventually found out. <br /> <br /> Unless you pay close attention to every emotional gesture, to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where the two are alone in the darkness of Kurtz's lair, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible film. Kurtz's subtle agreement with his executioner, his unilateral "surrender" in exchange for Willard's consent (he beckoned?) To tell Kurtz's son (another metaphor for us, the next generation, those who watch the film ) the truth about all the horrors they had both seen in Vietnam, are things that expand the mind. The bond between the two men while Kurtz has thoroughly examined Willard, - intertwined with some of his horror stories, is incredible, indeed, brilliant, film. The final (interceded) scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of the symbols. Coppolla intentionally or not did the last anti-war declaration, one that should resonate through the centuries.
