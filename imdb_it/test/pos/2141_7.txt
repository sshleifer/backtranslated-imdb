I've been a fan of Heaven's Gate since its first release. I've seen it at least half a dozen times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece. So, it was with enthusiasm and a sense of anticipation that I took off to see the cut of the restored director. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I was disappointed to see him again and since then I have reviewed my estimate of the film. Heaven's Gate touches on greatness in parts, but overall, it lacks the thematic and narrative coherence and the passionate urgency characteristic of a truly great film. <br /> <br /> Firstly, two technical problems: the sound quality is widespread throughout the film, verging on the inaudibility sometimes. Something of this, perhaps, is intentional - a way to mimic the chaos and confusion of the story as it unfolds. But at key points, one cannot record what the characters are saying. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is similarly widespread. Images lack clarity and detail detail. The result is a certain graininess and lack of pictorial sharpness that manages to blur the foreground and background. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the narration is off-key in everything, as if Cimino could not decide how the effect he is looking for. He wanted an epic, for sure. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film is uncomfortable and unconvincingly between styles and perhaps even genres. Sometimes he reminded me of "Days of Heaven" by Terrence Malick or even "Elvira Madigan" in his languid rhythm and elegant pictorial scene. Other times he threatens to turn into a sturdy "western" more like "The Wild Bunch". Indeed, this last film offers an instructive point of reference for an evaluation of "Heaven's Gate" because it shares the same interest of the period and uses a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a more obscure and heroic America. <br /> <br /> This structural and thematic uncertainty is not helped by the poor quality script that often seems forced and shocking to the ear. The result is an inauthentic sense of the discourse of the period. <br /> <br /> The almost greatness of Heaven's Gate lies in its pieces. The roller skating sequence, in particular, is incredibly beautiful, one of the most evocative scenes ever filmed in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Another scene that works very well in terms of theme, mood and unifying setting occurs when Kristofferson and Huppert ride their horses in the new rig at the lake and she washes while taking a nap in the shade . The languid rhythm, the evocative music and the monumental scenario are combined in this scene to convincingly portray the love story that could be right at the center of the film - and that could have been his salvation if pursued more convincingly. <br /> <br /> Some critics have complained about the length of the film. This in itself doesn't bother me. A good movie can't be long enough. The restored minutes are essential to restore the motivation and characterization absent from the cut version, and are full of pictorial interest. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main glory of Heaven's Gate lies in the painful evocative soundtrack. The repeated motif of the waltz and its different markings (full band, guitar, fiddle soloist, etc.) give the action in the foreground a disturbing quality and establish a thematic coherence devoid of the same narrative. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, especially the absence of a compelling narrative, there is a sense of grandeur of the film. You exit the cinema with a sad sense of lack of grandeur and a desire that Cimino can revisit the film - with the wisdom of time and hindsight, to remedy what is so badly wrong.
