living in Romania, I was almost dumbfounded by the very realistic setting for the scenes and by the great care given to the local details by the director. Anthony Queen's performance is absolutely fantastic, and the rest of the cast does a great job supporting it. The film takes a little knowledge of the Eastern European context to be fully appreciated, but it still remains a great performance with some memorable lines. the ending is perhaps a bit too melodramatic, but in reality this is how people find themselves in this part of the world. I think the script is fantastic, because it presents the horrors of the Second World War in a very original way: no blood, no battlefields. And yet, lives are broken and the smiles that come from time to time in the film are quickly killed by the realities of war that touch the characters.
