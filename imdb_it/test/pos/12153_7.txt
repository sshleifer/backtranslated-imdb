17/02/09 "More" (1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a film that most viewers have agreed is rather mediocre, I am impressed by how many different interpretations have been offered. I have only scoured the web in a short time and have already been informed that "More" is: a 19th century love story, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a simple film full of obtuse people, and of interest only for Pink Floyd outfits. It is therefore fair to say that critical reception is mixed. I would say that these wildly disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder's 1969 directorial debut are sufficient proof that "More" is nothing but a rather mediocre film. <br /> <br /> Nor is it a masterpiece, of course. I approached "More" as I did for Antonioni's "Easy Rider" and "Blowup" - like a "time caps" movie, a snapshot of an era - despite the differences in rhythm, style and content between these films . They all have similar flaws - vague or even improbable characters, acting that seems to drift slightly from reality, relaxed editing and abrupt terminations that have left viewers indignant. These films never try to be persuasive or to meet the public halfway - they are what I am, friend. This in itself is not a problem as long as there remains a memory of the experience. Fortunately, "More" offers several images, sounds and suggestions that are truly memorable to the viewer, and that's what saves it. <br /> <br /> Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris just after his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him while coming into contact with a group of French hipsters, accompanying them in bars and incredibly cool and conscious parties before meeting Estelle. The two characters become sexually and romantically involved and promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of her friend Charlie. This is where the Icarus thing comes into play: she is the sun, he pursues her. Now you may be able to guess how this will end. <br /> <br /> Ibiza is an idyll so far from the busy frenzy of overcrowded Paris that the naive Stefan knows he has to do a good thing. Estelle remains elusive and irregular, and the island has a less desirable womb. Until now I didn't care much about any of these characters and their fuzzy search for a place to be really free, but once the action is reduced to just these two, the film suddenly becomes moving. During a single melancholy exchange of dialogues in the remote villa where they live, the place where their volatile love crystallizes, I went from observing with an optimism on the verge of extinction to being completely ecstatic. I can't think of many other movies that have done this. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human as we can see it pass from the intimacy that defines life to disillusionment and cruel cold. They take a lot of drugs and take off naked on the terraces, on the rocks and on the beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful Mediterranean surroundings. For a while, their situation is the very essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience as an end in itself. But Stefan is not in control, and this is the ruin of something more than his future in Ibiza. <br /> <br /> The Pink Floyd soundtrack is perfect for the exoticism, intimacy and presentiment of "Other". It is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito net around Estelle's bed, and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the cover of the soundtrack disc). A scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin withdrawal is an example of the couple's fundamental flaws: they can't "land" without an accident. Maybe they got too close to what they wanted. <br /> <br /> Stefan never comes into contact with family or friends before he arrives in Paris. We are left to assume that they have no idea where it is. While other films of the counterculture of the 1960s focus on debauchery, excess, media and voyeurism, Schroeder instead presented us with a story centered on a man, who retires to a small corner somewhere in the world and disappears silently.
