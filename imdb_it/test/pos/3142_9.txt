John Ford paid the tribute to his floats with a special image, "Wagon Master" made after two great Indian cavalry epics ... It is an adorable poetic film, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit ... He had no top to the older ones who had preceded it ... <br /> <br /> Photographically, it is extremely simple ... The camera moves only once or twice throughout the film, and never when a director would have made it move to emphasize a blow ... Ford also resists the temptation to track down his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of women walking wearily in the dust behind their wagons ... They come and go while the camera remains motionless and the audience remains a spectator for the march of history, not a participant ... Obviously, when Ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically, as in "Stagecoach", he only knows how to do it ... But "Wagon Master" is a or soft and nostalgic look backwards ... <br /> <br /> Full of traditional Western songs made by The Pioneer Children, tells of the journey from West to Utah (in 1879) of a train of Mormon tanks driven by Ward Bond as Elder Wiggs and two young horse dealers (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr). And in a series of beautiful images, while the train of wagons fights outlaws, Indians and nature in its struggle to reach the "promised land", the modest "Wagon Master" manages to capture the history and legend of the West ... <br /> <br /> Ford himself said that "Wagon Master" (of which he wrote the original story) was among his three films that "came to be what I wanted to achieve". <br /> <br /> Ford's career as a Western director was surprising ... More than anyone else he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about the family, society and American lifestyle .. Ford saw the frontier as a land to be subjugated by a special class of settlers and lawyers whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come later ... These early Westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned, and the civilized inhabitants who followed must always keep them out of fear and respect ... Ford Westerns often employ flashbacks that emphasize the historic authenticity of his approach ... <br /> <br /> In "Wagon Master", for example, popular songs on the soundtrack tell us about the difficulties of the pioneers of a century ago, and Ford shows them to us almost in a documentary way ... In a sequence the train is encamped in a circle and the settlers decide to hold a square dance ... To shape a dance floor they have to lay tables on the desert sand, and with this ritual celebration Ford shows the defeat of the wild nature through the metaphor of embarking on the earth ... <br /> <br /> It's a lovely film, full of wonderful carefree optimism, and is it easy to see why Ford found it so satisfying ?? Never breaks the mood and style of the first sequences ?? But one wonders if the ultra-romantic is better suited to the chosen theme? <br /> <br /> The experience of the train wagon must have been one of the most strenuous and physically more difficult tests of the man (with his woman) has he ever set himself? Must have been riddled with doubts, was I wrong to sell everything and come? How can we hope to survive? How are we going to dispute the other leader ??? almost every other painful step of the path ?? <br /> <br /> However, none of these sensations really comes in "Wagon Master". Travel ?? such is the general ebullience ?? doesn't it hit one as particularly dangerous ?? Could it be, of course, that the Mormons were so "tall" on the religious spirit that this tended to act as an anesthetic ?? In other words, their reactions were not those of normal human weakness ... If so, was Ford right and the skeptics wrong? <br /> <br /> What is beyond doubt is the right and right exuberance, especially at first sight, of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. This is the essence of the adventurous and carefree young woman, particularly that of Western youth of those extraordinary times ?? Is it an extraordinary relationship and remains etched in the mind ??
