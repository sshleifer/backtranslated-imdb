Challen Cates does a marvelous job depicting a bride in conflict, torn between the challenges that await her professionally, the memories of the freedom she thought she had when she was in college (inspired by a famous author) and the security of her suspended marriage with man she really doesn't love. This film certainly deserves to be seen - however predictable, acting is inspiring and the real chemistry exists between Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner.
