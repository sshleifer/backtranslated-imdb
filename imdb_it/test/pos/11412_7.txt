When A Stranger Calls is actually a pretty good movie. I had never seen the original and so when I saw it I thought it was unique. When When A Stranger Calls was advertised on television, the trailer gave away the ending. Well, I've never seen the trailer so when I saw this movie I was surprised how beautiful it was. I spent a day there and decided to buy it and now I'm lucky, because I thought it was a very nice film that is a good movie to own. It's becoming an unfair treatment, and if you're interested in this movie, don't listen to all the negativity. Camille Belle is not an actress as bad as everyone makes her, and she did a great job in this movie, so everyone who hates you will get past you, get calm and actually try to enjoy this movie for what it is; A fun, lively bopper, popcorn movie. If you haven't seen it, do it please, it's much more enjoyable than many of the other wood cutters that have been made recently ...
