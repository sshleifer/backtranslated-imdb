This movie is fantastic! Be a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents ..." I just knew I would like this movie. And I love it. I finally bought a copy of this film earlier this year. However it annoyed me to find out that it had been cut! So I will continue to look at car boot sales for the original version. <br /> <br /> However, the film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) by claiming to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is eager to brag about it one night in the pub and he has nicked it! So Dennis becomes supergrass but the problem is that he doesn't know anything and starts inventing lies and digging into an even deeper hole! The irony of all this is that in Devon there is drug smuggling. <br /> <br /> This film is not as funny as I expected, but it's still a really good movie with some good laughs and a fantastic soundtrack. It also has the best scene ever in a British film (Robbie Coltrane's walk through the pier set at "Two Tribes" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a fan of "The Comic Strip Presents "...", by one of the cast members, or a fan of the British comedy see it soon !!!
