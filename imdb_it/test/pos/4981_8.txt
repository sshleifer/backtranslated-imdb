Extremely Western in the mid-1950s, it contains a lot of things in just 96 minutes. Most of the spectators will soon be attracted to this story and will find the experience quite pleasant. More than a B-Western but not exactly an epic, the budget was modest and the cast was accessible despite several big names. Glenn Ford was the only box office draw at the moment. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck had passed their first and looking for work, Stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in "The Big Valley". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster were just starting out. <br /> <br /> Ford plays John Parrish, a small breeder who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is killed by the big farmer's killer (Robinson). Parrish is a former Confederate officer who moved only westward for health reasons. <br /> <br /> Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest, making a promise to his wife Martha (Stanwyck). Lee was paralyzed in a land war that he fought 12 years earlier; his brother Cole (Keith) arrived from Texas to help him manage the huge spread. Lee turned a blind eye to obvious connections between Stanwyck and Keith, but his sensitive daughter Judith (Foster) is understandably upset by what's going on in their home. <br /> <br /> John Parrish has promised his girlfriend Caroline (May Winn) that he will return to the east. Caroline, who is modeled after Grace Kelly's "High Noon" character, interrupts the engagement at the first sign of difficulty and simply disappears from the movie. This leaves the way open for a love story between John and Judith. <br /> <br /> Violence begins early and continues throughout the film, with Parrish able to apply military tactics against an enemy that underestimates his ability and determination. It has a very original comparison with the main gunslinger halfway in the film. Ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest guy who disarms everyone with a self-deprecating way, which is slow to be offended but brutal when finally provoked (very similar to his role in "The Sheepman"). <br /> <br /> Robinson is also excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even if physically he is only a shadow of his previous self. And he gets enough lines and screen times to properly develop his character. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck has the most difficult role and is not simply as convincing as the classic two-faced woman, a seemingly loyal wife who is planning to replace her husband with her brother. In part this is due to the fact that she is not given enough time to do anything more than superficially transmit both sides of the character. That being said, a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations. <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. It should remind viewers of a lot of Carroll Baker, both physically and acting. Although it is required to play Judith according to the convention of the 50s (she is allowed to be tough but then needs to break into hysterics after every big fight), Foster shows a good range. It conveys a growing attraction for Parrish, but it does so subtly that it is only in retrospect that the various clues snap into place. <br /> <br /> The real problem with "The Violent Men" is that it tries to be both a western action and a morality game for character study. Because so much has to happen on the screen that much of the action is rushed and many of the characters receive only superficial treatment. This is not a fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film, but it could have been significantly better with another 20 minutes of execution or the absence of unnecessary characters like Caroline. <br /> <br /> So once again, what should I do? know? I'm just a kid.
