Does this start a series (which I hope I will keep every weekend) of films released during my childhood? in this case, it's one I've managed to capture just now. It was clearly intended as the last word on the subject, which had basically been degraded to the level of the hokum over the years; however, in his uncompromising effort for a serious approach (a certain measure of what it is that the protagonist has never been reported by the name that has been known throughout this time all over the world!), the filmmakers have lost track of the fact that it was intended primarily as entertainment! As a result, do we get a decidedly serene representation of the events? with more attention given to the meticulous reconstruction of the period than to provide a functional thematic environment for its mythical jungle hero! Even so, Christopher Lambert rose to fame ?? how did another rookie, Andie McDowell, play his love interest (named Jane, of course) ?? with the role of the title, which manages quite well according to the circumstances. However, Ralph Richardson (to whom the film is dedicated, this is his swan song) steals every scene in which he finds himself as Tarzan's natural grandfather who, despite showing obvious affection for his long-lost relatives, does not he manages to forget tradition in an effort to understand his situation; the hero, in fact, is much more at ease in entertaining with the primates (even inventing himself, after returning home, to save his adoptive father from captivity). The film is otherwise very beautiful to look at (with Stanley Kubrick's cinematography, regular John Alcott, no less), does it have an appropriately grandiose score and even remarkable makeup effects (by Rick Baker) ?? and, although essentially disappointing as an output from Tarzan, it still retains considerable value as a prestige image of its time.
