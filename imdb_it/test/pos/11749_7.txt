"Love is a Many-Splendor Thing" is set in Hong Kong in 1949-50 and tells the story of the relationship between Mark Elliott, a white American journalist, and Han Suyin, a semi-Chinese half-European doctor. The story of a mixed-race love affair was a rather daring theme for the fifties and, as often happened, Hollywood tried to soften the blow by throwing a white actress like the apparently non-Caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man, something that would be considered politically incorrect today, but was quite acceptable then .. (Think, for example, of the casting of Ava Gardner on "Show Boat" or Natalie Wood on "West Side Story") The setting of the story in a British colony it was perhaps also a way of exploring racial issues in a way that would have caused less controversy in America. Suyin loses her job in a hospital in Hong Kong because her British superiors are an exception to the fact that she goes out with a white man, who is unable to marry because the separated wife will not grant him a divorce. As has sometimes happened, European colonialism has been made the scapegoat for some of its failures. Imagine the fury that would have been unleashed if a similar film had been made about a doctor of a black or mixed-race woman in a hospital in Alabama. <br /> <br /> In addition to racial issues, the film also raises issues of international politics, referring to both the seizure of communist power in China and the outbreak of the Korean war. Han Suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the period; in reality it tended to support the communist regime of Mao, but here it is shown as strongly anti-communist. This is not, however, primarily a "problematic" film about racism or politics, but rather a novel, a good example of what would have been known at that time as "a woman's painting". These films, although mostly made by male directors, were mostly aimed at women. They dealt with love and romance - often unhappy romanticisms - from the point of view of women, and they had a strong feminine character in the main role. The genre often provided roles for older actresses than the heroes of standard novels. The previous examples were normally in black and white, but in the fifties generally, as in this case, they used luxuriant and sumptuous colors. <br /> <br /> Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role, Jennifer Jones does a great job as Suyin. I found William Holden, like Mark, rather not very charismatic, but that doesn't really matter since Suyin is the dominant figure. It's much more screened than Mark, and the film examines his family and professional life far more than his own does. Although Jennifer was still extraordinarily beautiful, she was about thirty-five, rather older than the romantic heroines of the films of that period. Holden was about the same age, unusually for the fifties when "boy-girl meets" often meant "the oldest man meets girl". <br /> <br /> The film is not particularly profound, but it is well done with some attractive photography, particularly that of Hong Kong, reflects the growing trend in the fifties for shooting outdoors rather than in the studio. Hong Kong has rarely looked so good; the view from a hill overlooking the city takes on special significance, since here Suyin and Mark go for their romantic assignments. The general atmosphere is a poignant and condemned love story, a mood enhanced by atmospheric photography and musical score, including one of the most memorable themes of the film ever written. 7/10
