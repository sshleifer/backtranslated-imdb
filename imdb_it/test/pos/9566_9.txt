This film is not a comedy, it is an exhibition. I've always hated dog shows, considering the ridiculous people who put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give him. So the reason for my uncontrolled laughter while watching this movie. I take a kick from something that is taken so seriously, even if the gains are small and insignificant. It's like playing miniature golf, or jumping championships or roping or the need to set some obscure world record. The acting was much more refined in this Waiting for Guffman film, and is mainly due to the greater fluidity of the characters, who seem more at ease with their acting partners in this film than the previous ones. Eugene Levy was exceptional, as were Michael McKean and Fred Willard. However, it was the dogs that eventually stole the show. But then again, who wants to see a lot of humans in a dog movie anyway.
