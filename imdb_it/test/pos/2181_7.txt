This cheapo remake of the terrifying Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting. Humphrey Bogart plays the role of manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate for relaxation assessments. The owner decides to write a series of morality works on a famous murder case 20 years ago. Then they hire the fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the murderer, who was acquitted and lived quietly with a false name. The preacher arrives on his daughter's wedding day, but the ruthless radio station refuses to expose his mother and ruin his life. <br /> <br /> Bogart is always good. Hayden is good at the slimy preacher, and Henry O'Neill is as good as his father. All the others are simply horrible. Helen McKeller has no sympathy (crucial for the role), Linda Perry is a disgusting actress, Beverly Roberts is OK but always looks old, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no parts, Carlyle Moore is a wretch like the boy, Virginia Brissac discontent as the mother of the company, Robert Middlemas is the master of the station. <br /> <br /> This comes in less than an hour but is a pale copy of the original boasting dynamic performances by Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon, Frances Starr and Boris Karloff. But it's always worth watching Boagrt.
