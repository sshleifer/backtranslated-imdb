(The review is from the original 1950s version, not the restored version from the 1980s). In a land where the king does not love anyone and nobody likes the king, a shepherdess and a chimney sweep of two neighboring paintings come to life and escape. A portrait of the king, who loves the shepherdess, kills the true king and takes his place. A huge bird, the wonder of the title, acts like a hero and helps our two lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a strange strange film ... not surreal, very, very, very surreal. /> <br /> The background style is very European, while the characters are Fliescher who meets Warner but at the beginning Warner of the non-main characters. They move in both realistic and comic ways. <br /> <br /> This is a strange film and it takes a while to get into it but Peter Ustinov seeing as the bird is a riot, his children and the puppy are wonderful. There are cops in rubber ducks and a drawing of a bear that makes you smile. <br /> <br /> And there is a profound philosophy in the film, about the existence of a world out there ... beyond an underground metropolis. <br /> <br /> This is a really nice movie. There is something so strange and unique that it rewards you if you stay with it throughout the ride. It's not perfect but what the hell. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to look for. If your local bargain DVD basket has the capcom version (paired with Alice in Paris) buy it. It should bring you less than ten dollars, probably around five o'clock, and the price is absolutely worth it, especially when you realize that it comes with two cartoons, two short cartoons and various commercials and other fun stuff.
