Down Periscope is not a "big movie". But very few gestures again. So if you are looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom, this is a "great movie", without the capitals. No strong sexism or graphic violence ruin this light comedy about a group of misfits assigned to an ancient submarine. They are destined to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star. They must hire the entire US navy with its nuclear submarines. But they are losers and this is a comedy, so you can guess the result. But you're rooting for those losers and this makes it a very funny movie. Look and enjoy ******** (eight stars that is)
