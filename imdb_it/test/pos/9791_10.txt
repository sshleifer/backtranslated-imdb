This is just my favorite movie ever. Nothing special. It's so incredibly detailed. It makes me cry just thinking about it. Geronimo Bill is the nicest guy you can imagine. Money is not important. Bamboo spears are important. You don't need money to get what you need. If you need something, you will come to you. If people realized that the world would be a much better place. Whatever you do, don't do it for the money.
