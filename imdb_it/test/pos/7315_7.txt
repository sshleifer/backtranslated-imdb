I found this more chaotic than Stooges' average short (as strange as it may seem). There were lots of fun parts, especially the gags that ran ("Call Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!", The glass door breaks, the Stooges run into the furniture room and come back out with ... well, I know it), but even a little of it was taken up with things that made no sense to me. I have to assume that these were generally the take-off of scenes from the movie "Men In White", but since I don't know much about that film I can't say for sure. Perhaps if someone could explain them, I would appreciate much more.
