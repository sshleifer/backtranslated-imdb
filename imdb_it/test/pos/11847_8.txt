I was very impressed with this film, if only for the comedy. It may not be the most fun and cheerful humor at all times, but I found it appropriate for every scene. <br /> <br /> The flow of the film is certainly a bit confusing, sometimes confusing, but that's how the characters feel Sometimes, we're looking at some slapstick and other scenes revolve around a decisive speech on relationships. This could be a bit frustrating for some viewers, but it brought me closer to the dilemmas of the characters of irregular chaos. <br /> <br /> Acting is great for everyone. I'm a huge Andy Richter fan, but I wasn't baffled by how he looks like everyone else is. He did very well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show for me, both in their respective ways. Jay Mohr behaves as expected, if you've seen him in other movies. I've always liked it. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a lot of fun and offers some nice bases for some types of relationships. When it comes to relationship issues and problems, some films try to surprise. There is nothing surprising in the conclusions offered here, but it is fun to see them being revealed throughout the film.
