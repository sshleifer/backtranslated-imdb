Another great Hollywood Golden Age musical! I liked the story of this movie about a trio of friends performing in a small nightclub far from Broadway and its glitters. Although it is not the big time, they are very happy with their life and the small club they perform. Gene Kelly is the owner of the small club and is also the fianc√© of one of her dancers, Rita Hayworth, who seems to attract attention when she is offered the opportunity to be on the cover of a magazine. The trouble starts for Gene Kelly while his girlfriend is now talking about the city. Phil Silvers plays one of three friends and does a good job. Obviously there is music and dance. One dance show by Gene Kelly stands out. He is walking alone along the street at night and sees his reflection in a shop window. His reflection soon starts to dance with him in the streets, a great cinematography. Don't miss this, great entertainment.
