Unfortunately this original mix of action and laughter is kept away from movie fans while rotting in the Columbia vaults for eternity. A pity given that this could be Jack Starrett's strongest film and presents a witty script of a young Terrence Malick and performances completely made by his two protagonists Stacey Keach and Frederic Forrest who turn into a life of crime so they can get the money to open a fish restaurant. Many prominent scenes include the bathtub and electric razor interrogation, and an intense shooting in an abandoned building while being demolished by a demolition ball!
