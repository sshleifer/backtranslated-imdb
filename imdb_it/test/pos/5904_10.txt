Mon Oncle Antoine observes the steep face of a community of houses from various angles, slowly, taking its time from the beginning, as it should, until we emerge from shattered (but trivial) hopes and expectations in swirling ecstasies of dreams and a heart stopping the revelation on the terrible enigma of mortality. <br /> <br /> The pots and the non-oriented zoom through the snowy mountain comfort the mind and hypnotize the viewer. This restless photographic work is personified in a marginal character who is also the vagabond, leaving his work in the coal mine and leaving his family to cut lumber, and then quit smoking and return to the dead humanity of his dead boyfriend. <br /> <br /> A creepy old woman cheats on her husband and a young boy dies. Old things become new and new things die. In all it is the snow-white whiteness, as surprised as the history of cinema.
