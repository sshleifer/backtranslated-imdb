Honestly, at first I didn't think this movie would make me laugh to death and admire the great effects of blood, boy was I wrong! From beginning to end the film showed some great gore effects accompanied by a parody of other titles like "Evil Dead" and "Gremlins". This film could be compared to Peter Jackson's artwork, although this film is not as gory as "Braindead", but I'm sure these guys will make another splatter movie.
