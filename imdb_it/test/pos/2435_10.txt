This amusing and sometimes moving look from the Hollywood genre of the 1940s and 1950s Robert Curci as a retiring former unnamed cop uses his life's savings to pay for plastic surgery to turn his image into his own idol, Humphrey Bogart, then organizes the store as a private eye with the name "Sam Marlowe". Robert Sacchi, incidentally, is one of the few rare Bogart imitators who had the lisp exactly the right way; more to the point, the body and the facial language are there. For a while, the only customer of "Sam" is his landlady, who wants him to find his underestimated boyfriend, and his only secret is his secretary, simply called "Dutchess" (Misty Rowe), who in his own words, "he looked like Marilyn Monroe and has a sense very similar to that of Gracie Allen", and has a passion for banana split. Then he meets Elsa (Olivia Hussey), the simple, sweet, virginal daughter of a retired landlord who was murdered for no visible reason. In the process of investigating the murder, Sam soon crosses: the identical daughter of Gene Tierney (Michelle Phillips) of Anastas, a greedy and obscenely wealthy tycoon full of Greek expeditions (Victor Buono, turning into a credible Sidney Greenstreet), his unfortunate , for a long time second suffering wife (Yvonne deCarlo, who succeeds in acting in a variety of putrefied emotions without saying a word), her two henchmen (Herbert Lom, who channels Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson, making a reasonably precise Lionel Atwill) and Anastas' vicious, amoral Middle Eastern potentate (Franco Nero) who comes complete with a glamorous and flattering lover (Sybil Danning), who would give anything to acquire the "Eyes of Alexander", two enormous perfectly matched star sapphires. When Elsa is killed, Marlowe's interest in solving the case becomes personal and starts through a maze of landmarks in Los Angeles, including the Hollywood Bowl, the scatological and esoteric attractions of Hollywood Boulevard and the island of Santa Catalina in pursuit of the rocks, determined to reach them before one of the two rich competitors. Throw the cameos of Mike Mazurki and other assorted, the traditional mute but comprehensive ally of the police, and a plethora of well-designed characters that provide a dimension to practically all the players, and despite an unfortunate title, you owe my mind, a really enjoyable cinema experience.
