Most people absolutely don't know that this film exists. Fox, who paid the judge to do it, kept it in the can for quite a while and then spent nothing to promote it. I imagine he made sure that many people thought it was one of the junk movies that were downloaded in late summer. Well, I'm here to tell you that this is a funny and rather terrifying look for a future that is not hard to believe. Basically, Judge advances the idea that fools can overcome the cunning by a wide margin. Then these fools are getting dumber, spending almost all their time watching TV and having sex, which makes them more stupid. By 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will seem a genius, who speaks "all faggy". Seriously, it's really hard to believe. Oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is as big as the time-traveling army boy, desperately trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story will gain its cult status is with the many amusing jokes, such as "we can family style" and "hey man, I'm bating here!" This is a fun movie and a pretty keen social commentary on an American company that seems to be enchanted by personal pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee you that I will buy it on DVD the first day it will come out and watch it and beyond.
