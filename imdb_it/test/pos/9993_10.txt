if you look at it at home on DVD or Bluray! make sure you have a great sound system. the soundtrack through this is what moves you through the film. I saw the movie several times and thought it was great, but after updating my home theater sound system, what a difference. I will watch this movie many, many more times. <br /> <br /> if you don't have a great sound system. find a friend who does it and looks at it there. <br /> <br /> also look at the extra stories and the extras behind the scenes that come with it (the BR or the DVD.) Quimet's interview in the 60s speaks of his scholarship fund ... but for those times only the boys understood it. today I hope some things will go to the girls .......
