I loved this movie and spent several years trying to do it. It is not available and has not been on TV for many years. I had fun and the songs because he had something different to say and made you think about how each person looks at something from different perspectives. Furthermore we often do not appreciate something we have until it is no longer there. <br /> <br /> My 12 year old daughter has just discovered music and is ecstatic with some of the songs. One day I hope to get a copy of the film so I can have the opportunity to see it. (Oh I'd love to see it too!) <br /> <br />
