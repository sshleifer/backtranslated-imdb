Woaww Is it only now that you notice the connections between all the characters? Of course it's Libby! And for the guy in the door with Desmond, any deja vu ??? Yes !! He was the "same" boy who gave money to Sayid after killing or torturing the other soldier in season 14 of season two: One of Them. Well, actually he's not completely the same guy, his name is Joe in the 14th episode and Kelvin in the last 2 episodes. Gemini ?? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm I'm not even sure :) There are hundreds of links like this among all the characters. <br /> <br /> But it was only in response to Libby's comment. <Br /> <br /> I found those 2 much more interesting episodes of the whole season 2. Throughout the season I felt that there are many things that I lost and very few things I learned. Especially at the beginning, the 1st episode of the 2nd season is excellent, and then the 2nd is a sort of flashback of the first ... I found it disappointing even though I'm pretty sure that everything in Lost tends to have a meaning This was just an example of how frustrated I was watching those episodes. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the last 2 episodes. I think we learned new things in those 2 episodes throughout the season. But all we learn are little pieces for the next puzzle, like the involvement of Desmond's "relatives" (sorry if I mess up too much, believe me or not, I'm trying not to) for example. So many things evoked in the last 2 seasons are not yet clear or have been developed once nothing. Yet there is new material as if all the holes in the photo were not enough. We all want to see the big picture of this, of course, but I think we will have to be very patient. I hope there will be only 3 seasons. I'm not sure I will watch more than 3 seasons anyway. There were also many actions in the last episode. And a good cliffhanger at the end. <br /> <br /> So basically, yes, I loved that last episode ... and yes, I want to see the third season.
