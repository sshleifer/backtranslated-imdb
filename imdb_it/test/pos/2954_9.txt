I always thought my father had a second life and I was looking forward to the development of 51 Birch Street when I sat down and saw it for the first time. Surprisingly, the journey of this film took me to places I didn't expect and made me think back to assumptions and judgments. Truly an extraordinary personal story told in an intelligent but direct way. I particularly appreciated the director's use of bringing out the type of his mother's daily diary - very effective. I read the previous comment and would like to note that the sound went well when I saw it and I suspect that the film was modified in some way or that the theater could have contributed to the poor quality of the other writer's sound.
