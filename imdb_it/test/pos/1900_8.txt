The various Law & Order and CSI series should be happy that Dolomite does not pass. The policemen, the ADAs and the coroners will all be fascinated and the males will be subjected to so much thrilling speed, a badge that melts at speed (you wouldn't just like to see David Caruso's Horatio and know everything about CSI to get the Dolomite Ice Hush puppies T could start crying and go back to Playa Trail. <br /> <br /> Low budget, bad but enthusiastic acting and a vision of what the gutbucket nightclubs offered to its patrons: funk groups, soul singers, the latest vestiges of the Chitlin Circuit entertainers (that strange dance company) James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and a host of others came from those clubs to glory, while their peers worked in the local or regional celebrity Rudy Ray Moore came from that background and the character of Dolomite is a mix of daring Black badasses that they have broken in. He shouldn't have gone to the spinel, the pigs didn't have a mandate, like his half self and It is a mystery that only a student of seven can explain, but all that is beside the point. It is a glorious home movie of a legendary artist who, compared with the mirrors of actors ranging from established Hollywood to Russian indie films, hits his brand. A funny and stupid movie!
