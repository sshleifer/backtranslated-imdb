Do you know those films that are obviously terrible but you can't help but love them? Well, this is Evil Ed, perhaps the best horrible movie in the world. The sound is rubbish, dubbing is crap, the script doesn't make sense and the special effects are pap. However, I can't help but love this movie at a high price and have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the guy who plays it) should be present in the Actor's Studio series because it's so memorable. Perhaps the worst villain in the film isn't called Tony Montana. Seriously, if you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed. Keep a carefree approach to watch this movie and soon you will rank it ten.
