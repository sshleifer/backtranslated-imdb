Drew Barrymore gets a second chance in high school, on undercover assignment as a journalist. In flashback, we see that the first time was, to put it mildly, a serious disaster. David Arquette is fun in the modest role of Drew's brother, who also enrolls to help his sister. A lot of subplots endanger but never overwhelm the simple charm of the film. Drew continues to make his niche as a light sexy-innocent comic actress.
