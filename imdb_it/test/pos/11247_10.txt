I'm sure all Canadians on IMDb are too familiar with Canadian content, and how much is ... well, let's say, sluggish. There are some few Canadian shows that are worth watching, however, this is definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> Simple premise. Two boys who gather girls in a bar with certain guidelines and rules, add some witty and intelligent comments from a group of surprisingly nice "Alpha-Males" and made a very fun program. Each episode is solid. If the "players" are sub-par, there are some embarrassing moments to do, and there's some fun hitting them. If the "players" are good, it takes you to moments where you just have to stand up and applaud, and some comic praises lavished on them. <br /> <br /> The premise is a little sloppy, I know, and like a guy who is usually proud of the fact that I'm rising above the typical, terrible television reality, it takes a lot to admit that this show is actually fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing that needs to be emphasized is how The Comedy Network did a terrible marketing job on this show. For a long time I didn't even know the premise, and all I knew was that there was somehow a naked torso that "loved the pumas" involved. However, after watching the show, I was surprised by how surprisingly polished it appears for Canadian content (despite a rather weak sequence of opening credits). So give it a chance. I have yet to find someone in the demographic target (18-30 year olds) who actually saw the show (and not just the annoying commercials) that he didn't like. <br /> <br /> Bring it back for a third season, Comedy Network. Actually it has a good premise, unlike some other Canadian shows you've had (coughs * girls will be girls * coughs). I usually ask myself 10/10 for "works of art", but I have so much fun watching this show and I think it was unfairly judged by many, which I had to do.
