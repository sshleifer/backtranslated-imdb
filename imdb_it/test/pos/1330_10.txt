With a cast like this, I knew that acting would be great. However, I was cautious, as sequels always are. Would you support the feeling of the first movie? Could they perhaps replicate the tension and the thrill of the masterful fury of Ocean's 11? We will never know, because they have not tried. At least, not the way I expected. Instead, they made a light and really funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a logical and compelling raptus, don't look at it. If you want a good laugh, with witty dialogues, bizarre characters and an absolutely brilliant scene in which Julia Roberts has to impersonate herself, then you'll love Ocean's 12.
