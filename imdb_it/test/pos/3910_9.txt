I heard many different opinions about this film and then found out that even Paris Hilton was present, she didn't give me the best impression of the movie .... so being dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and I sit there expecting a lot of pants I was shocked to find that I was scared for the whole movie ... it was predictable but the accumulation of deaths and the whole atmosphere of the movie made it REALLY scary for me ... I was looking through my fingers for everything path. So I say watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that it's a scary movie doesn't convince you to go see it, then there will also be Chad Michael Murray who can't be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh?
