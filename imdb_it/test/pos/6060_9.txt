Jack Webb is compelling as a Marine Corp drill instructor in the D.I .. Webb plays Sgt. Jim Moore, a tough but loyal marine who is tasked with preparing young teens for possible combat. No one could have played this role better than Jack Webb. As a former marine, I can assure you that this is the most accurate film that deals with basic training in the Corp. Extremely fun!
