Midnight Madness is a film that is unfortunately underestimated and little appreciated. With a flood of classic "teen-college" films, this has been forgotten. As a child I watched this movie over and over again, luckily I got it on video. This film shows a more docile side, but more exciting than the eighties. In the cynical society we live in nowadays, with the abuse of drugs that is the most "beautiful" thing, it's nice to see, once in a while, a funny and innocent movie that is Midnight Madness ... that is if you find it .
