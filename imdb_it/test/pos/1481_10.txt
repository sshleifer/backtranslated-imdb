I loved this movie too. My only problem is that I thought the actor who played the villain was a low rent from Michael Ironside. Of course Ironside is just a low rent, Jack Nicholson. I imagine Mike was busy that year with "Highlander 2: The Quickening". Unfortunately "Beastmaster 2" would have been a much better career move. It is certainly the best of the Beastmaster series and in many ways is reminiscent of the great classic of the big screen "Masters of the Universe". In addition to acting in the incomparable Mark Singer, he also features an extraordinary supporting cast, most notably the "Sliders" second girl, "Fresh Prince of Belair" uncle Phil and the "Superman 2" evil girl. It has shaken my world and is certainly a must for anyone who does not have social or physical stores. BEASTMASTER FOR EVER !!! ROCK N ROLL !!!
