I saw this movie years ago and never forgot it. The theme is very topical. He was on TCM this morning and I wonder why this wonderful film is not on VHS or DVD. I searched extensively for this film but can't find it. I believe that if people asked enough, the film will ultimately be put on DVD. It amazes me that such an extraordinary performance by Quinn and such a powerful plot are not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must see for teachers and students. This film is a great educational tool of the past and in many ways contemporary as "Crash". From the previous comments I can see that this film has aroused profound impressions on everyone. Once again, too bad that it is not available for sale.
