Launch Momma has not dated at all, it's so funny now as when it was released. A genuinely eccentric comedy that does not strain too much to be appreciated and is even better, full of memorable loud laughter. Even the little characters are well written and well interpreted, like the girlfriend of Billy Crystal's best friend, and a nice cameo by Rob Reiner as Crystal's agent. A bit crazy and a lot of fun.
