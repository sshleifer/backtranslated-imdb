I saw this movie on PBS for the first time. Then I bought the video and saw it countless times. Every time I look at it, I can get something else out of it. It is a true testament to want to maintain a good life, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to keep the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte, don't want things to change. The general tone and mood are excellent. The cast is exceptional with stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And it's fun to see the next stars before they reach more recognizable films, like Kevin J. O'Connor (The Mummy) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black and Law & Order: Criminal Intent - one of my favorite shows). It's just one of those movies that is with you.
