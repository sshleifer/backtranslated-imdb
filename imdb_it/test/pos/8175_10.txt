A fantastic film. <br /> <br /> A great love story. A lot of sword fighting. Huge battle scenes. Heroes and villains Real history. <br /> <br /> Few people in the West know much about Chinese history. Chin Zchaundi founded China. The country is in fact called by its name. Some are familiar with the recently unearthed terracotta army. This is a historical epic of how it ended the period of contending states and unified China. He founded a dynasty that lasted only 14 years but was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty that permanently defined Chinese civilization. <br /> <br /> Chin (or the king of Zheng as he was before he founded the empire was roughly contemporary with Scipione, Hannibal and Fabius in the West. The parallel domination of the Roman world (western and eastern world) was achieved without an imposing personality like Chin It would not have been for another century before the West produced Caesar - the nearest comparable western figure. <br /> <br /> Chin is shown very nicely here at the beginning, but it develops in the course of the film in a ruthless despot.The story only records the ruthless part of the despot but the nice start leaves room for the development of the real character during this long film.The famous story of the encounter with the murderer is true "Like any two-thousand-year-old anecdote can be. Gong Li is adorable. She is the emotional core of the story. All this makes making a film exceptional."
