Can a film be too faithful to the book on which it is based? Judging from the 2003 adaptation of the huge 2003 seller of Khaled Hosseini, the answer is rather ironically "yes". Like many, I was fascinated by the book, an impressive first effort by the Afghan-American writer / doctor. So, of course, there was director Marc Forster ("Stranger Than Fiction") and screenwriter David Benioff ("Troy"), who pay meticulous attention to the most significant details of the story within the film's 127-minute duration. Yet, the seamless tapestry of events heard in Hosseini's novel often appears as episodic and truncated because Forster and Benioff are sincerely trying to remain faithful to the reach of history within the limits of time. Part of the challenge is how Hosseini carefully used symbolic acts to provide literary symmetry, then and now, to what is essentially a three-act story, a technique that may seem a little invented on screen. <br /> <br /> However, filmmakers do the most important things in the right way, giving the viewer an intimate look at a hidden culture that has been transmitted through CNN news so far, ensuring authenticity with the characters they speak in the Dari Persian dialect of the Afghan language and capturing the emotional intricacies of the complex narrative. The first part of the film is set in 1978 in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion and the possible acquisition of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of a wealthy businessman named Baba, and the devoted Hassan, son of his father's servant. Connected by mutual love for kite running, the two are thick as thieves until a tragic event separates them beyond repair. Unable to find the courage that comes so naturally to his father, Amir is paralyzed by the guilt for not having saved Hassan from an unspeakable act performed by a trio of local bullies. Forster makes the ethnic tensions between Hazara and Pashtun in Afghanistan particularly palpable. <br /> <br /> During the 1979 invasion by Soviet troops, Amir and Baba fled to the United States where history resumed their history nine years after Fremont, California, a suburban enclave of Afghan emigrants. Baba is reduced to working in a gas station and operating in a flea market kiosk. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and gets married. This is the least interesting passage in the film since Benioff's treatment gives little importance to ancillary characters like Amir Soraya's wife and, more particularly, Amir is interpreted by the need as a reticent young man with a cast descending towards his self-esteem . The last section flashes forward twelve years in which Amir, after the publication of his first book, is recalled to Afghanistan dictated by the Taliban to save Hassan's son from the Taliban, as a means to atone for his cowardice years earlier. There is real suspense and fear generated in this part of the story as shocking revelations and old acquaintances return to haunt Amir during his journey. <br /> <br /> A British actor of Egyptian heritage, Khalid Abdalla (the lead hijacker in "United 93") has the central role of Amir as an adult, a stimulating role since he must convey a constant sense of shame and decreased self-esteem until the end. The other professional actors are better - Shaun Toub (the savior of Tony Stark Yinsen in the current "Iron Man") as Baba's business partner, Rahim Khan, who holds the key to truth; Atossa Leoni quietly slicing like Soraya; and above all, the Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi who brings pride and dignity to Baba. Three young non-professionals have been recruited from the Kabul school system to play the key roles of children, and everyone is pretty good. Zekeria Ebrahimi is up to the challenge of the tougher part of the young Amir, and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is moving as the almost fatal son of Hassan, Sohrab. But it is Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada with the sad eyes and the face of the moon that will break your heart like the young Hassan, especially in the devastating scene of the pomegranate launch. It is fair to say that his performance is on par with the young Enzo Staiola in the classic "Ladri di biciclette" by Vittorio de Sica. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are well done, in particular, the clean cinematography of Roberto Schaefer (Western China convincingly substitutes for Afghanistan), the evocative soundtrack of Alberto Iglesias and even the CGI effects that show kites in turbulent flight. The 2008 DVD has a solid series of extras that begin with a discerning comment from Forster, Hosseini and Benioff, although some of their dialogues seem rather forced. There are two featurettes included - the first is "Words from the Kite Runner" of 14 minutes, which focuses on the connection of Hosseini with the history and development of the novel, and the second is "Images from the kite hunter" of 25 minutes "a more standard aspect behind the scenes of the production. Completing the extras are the original theatrical trailer, some previews and a PSA by Hosseini on helping Afghans during their current time of need.
