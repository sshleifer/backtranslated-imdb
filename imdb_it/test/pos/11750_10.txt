I just got back from this movie and can only wonder if we'll see films like this more or less? Timeless music, the tender voices of William Holden and Jennifer Jones leave this adult man crying through joyous and romantic scenes and I'm not one who cries very often in life. Where did our William Holden go and do more of these moving films? It's sad to have to realize that they probably won't do it but they won't think about it, just try to block it from your mind. Even so, they won't have Holden and even he won't appear on that hill even once. You can enjoy this movie and watch it again.
