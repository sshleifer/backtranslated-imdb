I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why - I'm sure some shrinks could do something about it!) I spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago, so I knew I'd never go back further back - I got the individual version of "scared straight"! (I was locked up in an isolation cell on Alcatraz for a couple of hours, compliments of a park ranger, but that's another story!) However, genre really interests me. The soundtrack, in particular the "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones, was the perfect background for the film. So far, I think of "The Jericho Mile" every time I listen to the song.
