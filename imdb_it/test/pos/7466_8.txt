I had the honor tonight to see a screening of the film "These Girls" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. Entering the film, I knew very little about it and I took advantage of it just because the film's plot seemed interesting. So, as they entered the theater a few hours ago, I wondered what the final verdict would be with thumbs up. <br /> <br /> "These girls" is the story of three best friends from a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after high school, but her father continues to push her to go to college, which she doesn't want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) will go to a Christian school after the summer. And finally, Glory (Amanda Walsh) who plans to spend her summer baby-sitter. But this summer it will be special because everyone blackmails Keith Clark (David Boreanaz), the old sexy baby-sitting piece. Fun times and lots of laughs come from it ?? <br /> <br /> Normally I don't like films like "These Girls" but there is something in this film that I really liked. I think the quality I liked best is that it looks pretty realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality choose a big boy who makes everyone have sex with him just to be blackmailed by them later. It's a pretty funny story about growth, friendship and sex, but even if it sounds funny, I can see most of this movie happening in real life. <br /> <br /> The topic here is probably a main reason why this film did not have a mainstream circulation in the United States. All the girls in this film assume they are under 18 and, if I remember correctly, two of them are 17 and one is 16. Now in the United States, even if child sex takes place daily, many production or financial companies will not finance movies like this because of sexual content. This information was actually confirmed by the same director John Hazlett during the Q&A after the film. The thing that strikes me is that the sex scenes in this film are not graphic and the nudity is minor. Not to mention the fact that all the actresses in this film are well over 18 in real life. Go figure. <br /> <br /> What the film does best is that it offers lots of laughs and very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this movie and every character seemed to have a "Now & Then" feature for them. The jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or exaggerated. Everything seemed to flow well both the comedy and the drama. The script was very strong. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good for the most part. I thought all three girls were fantastic. Caroline Dhavernas, who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time "Wonderfalls", was simply fantastic; as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh who both did a great job. David Boreanaz did a good job and looked like he was having fun while shooting most of the scenes. The boy played a head to head so it was fun to see him play that role. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of meeting John Hazlett tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and really enjoyed the comments made in films. I'm shocked that this movie hasn't gone anywhere. I think that with a little marketing behind it could have taken off. Unfortunately it will be one of these films on DVD that so few will ever have the pleasure of seeing. I think with that little budget that Mr. Hazlett had to work, the film went well and I think he did a great job directing this little gem. <br /> <br /> For someone who typically hates teenage sexual comedies I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this movie. The development of the character and the witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused. This is a beautiful comedy because it has a heart and a juice. I know I'll be sure to buy this movie when it comes to DVD on May 16, 2006. If you're a fan of older stories, teenage sexual comedies or romantic comedies, make sure you check out this movie because it's one of the funniest movies of its kind published over the years. <br /> <br /> The final evaluation of MovieManMenzel for "These Girls" is 8/10.
