This is one of those social dramas that WB was able to put together and which were guaranteed in the thirties. These first "childless children" are sent to a reform school where they are abused. Cagney, a gangster as part of an agreement is appointed school commissioner. At first he does not take it seriously, but changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys. The idea is to let the boys govern and administer their community. That this is a valid social reform is beyond my belief, but it is a film. It is very similar to Boys Town in a slightly darker tone. An unnecessary happy ending disappoints the impact on the first difficult stage but it is still good. Later, WB would make these same films with Bogart as Cagney / father.
