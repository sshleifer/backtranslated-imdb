Crack House (1989) was one of the few films of the 1980s that falls into this genre. What should be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than an exercise in the depravity of whites. There is nothing wrong with that though. The video presentation also has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show Richard "turncoat" Roundtree, <br /> <br /> The film follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is almost tough and the other is his girlfriend. One of them is discovered by a mutual friend while the other is given a ride to the slam and later given the chance to return to his former friends. Jim Brown appears as the film's "Mister Big", he is a bad guy who can still punish anyone and he is a very sadistic guy who likes to snap his hoes and beat the tar of those who try to challenge his word. Luke of the General Hospital is also a guest star. <br /> <br /> If you like hard edges, then this movie is for you. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't make them anymore and when they do, it's neither exploitative nor fun. <br /> <br /> Recommended for sleaze fans.
