Werner Herzog again explores the psyche of a man. In "Little Dieter ..." we meet an effervescent and brilliant man, a survivor of the war in Bavaria who saw hunger and strange views, move to the United States and fulfill his dream of being an aviator. War, food, death, survival, hoarding, planes, heads coming out ... how an American is born. Herzog still sees madness as the plane of existence and the surreal merges with the moving as Herzog himself recounts this psychic travel diary of a German who becomes an American who flies with planes in a 20th century war where the climax of technology, pilgrimage and eating out of the trash cans with spoons blend with constant optimism in a man redefined into American. As always with Herzog we find ourselves facing florid madness, genius and what is man in front of his own excesses, social and personal. We laugh and we shudder and we are amazed by this man. Where else for this man if not America?
