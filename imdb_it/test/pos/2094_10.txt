What I got was something better. <br /> <br /> Just like many of the films I commented recently, I couldn't wait to do it for a while. Especially after watching one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, "Blue Spring", which is easily in my top 20 favorite movies. I loved the "9 Souls" trailer, and I thought it sounded very good. I didn't hear anything bad about it. Now I know why. <br /> <br /> This film begins as a kind of comedy, so during the last half of the film, it quickly becomes something else. It becomes more dramatic as each of the characters faces their own tragedies. Each character gets only the time needed for the screen and you care what happens to each of them. Even if there are 9 characters we have to learn, and we take care of you, in just two hours, Toshiaki Toyoda behaves brilliantly. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Blue Spring" I was hoping the soundtrack was at least a little good, like in the movie. I got my wish, because even the soundtrack of "9 Souls" was incredible. The music used in each scene, especially the most dramatic, is simply wonderful. I loved every second of it. <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to see another Toyoda movie by Toshiaki, "Pornstar", but after seeing it, I'll do it. Definitely. Also, because I read the plot for this, and I think it sounds really good. I can not wait. On the R1 DVD of "9 Souls", there are two interviews with Toyoda. He says he has completed another film, and wants to start writing his neighbor's script. I can't wait for both. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. You must see it. Now.
