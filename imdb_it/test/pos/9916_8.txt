I classify OPERA as one of the best Silver films. Trace holes and inconsistencies? Sure, but I don't think they compromise this film like many other reviewers seem to. A lot of the elements that are present in many of the Silver films are a bit "off-the-wall", but it is part of the draw of his films ... <br /> <br /> Tale: psycho chases the new protagonist of the work lady. Silver's typical twists ensue, leading to a decent gain of a climax. It's not the best of Argento, but I pull it out from time to time. Definitely worth a look if you like his other things - don't be fooled by this with the abounding PHANTOM OF THE OPERA remake that Silver did, that's really horrible ... 8/10
