I was not familiar with this film, until I saw it included in a list of the Top 20 Spaghetti Westerns that I recently met (after the marathon I did these last weeks of subgenus films); It was a good omen, therefore, that the film should arrive almost immediately on Italian television late at night (for the first time, I'm quite sure, in a good number of years)! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel on which it was transmitted was not great lately: I recorded the film on VHS but decided not to keep it because of this factor; as it happened, the day after I saw the film, I discovered that it was available on a DVD of the Region 2 in Italy (with an interview with the uncredited screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi) - and, having been sufficiently impressed, I decided to order it there and then, even though I knew I wouldn't get to the DVD for quite a while because I like to give some time between watching a movie and another! A brief parenthesis here: when I recently bought a series of Spaghetti Westerns on Italian DVDs, I decided not to order FACE TO FACE by Sergio Sollima (1967), since I had the impression that it was a bare case; however, I just learned that the record actually contains an interview with the director (as happened with THE BIG GUNDOWN [1966], which I bought). It seemed puzzling to me that Sollima did not offer a similar contribution to the DVD edition of that film when in fact he considered FACE TO FACE his favorite work (according to the biography of the director included in the Blue Underground Region 1 album of another Sollima Spaghetti Western - RUN , MAN, RUN [1968]); the trouble is that I loved THE BIG GUNDOWN so much that I followed it with a vision of FACE TO FACE through the recording I owned made out of Italian TV! I ordered the DVD of that movie now - especially since it's still obvious - but as I said about a second look at THE PRICE OF POWER (although I can still check the interview with Sollima when the album arrives) ... <br /> <br /> OK, don't overdo it: the film in question is an unusual and very interesting Spaghetti Western, indeed ambitious, being a transposition of the JFK murder case in an Old West setting! In fact, he remembers the gloomy black and white thriller by Anthony Mann THE TALL TARGET (1951) - which faced an attempted murder on the life of the then U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. It is characterized by one of the most popular Italian stars of this subgenre, Giuliano Gemma, in what is perhaps his most impressive western role (many of his other films tended to have a slight inclination). The supporting cast includes at least two other notables: Van Johnson (in one of his few and above all insignificant Italian films) as the American president killed in the post-Civil War Dallas and Fernando Rey as head of a conspiracy of the Southerners - who not only plots his murder but also conveniently maneuvering the new American leader who acts, Johnson's vice president, by blackmail! <br /> <br /> Benito Stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who chases Gemma throughout the film, and with whom he has engaged a couple of times in a "duel in the dark" - with guns propped up on the floor rather than the respective holsters and the only light in the room provided by the end of the cowboys' cigars! Ray Saunders was also interested in the role of Gemma's black comrade, who eventually became the doomed figure of Lee Harvey Oswald. Stelvio Massi - who later cut his teeth, as a director, on a number of police officers - is behind the film's luminous cinematography; in the same way, Luis Enrique Bacalov supplies another great "Euro-Cult" column - which is quite different from the style of Ennio Morricone to be equally distinguishable. The direction of Valerii here can be as impressive as that of the other Spaghetti Westerns, but manages the procedures quite efficiently (the last firefight is particularly well done); the film is certainly one of the most underestimated voices in the subgenre and, for those who are so inclined, the novelty of the plot alone should make it something to keep in mind ...
