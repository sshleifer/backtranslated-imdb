a fantastic product for the science fiction film that far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts they have made. Bruce Campbell is in excellent shape as a possible investor who gets involved in a bizarre experiment conducted by a delusional professor, Stacey Keach, and his half-aid, Ted Raimi. The film is pure b gold film and it's nice to see Keach and edit on screen with Bruce, and the fact that most of the film works exclusively on Bruce's comic acting is what makes it hilarious, and makes me ask the question, Why wasn't this guy charged more than his scripts? It's really a sick world. Definitely worth looking at.
