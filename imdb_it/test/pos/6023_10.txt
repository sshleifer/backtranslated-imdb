This is the best version of Gypsy that has been shot. Bette Midler is simply superb as Mama Rose. He has the voice, the gestures, the gaze and, above all, a supreme acting ability to interpret the role and make it character becomes alive. His singing is, simply put: MAGNIFICENT! She especially shines in two numbers: "Everything's Coming Up Roses" and "Rose's Turn". The other actors are fine too, especially Christine Ebersoll as Tessie. Peter Riegert is also excellent, his portrait of Herbie is interpreted with great style and credibility. The direction of this film is very, very good. There is no fake note or gaffe in the whole production. This film represents a huge improvement over the version of Roz Russell filmed in 1962. After seeing it again, I can say that the three biggest Mama Roses are: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler and Angela Lansbury. Watch this movie. You'll be glad you did.
