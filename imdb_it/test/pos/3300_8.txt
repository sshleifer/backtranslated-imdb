I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence of <br /> high-brow NYC, or any major city in mid-century America. The colors, the cars, the clothes and the arrival of the women's movement. It reflects the welcoming and welcoming attitude of relations between men and women in the corporate world of <br /> <br />. In a sense, things have changed and in others, they have not changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but now they have all kinds of laws and rights of equality to get it for them. In <br /> <br /> my opinion, beautiful women will LAUNCH themselves again at the men in <br /> <br /> pursuit of their goals! The laws we now have against harassment and <br /> <br /> have been passed by unattractive women who wanted to have the same chance to compete with nicer women who could get exclusive positions <br /> <br /> in based on their looks and your out! The real competition is not between <br /> <br /> men and women, but women and women! I liked the look of the film, but the world hasn't changed as <br /> as <br /> as what is real
