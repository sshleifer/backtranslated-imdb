Now, I've seen a lot of B-grade movies in my 15 years of life, and I have to say this was one of the best. Personally, I appreciated the real estate and the plot, but suffered from amateur acting (although Adrienne Barbeau gave a decent performance like Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms could not support his part well enough to be considered good. The other show that really suited the film was Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). Start with a real estate agent wishing to bring an Asian couple to a house, only to find that there is a dead girl in the shower of the country house. He progresses with the detective's speculation and introduces key characters with reasonable grace. I think for anyone involved in a giggle at the exaggerated drama that real estate agents provide during exaggerated scenes, this is really a gem ... It's not great, but it's worth being looked at if you're frighteningly bored.
