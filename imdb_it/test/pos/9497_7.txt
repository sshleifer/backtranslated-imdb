I found this film full of irony. But by watching the movie you can almost see what will happen. Leila is a bored and confused domestic wife who is constantly looking for happiness. When he thinks of finding true happiness, he clings to it, leaving all he knows behind him. But he almost finds himself comparing the notes between his ex and his current husband. She learned that if only she communicated more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage, she could have been saved much more easily than she intended it to be. He realizes that words are nothing without action, but he learns too much in his second marriage and finds himself looking back, still hoping for change. The main conflict in this film is Leila vs herself. You cannot have true happiness without being truly happy. I liked this movie, but I would only recommend this movie to women, I can't see a man who really likes this movie.
