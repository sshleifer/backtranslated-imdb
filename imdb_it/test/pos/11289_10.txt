E. Elias Merhige's existentialist experiment in enduring is certainly a hell of a boring watch. This is like something that Alexander de Large was forced to look at in "A Clockwork Orange". But despite how unwatchable this film is, it's a success. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this film and have not seen the movie yet, then it is too late. For me, at least, the payoff (after 3 separate visions with a lot of breaks between you) was seeing the list of characters * after * the story was told. This is when the simple message hit home. But I wonder if Merhige could have told a 5-minute story in about 30 instead of 78. <br /> <br /> However, given how the cast of credits appears in the foreground on the first page of this film, cat is already out of the bag and you will surely enjoy this film only if you appreciate the existentialist film production of the early twentieth century. Even then, you could vomit. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but I recommend Merhige for making a work of art, even if it is unwatchable)
