Nurse Betty is really an interesting film. I guess we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real, that you can't explain them by any means that they're just actors and not real people. <br /> <br /> 'Nurse Betty' is not a nurse at all. In real life, she is a regular housewife who works in a restaurant. To escape her terrible husband and her problems in her miserable life, she became a passionate fan of a soap opera. After seeing her husband being murdered, she suffers a sort of shock and loses all grip on reality. She thinks she's in love with one of the characters in the soap opera, a doctor, and decides that she will visit him and start a family with him. But the killers think they know too much and go looking for it to kill it. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, the subject is quite recognizable (if you leave out professional killers and murder) and the movie was fun. The story was well directed and the actors did a great job. It had everything I always want to see when watching a play. I give him a 7.5 / 10.
