No matter how many times Wy Ethelbert "Famishius Famishius" Coyote tries to get Road "Burnius Roadibus" Runner, we always know what will happen, even if our sympathy always remains with WEC. The highlight of "Hook, Line and Stinker" is a Rube Goldberg style scheme that WEC hopes to finally complete with RR; but, of course, you know what happens. <br /> <br /> So, Wile E. continues to be passionate about fanaticism (defined by George Santayana as doubling your efforts after forgetting your aim) while Road Runner almost never becomes aware of the potential danger - or not - in which he could find himself. A true classic. <br /> <br /> And yes, the second name of the coyote is Ethelbert. I learned it from "Jeopardy!"
