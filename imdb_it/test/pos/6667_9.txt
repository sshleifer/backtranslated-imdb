I really enjoyed this movie. I had read the book ten years ago and was intrigued by how it would have been translated into film. <br /> <br /> The script is very faithful to the book, of which I was fascinated - this is a rarity in itself these days. The characterizations were solid and credible, and the fascination pushed me to move into my perceptions, even though I already knew the end of the book. <br /> <br /> An intelligent and well-made film.
