This was such a funny film, which was soon forgotten, probably because there are so many comedies for teenagers and young adults, like this one. The film does not stop as predictable. Crawl is unattractive, but fun and caring and, above all, a very devoted friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and apparently kind boyfriend at home. When it helps to feel more comfortable at school, showing them around the neighborhood and encouraging them to socialize more, they become friends, but it's completely platonic. When he realizes that his boyfriend could propose, he does not feel ready, he seems to like his boyfriend, but it seems that he is enjoying his relaxed party life in college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility . In a sense, you learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells you he'll help you get married. When her boyfriend proposes them, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him in place. He tells the whole family that he proposes them and gives her his diamond ring, which came out all the time (it must come from money or something.) Well, they never really showed a ring near the ring) . The film's message seemed not to judge people by their appearance and not to judge people before they knew it. Rebecca's boyfriend, whom her parents love, became bad when we find out that she drugged her new girlfriend after Rebecca, (Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca would leave with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Even if they weren't, Rebecca was angry with him, which was unfair when you thought about it, since they weren't a couple, but I think they were beginning to like each other. And I think she thought there was more. The film never showed that they would become a couple, they left it open to viewers to decide. They didn't even kiss at any time, even though there was a part where they almost stopped. This was something that many viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said it would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters take home or a shock, but they were just friends all the time, even towards the end. And she didn't introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told his parents that they weren't engaged. Rebecca almost did it. Even if he would never become his boyfriend, they could still be friends. In the 90s for some reason the femanins were inside, and there was this kind of stereo that the woman liked the femanin (not that there was something wrong with that), I think it came from the fact that women love the sensitive type , which Crawl proved to be, through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I have to admit that if I went looking, I thought I'd go for the first guy. Yet it was a creative film, which sought to teach a lesson in friendship and judge others.
