Double Shock is one of the many good episodes of Columbo that reaches the level of a good movie. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo does something awkward, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that he will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode. <br /> <br /> We also have the riddle as usual with a near-perfect murder, but something about the problems of the Columbo murder. The end is the same, we have the story of how Columbo solved the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is another good episode of Columbo, and I will evaluate it 7/10. It's close to 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Just another question" - Acting? Peter Falk is very good as usual.
