I think this is a great, classic monster movie for the family. The mole, what a car! The high creature with the beak, the flying green lizards, Ranthorincus / mayas or whatever they are and the apes men things that speak telepathically with them. The battle of the men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast umm! yummy! Class, what else can I say? How would they do a 2002 remake of this?
