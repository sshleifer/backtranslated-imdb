Back in 1996, one of the pilots of airliners where I worked gave me a copy of this film. He told me he will make me cry. I never believed it and we even made bets. After watching the movie ... I cried a bucket! Even after watching the movie, I found myself in the bathroom crying. It was actually the most touching film I've ever seen. I like the part where Dexter's mom confronted Eric's mother, the joke went like ... "Your children's best friend died today ... and it won't be easy ... if you ever impose him on hands again ... I'll kill you! " The last part where Dexter took Eric's shoe was a scene that has never left my mind until today. Honestly, just thinking about it makes my eyes water. A story of what true friendship is. My girlfriend loved it too ... She hated me for letting her watch the movie. I cried a bucket, cried a river.
