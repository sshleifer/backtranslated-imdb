If you love the book, like I do, stop watching the video after Jean and Joe met in Australia. Until that moment it is a fairly faithful representation of the book, and the images are fantastic. 10 out of 10 at that point and I enjoyed it many times. After that, the story is seriously reorganized and revised in ways that really destroy the fundamental part of the book, that is, how Jean creates a city like Alice (Springs). In the first part, the main change is to make Strachan a 40-year-old bachelor instead of a seventy-year-old widower. This rather distorts this love story, especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making it more selfish and greedy, such as: in the book, intimidates Joe on the ship that he could find more than one letter waiting for him in Australia, but in the video does not give Joe any clue about Jean's position or intentions. The last hour of the 5 hour video scrunch and handle the last third of the book. I don't see any reason why Joe and Jean had a fight - he's rather out of character and seems to be just an Australian hoot to Pommies for telling them what to do. Then they take Strachan for the wedding (instead of three years later) - and they make him read the toast !! - Very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel as a cast in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the writers. These abominations take time in the last hour, which was not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how Jean Willstown recreates it as a place where she and Joe can both be happy.
