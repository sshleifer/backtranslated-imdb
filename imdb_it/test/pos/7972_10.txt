"Hell To Pay" calls itself the rebirth of the Classic Western ... it succeeds as a Western genre film that the whole family could see and not unlike the baby-boom films experienced decades ago. Good guys are good and bad guys are really bad! . Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (excellent in this film) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all fantastic and it's fun to see them again. James Drury really shines in this, perhaps even better than his days as "The Virginian". In a sense, "Hell To Pay" reminds me of those films of the 60s in which the actors you know from so many shows make their appearance. If you are of a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith provide a "wow" factor because we rarely see these icons these days. "Hell To Pay" presents the legends on the screen along with the latest Hollywood names. Most notable in the cast of "newbies" is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), whom I recently saw on "The Young and The Restless" and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays Kirby, a war-tired man who is torn between wanting to live and let live or come in to "do the right thing". William Gregory Lee is excellent as Chance, Kirby's mischievous and feminizing brother. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebekah's sister, a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive, but giving up her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role, Jeff Davis plays Mean Joe, a former confederate with a rather bad streak. I think we'll see more of these good actors in the future. "Hell To Pay" is a funny film with a nice story to tell ?? get the popcorn, we're heading west!
