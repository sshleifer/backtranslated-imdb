This film marks the end of the "serious" era of Universal Monsters (Abbott and Costello meet the monsters later in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein"). It was a bit of a sorry but fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of Wolf Man, the monster of Frankenstein and Dracula in a "last" time. <br /> <br/> I say desperate, because in the previous film, "House of Frankenstein," both Dracula and the Wolf Man are killed based on how vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (Dracula in the light of sun, and the wolf man by a silver bullet). Yet somehow they return to Dracula's house without explanation. This film could have sounded like a sort of House of Frankenstein prequel if the Frankenstein monster's plot had not continued chronologically in House of Dracula by House of Frankenstein, and if the wolf man had not healed. So there would be no holes in the plot. But since this is not the case, the plots of Dracula and the Wolf Man make no sense. <br /> <br /> However, ignoring these holes in the plot, House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that is fun to watch. It has many highlights. Above all see heal the wolf man. I know I just said that this shouldn't have been included, but it was nice to see him heal after all this time. And the scene with the lady who plays the piano "Moonlight Senada", then suddenly sounds a disturbing melody when under the spell of Dracula she was very lugubrious. Dr. Edleman's transformation into the "Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde" character was also done very well. <br /> <br /> And it's great to see Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man together, a "last" time. <br /> <br /> *** of ****
