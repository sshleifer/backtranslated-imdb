If you like the excitement of good underwater drama and the fun of good comedy, then this movie comes highly recommended. Kelsey Grammer offers an excellent performance here. <br /> <br /> The film also offers you something to think about the next time a serious subtitle asks for "silence" .... <br /> <br />
