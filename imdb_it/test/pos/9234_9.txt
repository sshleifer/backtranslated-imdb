This is a very funny movie. There is a self-deprecating and iconoclastic tone to the film that is very attractive. The characters are interesting. The film runs very well and keeps your interest for the film lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes. The quality of the film is not the highest in Hollywood; however the original film had to be made in the genre of a punk-rock gritty style. The documentary on the attempt to make the film and the consequent betrayal of the directors is very well detailed and easy to follow. The same original directors become the protagonists of the documentary version of the film. The interviews with the directors and the actors were collected in a very funny story that illustrates the difficulties related to the creation of the original film, the eventual failure of the original project and the rise of the phoenix from the ashes that evolved in this documentary film. In my mind the documentary (A Texas Tale of Treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film (Waldos Hawiian Vacation) that would have ever existed. Two thumbs up for a job well done.
