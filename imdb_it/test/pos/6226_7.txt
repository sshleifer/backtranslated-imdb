Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror film from the late 1970s, the film is about a group of young friends who run aground on an old deserted lane from an old creepy wax museum. <br /> <br /> The owner of the museum seems a strange but harmless old man, but things take a bad turn when the members of the young group start getting killed, who is responsible for the murders, is the old Slausen or is he his collection of scary mannequins that seems to be alive and hungry for blood !!!! This film was good stuff, it was fast, the performances were very good from actors / actresses (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the film was never boring, and like I said, it had some very scary scenes, so be prepared to hide under the covers ! Definitely recommended for fans of horror movies / ghosts! I give this movie 7.2 out of 10 of all respect.
