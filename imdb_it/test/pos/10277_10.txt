This is a wonderful thriller that I've seen many times and I can't get enough. Everything revolves around the obsessive love that 5 people have in Paris, (not) lucky coincidences, false identities. The music makes it really exciting. There are almost no flaws in the characters, only the end is not very credible, but a definite "must-see" yet.
