I thought it was a beautiful film, very brave. Such beautiful images - and I liked the use of broken glasses with applause. Furthermore, the best friend repeated the joke about "..and she is a year older than me .." showed that their friendship was rekindled and grown, but maybe some competition remained ... I loved the movie of the hands that felt the fabric. The dance concert was beautiful. The beginning seemed slow, though. It took some time to prove the characters - the husband could have been more violent - he just seemed absent so when other characters were talking about him - he didn't really fit. The deal is like that. the best friend and husband seemed random ... the doctors who met seemed to suggest that there was not much time left (to live ..) so when infidelity was revealed, I no longer felt sympathy for the character, more like relief! the finish was so beautiful, the lines were so clear. her and her husband, and the scene in which she was dragged is brilliant!
