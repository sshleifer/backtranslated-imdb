One of the most enjoyable aspects of watching the film is getting lost in a movie. To have it completely washed over you, so as to absorb it as it is and, therefore, live it to the fullest. Every time I see it, "The Egyptian" is such a film. Over the years it's a photo that critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at his vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is precisely because of the tone that the film brings with it, rather than because of its more evident characteristics. It is at the same time prohibitive, remote, perhaps dangerous; beware of what's inside! The haunting chords of music, seen on the 20th-Fox logo, introduce us to turquoise letters from other worlds. <br /> <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It is as if we were descending into antiquity at times, where there could be great treasures, mixed with uncertain dangers. (One could imagine Darryl Zanuck as commander: "Make it ancient!") Then, what a dramatically dramatic story takes place, all with the same tone set at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Egyptian Hollywood trilogy in the mid-50s, 'The Ten Commandments' represented the severity of civilization, the phenomenal' Land of the Pharaohs' its nuts and bolts, while 'The Egyptian 'shows everything, from glamor to tragedy, to make us wonder. <br /> <br /> There is no need to say much about the players here, but I think that, over time, Bella Darvi will be redeemed. What a perfect face for the role, just out of a Symbolist painting. If someone does not like his acting, it could be argued that, in his role as "courtesan", he is obviously better in bed than chatting with some poor helpless admirer. I think Curtiz has captured the perversion of his sado-masochistic relationship with the character of Edmund Purdom with ease, being censorship what he was at that time. Sir Peter Ustinov, in his memoirs, was rather gentle with "The Egyptian", writing that he was "as if I were lost in a great set for" Aida. "His pronunciation of the word" beer "has always adopted me. (One historically accurate references to the film: the beer invented by the Egyptian!) Henry Daniell, egads, what a perfect performance Gene Tierney, who cherishes the screen. Bless DFZ for giving her this 'late' role. "Victor Mature! He is the son of a dairyman! Who became the pharaoh! It seems a strangely American opportunity. One of the best moments: the existential observations of John Carradine on the sands of time. And Purdom's statement on living beyond sunset of the world. If this is not the Grade epic, what is it? <br /> <br /> Of course, along with everything else, the music is sublime.It has often been noted that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann have created one of the most compelling screen scores, perfectly harmonious, but each theme is well developed, with a life of its own. Newman, pressed for time by DFZ, called Herrmann, someone he could implicitly trust, to take half the weight. <br /> <br /> Benny, not the easiest guy to work with, obviously respected Newman enough to deliver really inspirational music. They have alternated cues, a brilliant approach. No spoilers about who did what here, but Benny brings an advantage with him, mysterious and fantastic sounds. Alfred brings fullness, desire, intensity. Both are consumed epic. Even if seen on a squeezed television press, the effect of seeing the two composers' names side by side in the opening titles, which the ultra-wide anamorphic screen could easily accommodate, is a thrill. <br /> <br /> Leon Shamroy, the principal of CinemaScope, does not leave us here. Lush greens and moody shadows (probably the distortions in all the terrible TV prints I've seen over the years) perfectly accompany the multi-dimensional script (by the great Philip Dunne and WB veteran Casey Robinson, which Curtiz must have brought with him at 20). It is extraordinary that Shamroy, who was as much a Fox film institution as Newman was with music, would have chosen "Cleopatra" some years later, but in the brightest and clearest images of the 60s, Todd A-O. These old guys from the studio really are my heroes. For me, who wants to worry about all the imperfections and opportunities for criticism in a photo like this? I'd rather surrender entirely to his spell and dive into his sea of ​​luxury, to emerge after the stimulating climax of "The End" refreshed, moved and hungry for more. <br /> <br /> And yes, we should shout at 20th-Fox for a DVD version worthy of the DFZ legacy.
