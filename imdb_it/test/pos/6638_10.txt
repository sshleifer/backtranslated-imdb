This film offers one of the greatest experiences available for movie goers. It is not a pleasant film at all, but offers realities and emotions that the human mind would never have wanted to touch. It opens up paths in the way an individual thinks, and then changes the person forever. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was in class, and immediately after seeing it I had to skip my next lesson and walk around campus to reset my body and my mind. I felt devastated and somehow unreal, as if I didn't exist. Only a few months later I was telling one of my friends at SHAME, and she asked me, "Oh, is that so when you're messed up after seeing it, and I came across me in a strange way?" I didn't even remember bumping into someone or talking to someone while outside that day, I was amazed. <br /> <br /> In terms of plot, it's the simple story of a war-torn couple. Suffering is greater than that of the dead and in the end ... there are no words to complete the image that Bergman creates. It's like a horrible dream that makes you wake up, altering your reality forever. This film must be seen.
