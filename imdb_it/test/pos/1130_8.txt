I watched the pilot episode for this with great expectations, having just graduated and moved on to "real life". I wasn't in a fraternity, but many of my best friends were, and I got to take part in many of the parties they did at home, so I know what happens to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life, or the college life for that subject, even if it contains a lot of truth, though for the most part exaggerated. If you watch the show for the value it contains like a TV show, and nothing more, it's a lot of fun, much like movies like Old School, Porky's, Animal House, etc. If you look at it, you expect it to chronicle all your experiences in your college life, you will probably be more or less eager to over-dramatize a lot of events.
