This is by far the most entertaining TV sitcom ever. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and I could literally watch them over and over again. Anyone who does not find this hilarious, moving, amusing and hysterical laugh, is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there. My boyfriend and I love going to do comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and we saw Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. They are both so incredibly talented and are simply thinking about their work. There are so many comedians out there that are simply horrible and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of real comedy. Leah Remini, although a snobbish and whore in real life (so I read) is an extraordinary actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in a sitcom. She really does the show ... along with Jerry Stiller! This show is a must see and you will become dependent on one to two episodes!
