WrestleMania 6 took place on April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. <br /> <br /> Match 1: Rick Martel vs. Koko B. Ware - For what it was, a very solid opening match. Koko was always quite popular among the fans, and at this point Martel was still becoming a talent for the heel. In the end, Martel is able to win the victory in a non-memorable game. <br /> <br /> Match 2: The Colossal Connection (Andre The Giant & Haku) (c) (with Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan) vs. Demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Tag Team Championship - At this point Andre's health was really terrible, so his performance was nothing special. The crowd is 100% pro Demolition in this game. Eventually Haku is lined up and we have new Tag Team champions. After the game, Andre exposes Haku and Heenan and turns to what would have been his last WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> Match 3: Earthquack vs Hercules - Very short game. The big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time. REST IN PEACE. to both men in the game. John Tenta (Earthquake) passed not long ago and the same with Hercules. Eventually the earthquake attacks Hercules for victory. <br /> <br /> Match 4: Mr. Perfect vs Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake - The first really beautiful match of the evening. REST IN PEACE. to Curt Henning (Mr. Perfect). A really solid action by both these talented guys. In the end Brutus gets the victory thanks to many of his main fan support during the game. <br /> <br /> Match 5: 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper vs. Bad News Brown - It's not a technical classic, but it's a pretty decent fight for WrestleMania. Piper comes out half black / half white in what is considerably a classic moment. In the end both boys fight for a double count without a winner. <br /> <br /> Match 6: The Hart Foundation vs. The Bolsheviks - Complete squash match. The Hart Foundation gets an easy win. Amazing that WWE had a tag team division. <br /> <br /> Match 7: The Barbarian vs. Tito Santana - Bobby Heenan's "Heenan Family" does better in this game while The Barbarian takes the victory against Tito Santana. Not memorable, but good to go back and look at years later. <br /> <br /> Match 8: Randy Savage & Sensational Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes & Sapphire - Great inter-gender tag team game. Dusty Rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka dot dress in the ring. In the end, Rhodes and Sapphire win the victory on "The Macho King" and Sensational Queen Sherri. <br /> <br /> Match 9: The Rockers vs. The Orient Express - Surprisingly another tag team game. The wrestling tag was much better during this time. A young Shawn Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetty suffer a loss counting in this game with the Orient Express. <br /> <br /> Match 10: Dino Bravo vs. Jim Duggan - Duggan gets a decent reaction, despite his American Patriot expedient. Bravo, a member of Jimmy Hart's group, arrives in the ring with Hart and Earthquake. Even if he has support, Duggan takes the victory. <br /> <br /> Match 11: "The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase (c) vs. Jake 'The Snake' Roberts for the Million Dollar Championship - The first major night event. Roberts was extremely over with the fans. The game was considerably good for what it was. DiBiase is able to collect a victory count on Roberts. But Roberts ends up owning DiBiase's money and giving it away. <br /> <br /> Match 12: The Big Boss Man vs. Akeem (with Slick) - The sad attempt of One Man Gang to be an African dream named Akeem. A really short game that needed a little more time to develop as a game. Boss Man wins with a slam. <br /> <br /> Match 13: Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka vs. Rick Rude - Heenan arrives in the ring with Rude for this match. Snuka, he's never been good at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be the loser in the end. After 5 minutes, Rude wins the victory over Snuka. <br /> <br /> Match 14: WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Dubbed "The Ultimate Challenge" we get interesting promotions from both men before nightfall. The game was really very good, as people tend to think that Hogan can't fight. A lot of close-ups that have really caught the crowd and the people watching at home. In the end, Warrior wins the victory over Hogan and wins both titles. A stunned crowd watches as Hulk Hogan suffers his first defeat at WrestleMania.
