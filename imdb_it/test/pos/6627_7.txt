Shame, it's a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. The film is about a husband and a wife named Jan and Eva. They live on an island that works as farmers. There is a war going on and the soldiers are starting to attack people on the island. Once the war abandons itself a little to Jan, and Eve is arrested as if she were going the other way. Once released, more problems arise and the film shows how two normal people will act in a situation of war, life or death. Winner of the CEC Award for best foreign film at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards, The Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (Liv Ullman, who plays Eva) at The Guldbagge Awards, The NBR Award for Best Foreign Film and Best Actress at the National Board of Review The NSFC Award for Best Actress, Best Director (Ingmar Bergman) and Best Film at the National Society Of Film Critics Awards. Shame, he has a good direction, a good script, good performances both by Max Von Sydow (who plays Jan) and by Liv Ullman (who plays Eva), good cinematography and good production design. Shame is a well-made story of how people in desperate situations sometimes do everything they can to survive. The film has a powerful message and is a good movie. The reason I don't vote for this movie is higher because it's not a masterpiece like other Ingmar Bergman films like Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal or Persona, for example. The film didn't have such a big impact on me as I thought and didn't have the thoughtful and philosophical dialogue of Ingmar Bergman. Although it's not close to being one of his best films, there's still a lot to appreciate about Shame, and it's a good movie. I probably would have liked it better not having seen some of those other Bergman masterpieces.
