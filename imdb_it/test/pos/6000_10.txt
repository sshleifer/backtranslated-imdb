Gulliver's Travels is, at the beginning, a satirical novel written by a great misanthrope named Jonathan Swift. So it is not advisable to judge this film, alone. We need to go deeper into the consciousness of man to get to the point where Swift would guide us. Gulliver lived a journey of truthfulness, of solitude, of apprehension of what his true life could be. We can't just sit and watch that movie, saying it's so cute or boring. The question is far beyond that and I would like everyone to expect it. This is the greatest film of all time, though you can perceive the truths that emerge from the character of Ted Danson: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver.
