I found this film as one of those big heart-warming gems. The plot is tightly intertwined and the character development is fantastic! I'm a big fan of non-US movies and that's right there with "Happenstance", "The Closet" also "King of Hearts". Vlastimil Brodsky in the role of Fanda is fantastic. It is a love story in the true sense of loving life and the necessary turns to convince the viewer to understand / appreciate the vision of Fanda's life (which almost costs him <br /> more than he is willing to give ) They're wonderful. His star Stars Zazvorkova is as unforgettable as his tantalizing wife. I highly recommend this film for the whole family - my kids loved it.
