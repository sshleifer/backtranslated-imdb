I really felt that the film was ahead of its time. The only potential daughter-in-law was a woman so strong and career-oriented. He knew what he wanted and was diplomatic but firm at being the sovereign mother-in-law. The role of the mother was very well interpreted (you just loved to hate her). His need to control his son's lives was neurotically evil. If you've ever been in a relationship where you were tried and found missing (and everyone knew it), this could hit you too close to home. It's been years since I saw this movie and I remember thinking that this plot and this dialogue would work in a movie from the 50s or 60s. It's hard to look at because of the dynamics of mother and children, but I'd like to see it again. I keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels, but so far I haven't had any luck. Even the attempts to buy it have been in vain (I don't think they are on tape or DVD).
