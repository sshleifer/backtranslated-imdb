I'm not really a t.v. the observer - except between the ages of 6 and 8 and the "General Hospital" still had Luke and Laura - but there are some exceptions and I certainly think "King of Queens" is one of them. Every decade has its classics and I think this show (or damn good) should be among the best of this decade. His comic timing is fantastic and can sometimes be quite strange. In a more "serious" note the actors are more than able to convey subtle - and not so subtle :) - complexities in their characters without being overly involved. One commentator wrote that it could take a couple of episodes to accept it and I agree; it's definitely a guy that grows on you but, once you get in, you're pretty much caught. And rightly so!
