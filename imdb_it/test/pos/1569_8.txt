While I can understand some of the points taken regarding cinematography (I thought that a more proactive approach would have better supported the low-fi, the sense of the home movie) I must say that I thought that the script and the acting of WHAT ALICE FOUND were excellent! Dean Bell has created a real gem that Judith Ivey captivates with the pleasure of the characters. His interpretation of Sandra is a pleasure, which takes place, alternately, as diabolical and romantic. We are both intrigued and rejected by his actions ... and we have never given more information than necessary. His efforts and those of the supporting cast meet Bell's post-modern fairy tale with his arms wide open. Emily Grace's Alice is imbued with magic with dangling eyes. It seems to form like clay in front of us, turning into a sort of beautiful lost beast. In the end, we disagree with the words, like her, saying goodbye to her mother. Even Kudos should be handed over to Jane Lincoln Taylor - whose mother provides the right dose of tragic historical weight - and Justin Parkinson - whose timid first time John, Sam, offers one of the sweetest, if not the most embarrassing, sex scenes in the movie. Bell created a first-rate story and brought together a plethora of talent to make it happen.
