The film Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece and demonstrates once again that you can make a brilliant film on a tight budget, such as American Beauty and Blair Witch Project. Director Fridrik Thór Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheimsin a new life on the white screen. The film is a turning point in Icelandic film production because it is the largest and largest film ever made in Iceland. <br /> <br /> The music of the film, played by Sigurrós, is very symbolic for the film, it's absolutely brilliant. I advise all those who are able to think of going to see this film as soon as possible, you will not be disappointed. Would you bet on this film to win the prize for the best foreign film next year ?? worldwide!
