I just looked at another comment published here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways in which the teenagers of this film use the body of their dead friend. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most disturbing of all, it is no surprise that it is the crunchy character of the glover (layne). he is thrilled by one of his friends who kills another friend of his, the murderer's girlfriend. not because Layne didn't like this individual, on the contrary he is excited about his death because he gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life, and dead inside, that a murdered friend is something to be enthusiastic about because it gives him something to focus on.
