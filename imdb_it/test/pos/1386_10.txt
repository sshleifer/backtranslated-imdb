GZSZ is the most long-lived daily soap in Germany and is cult! I started watching it from day one and got passionate from the beginning. Over the years so much has changed, the old characters like Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia etc. They are gone, and the new ones have appeared like Marie, Kai, Cora or John. I must say that I really liked GZSZ in the years 1995-2000 because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe because she is the most intriguing person who has ever been on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show. Tina Bordihn was as great as the first Sonja, but when Tokessa became the recasting of Sonja, the character improved.
