Late at night on BBC1, I was on my way to bed but curiosity sparked a contemporary Irish film, so I watched for a few minutes and then stayed until the end. I must admit that the main attraction was the only English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> This is a black advertisement, which is one of the most difficult things to do. It should be the perfect mix of horror and horrible laughter, so that in the end you don't know why you're laughing - for me Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the best example. Dead Bodies is blacker than comedy, but the plot winds and descends into further darkness. I didn't notice the last twists of the story like some other posters here, so I was appropriately surprised. <br /> <br /> As a snapshot of the Irish film industry in 2003, everything looks pretty worthy; they don't seem to have spent too much on it, so he had the chance to recover his money. The script may have been much sharper but the acting was overall pretty good. I'm glad I saw it, flaws and everything else, I don't think I learned a lot about Ireland today, especially about police methods!
