First of all I must say that I am a big fan of Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento. Although I didn't see any of their films at all, I really appreciated almost everyone I saw. I really like the Giallos and I thought Argento was the master of this genre, after watching films like "Tenebre" and "Phenomena". But after seeing Fulci's "New York Ripper", I found out that he could make good blues in addition to his graphic zombie movies and even surpass Silver at a certain level. <br /> <br /> I love Fulci's style, and yes I really love blood, but I think that this film, although it has a plot and characters more developed than its other films, is not its best. What I don't like is that sometimes it can be confusing, especially at the end. And the fact that we go from one suspect to another, and then another until we even suspect the child delayed for a moment, I think it goes too far. I know that the yellowies should continue to guess to the end and the killer should be very difficult to find, but this film plays a little too much with our minds. However I liked the scene where the witch is killed, I think she is very well made and gave me the chills. The acting is also quite good and the photography is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a bad film, I think Lucio Fulci has made better films than this, and I think his best is "The Beyond", a very different film but a more suggestive experience and visual. <br /> <br /> I give "Don't torture a duckling" to 7 out of 10. <br /> <br />
