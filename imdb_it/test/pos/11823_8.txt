This is one of the most touching films I've ever seen. No film struck me like this movie. This is a great movie and you have to see it for yourself. I'm normally impregnable with these hiccups, but this one did for me. I was in tears at the end. You will want the friendship that is represented in this film. If I could give this movie a billion stars, I could.
