Resume The A-team was a one-hour special screened on Channel 4 in the UK last year and hosted by presenter and comedian Justin Lee Collins, the show attempted to track down and reunite the cast members of group A together , for the first time ever on TV. This was something that no one has ever tried before. Well, not from anyone I know, I mean. <br /> <br /> Justin is a great presenter, and his eccentric personality and amusing jokes have shone during this program. The attempts he made to take over the cast members has always been so fun, but he too has been very persistent and eager to fulfill this task, which is a credit to him I would say. Mind you, it's great on TV anyway - by presenting a show like this, or the Friday Night Project with its host, Alan Carr. <br /> <br /> There were appearances and interviews with Dirk Benedict - Faceman himself, Dwight Schultz - aka Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heasley who played Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging aka General "Bull" Full Bright, the creator of A-team, Stephen J Cannell and the great man himself, Mr. T aka BA Baracus. They were simply fascinating to watch and listen to what they had to say about the program that became a global success in the 1980s, because they remember and relive the positive and negative moments of the show: both during and behind the scenes. Unfortunately, there is no George Peppard, but of course he is already in heaven, understandably and strangely there is no Melinda, who plays Amy. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why it wasn't included on the show. Ok, it was cut after 3 seasons or anything else, but it was the first and original female component of the A-Team - only to be replaced by Tawnia by Marla and so it would have been nice to see and feel her side at A- team story, in addition to other cast members. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bring Back The A-Team was a great documentary show. Perhaps this could have been more widespread through which this could have been a six-part documentary. However, this was a great effort by JLC. Recommended
