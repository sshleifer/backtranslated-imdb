I also attended the RI International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this film won the best show. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST is a wild game of Horror, Comedy and wonderful landscapes. A story back to strange events. An increasingly widespread disease with an extremely irritating side effect of the head of exploding people, brings the apprentice of a young professor; Stefan, to investigate. During his travels, he decides to make a brief detour and ask once again for his long period of love in marriage, only to be sent once again to pack his extremely stubborn father ?? Along the way "out of town" he meets a sick girl on the street and delivers her to Dr. Maitland, (brilliantly played by Vincent Price as an actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan with the Bad? foot. Only Dr. Is it insulted to have called the professor and received only one boy in training? Nevertheless, Stefan turns out to be much more than just a spectator. Horror icon; Tom Savini portrays the last massacre of religious tormentors; Priest John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt leaves the boarding house to do a stellar performance like Anna. Many beautiful and talented support actors have joined history together and helped make it move effectively up to the climax. <br /> <br /> Dark Religion is over the top, but also fun and sometimes very original scenes, in which gore play heavily as a tribute hammer blow. This fashionable film goes back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and reality of the character. <br /> <br /> Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very funny movie! Slap, tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads in the dark plot. As others have stated; this is really like three great movies in one. Very funny and original.
