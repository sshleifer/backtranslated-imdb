Journey to the extreme side of the sun concerns the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun that shares the same orbit of the earth and therefore has been discovered until a space probe on the far side of the sun photographs it. Of course two astronauts (Roy Thinnes and Ian Hendry) are sent to explore it but due to a malfunction they crash and find themselves on the earth for only three weeks on their six-week journey. Of course they are scolded (at least Thinnes is, Hendry is seriously injured) and on the grill and asked why they returned their mission, but it was claimed that they didn't. Until Thinnes seems to notice some very strange things about coming back to "home". This is excellent if sometimes a little convulsive, and the sets and sensations are not far from the territory of "Thunderbirds" but actors will live for once. It's not a big "Star Wars" type production, but a quieter science fiction that you need to think about a bit. It is worth seeing and it is criminal that the DVD is sold out. 8 out of 10.
