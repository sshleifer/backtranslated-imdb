I think the reason this film didn't get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misunderstandings about Darwin, pros and cons. I would say that the real man is depicted here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the film is only a snapshot of man, the technique of storytelling has expanded his life well beyond the years touched on in the film. This is a profound film, a reflection on modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study of man whose thoughts (and others who have used it) have certainly influenced our lives. There are some films that the historical context is so great that it is the main task of the actors to keep out of the way. The story brought the day and the actors did their job. Good job to them, I say.
