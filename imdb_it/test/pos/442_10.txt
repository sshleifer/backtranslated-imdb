This is my favorite Renoir from the fifties. It's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workers blowing up the site to begin the construction and training of the dancers. Finally, the vertigo of the opening night and the long sequence of Cancan dance. The financial problems and performances of the artists' ego are described. <br /> <br /> Gabin is in excellent shape like the casual Danglard: see him deal with humor with Nini's violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito is moving like the melancholy Prince who is courting Nini. Maria Felix, with that body of amazon, is as impressive as the egoist Lola, Danglard's first lover. Finally, Françoise Arnoul in the role of Nini, the cleaning lady who ends up dancing for Danglard and becoming his girlfriend, is simply stunning; its beauty and its charm will allow you to conquer yourself. <br /> <br /> A bonus: we get Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other cameo stars who play the stars of a century ago that reigned on the Moulin rouge.
