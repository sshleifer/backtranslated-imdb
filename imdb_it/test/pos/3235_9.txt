Don't watch this movie waiting for Jane Austen's ingenuity, clear dialogue or intelligent social commentary. This time, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! <br /> <br /> In this version, Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just foolish fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality that is just peeping through her adventures of light. By day she is very primitive and demure, and her sex Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as his own sexual nature awakens, his daydreams change so gently from mild to steamy to filthy! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, Catherine's sex visions are based entirely on the gothic novels she devours in bed. It is at the same time touching, sexy and provocative to observe the way in which his dream image of the handsome Henry "dissolves" in a filthy dream of being kidnapped and kidnapped by romantic villains! At the same time, it is ironic and moving to reduce them to her bed in the morning - Catherine sleeping peacefully seems so innocent that she would never guess what really happens in that pretty little head! <br /> <br /> Later, after being invited to Henry's castle, Catherine listens to a family discussion and completely misunderstands its meaning. Jumping on the bed, she covers her sheets and the lies wake up, listening fearfully, her amazing blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert. Little by little, however, those beautiful blue eyes are lowered and closed as she plunges into another sorrowful dream of innocent desire. This time, Catherine dreams of being in the Elizabethan era, dreadfully waiting outside the castle for the "bandits!" It is quite clear that she is more excited than terrified by the idea of ​​being taken out by bandits. She almost quivers with excitement and waiting! But then, after frantically shooting to escape, we returned to the daylight world, where the maid is scolding her for making a mess of her room before falling into a deep sleep. It is worth noting that Catherine's heavy yawn in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been! <br /> <br /> Ultimately, of course, Catherine's stern and unimaginative lover, Henry, guesses the nature of her fantasies and gives her a severe lesson. It is interesting to note that Catherine's immediate collapse in tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance in adult relationships. In the next scene, she burns her gothic love story in tears and throws herself shameful and sobbing on the bed. Significantly, this turning point is also marked by Catherine falling into a deep sleep - except this time, there are no dreams of making people believe in passion. Presumably, Catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing. <br /> <br /> Although Katherine Schlesinger has beautiful blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performances are fascinating, it must be said that outside of the warm dreamlike sequences this film adaptation is atrociously boring. I give him only 9 stars because true romantics can enjoy it only at the level of daydreaming. <br /> <br /> If you would like to read a book about a young heroine with a strong genuine will that overcomes the real darkness and danger in a true Gothic context, I highly recommend Elizabeth Marie Pope's THE PERILOUS GARD.
