Despite everything is a weave of style and a cinematic invention, this is basically another thriller serial killer, following the same kind of plot favored by old favorites like Silence of the Lambs? the police team follows in the footsteps of murders (particularly bad ones), someone else gets caught and somehow they have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows it, the murderer himself (powerful played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need the mental science fiction machine of psychologist Jennifer Lopez to get into his head and force him to tell to all It is here that the film becomes all new and different, as we enter (through a 21st century CGI update of Dr Who's kaleidoscopic favorite, the fashionable temporal tunnel) a kind of world of scary and disturbing crazy things by Hellraiser worldwide. place, ruled by D'Onofrio, now a sort of overlying lord of his tormented mental world, inside his comatose body. The sequences within the mind are well done and often wonderful, all derivations behave appropriately, melancholy is at its best if you like that sort of thing, but the clamor around it all led to disappointment for me , as I expected something completely new and unlike anything I have ever done before, not this pretty successful fusion of genres of serial killers and special effects of the horror genre. Sometimes gruesome, often pretty, a pretty compelling story told with care and attention by talented people, but it's not at all the big leap into the unknown that was marketed as.
