The series of decline is surprising and the director PS does not have enough credit to make these films. I am a little surprised to see that not many people have seen this or the other two, but it is worth bringing it to light if you want the image of punk in the trans-formative years between the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties. The film begins with a noble collection of clips played on music by group X. Many interviews with bands and punkers offering an illuminating perspective on what survived on the lowest rung of the mainstream rock scale. No internet, disgusting jobs and out of the ordinary hostility collide in this genre. For new children who have never heard of these bands or are just starting one, this film is a real lesson in how to rock. All the band's performances (and there are many) are fantastic, especially FEAR that never ceases to amaze me. This and the second episode are incredible time capsules that offer those interested in a rare vision of the life of these crazy people. It is the real punk, as in the interview with Darby Crash's girlfriend when they remembered a painter who mysteriously / suddenly died outside their house and it took about a week to figure out what they were doing, they take pictures next to the boy and all including the EMT he had a laugh about this, and in the true form the interviewer asks the girl if she was sad or upset that this boy was dead while painting their house, the answer "no I hate painters". How about Black Flag that rents their apartment / rehearsal room for $ 16 a month! My jaw almost fell out at that moment as I was renting a ten ten closet to practice for 400. Between the vision of this and Deadwood I feel like I was born at the wrong time, I miss only those cowboy days and nights the old way . The people and bands associated with the film paved the way for harder music today, and they did it in their own unique way. A brilliant film, ten stars, see the second part and its equally fantastic, the third part, however, I don't know what to say.
