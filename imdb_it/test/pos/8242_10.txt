As a child raised in Sydney in the 1950s, I can easily identify with the content of this beautiful film. Every week I visited the Wynyard Newsreel cinema on George Street to see the Cinesound short films (and usually 3 Stooges). There has never been a better fusion of B / W and color in a film. Impeccable production values ​​complete a cinematic experience never forgotten.
