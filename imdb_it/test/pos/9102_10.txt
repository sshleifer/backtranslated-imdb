I loved every minute of this movie. Jack Black and Kyle Gass have definitely brought back the thunder in this epic story of friendship, hard ass and destiny. <br /> <br /> Filled to the brim with useless curses in every sentence, humor in the toilets and general attitude of breaking the rules, this film is absolutely not to be missed for the tenacious fans of the world. <br /> <br /> We follow the journey of Young Jables (Jack black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) as they try to recover the choice of destiny, win the open-mic evening and become the biggest band on the planet. The duo must overcome obstacles such as a room full of lasers, a man with a leg and the devil to complete his task. I'll show you if they make it or not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack itself is already quite impressive, and now we see the D in person, making the experience even more magical. A must see for anyone who calls themselves a tenacious fan of D. Pay attention to the inside lines of the first album!
