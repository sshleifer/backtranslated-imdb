Although I completely agree with the previous comment regarding Toni Servillo's wonderful acting in the role of Titta Di Girolamo, I would also like to add the beautiful shots and editing that virtually transforms this film into a painting. The young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different types of shooting techniques that reminded me of Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. Both used the same MTV-style footage combined with modern (alternative / techno) music, making the film ?? The Consequences of Love - is distinguished from other criminal / mafia films of its kind. Even if the film could start with a very slow rhythm almost "sec" compared to the fastest Hollywood productions, it should be appreciated for its serenity, the wonderful character played and the splendid ending. A must see for people who love European / Italian cinema. PS Toni continues to behave in this way we need an encore.
