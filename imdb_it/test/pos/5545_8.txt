This is a funny movie with subtle intent. His off-beat comedy is hilarious to me, little fun for my friends. The soundtrack is perfect. I own it on VHS and watched it many, many times, because it is simply a fun and entertaining love story with great performances of all the main ones (even if you use Joan Cusack exclusively as a big hair perch it was a waste of his talent. I know, I know, he was still young ...). <br /> <br /> On a sad note, I decided to check the DVD last night (instead of watching my VHS tape), and it was SHOCKED to find many crucial cut scenes. And on the copy I looked at, there was no special feature of the deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes had never existed !! I'm so glad I bought the VHS used at a flea market. <br /> <br /> It is clear that there was a great deal of choreography in this, which is another reason why I like it so much. It takes great skill, talent and genius to shoot the scenes as Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine act as a scene (note the scene where the shopping carts converge, the rolling on the floor during the shootings in Miami, the debacle of Chicken Lickin, foot massage, salon hair washing.) There is a very "theatrical" feeling for this film, which could be the turn-off for many of whom follow the negative reviews: I know some spectators who don't understand this style mistake, exaggerations and exaggerated performances for poor acting and worse direction. Not like that. Jonathan Demme does a great job bringing the whole company and their respective roles to life. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and the first rank of the scene among my favorites of all time (another favorite opening film / first scene: Fly Away Home). <br /> <br /> Too bad that Matthew Modine jumped so hard by the public eye; I like it a lot, and found its casting PERFECT as Mike Smith. In reality, this film is well interpreted by the dried fruit soup: everyone is credible and true to its role. As for the question of expecting the public to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they did it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Charming, fun, exciting ... what's wrong? If you want to have some fun, look at this bizarre and colorful adventure-mob-love story. If you're looking to learn more about organized crime and families, tune in to HBO's The Sopranos.
