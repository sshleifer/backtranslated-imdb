I loved One True Thing from the first time I saw it at the theater and I shouted out loud. I bought it as soon as it was available and I lost track of how many times I saw it. <br /> <br /> For me, One True Thing is the latest film for family relationships. I love looking at relationships in family change and evolving into what they end up being. I can relate to many details in the film. My mother died of bone cancer, so it really affects my home. Maybe that's why I like it so much. <br /> <br /> I like the relationships between children and their parents, and the relationship between brother and sister, but above all I love the relationship between husband and wife. For me it's really beautiful. I strongly recommend this move to all those who appreciate this type of film.
