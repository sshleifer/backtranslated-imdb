It was very pleasant to see this beautiful film. The director continued to focus on the main subject without venturing into lateral plots (the doctor's family or the stories of other hospital patients), which are so typical of Bollywood assembly line products. He kept the narrative simple to understand and made sure that all the actors were faithful to the characters they should represent. The rustic ways of his grandfather in the clinic, the cold and not emotional behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker gave the film a sense of genuineness. I'm also glad the director didn't fall into the temptation to add songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of Anand or Safar. A couple of scenes towards the end of the film, like the boy who visits other blind children and a blind man's workplace and even the final scene in which the boy applauds the sound of the sketches and the chirping of birds, surely make your misty eyes. /> <br /> Many Bollywood players do not realize that the members of the Oscar committee appreciate the simplicity of the subject and the genuineness and brevity of the film more than pomp and glamor. Shwaas is certainly a better nomination than Lagaan, who treated a subject that has already been beaten to death. No MPAA member is going to suffer for 4 hours of jingo drama and lots of songs and dances. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing more films by director Sandeep Sawant in the future.
