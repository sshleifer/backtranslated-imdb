Gerald McRaney, (Dave Morgan), "War Crimes", '01 TV series, was like a father to Tiffani Thiessen, (Jennifer Gallagher), "A kiss before bed", '03, who lives a bad situation in his life and made Jennifer retire with people and young men. Dave Morgan desperately tries to take her out of the house and manages to introduce Jennifer to Chris (Gallagher) who falls madly in love with her in their first meeting. On almost one or two dates later, Chris asks Jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees. It's not very long after the wedding that things start to happen, Chris is in the Navy and doesn't like working in submarines and things start happening to young girls in the neighborhood. This is a very excellent TV movie and sometimes I ask you if the boy or girl I want as a soul mate is the perfect PERSON!
