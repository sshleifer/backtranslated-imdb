After the leading actress of the opera was killed in a car accident, her young replacement, Betty, is brought to the fore. He is very fortunate for her, with only one problem: he has an admirer who has decided that he will kill all his friends and have them watched. What is your connection to the work, and what is its appeal to Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan, I think. Many people, especially critics, praise his previous work ("Suspiria" and "Deep Red") but actually disapprove of subsequent films, like "Sleepless", which I liked. My favorite, "Phenomena", is usually very underrated. "Opera" tends to fall somewhere in the middle. Some consider it one of his last great films, others see it as part of his so-called decline. I loved it. <br /> <br /> The image is sharp, the music is exceptional (unlike other critics, I love the metal soundtrack), the female lead is a person I can try (not unlike Jennifer Connelly from "Phenomena" "). And the image ... wonderful. Great cinematography and some incredible scenes of killings. The concept of tying the needles to the eyes of a person so that they can't blink ... brilliant. assistant Tina thinks this to be false, but even if that were the case, the idea is more than enough to repay, and some great effects, like a knife blade that comes out of a man's mouth? Impressive. <br /> < br /> Jim Harper defines the film as "stunning" and draws attention to "innovative cinematography, well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders." I fully agree with this: one click follows the camera through winding tunnels, and there is a use very interesting visual of the co rvi throughout history. Mike Mayo himself calls it "visually appealing eye candy" and praises "clean editing and the work of a flowing camera". It is truly a wonder that this is not one of the most appreciated works of Argento. <br /> <br /> Silver returned to the opera with "Phantom of the Opera", which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting, in the same year he offered the release of "Stagefright" by Michele Soavi, who (as "Opera") has a free killer in a theater that kills the people involved in the presentation. Both are great movies, with Soavi being more on the slasher side. (Soavi was actually director of the second unit in "Opera" ... you can draw your own conclusions.) <br /> <br /> My only complaint with this film is the length and the rhythm. While it is very well shot and the killing scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. The first takes more than half an hour and then we put ourselves down between them. The lead actress should be constantly terrified, but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything were normal again. Not fantastic, Dario. We must keep the suspense low and the intensity high.
