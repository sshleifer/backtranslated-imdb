I lost count of how many times I've seen this movie. I never got tired because this is a film that can be appreciated and interpreted on so many levels. they simply don't make films like this anymore. <br /> <br /> having finally seen the compelling documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness: a filmmaker travels in madness), I am even more amazed that this film is finished, yet by itself it turned out to be so great . <br /> <br /> the fact that they actually filmed this film in the jungle of the Philippines is the film's greatest asset. you really feel like yours in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> all the actors are fantastic with my favorites still Robert Duvall ("I love the smell of napalm in the morning !!") martin sheen, and the great Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> many people complain that the film becomes too dark, strange and cerebral towards the end. well, remember what Coppolla said about this movie, "This movie is not about Vietnam, it's Vietnam!" what he means is that this film is about FOLLY and not about war. <br /> <br /> this film is based on the short story "Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad and is set against the Vietnam War instead of civil war as in the book. I think it was a brilliant combination in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This film is perfect, challenging, dark, violent, humorous at times and well done in every single way possible. <br /> <br /> a true classic <br /> <br /> vote: 10
