A bizarre mistake at the Ministry of Education has resulted in the Nutbourne boys' school having to share with the St Swithin school for girls. This confuses the respective directors of each school and leads to all sorts of chaotic events, yet the two are forced to come to an uncomfortable alliance in the hope of avoiding major problems. <br /> <br /> Your happiest days are based on the game of John Dighton from 1948, with Dighton writing the part of director Whitchurch specifically for Margaret Rutherford. Replacing George Howe from the role in the role of Headmaster Pond, is Alastair Sim, and here in lie the glory of this film adaptation, Sim & Rutherford are perfectly wonderful, bouncing off one another to keep what is basically a movie of one joke, very funny Directed by the talented Frank Launder and produced by the very passionate Sidney Gilliat, The happiest days of your life is a typically British film, obviously a precursor of the St. Trinians franchise, the film entertains children with its high pranks, clash of the heart sexes, while it tickles the adults who watch with its very impertinent submissive. Fortunately the chaotic end cemented everything that happened before leaving this particular spectator with a wide smile like the Nutbourne train station, very fun 8/10.
