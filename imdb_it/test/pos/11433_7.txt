"The disappeared star", which competed for the Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival, is a film that, when you think about it, the first adjective that comes to mind is: intense. Intense looks, intense sequences, the intensity of this film captures the viewer from the first scenes of the steelworks, in Italy (I could not recognize the city, perhaps Genoa or even Naples), even if the pace is rather slow. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Buonavolont√†, the male protagonist, and with him, the whole audience, sees a China completely different from a normal Western imagination: a horrible skyscraper with about eight hundred apartment owners inside, skyscrapers, desolation , fog, scraper and crane everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze Kiang River, which will soon become a large lake due to the controversial dam that will sweep away many cities. China is a country under construction, but in all these colossal public works there is still poverty, backwardness and unfair laws. <br /> <br /> We can relate more easily to this story because Gianni Amelio, the expert director, has chosen two phenomenal leads: Sergio Castellitto, a well-known actor in Italy, and the Chinese surprise Tai Ling, an unknown girl who gives an intense interpretation like that of Castellitto. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect, there are some flaws here and there, but this does not mean that it is a mediocre film. Try to see it.
