this film explores if it doesn't create a completely new genre with perfect imperfections --- the hilarity, truth, fun, talent and circumstances that make MAGIC. <br /> <br /> from the creative musical numbers to the unconventional comedy that incorporates the actors at their best, if I had not known better, I would have thought there was a script developed here. <br /> <br /> what you get: a powerful wind meets conversations with God meets something so fresh, new and delicious that it becomes its very entity. <br /> <br /> Peters and fellers both deliver stellar performances and attract you immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ....... only small actors, and everyone involved here should be petted in the back, taken out to dinner and considered for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> well done!
