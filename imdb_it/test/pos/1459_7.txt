A group of teenagers who broke into a department store are attacked by a crazed cop. Exciting and full of suspense for everything and refreshing free of extreme violence and cold blood, but those Australian hairstyles and accents are a little too much to take. And they can induce headaches. But this is still a good thriller. 7 out of 10.
