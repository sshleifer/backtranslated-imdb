This French study of the late 1950s on dissatisfied young people (in their early 20s, actually - "grown up" but not yet established in the adult world) probably missed the target by a mile in terms of accurate representation of the French youth of 1958 (not practically ALL adult films made by adults do this? Those who do not - River's Edge comes to mind - they are really rare), but also director Marcel Carne, of the fame of Les Enfants du Paradis, is too careful an observer of humanity to NOT provide a perceptive view of the essence of these characters. In a sense, the details are not important - you could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as well - but the loneliness and insecurity and superficial passion and hypocritical rage of the characters are captured well. The young Pierre Brice and Jean-Paul Belmondo are in secondary roles, but he brings Jacques Charrier, Laurent Terzieff, Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy to play the roles with subtlety and depth. There is also a nice jazz score, which you can find on the JAZZ IN PARIS CD - JAZZ & CINEMA VOL. 2. Unlike some who have commented on the film, I don't really see the director-writer Carne as sitting in judgment on these characters - it seems like he's an objective observer for me. Of course, these middle-class characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to whine for some viewers of the working class of the film, and I think that Carne is certainly aware of it. For this American spectator (I saw a double version of this title, entitled THE CHEATERS), the film offers an interesting window on 1950s France. He is also self-consciously poetic (the scene on the ledge, saving the cat, is just one example of this) and has intellectual aspirations in that fascinating way that only French films can get away with - I can imagine the heavy hand In a melodramatic and superficial way this guy of material would have been managed by a production of an American studio, and the sensationalist, moralistic and suggestive way of this type of material would have been managed by American filmmakers of the drive-in / exploitation type. I feel that Marcel Carne has captured the essence of that period between, for example, high school graduation and when, in the early 1930s, people mostly settled into a routine, whatever the routine. Those who are willing to watch the film with an open mind and not shoot the many easy goals it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people who are in their early twenties. And even if you don't want to do it, you can go to the other room while the movie is playing and simply enjoy the beautiful soundtrack, with the great jazz of the 50s and the instrumental pop, including the wonderful original soundtrack of a "Jazz at the "Philharmonic" group including Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz (spelled "goetz" in the credits), Roy Eldridge and Ray Brown.
