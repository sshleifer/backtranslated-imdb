Hummmm, ... ANOTHER Keystone comedy set in the park !!! It seems that the number one landmark for filming has been in this same local park, since many of Chaplin's and Arbuckle's films are set there! And, although this is yet another, it is quite different and well done that I still liked. <br /> <br /> Fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting Mabel Normand. I think she should be a little younger, though in her mother's eyes she's too young to be interested in men. Well, Fatty doesn't share his feelings and soon he and Mabel will run for innocent fun. Things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. Fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel as a gift, ... and VERY result of the problems. <br /> <br /> Decent stimulation and the fact that this film was not based too much on cheap slapstick, but a reasonable plot make this a cute and funny little movie.
