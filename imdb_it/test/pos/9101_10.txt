I loved this movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass have probably made one of the best Up in Smoke comedies. This film has something for everyone: rock, drugs and Satan. What else could anyone want? I suggest this film to anyone who wants to sit down and forget all the problems in the world and have a good laugh. Even if the film is not good in the cinema, it will surely become a cult classic. I suggest anyone going to see the movie to take the first D album because many of the lines are made more fun if you've listened to the songs (like JB's obsession with Sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil). The film is still a guaranteed laugh even if you haven't listened to their music but the songs are so beautiful that you can't let them pass.
