What do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson movie? Are they waiting for classic cinema that is wonderful beyond imagination and will leave them with lasting memories? You would think from some reviews. Al Adamson's films are sloppy, dreary and in bad taste, not much more, so if you go inside knowing that it already helps, and they don't necessarily have to be taken for their face value, especially when they have unintended entertainment value . First of all, this starts by ripping up the final theme music from Outer Limits, so you know that things look promising. This is the story of a Wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to lift a corpse, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital. Obviously Nurse Sherri tends to satisfy her needs and everything, and when an operation is necessary, she simply hangs up in the operating room when the guy passes and her spirit invades her. And nurse Sherri starts to change. No longer a good nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There are a couple of secondary stories going on as people trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded soccer star who became the love object of one of Sherri's colleagues who even dabbles in voodoo . This is not bad if you are a fan of cult movies, but it could be bad if you are a "Spiderman" fan because you will not like it. Sometimes this actually moves towards "respectability" (for Adamson, anyway) but then "it breaks down: same with some ridiculous event. If you like Adamson movies and similar garbage you might like it, for anyone else you're looking for a lost treasure, keep digging 7 out of 10.
