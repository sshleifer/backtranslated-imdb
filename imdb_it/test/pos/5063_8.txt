Tense, topical political thriller, which has targeted the controversial US rendition policy, another terrifying Orwell sentence (collateral damage, anyone?) For the illegal interrogation, even the torture of suspected terrorists who go through the process legal due. The inhuman interrogation is overseen by the Egyptian Chief of Police, himself the target of a suicide plot - a suicide bombing, thus intertwining the two main lines of the film. Both work very well, the graphics of the bombardment piece and its chilling realism, with its epilogue revealed in an elegant Tarantino-type flashback and torture scenes on an innocent man retractable in all their bloody details. The film marks points on the use of torture as a credible means of intelligence - collected in the war against the terrorists and against the bureaucracy without face-populations (here played by a cold-tempered Meryl Streep, like the head of the CIA who casually gives the order for surrender) that can ruin innocent lives. Don't worry about Kafka's fiction, think more of the recent murder of the innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, with the chief of the metropolitan police still in his work and no one sought the murder of the poor. Acting is excellent in everything: the two key roles of the innocent man and the terrorist are realistically and cleverly interpreted by the unknown actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Similarly Yigal Naor as the intimidating police chief and Zineb Ouhach as his idealized and beloved daughter sound true to their performances, their lack of familiarity (at least for me) increasing the credibility of their characters. Of the greatest Hollywood names present, Gyllenhaal's stature grows with subsequent films, here he plays the government man, initially detached but later conscious, shocked and distressed, who eventually does the right thing. Witherspoon plays the part of the wife upset mainly in one key, but it is credible anyway, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin convincingly show selfish senators and their lackeys who will go so far to help you until their career prospects are compromised. There are some weaknesses in terms of plot; there's a bit of a dramatic need to create the "suspense" surrounding El-Ibrahimi's escape and the character of Streep is perhaps too obvious for a bogey man / woman. The worst thing is the senseless inclusion of Gyllenhaal's girl on the spot, just for decoration and a short free love scene. Overall, however, a compelling thought - which provokes cinematic experience.
