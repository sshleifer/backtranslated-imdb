<br /> <br /> Great movie from the 1970s about mafia operations in New Jersey. When a "non-conformist" gangster doesn't play by the rules of the neighborhood, sooner or later, it's time to eliminate him. <br /> <br /> Joe Pesci was true to his character: smooth and fun. He's just getting better with age. His current face and fame should not have been used on the DVD cover to sell this "B" movie since it was only the third star. <br /> <br /> Dated 70s printed wide-cuff shirts and a lower quality background music creates a distraction. Nice to see the great cars of the 70s. <br /> <br /> However, acting is good. <br /> <br /> Anne Johns' nudity was not necessary to make this mob story work. And, she doesn't show up in the database like any other that plays a movie other than this one. Sin; did a good job! <br /> <br /> Moral of the plot: don't make your "Don" angry with you. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night then check out this DVD. It is part of a three-movie DVD special at $ 5.88 at the local discount store. <br /> <br />
