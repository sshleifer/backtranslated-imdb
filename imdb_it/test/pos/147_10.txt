Of the Korean films I saw, only three had really stayed with me. The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters. The second and third - and now the fourth - were all Park Chan Wook movies, or Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, and now Thirst. <br /> <br /> Park kinda reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with his irreverence towards conventions. All his films are shocking, but not for free. It's more like showing us what we don't expect to see - typically situations that go radically against the morality of society, like incest or a libidinous, bloodsucking but devout priest. He is also very artistically inclined to cinematography, and his films are among the most beautiful I've seen. <br /> <br /> Thirst is all that - to be about the priest and the repressed woman without conscience falls for - and more. It's horror, drama and even comedy, as Park disarms its audience with many inappropriate and fun situations. As such, this could be his best work for me, since his other two films I saw lacked the humorous element that would make them more appealing for repeated views.
