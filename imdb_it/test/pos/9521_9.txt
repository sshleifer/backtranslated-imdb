Starting with a scene like "My name is Joe" in Alcoholics Anonymous, BM's careers in a mad spiral of infidelity, double standards and clandestine affairs. but what do you expect from a family of lawyers? <br /> <br /> A really funny film, with some of the most outrageous characters from The Birdcage, plot and subplot intertwine with surreal scenes of decadent Parisian life (never been at a wedding reception in the gentlemen's bathroom where the grandmother Does the bride and her deranged girlfriend smoke blue jokes and drugs? No, neither do I!) leading to a final scene of almost Arcadian symbolism. <br /> <br /> Excellent.
