Chicago reporter Frank Quinlan decided to go to Iowa to confirm the existence of a so-called angel. He was not alone. His partner Huey Driscoll and new colleague Dorothy Winters also joined him. When they arrived at their destination, they discovered that the angel Michael was very different from what they expected. However, Frank still persuaded Michael to go to Chicago with them. Thus began an interesting journey. <br /> <br /> Even though Michael didn't look like a saint, he was a kind and amusing angel. In fact, Michael had an irresistible charm for women. Also due to the jealousy of other men, he was involved in a revolt. The climax appeared in the pizza restaurant. Dorothy sang lively country songs for Frank. That was exactly what Michael wanted to see. But the next day Huey's dog was killed to death by a racing car. Michael was asked to save him. This would be used to check if he was a real angel. <br /> <br /> Andie Macdowell shone in this play. He also showed his singing skills. John Travolta has shown his comedic talent again. Certainly Pulp Fiction was still his typical work. <br /> <br /> A comedy that will warm your heart. 8/10
