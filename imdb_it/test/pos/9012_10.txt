I was never forced to write a review about something, but seeing such negative reviews about such an innovative show made me say something. First, people simply need to overcome the fact that the voices are different. Once you watch an episode, it never comes to mind. The humor is original and while, yes, some jokes are transferred from the film, they are delivered fresh. Some of them even remember Shrek - self-referential humor. Many of these jokes seem to be aimed at teenagers or original film fans as much as young people and teenagers. Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both hilarious as they resume their roles as Kronk and Yzma and their Annie Award nominations were well guaranteed. <br /> <br /> This show takes time to love, to really get "into the groove" of things, so to speak. If you ignore the horrible musical theme (which really shouldn't guarantee much in the way you judge a show since it's only 30 seconds of the overall product), this show is ridiculously strong hilarity and doesn't lose any spirit of the New Groove Emperor.
