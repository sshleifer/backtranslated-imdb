Not only was this film better than the entire H: LOTS final season. But it was better than any TV movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Looking at the "Top 250" I see that only a film on a small screen did it: how the Grinch stole Christmas. I think it's time to raise that group to 2. <br /> <br /> I admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but I didn't mind. I just enjoyed being able to enter the world of the Baltimore homicide team again!
