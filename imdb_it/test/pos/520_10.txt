Linda Blair has been acting for forty years and, although she will never escape the part of Regan MacNeil in "The Exorcist", few of her later horror films have used her legendary status with such an effect as "Witchery". She plays Jane Brooks, a single pregnant woman who travels with her family to a hotel on the abandoned island her parents want to buy. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) and upon arrival on the island they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) who illegally crouch in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seems that a witch hunt long ago caused her suicide, and she was pregnant at the time. Unaware of the danger, Jane recently dreamed of the dramatic death of the witch, and Jane's little brother, Tommy (Michael Manchester), was more directly visited by his ghostly spirit and dressed in black, whom he calls "the woman in black". The group time at the island inn starts quite quietly; unknown to them, however, the Lady in Black has already sent the captain of their chartered boat (George Stevens). In a short time, isolation and cold begin to affect everyone, and it is during this period of discontent and tension that the Lady in Black begins her reign of terror. He plans to avenge his fate by owning Jane and sacrificing his companions and his unborn child. Each of his other victims fulfills an aspect of his vengeful curse - the greed, lust and blood of a virgin. As the sun sets and the sea turns wild, she pursues them one by one in gruesome and horrifying ways. The island's location is actually scary and the inn is very creepy and disturbingly fired. It is such a colorful film that reminds me of the work of Dario Argento. The lighting is excellent and the decoration of the whole is perfectly spooky. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horror effects are extreme, terrifying and unforgettable. Photography is fantastic, and that's what brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star: many dramatic twists, close-ups that subtly describe Jane's incremental possession, and moments reminiscent of other great horror films. There are hidden tributes to "Rosemary's Baby", "Jacob's Ladder", "The Shining", "Black Sunday" and, of course, "The Exorcist". He does a great job and absolutely steals the show with his humorous and sober performance. This does not mean that the rest of the cast disappoints; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran Annie Ross is memorable in the role of Jane's mother, Rose's mother. Hasselhoff is at his best, but he is not essentially a movie star, and his television character interferes with his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The film is otherwise so violent and disturbing (in a good sense) that it desperately needs their warmth (Blair also played a mother in 2003 "Monster Makers", and his maternal scenes in that film have the same feeling of tenderness for them ). Finally, Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch and has the most surprising voice and accent. Along with Blair, he was also perfectly cast. But it's Blair's film to the end. Jane Brooks also seems to have psychic abilities and this aspect of the film leads back to "Exorcist II: The Heretic". I think "Witchery" is up there with "The Exorcist", "Exorcist II", "Hell Night" and "Summer of Fear" as Blair's best work genre to date.
