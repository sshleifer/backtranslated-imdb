A vampire's definition is an inhuman corpse that should leave his grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi almost nails this concept on the head minus the clich√© of pointed fangs and biting the neck. Being a R-rated film, I knew this was actually about vampires actually being vampires. Which means that the characters in the film are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightly lack glamorous moments compared to Twilight. Having seen Chan-wook Park's previous Oldboy, I had very high expectations of Bakjwi. I anticipated some strange plot sequences with our antihero, known as Priest Sang-hyeon, and I was very impressed by his performance as a holy man who is forced into this dilemma of being human and obeying his thirst for vampire. (SPOILER) After his initial premise that he survives the transfusion of defective blood, he begins to crave blood and discovers his super strength and flying ability. The screens make its transition phase without being too overbearing in the exposure. He begins to drink the blood of the dying and those who wish to be subjected to euthanasia for moral reasons. The tragic and dysfunctional love affair that the priest has with the manipulative Tae-joo is very compelling as they are played by Kanh-ho Song and OK-vin actress of The Host. The special effects are positioned correctly in the background and, although it offers nothing new in the way of acrobatics and CGI, it has not imposed itself on the premise based on the plot and the characters it developed. The plot and the crucial points of the plot are very perverse and grotesque but very original in their Korean style. <br /> <br /> There are not many negative aspects that I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I wonder if the transition phase of the priests could have shown more of the priest who has an emotional crisis with his transformation, but then again this would have made the film 3 hours long. The film was long to begin with. Similarly, vampires don't really have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with. As mentioned before, this film is very tragic, so don't expect anything hopeful as you watch it. <br /> <br /> Overall, Bakjwi is deliciously dark, morbid and original. I highly recommend this movie for serious viewers who have passed the adolescent Twilight phase. This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish Let The Right One In, which is also a good movie.
