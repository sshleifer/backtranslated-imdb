Superb on the screen and extremely faithful to the vintage novel by Mary Webb, this film is a true masterpiece. Apart from the emerging star of exceptional talent, Janet Mcteer as the protagonist and one or two established actors, the film mainly used little-known names. Yet the drama was all the more convincing for that. The social and personal tension is almost tangible and I felt as if the cast is reacting to each other as if they had done in real life. I saw that a commentator asked if Janet McTeer really had a cleft lip, testifying to how beautiful her characterization was. I saw it on TV when it was first shown, recorded on tape, and later the tape was lost. But it remains as clear as anything in my mind. If you have any predilection for the social period, it's a must see.
