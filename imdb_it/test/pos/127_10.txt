Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better account of the details of the film's plot than I could. What I remember most is that it was so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that are wonderful to watch and that also have emotional content that this beauty is relevant, I think you will be happy to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art. <br /> <br /> On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give about an 8.75. The only reason I avoid 9 is that it is a bit of a mood. If you're in the mood for a truly artistic, very romantic movie, then it's a 10. Surely I think it's a must see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so, overall, 8.75.
