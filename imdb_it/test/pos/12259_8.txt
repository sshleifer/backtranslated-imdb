Spunky journalist Holly Hunter produces investigative news for a large news network. He is a non-conformist with an open mouth, incredibly good at his job and with little time for romantic relationships. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men fighting for his love. <br /> <br /> Brooks is an old-school journalist who loves Holly because he represents all that is beautiful about journalism. Both believe that the media exists to test the gods, educate the public and fight for the truth. Children of the sixties, they embody hippie values. They are defenders of the public good. Knights who fight bravely with pen and camera. <br /> <br /> William Hurt, on the other hand, is a much more complex character. Initially clumsy, clumsy and self-deprecating, it gradually reveals itself as a great and sexy manipulator capable of climbing the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, it is the symbol of modern media values: news as a show, journalism as entertainment, news as celebrity, truth as a subject of editing board. We want to despise him and his junk journalism, but we really can't handle it. He is playing the game according to his own rules. Do we condemn it for lack of a moral backbone? Do we condemn the game? Can the game exist if its rules are disobeyed? How did these rules evolve? <br /> <br /> This is not the "Network" of Lumet and Chayefsky, so the film never worries about answering or raising these questions. Content to keep things at the level of light comedy, concludes with Hurt being promoted to London Division and Brooks being launched into a small community network. Holly, after pushing both away, remains trapped between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this spunky reporter remembers his roots, mourns the loss of Brooks and warns of the future William Hurts. <br /> <br /> It is a nice ending, but compared to "Network" "the film seems decidedly trivial. Chayefsky's vision is one in which global media, despite its ubiquity, offer less significant information. world in which globalization has homogenized cultures, information has become subject to corporatization and a handful of media monopolies control all international news This is a world in which truth is subject to shareholders' meetings and economic interests. A world in which spectator ratings determine content and opinion polls dictate the best stories. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is why "Broadcast News", which aspires to the glorious days of journalism, ends with such a bitter-sweet note: it knows what the future holds in. Made in 1987, it has been living for at least a decade. <br /> <br /> But today, in the digital age, things are even worse. acquis have left a very limited number of large companies that dominated the communications landscape. With this came the hyper-mercantilism of content, the barrier between the creative / editorial side and the commercial side almost collapsed. Today everyone could be able to start their own blog or website, but these are basic business. With increasing communication of the person (due to technological progress - e-mail, internet, electricity, air mail, etc.) the size of the individual world also increases. He must project his voice farther and stronger, fighting the deafening white noise, the incessant verbal immobility that is the global community. <br /> <br /> So in the end you need two things according to democratic theory. First, you need a rigorous presence of people in power and people who want to be in power, both in the private and public sectors. Secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all the important issues of the day. In a democratic society the media system as a whole should produce this kind of culture. Unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the demands of democratic journalism and a democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? This is light stuff, but a witty script, some funny moments and a short cameo by Jack Nicholson, elevates him above most other journalism films. It is interesting to note that, unlike most media films, it never immerses itself in satire, and instead plays things like a straight love triangle. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
