Let me start by saying that if you are expecting subtle humor, you are in the wrong theater. It is low eyebrow and hit heavily. But he's not out to tickle your funny bone. He has the bat out and he has drawn a bead on the side of the head. But fear not. While the films are going, this is a fairly kind education. Oh, too, weighed down by the oath, but again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers. <br /> <br /> Was this film called "intelliocracy"? F *** no. The gem, the essence of Mike Judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh to himself. Beavis and Butthead were very popular among teenage boys, the very people they constantly teased. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, I don't think the humor of this movie is for the super smart. Maybe you're too smart to have it. But he is not aiming for you. He's aiming for your average Joe. And he has a message: act together and, for God's sake, study botany! It's a bit bumpy and the narrator gets a little irritating after a while, but again, this movie is meant for people who need a lot of storytelling ;-) It's fun. He has a message that he wants to be sure that we all understand. <br /> <br /> I wonder about the casting of Luke Wilson as a man with a 100 IQ. Sometimes, he is not able to minimize (what does he have, like, a 104?) At the level of his character. Sometimes slightly forced. <br /> <br /> Kudos on Dax Shepard in this. I remember seeing him in Zathura and thinking, "This guy looks like an idiot." In this film, he is a great idiot. Maybe I'm a psychic. <br /> <br /> It took us a while to warm up with Maya Rudolph, but I gave it a little margin. After all, she had to play a straight man on an entire planet. But once he got a little time on the screen, he made an important contribution. <br /> <br /> Terry Crews played the same psychotic and aggressive character he has played many times in the past, but he is still a first-rate president. <br /> <br /> Another advantage is that the place was practically empty. Counting my girlfriend and I, there were literally six people in the theater. We may have had a barbecue and a mariachi band. So, no annoying people talk, as seems to be the norm in the "talking to TV" era. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good premise and a competent delivery, given the set goal. Lots of laughs scattered everywhere. <br /> <br /> What made this film scary was the fact that when we left the theater, it was like the film was still playing. We saw a lot of idiocy in the people around us immediately, perhaps made more evident by the dose we had in the theater .... <br /> <br /> They are all pods, all of them!
