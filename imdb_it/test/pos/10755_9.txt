What is often overlooked by Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd did not have the background of Vaudeville / Music Hall and was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to act; and he discovered he had a talent for fun acting - first in shorts, then in features. A name was made like "Lonesome Luke", a knock-off by Chaplin; with the "character of the glasses" that made him the all-American boy rather than a grotesque, Lloyd found his pace and his films became among the best products during the era of silence. <br /> <br /> He has developed a reputation as a "daredevil" in some short films, and has kept it in some of his best films ("Safety Last", "For Heaven's Sake", "Girl Shy"). It was more popular than Chaplin or Keaton in the 1920s and became very rich before the advent of sound. <br /> <br /> The first sound films were often disasters. To get the most out of their "sound", too much dialogue has been used in many films. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's acting skills were, after twenty years, silent-oriented. He didn't have a bad voice; his high tone suited his "glasses" character. And his sound films were not the unqualified disasters of the legend. Yet the silent films had been brought to a high artistic level (especially Lloyd's, which had no limited budget and were extremely well made); with the introduction of talkies, the films had to learn to walk again and have made some missteps. <br /> <br /> Although I tried to move with the times and embrace the sound, Lloyd's best songs from his first (excessively chatty) talkies were still visual - like the "Movie Crazy" scene where he seems to be in riding a luxury car, but actually "took a ride" on his bicycle. <br /> <br /> Trying to recapture the reckless antics that made him famous, as he did in "Feet First", was a misstep. (In "Safety Last", his best film and the one that, deservedly or not, pushed Lloyd into the box as a "reckless comic", he played a determined young man, climbing to the top. "Safety Last" had a natural the structure that went up to the step of his character on the side of the building, was obviously frightened, but his fear was added to the humor: in "Feet first", he arrived by mistake in a precarious position of building scale, his frenetic cries for help destroyed by humor: his character was pathetic and cruel, the aspiration to save his neck - perhaps an accurate statement of the 1930s, but not funny). Harold Lloyd was not bogged down in the past, like some wacky Norma Desmond. He embraced the sound and tried to bring his films in different directions, growing and changing with the industry. When "Feet First" failed, he left the daredevil business and satirized the talking movie industry, "Movie Crazy". Just as he had to go through many films like "Lonesome Luke" before recording his place in the history of cinema with the character of glasses, he had tried different directions in sound films before hitting his stride in sound, which he did with " The Catspaw ". <br /> <br /> In "The Catspaw" he plays the son of a missionary bred in China, who is involuntarily elected mayor as a frontist for corrupt political interests. When he discovers the truth, he commits himself to cleaning up the city. Only at the age of forty, Lloyd could still play the brash young man. <br /> <br /> However, "The Catspaw" was another box office failure and Lloyd made only three other films, including "The Milky Way". Among his main competitors, Chaplin still had silent films in him and Keaton was hopelessly mishandled. "The Catspaw" and "The Milky Way" suggest that Lloyd could have mastered the sonic comedy if he were a little younger, or if the audience had given him the benefit of the doubt after his first sounding flops. <br /> <br /> Although the film has been unfairly defamed about the way Lloyd's character has cleaned up the city, it's good for him. From his days in "short films" Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the climax of "The Catspaw" reached him once again, in a surprising way; until the makeup is revealed it looks creepy, and then the laughter comes. <br /> <br /> Seen as a product of its time, "The Catspaw" is fascinating and fun. A very well written sound comedy, well played by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, his curious mixture of drama and sly humor makes him seem almost a comedy by Frank Capra or Preston Sturges.
