In the first twenty minutes we are swept away by some powerfully portrayed emotions: a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent discussion with her forty year old daughter; love for his students for the piano teacher (and music teacher) expressed in a careful critical evaluation; the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and in the artist. In this short space of time our senses have been convincingly assaulted with very real characters. We are also overwhelmed by powerful music and shown the difference between grandiose and mediocre performances with a lot of attention to nuances. This material alone would have been the basis for an exceptional film of widespread appeal. But the trend of French cinema is what it is, it goes deeper, exploring the repressed teacher's sexuality, the expression of sexual freedom and the subsequent break in a context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are attracted by his suffering and, at least initially, we ask how much suffering can be related to the realization of genius, particularly in the composers he admires. The Piano Teacher contains graphic dialogues and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people may prefer not to watch. The scenes are essential for the dilemmas that the film tries to raise and therefore can hardly be called free. A great film could be, but the mainstream view is not.
