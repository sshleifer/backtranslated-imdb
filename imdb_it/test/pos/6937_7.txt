"you can't realistically take it". -sheets <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world of its own. I've never seen anything like it. The only thing I can think of to compare it with psychedelic drugs. Forgive the clich√© ?? I do not mean simply that it is inconsistent and absurd, even if occasionally it is. I mean it takes you through such a wide range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly to overwhelm you, and when it's over, you find out that everything happened while you were sitting on the couch. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that it is extremely low budget, as a disclaimer for those who, after seeing "Shaun of the Dead", consider themselves fans of underground zombie movies. It should also be noted that it is much more "brutal" than one would expect. The children are gutted and someone mocks a teenager before shooting her in the groin. His body is subsequently "raped". These are certainly not flaws, in fact, I believe it is due to the merit of the film. But if it doesn't look like your kind of movie, don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I do not intend to exaggerate with brutality, do not wait "Inside" or something like that. "I hesitate to give away any plot, because it is really full of surprises. Even the opening scene, which it has nothing to do with zombies, it is at the same time a classic horror scene and something absolutely original. <br /> <br /> Man, they are in three paragraphs and I have almost never said anything. that the film was fantastic: 1. It is big and it keeps moving.At a certain point, you expect it to turn into another NotLD clone, a movie on the edge of a window where everyone stays on a farm and they discuss with each other. At the end of the film, however, the farm scenes will seem like a distant dream, there are also a number of urban outdoor scenes, which are rare in low-cost zombie movies. <br /> <br /> 2. The makeup / gore is much better than ZB 1. More convincing and more creative Something fun: the first zombies seem to be lame lame. Then, halfway, they suddenly look really good, with prostheses and all the rest. Some of them look like Fulci Zombies, some remember Mr. Tongue from "Day of the Dead". And he has great scenes of dozens of zombies moving around. Never gets old. <br /> <br /> 3. There is something strangely emotional about it. A character claims that heaven exists and that our dead / undead protagonists are now in heaven. In the context of the film, we believe it to be true. Although the characters behave with the typical stupidity of the horror film, they seem genuinely to care about each other and, as a result, I found myself taking care of them. <br /> <br /> 4. The pace is fantastic. There is hardly a dull moment. <br /> <br /> My only criticism bordering on criticism is that Todd Sheets has the most bizarre dialogue I've ever heard. I personally think it adds to the experience, but I don't think it does it on purpose, so I can't give the film a perfect rating. (Example: when a car breaks down, the owner shouts at the passengers, then says something with the effect of "Sorry if I screamed at you guys. You don't know what it means to have your father above you with a straight razor when you're five . "wtf?) In the end, it will be more than I can handle. It involves a montage with Bill Clinton, and then some credits that explain the metaphor of the zombies. Really, at this point, I was definitely reliving my drug experiences. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 7/10.
