I admit to going more for the traditional vampire tale, but this is a real winner. Lots of graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours. There was a lot of blood with the vicious blood-suckers attacking mortals and even each other for world control. A voucher for all of us vampire lovers.
