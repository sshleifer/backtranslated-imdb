Although it's not the first movie I bought for myself, this is almost certainly what I've seen the most. The animation is well designed by the Tokyo Movie Shinsa experts, and the animators have often used intelligent techniques such as having the sun cause "lens flare", making the camera soak (and having the "operator's hand" camera "clean the lens!" etc. While the film avoided becoming a "gadget-fest" for animators, the judicious but generous application of these techniques gave the film a much more "realistic" appearance than the typical cartoon. <br /> <br /> The plot has many interwoven weaves that don't seem to have much to do with one another until everything comes together in the end, in a way that even writers unequivocally admit is invented. Each of the main plot lines has its musical theme, ranging from "Pop goes the weasel" [Hamton & Plucky], to the love theme of "Romeo and Juliet" [Fifi & Johnny]. The transitions between the frames are slightly varied, but consistent. <br /> <br /> Really a wonderful movie; there isn't much original music, even if the new "Spinning Song" lyrics are smart and fun. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
