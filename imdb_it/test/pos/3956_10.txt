I had the chance to see Blind Spot in Barcelona and I had a great time. I thought it was one of the most endearing films I had seen for a long time. One of the film's best points was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpected and beautifully filmed locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on the screen that runs through the film making it so exciting. They are set on exceptional landscapes identified by such an original eye (the work of the PDO is simply fantastic) that makes you feel as if you were discovering them for the first time. The mood of the desert is everywhere and even the scenes shot in the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be a natural extension of it. The story guides you smoothly through all these wonderful settings to lead you to a bitter-sweet ending, becoming the perfect climax for this perfect journey. The construction of the film itself is a master trade. The skilful use of innovative resources (such as still images that link Danny's memories to the film) will be compared to those pieces of handmade work so rare and so amusing. Blind Spot allows you to capture the essence of the desert by bringing you into a universal common ground where each of us can feel both discoverer and native.
