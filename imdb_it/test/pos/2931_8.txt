The next American supermodel is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately I've been bored with it. <br /> <br /> cycle 1: yes I am happy Adrienne won, I wanted her to win from the start. <br /> <br /> cycle 2: it's too bad, I think Mercedes deserved it. <br /> cycle 3: I didn't like Eva, but I didn't like most of the girls in this cycle. <br /> <br /> cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. I don't know what they saw in Naima, but I certainly know what they saw in Kahlen. <br /> <br /> cycle 5: like cycle 3, this too was not a great cycle. but of all the girls, NICOLE as a winner? eww! <br /> cycle 6: I liked Sara and Joanie, but Danielle is fine too. <br /> <br /> cycle 7: Caridee deserved it. <br /> <br /> cycle 8: no, I didn't want Jaslene to win. I didn't like it I saw other girls in that cycle with definitely more potential than her, even though I didn't see much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> nice show, I've just seen it too many times to like it a lot more: D
