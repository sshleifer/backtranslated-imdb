I saw it on DVD with subtitles, which made it a little frustrating due to the length of the movie. But I was riveted for all this. That I have been fascinated by the characters and always absorbed in history, despite the subtitles, is a testament to the power of the film. It's an extraordinary job. I have it on my list of the ten favorite movies of all time. It is easily the best foreign film I've seen in the last twenty years. I would like to know the whole story behind the making of this film. A long time must have elapsed and required the use of hundreds of positions. His use of some hardcore scenes (on TV in the motel room) could cause some people to choose not to see him, but if you don't mind, you'll be deeply moved by all the stories of this!
