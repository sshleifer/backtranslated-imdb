I'm a big Naruto fan, even though I haven't seen all the episodes or read all the manga. <br /> <br /> I really liked the first Naruto movie, and to tell you the truth I was a little nervous that this wouldn't be as good (or full of action) as the first (mainly because this one in Australia only had a PG instead of an M, which is a PG-13 USA or 12 UK). But I was wrong (thankfully)! The animation has been improved (although some drawings of the characters in the points seemed hasty) and it was very good especially in the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> By the way, let's talk about the fighting scenes! The animation and action in the fighting scenes was spectacular and very funny! I particularly liked the genjutsu battle with the kankuro and the fight with Gaara who fights the form by moving the female warriors! All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari was in the film, Shikamaru could save her from warrior women dramatically! And maybe they could have a PASSIVE KISS! In my summary above, I say that this is more of a piece of Cinema than an extended episode. And it does! The action is very cinematic and the quality of the animation seems very elaborate, especially during the fights! Overall, this is an excellent anime movie that is a must for all Naruto fans! 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! Okay, I'll stop!
