'Wicked Little Things' really stands out from other zombie movies. First of all, all the zombies in the movie don't start to bite you and tear your flesh with your bare hands. They'll kill you with a pickaxe or shovel And secondly, they can't die. In most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but they simply won't die. Third, which is the main reason why this film separates by itself, all zombies are children. How exactly did they die to become zombies? They were working in a coal mine when suddenly they were all killed in a collapse. Now they wander through the forest carrying their pickaxes and shovels, waiting for someone to arrive, so they can kill them and eat them. Oh, they go out even at night. Yep, only at night. This makes the movie even more fun than it would be if they came out in the morning. Despite the violent and bloody chaos of this film, "Wicked Little Things" is a great choice if you're looking for a movie about zombie children. Don't expect anything exceptional like "Dawn of the Dead" or "Land of the Dead", but expect a lot of blood and violence that makes this movie a true zombie fan. Give Rob Zombie's "Halloween" Scout Taylor a great hand to offer a great performance like the one he did on "Halloween". He really needs to start playing other horror movies.
