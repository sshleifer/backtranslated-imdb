If you like stupid comedies like Airplane, you will love this movie! It's definitely in the style of Airplane and Scary Movie. A funny movie! It has the strangest cast of characters all in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are lousy, but I think we should be, since it's a silly comedy. Apparently there are two versions of the film, one on Blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com. The one on the website seems to be a preview version signed by the director. There is fun behind the scenes of the material shot at Neverland with Michael Jackson. The film was shot in 2003 and says it's a funny PG rated on the box.
