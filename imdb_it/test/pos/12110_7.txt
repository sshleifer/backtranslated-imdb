A rare very long role of Kinski as a crazy outlaw of Johnny's sex who is wanted in San Francisco. Kinski's character is obsessed with rape of women, a sexual predator in the old west that has nothing but stealing, raping and killing in his mind. This film is perhaps a big disappointment for many Spaghetti Western fans, but not for many Klaus Kisnki fans. Altogether he had two things to do for a great performance by Klaus Kinski and a soundtrack by Stelvio Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another plot that required a lot more work to be impulsive but still fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It would be nice to see this film redone in the future. Since most of the old movies are played nowadays.
