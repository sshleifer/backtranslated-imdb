The Italian concept of "sprezzatura" was grace and carelessness in the social ways that led to success in love, as described in the 16th century manual "Il cortigiano". The film "Hitch" deserves to be seen for the embodiment of the concept of "splitting" in Will Smith's dynamic performance. <br /> <br /> Smith plays the character of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant. to those short of luck and safety. The best scenes are when Hitch trains the painfully shy and clumsy Albert in his quest to win the heart of a New York socialite and in Hitch's attraction for Sara and a surprise for her when she visits Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith is supported with a good job by Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this film is driven by Smith's charm and victorious personality. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Smith exceeds the average of comics to make "Hitch" an eminently watchable and fun movie. I don't think there is another actor working today who is able to offer the perfect charisma and timing with comedic moments like Will Smith in this film. And his secret is in the "sprezzatura"!
