The case history of Dr. Mulholland is known: what should have been another excursion (after "Twin Peaks") in the rival TV series field ended abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for producers to venture into an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started shooting again to complete a completely new feature. The result: one of the most impressive cinematic experiences of this decade that can be ranked among David Lynch's best works. His previous films "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet" or "Wild at Heart" kept aloof in an irritating way that pushed the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot that happens like here. /> <br /> 'Mulholland Dr.' it's a puzzle where the pieces are missing, others obviously were taken from "Eraserhead" and "Lost Highway", but it never seemed like an unfinished business. On the internet I came across many instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that he loses his magic when he tries to decipher it completely. All these detailed explanations about the solution are not just waste, but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where it is not absolutely necessary. Imagine this scenario: a small child is analyzing his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear is. Is it because he wants to destroy his toy? Is the secret found in the teddy bear or in the heart of the child? Transferring this to "Mulholland Dr." it means that innocence is one of the most important conditions for seeing and appreciating it. <br /> <br /> David Lynch not only manages to imagine the surface of human life behavior, but also to try his hand at everything below. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that remains unsaid; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' it has the intensity that requires a cast that completely removes problems with the substance. Actresses and actors ready to selflessly follow the director's visions.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressive way that you won't want or you can't imagine another cast. While their acting at first seems to be a bit overlapping, you'll soon realize that this stereo typing is set up with the aim of manipulating the viewer and disconcerting it as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. <br /> <br /> When you claim the criterion of a well-made film to be able to lose yourself and immerse yourself in what you see on the screen, Lynch has succeeded in making a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifests the status of David Lynch as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like any director who goes beyond the limits, he is faced with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's movie world. 'Mulholland Dr.' is it more than a sleeper ?? is a must see for all those who love ambitious cinema. Furthermore, the film is a pay-off with Hollywood, in form and content, which in that distinction had already been dared before.
