Out of any category, this is a film that is demented and beyond limits, even in today's standards. Shot entirely in crap-o-rama, this film will blow your mind (and something else too!) <br /> <br /> The amount of unpleasant taste and sleaze is surprising. The dialogue is incredibly fast and engaging. You will love or hate this movie, but give it away. I've seen it 4 times and absolutely love it. Divine is looking to be the dirtiest person in life, but so are his rivals in this obscene and disgusting (but fun) and elegant film. <br /> <br /> Divine was phenomenal, and "she" will always be very missed. Edith Massey makes the performance as unforgettable as the "egglady" and don't forget the energetic Mink Stole! <br /> <br /> Ãœber crazy s ** t! <br /> <br /> Also recommended for you little sick puppies <br /> <br /> Female problems <br /> <br /> Desperate Living <br /> <br /> Polyester
