good job. Here's how to describe this animated Scooby-Doo adventure. This is Scooby's best animated film I've seen. I liked the story. I thought it had some depth. The film is also very paced.it does not become boring for a minute. He also has an interesting group of characters (besides Scooby and Shaggy and the band, of course) and also, the film was a blast. I really enjoy watching it. I also liked great Scottish music. It was very catchy and contagious. Of course, we know that Scooby and Gamg will solve the mystery, but it's still fun to get to that point. Animation is also very good for this film. I love it if they did a Scooby 3D animation adventure, but we'll just have to wait and see it. For me, Scooby-Doo and the Loch Ness monster is a 7/10
