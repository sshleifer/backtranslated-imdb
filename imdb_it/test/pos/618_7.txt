The first half of the movie scared me and I'm normally not easy to scare, but the second half of this thriller didn't work well enough, but it's still very scary! A good thriller, which use simple ways to make good horror. Lowbudget, set in Russia, unknown cast and produced in Europe. but still very funny, and yes, there are also some laughs for good things!
