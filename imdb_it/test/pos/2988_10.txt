I love this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was working in a video store. when I went to buy it they told me it was out of print and I couldn't order it, so today I thought I would watch. and then I discovered that they published it in Spain on DVD with the name "Algo Mas Que Amigos" and you can buy it in English and Spanish on the DVD .... I hope this helps ..... I know how difficult it is to find films which we love that have not released in the US market. good luck..oh For more information here is a place to look .... HTTP://www.zonadvd.com I think it will go for 10 USD dollars on eBay as well.
