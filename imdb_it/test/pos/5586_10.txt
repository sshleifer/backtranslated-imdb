It seems that this film has been overlooked by everyone. Someone should get it out on VHS and DVD. It's an excellent film and far superior to the one with Brooke Shields, which was terrible. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons deserves more credit than he gets now. It would be nice if all his films were offered on VHS or DVD. Jean Simmons was, and still is, an excellent actress. It was certainly a beauty. In fact, she is still a beauty. He also did very well on T.V. It is much better than many of today's actors.
