"Edge of the City" is another film that owes much credit to "On the Waterfront". From its offices in New York, to its score, to the belief that whatever your problem is, you can somehow correct your mistakes. <br /> <br /> "Edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, this is where the film fails as "Waterfront". At 85 minutes the film runs through the creation of relationships, and binds everything together so fast that it seems largely forced and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers **** <br /> <br /> the relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed at the beginning. I don't think these two characters, from two very different places, would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /> <br /> I think the entire sub plot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so clumsy with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason he is in the movie is that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways they could show it. I would also have liked to see some Axel scenes in the army to illustrate why it is as it is. <br /> <br /> Acting is excellent. Poitier is formidable in a well-written role. His role as Tyler is interesting and multilayered and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected and intelligent. The Cassavettes, like Axel North, although very good, don't seem quite right for the part. Warden is as formidable as the boss who knows the secret of Axel (even though his fight scene with the Cassavettes eventually went on horribly. I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in the role of Poitier's wife. <Br / > <br /> Overall, "Edge of the City" is a clever film, with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style image, without wasting time building the drama. <br /> < br /> 7 out of 10
