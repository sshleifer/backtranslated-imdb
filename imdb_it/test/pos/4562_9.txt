This is one of the most satisfying of the book for television adaptations. The actress who makes us believe that a Borg can be sexy makes us believe that a spy and a traitor can have some qualities of redemption. <br /> <br /> The television plot does not exactly follow Cornwell's story but is both exciting and rewarding as a revisitation of a damn good yarn. If you have a yen for uniformed romance, there is a lot of sexual energy that lights up between our Sharpe man and the liar. It made me wish his role was closer to that in books. But no matter there is enough offended hero, redeemed hero, angry hero, runaway hero and battle hero to keep you glued to your DVD playback.
