After watching this film I experienced a new sensation. I had seen a movie in which the main actor had staged a performance that almost rivaled the Chevy Chase legend in 'Fletch'. This does not mean that the performances are comparable, but both offer a practically perfect delivery of their lines. That actor is Marc Singer! Singer is Jack Ford, the 'Droid Gunner' of the title, who makes a living by collecting the bounty on androids. There are mutants, topless droids of pleasure (!), A Scandinavian smuggler, and perhaps a half attempt to make a statement about the class or maybe even about globalization or ......... well, it doesn't matter. What matters in this film is the dry way in which Singer offers his lines resulting in side-splitting humor! What matters in this film is that director Fred Olen Ray seems to realize that serious science fiction works very rarely, and when your budget is scarce, it's better not to take yourself seriously. Olen Ray said that everyone involved in this film had a lot of fun and this transfers to the film. I challenge you to criticize a film that allows itself to portray the futuristic Earth as eternally dark and illuminated by neon and then ends up in a warehouse pipe and valve. The self parody is a very saving quality. To sum up, Fred Olen Ray is an ambassador for making independent films and Marc Singer is the perfect B-movie host. If only Olen Ray was able to write Tim Thomerson to the equation, we would have a movie in our hands.
