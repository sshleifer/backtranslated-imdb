This is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film I've seen in years! The plot seen in print is almost trivial: a ship crashes on a deserted planet with three suns, the survivors have to adapt to the landscape and each other, then the darkness falls and the monsters appear. Pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when he almost knocked out the passengers, takes charge of the group and enlist the help of the convicted murderer Riddick to lead them through the darkness towards the escape ship - he is the one with improved eye surgery that they can see in the dark. But it's not really that simple - each character is complex, three-dimensional, with contrasting traits, so you never know who is good and who is bad. <br /> <br /> The performances are uniformly superb - Radha Mitchell shows that Fry is arming himself for leadership, overcoming his own fears, and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man who takes Riddick into custody, proves to have his idiosyncratic program and standards. But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - it has the presence of magnetic screens I've seen for years. For most of the film his face is in shadow, and in reality he doesn't say much, but he does attract your attention anyway. Sometimes it attracts your attention by not talking - or not moving. And Diesel does not trivialize the character, as one could easily do, giving him a "golden heart" - Riddick is still a bad and bad man as they approach the ship - it only makes us see those first temporary steps to take care of oneself only to take care of others. <br /> <br /> Technically the film is very good. The light effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum: the triple excessive sunlight and the darkness of the tone. Special effects that show Riddick's and monsters' views add to the suspense, as do the sound effects of flying monsters and use ultrasound to "see" (the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and appropriately scary). The editing is so tight that sometimes it's almost shocking - there's literally no padding in this film, no fading, no time to reorient yourself. <br /> <br /> From the opening photo at the end of the credits you have to keep your intelligence on you. Every scene, every line of dialogue, every single shot is important. Watch it three times to understand everything. <br /> <br /> My only warning concerns science: the solar system as shown in the model is impossible (the planets revolve around the suns, not vice versa). However, this does not affect human history, so I didn't take points for this.
