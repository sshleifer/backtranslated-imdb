2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama that has some similarities in tone and subject with films like Bully, Elephant and Kids (although, from my point of view, 2:37 is a film superior to those three). Before watching the film, my expectations were neutral, but in the end I got a very good impression thanks to the intelligent script, the perfect direction of Murali K. Thalluri and the excellent performances of a group of young actors. <br /> <br /> The sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many films, television programs and books that claim to find and predict the external or internal reasons for those wild expressions of rebellion, discontent ... and especially of madness. Some people might say that 2:37 comes too late for that art movement; however, I don't think so, because that delay has allowed the film to make a more artistic analysis, focusing on the situation with more subtlety and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish that has imbued other films with similar stories. /> <br /> On the characters of 2:37, we can find the clich√©s of youth cinema (from director and screenwriter John Hughes -RIP-movies to teen horror films): the beautiful "princess", the clumsy "nerd ", the obnoxious athletes, etc. It would have been very easy to make them become empty caricatures defined by their function in the script; but it is admirable that the script transcends stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems that, more or less, anyone can find on its way to maturity. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is an excellent film, whose only flaw is that the ending seems a bit influenced, but that compensates for this with many positive elements. It will be very interesting to see Thalluri's upcoming projects, since he had a great debut with this film.
