Well, how can I classify Farscape without resorting to exciting superlatives? Ok, here it is! The screenplays are fantastic, with every episode offering lots of fun, drama, humor and pure transparency. The casting is perfect especially for that of Zhaan (the blue woman) played by Virginia Hey, each character has a depth that is not really in the Star Trek series. <br /> <br /> I think having an Australian ride on the show does it for me, Australia has destroyed quality movies and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I've only seen the first four episodes in the order of the United Kingdom and have a quality that makes every 45 minute show (in the UK) stands out more like a movie than a weekly TV series. <br /> <br /> The episode that really does for me is "I, ET" that transforms the alien concept around where Moya (a living ship, even the spaceship has a great character) is forced to land on a planet that has yet to make "First Contact" and is surprisingly land like and Crichton meets a radio telescope and * he * is the "little green man" to them. In short the effects. <br /> <br /> In short the effects are fantastic, the scripts are of high quality and the main characters (none of which really matters more than others) are interesting, not always "good" and well just excellent. <br /> <br /> Roll on the second season!
