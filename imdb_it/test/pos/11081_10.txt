... David Bovie sings in this film. BUT IT IS!!! It's all about America, so don't be ashamed to look at it. Think, if you can, to prevent further damage ... You know, you're the same normal guy next door, so be careful! One of the best critics of the "common" mind and friendship. Still not interested? Try it for music - it's worth a try, close your eyes and Pat Metheny and David Bowie will touch you so deeply that you'll start screaming! And while you look, if you dare to open your eyes, please don't make popcorn and things, you'll miss them a lot. You might think it's not worth it, but think twice - and don't look at your neighbors' lawn - you never know what to find there ... Is it worth it? Try it! Just don't die or gloat over it ...
