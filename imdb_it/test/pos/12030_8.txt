Guest from the Future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, the battle of good and evil - all with a small budget, child actors and few special effects. Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth elementary Kolya "Nick" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels for 100 years into the future. He discovers an almost perfect and utopian society in which robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people appreciate all that technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of an important scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows human and animal minds to be read. The device can be used both in positive and negative, depending on the hands in which it falls. When two evil space pirates of Saturn who want to dominate the universe try to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of the 20th century school boy, Nick. With the pirates lit in his tracks, go back in time, followed by the pirates and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow while the pirates without luck try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls at the same school where Nick goes and demonstrates superhuman abilities in the PE class. The problem is that Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while pirates do. Furthermore, pirates are able to change their appearance and literally transform into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea of ​​Terminator ...) Who comes first to Nick - and Mielophone - first? Excellent storyline, non-stop adventures and excellent soundtrack. I wish Hollywood would produce films for children like this ...
