I paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressive ability of the lead actress, Julianne Nicholson. I have no words to describe how enchanted I have been. All the actors and actresses played well. Above all I noticed the solid good character that was consistent in predicting the future - Andy Richter who played Carl. I think the idea of ​​showing a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions, and numerous counseling meetings, is like the real world. Even Jay Mohr, who played Ed, the future husband, had a very real behavior. But, I want to emphasize again the point of a rich repertoire of expressions that Julianne Nicholson is capable and does it naturally, it was overwhelming for me. In fact, the subject of this film seems to me to be very important and touches on highly significant thoughts of many people. I saw this movie several times and I wasn't bored. He rises again and again in my thoughts.
