Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the head of a cult in the desert who tries to resurrect his people, only to have a heart attack! He ends up dying on an operating table, and out of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), who then continues to hacking and cutting until his nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> Even if I know the filmography of the directors enough to know that it is made up mainly of definitive schlock, "Nurse Sherri" is not so bad. Of course, it is clear that these were low-budget things, but all I found very well about it were the visual effects. Acting is not as bad as one might expect. <br /> <br /> There are two different versions available on DVD. A much more sex-oriented version with plenty of T&A is the original cut, with cartoons as hilarious as the victim and his love interest that shares their "weirder sex" moments, including fellatio during a lecture college! br /> <br /> The film will then be cut out for the theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly. Some scenes have been eliminated with new additions (with Stevens, the role played by J.C. Wells, expanded). The most memorable sequence of the film in this cut is a scene in a foundry, and it works quite well. This cut of the film is more interesting overall; I would advise a spectator to see them both and compare them. <br /> <br /> Both versions reach the last third, and benefit from a wonderful show starring Bill Roy as the mad Reanhauer and a moody climax set in a cemetery (although it was actually shot in the courtyard of Adamsons!). Also worth mentioning is Marilyn Joi, the friendly nurse attracted to football player Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), who lost her eyes in a car accident, and who incidentally is the key to solving the story with her knowledge of voodoo rituals. The film also makes a fun use of music from the personal collection of the composer Harry Lubins, including TV series such as "One Step Beyond" and "The Outer Limits". <br /> <br /> "Nurse Sherri" (known by more alternative titles (including "Beyond the Living" and "Hospital of Terror") than any other Adamson movie) is actually quite funny low budget fare. I ended up having fun watching it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
