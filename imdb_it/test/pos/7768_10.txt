Late film critic Gene Siskel said this film shows how easy it is to make a film. He was giving him a compliment even though he could now be considered an insult these days. Although I don't always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. Love Jones is a brilliant example of what a love story should be: realistic with real characters in real situations. <br /> <br /> The story tells the ups and downs of the relationship between Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than a nice couple on the screen. These two actually have the chemistry together. You can feel the atmosphere between these two whenever they are on the screen and its fantastic. <br /> <br /> Bill Bellamy is rather funny as the deceptive Wood and Lisa Nicole Carson is as big as Nina's friend, Simone. Isaiah Washington is as great as Darius Savon's dear friend and I sigh whenever I see him in a movie. The boy is a great actor whose career is ruined by the lowlifes industry and the children's games they play. You may believe that he called the little weasel of Grey's Anatomy by his name, but anyone who knows how it works Follywood knows it's better not to believe any "official story" from the place of being believed. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and nice characters who are in realistic situations that anyone who has been in love can report. You love these people because they are credible and are not portrayed as gangsters and vagabonds. It is not possible to find an obscene stereotype here. Contrasts with romantic toady movies. Exactly. In closing, if you love Black Cinema, you would do well to own a copy of this film.
