Unconditional love is one of the best films I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace he doesn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds the glass in her hand and says "In memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor. Grace is one of the best roles of Kathy Bates. Meredith Eaton steals almost every scene she is in. Rupert Everett does some of his best work in Unconditional as Dirk. The kiss between Rupert and Meredith led me to another attack of hysterics. In this day and age of gay rights under discussion, I think this film should be seen by everyone. As a homosexual in the late 1940s I saw people lose everything when a loved one dies, so kudo is involved in all phases of making this film.
