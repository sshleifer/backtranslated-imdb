I saw this film at the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, where one of the screenwriters, Jos√© Giovanni, was honored. It is considered a great noir-crime drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura. The attention given to each character and the complex psychological representations, which detail loyalty, disloyalty, love and hope, are enormous. It's an excellent drama, an excellent thriller and an excellent film. Up there with the best of Melville. (The English title "Class all risk," in French "Classe tous risques" is a play on "Touriste Class", which means "Tourist Class".
