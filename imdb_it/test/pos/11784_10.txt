Nothing is sacred. Just ask Ernie Fosselius. These days, everyone has a video camera, and a movie has just come out before the parodies start flying, written and shot quickly, and often published directly on the Internet. Nowadays the parodies are hot, and we do everything to make sure that the directors don't make their self-importance. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars was created, it was a different world. The cinema was the playground of a select few and the parodies were very rare. Then God gave us Hardware Wars. It was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) And the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. Does this remove the experience? DIAMINE NO! This is what makes it so great! It was raw and unpolished, and it struck relentlessly some of the most pretentious moments of the original film. From Fluke Starbucker waving a torch instead of a lightsaber (I did it when I was young!) To Chewchilla the Wookie Monster, to "nah, some headache" by Auggie Ben Doggie, this short film is part of the phenomenon as one of the real Star Wars movies. Rent it. Buy. Borrow it from a friend. And that the farce is with you. Always.
