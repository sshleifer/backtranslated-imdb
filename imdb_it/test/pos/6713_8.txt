Tobe Hooper (back from the mainstream success with "Poltergeist") this time aims at the skies. "Lifeforce" is an adaptation of "The Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson. The script of 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby) varies a bit 'I was told: the futuristic plot was made contemporary and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage from Earth a few weeks after its release some movies (so I read). <br /> <br /> The story is about a shuttle mission (commander of Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Hailey's comet as it crosses the Earth. Everything goes smoothly, but once you reach the comet you discover that an alien ship is hidden in the comet's coma. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers the dried bat-like creatures. Looking further into the ship is a chamber containing three humanoids (two naked males and a pretty attractive naked woman) in strange stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a creature of bats in tow. <br /> <br /> A little later the ship returns to Earth but no contact can be made by NASA and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. On hooking up with the Churchill it turns out that a huge fire apparently killed the crew and all the flight data. But the three humanoids remain. However, it was learned that a rescue capsule had been launched but whose position is unknown. <br /> <br /> Soon they make the discovery of the origin of the alien when the attractive queen of space vampires arises from his sleep to easily seduce the life force from the men around her. If you suck your face with it it makes you like them and if you don't eat after two hours you will dry up and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough energy of the population to support them and their ship for the journey to the next planet to devastate them too. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Commander survives entering the pod (crash lands in Texas no less) and now has a psychic connection with his regal hotness, the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen while she and the surviving male attempt to bleed London out of their souls. <br /> <br /> Tobe Hooper (of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (1974)) does an admirable job in what must be his biggest production to date. The production brought together many excellent technicians from all over the film industry. Production designer John Graysmark (fresh from "The Bounty (1984)") uses every four phases of Elsree Studios to create the ship's spacious interiors and the like. Filmmaker Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a period in "Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi" (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every part of the widescreen frame with great effects. The Oscar winner John Dykstra, innovator of the revolutionary effects of the original "Star Wars" (1977), manages to push the envelope once more, creating highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck, even the master Henry Mancini is approaching to give the film a very memorable theme that gives this hybrid of science fiction / horror an adventurous touch. In the acting department he falls practically on the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (the queen of vampires). Railsback always brings an advantage to the characters he plays and can play dice as if they were nobody's business. This comes into his hand as his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on his soul. The beautiful French actress May does not have many lines (there were more than ten?) But her often naked presence never gets old and you have to give her my compliments for having the jingle bells to attract. Practically the whole queen is there to make food and to do it she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. Work done and where to register to be a victim? I really liked the way they optimized old vampire clich√©s and still managed to make it fresh but easily recognizable. Almost everything is explained here: bats (their true shape resembles a large bat), coffins (stasis fields resemble these), transformations (they scrutinize your mind and can be anything), a massive sexual appeal (Miss May ??. Duh) not to mention the fact that they also include the old waiting pole through the heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger at the center of energy slightly below the heart). The only thing that they didn't touch was religion, but I think that vampires who use the cathedral at the end as a base could just be a little strident and a nod. <br /> <br /> In short (yes right 800 words later) "Lifeforce" is an excellent combination of science fiction and horror that pays homage to the vampire theme by adding some well-defined wrinkles. The effects and dimensions of the production are enough to keep the summer films (at least at the time) and the fans of horror and science fiction busy. 4 of 5.
