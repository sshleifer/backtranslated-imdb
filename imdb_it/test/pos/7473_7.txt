I don't know what the critics were seeing when this movie was released, but it escaped them unnoticed. It is well written, witty, satirical and very pleasant. It's like a video game brought to life. You never know who is behind the door or what will happen next. Violence is not free nor exaggerated due to splatter. <br /> <br /> One last word: for you Mickey Rourke fans ... the Mickster is back and at his best in the cameo performance at the end.
