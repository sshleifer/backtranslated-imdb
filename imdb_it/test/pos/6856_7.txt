For me, "Anatomie" is definitely one of the best movies I've seen. I don't think "Anatomie" was primarily intended as a horror film, but a film that questions the ethics of science. If you look at it with this in mind, it turns into a really good movie. The only annoying thing was the horrible vocal dubbing of the English version. How can you expect a non-German person to hear these unbearable German accents for two hours? Let English native speakers speak or use subtitles !!
