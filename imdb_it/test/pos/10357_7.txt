Brain of Blood begins as Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley) the leader of a country called Kahlid is close to death due to cancer, however if he dies Kahlid will tear himself to pieces without anyone to guide them so Dr. Robert Nigserian (Grant Williams) and one of the devotees of Amir Mohammed (Zandor Vorkov) devised a plan to bring the body of Amir to America, where the mad scientist Dr. Lloyd Trenton (Kent Taylor) will transplant his brain into a new body and with some surgery plastic that no one will ever know that he was even dead. Things do not go according to plan, but like when the time comes to transplant Amir's brain. The strange assistant of Trenton, Gor (John Bloom), carries a corpse of someone fallen from a balcony, Trenton needed a strong and fit body and since there is no more time he decides to use the body of Gor as a temporary stop-gap until you find another more suitable one. Unfortunately, when Amir wakes up in his new body, he is not very happy with what he sees, I mean, would you be if you found out that your brain is in a badly burned monster? <br /> <br /> Also known as Brain Damage, The Brain, The Creature's Revenege & The Undying Brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced and directed by the only Al Adamason and frankly I feel offended by the pathetic 1.5 Brain of Blood vote he posted on IMDb, personally I think it's great fun in such a bad way is a good way. The very amusing screenplay by Kane W. Lynn and Joe Van Rodgers is crazy and foolish as they come from blood-soaked brain transplants to crazy mad scientists, from 7 foot tall scarred monsters who play with 4 foot high midget cars assistants, from basements in the basement to rooftop chases, car accidents to murderers, kidnappings of screaming and succinctly dressed women, by Regina Carrol's hair that should be mentioned during the opening credits to teenagers imprisoned in the basement for blood to a hilarious laugh-out-loud ending that includes some deep and meaningful speech! It's all here and Brain of Blood has a quality cheese printed on itself, if your fan of a low budget exploit touches the sense of fun, then this film should be at the top of the list of "must-see" movies. Despite being a low grade of 1.5, I am proud to admit that I really liked Brain of Blood, I thought it was an absolute blast to watch, it slows down a bit at the end with a little too many shots of people wandering without do nothing in particular, but until that moment had moved like a rocket, just 85 minutes is relatively short, it's hard to guess the crazy plot and I think it's a lot of campy fun. <br /> <br /> This is the director Adamson's masterpiece, as far as I'm concerned, along with Dracula vs Frankenstein (1971) which he made a year earlier. Those who have already seen an Adamson movie will know of the existence of non-existent production values, low-cost special effects and card sets that contribute to making the film more enjoyable, managing that fine between incompetence and seriousness to create an experience of memorable vision. I love Kahlid's opening shot which is obviously just a picture of the Taj Mahal in India, complete with statuesque people in the foreground! Regina Carrol's hair seems to be a separate entity apart, it seems to change style between shots and frankly it is horrendous, do not let me start her work of putting on makeup or what she must apply with a sprayer of paint! There is another hilarious moment in which we see the body of Amir transported to America wrapped in what looks like an ordinary aluminum foil, because the question I asked myself, why? The effects are variable, there is a terrible-looking fake spider, Gor's burnt make-up job is pretty ugly even though there is a surprisingly bloody brain removal that is actually quite impressive. <br /> <br /> The budget for Brain of Blood must have practically none, I must admit that I thought the Trenton laboratory was good enough with various computers and medical instruments, even if the rest of the film seems cheap and bad. The production values ​​are low, the music was taken from another Beast of Blood (1971) and the acting is terrible but in a fun campy way. <br /> <br /> Brain of Blood could have the best title for an exploit film ever and as far as I'm concerned it's a very funny piece of nonsense that I had a good time watching and laughing. They simply don't / can't / won't make them any more, impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good movie, but bad movie lovers should have fun. I liked it, but then again I'm just weird.
