I just had the opportunity to dig into the Austen films of the past, and I understood why Persuasion is, has been, and always will be, my favorite work of Jane Austen, and Anne Elliot, my favorite Austen heroine. So it was with great anticipation that I inserted the disc into my reader. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed either. I knew there would be setbacks, so I will declare them, and try not to be too thick for them. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen's characters; she is the least talkative and the least witty. There are passages in the book where Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. It works well in print, but how to transfer it correctly to the big screen? Short of making overs reflexive voice (which would be tedious for more than four hours) one remains with a long succession of strokes in which the heroine says little or nothing, and must communicate everything with his facial expression. This can leave the feeling that the film is slow and aimless. If you need a more explicit style than Austen, then surely this film is not for you; but if your style is more subdued, and you tend to grasp the unspoken "vibrations", this will satisfy all expectations. <br /> <br /> Anne Firbank (as Anne Elliot) is, fortunately, an actress whose face can convey a lot. It seemed that I had always imagined that Anne Elliot might appear: not a knockout - Anne was not to be the elegant of the family - nor her early youth - which is also occasionally highlighted by lighting and makeup. What you see is someone who looks a lot like the character of Austen: someone whose appearance you might spend only once; but hear her speak and look closer, and she becomes more attractive, the better you know her. This is Anne Elliot, as reported by Anne Firbank. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Captain Wentworth is skilfully managed by Bryan Marshall. Bitterness is never apparently obvious (except in the concert scene); and, yes, I found it hard to believe that I found Louisa Musgrove interesting as it was shown. But that's another point in Austen's book: she didn't find it interesting, she TRIED to find it interesting and, in the end, failed (sigh of relief). So this also fits into Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the representation of Lady Russell, which I thought in the book was not described as REALLY bad; this also comes out in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> So this is a film that has closely followed the book; I could write a lot more about how faithfully everything has been reproduced, but I would find myself running out of space here. Charles Musgrove remained one of the most cheerful characters (good fun), Mary the most annoying (I was dying to have her just shut up - but I had that feeling when I also read the book), the captains and the admiral I thought fascinating. <br /> <br /> Cinematography seemed a little stiff to me. There was little or virtually no fading from one screen to another - perhaps this is due to the fact that it is a TV movie. A scene - CHOP! - the next scene, the actors enter from the right, proceed to the left, and - CHOP! - another scene, where the same thing happens. This was the only part of the movie that I heard cheated me a little. A low budget must show up somewhere, I suppose. <br /> <br /> And, as I said before, if you like a little rhythm with Jane Austen, don't worry about it, as you will find it too slow. I liked it enormously though, because it brought a wealth of details (the sets were extremely elegant!) To an excellent adaptation of my favorite novel Austen. I highly recommend it!
