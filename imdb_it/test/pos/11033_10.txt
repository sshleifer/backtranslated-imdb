This film is one of the best memories I have since childhood. Having always loved the Tigers, my mom took me to see it. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely amazing. It is one of those films that leaves a lasting impression on you. The image of the Tigers running through the snow with all that is being sprayed is still in my head about 25 years, not many films have managed to do so, As other comments have said that photography is amazing. A must see I've also been looking for the movie for some time with no luck. Sad. Amazon's control from time to time reveals nothing, not even listed. If anyone knows of a source, please contact me or post here.
