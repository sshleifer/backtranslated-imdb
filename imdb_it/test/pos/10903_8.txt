IN & OUT, in my opinion, is a very funny film. I thought Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong to say that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. The part I liked best was Howard's stag party. That's because they were making jokes about a lot of things, including Barbra Streisand's films. I also thought that Emily (Joan Cusack) was very beautiful with her wedding dress and that Howard was handsome in his tuxedo. My favorite quote from IN & OUT is: "Is everyone gay? This is" THE DOUBLE VOLUME AREA "?" It was absolutely fun! The only character I couldn't stand was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). This is because she was VERY cocky and snobbish. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all Kevin Kline fans who have not seen it. Get ready to laugh HARD and have fun when you see it.
