Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with some dark shades. It is characterized by a child-friendly story of desire and love with ecological implications, but it is not a sermon. Hayao Miyazaki has fused Andersen's Little Mermaid with the native myths of Japan and his famous punk steam punk flights, and the result is very gratifying. There are some frightening moments of ocean storms and floods, but they are electrifying, not horrible. <br /> <br /> If you've always wanted to run with waves along the shore, ride on a jellyfish like an elevator, transform yourself completely, or make friends for life, Ponyo is a fairy tale for you.
