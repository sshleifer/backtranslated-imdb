"The Dead" is truly a work of art. Clearly, John Huston intended to prove that he was still "in the full glory of a certain passion" by doing it, even though his body was failing. This film has a strong impact and lingers in the mind long after it is done. Reading Joyce's story certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially Gabriel's inner turmoil, but the essence is all there in this movie. As an artist's statement of his love for life and his craft, "The Dead" is alone.
