I completely agree with the other poster. NEMESIS is one of Christie's best adaptations with a superlative plot and cast. <br /> <br /> The scene involving Liz Fraser as the mother of the murder victim is a top-level acting studio. This underrated woman was a fairy tale in British films in the 1960s that never had a mainstream break in American films. Check it out as Julie Andrews' friend in 1964 THE AMERICANISATION OF EMILY. <br /> <br /> All the perfs in this product have the chance to shine with and without the unparalleled Ms. Hickson who was never created for an Emmy for her Marple work. What a shame! And dig up the CID lesbian agents! :)
