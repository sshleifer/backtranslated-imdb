044: The Big Trail (1930) - published 10/24/1930; 5.4.06. <br /> <br /> BIRTH: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh unveiled his latest film, The Big Trail, a western on the western crossing across the border, starring the emerging 23-year-old actor John Wayne. In 1930, we are seeing many "first" but few "best". In addition to the first John Wayne film, we have the first widescreen movie here (although we only saw the full-frame version). Interestingly, the decision to film in widescreen format was essentially the same reason that widescreen became popular later on: competing with television, which had not yet appeared commercially, but was still an emerging curiosity. However, this film was extremely good, giving us a heartbreaking look at the Oklahoma trek. The opening titles of the title allow us to know that this is a western of the most traditional type, of America, of the earth, which should live on it, etc., and it is an excellent demonstration of this. Walsh gives us some amazing images of the desert wagon company (when they reach a cliff, they have to tie each wagon down one by one), and we also get a subplot of revenge that involves Wayne chasing the man who killed one of his friends (I seem to remember something similar in Stagecoach). Wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partly there, and he would surely evolve further into subsequent films. Since this film represents all of Wayne's 30 years of work for the Odyssey, we will no longer see his face until Stagecoach, but once we do, we will continue to see it until the end of the Odyssey and beyond. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Ah, our first western sound, and John Wayne's first starring role. It is The Big Trail by Raoul Walsh. This review will be short since weeks have passed since I watched it. I liked this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. The mostly predictable adventure has had some surprises, like when the brains of the bad guys, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in his latest role) is killed in half; In the end I thought he would be the boss, but in the end it was Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember that I didn't like the way Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and demands revenge in the end. I realized that was what he had to do in history, but I really didn't like his reasoning when he tells Ruth why he has to do it. I think he had a much greater responsibility to the hundreds of settlers he was driving through the harsh West. <br /> <br /> The last film shown: Animal Crackers (1930). The last film in chronological order: Soup to Nuts (1930). Next film: L'Age D'or (1930).
