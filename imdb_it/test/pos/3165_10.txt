I saw it in Europa-plex. Great movie !! <br /> <br /> This film is an exploration of the Spirit and Flesh in modern times. The protagonist, Jim Kirk, drives a bulky VR throughout America, often stopping to fill his tank full of gasoline. He is middle-aged and confused. It feeds its dense and diabetic body with coffee cups and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes distanced, almost unaware of the growing tension around him, but feeling it like a knot of unease. <br /> <br /> The Spirit transmits the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and passes into the visual field. The Spirit eventually clashes with the Flesh and Kirk descends, unable to understand what happened to him. He denied how bad things have become because of his rebellion against us all, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We are all in the same denial and therefore we, like Kirk, are in danger of going down and being swept away by the sands of the desert just like him.
