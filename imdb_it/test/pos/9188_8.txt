This was a film that, in the end, I thought "Now it's been a pleasant two hours!" I hate spending about $ 20 (not including baby-sitting $$) for my husband and me to get that "It was OK" feeling. <br /> <br /> I think I like Will Smith as an action hero comedian. He was well cast in this. His character was very nice, as was Kevin James. "<br /> <br /> There were several high-volume laughs. It is also a romantic movie, so guys, if you want to impress the woman of your life, bring her to this. Women will like it as much as any chick-flick, but I wouldn't classify it as one. There's a lot of male humor for men. I think that's one of the reasons why this movie is perfect as a dating movie. It has romanticism AND slapstick.I usually don't like slapstick very much, but it wasn't too much and I can't think of those scenes that don't offer laughter. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. husband told me after it was over was "I want to see it again!"
