I saw him at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in New York and he was very warmly received. In this pre-WW2 film, a couple of German scientists are working on the Scottish Isle of Scarp as the war looms on the horizon. The characters met on the island are priceless in their creation and in their representation. Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable <br /> <br /> After getting on the "Scootish" accents, the viewer feels at home with these people watching while the Germans work to connect their island with the mainland via a missile-based mail. Although implausible, this film was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> All in all, a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its cast, its history or its scenery.
