This movie was awesome! Tangi Miller and Flex have done a great job. Both look beautiful together and they both pulled it out. Tasha Smith was as funny as her cousin, and she couldn't stay out of her business. Absence kept her for his girlfriend when he needed her. Aloma was sweet and played a dear grandmother who really reminded me of my grandmother. And oh, I can't forget the stripper, it was so to find, and I didn't know if I should cover my eyes or smile as I watched him reveal his sensuality on the big screen. Give me! he was fine! Tangi looked impeccable, and sexy, and stepped forward from Felicity. Throughout the film he had a lot of actors and actresses from "A". He was funny, sexy, crazy, touching, loving, emotional and wonderful. This movie is a must see! Go on DVD now if you don't have it!
