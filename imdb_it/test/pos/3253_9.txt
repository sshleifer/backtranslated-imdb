Two Hands is an amusing Australian criminal, who in the end manages to easily combine dramatic dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film takes place in a natural way, and the laughter has not been set too elaborately and has not been too elaborate. It's really a lot of fun, thanks to the fact that every character in the film is an excellent cast, and that every actor / actress recognizes and can relate Australian humor. They portray it very well and very realistically. Of course, they were helped immensely by a fantastic script by writer / director Gregor Jordan. I was reading another review of this film by an American who had seen it, and he criticized it heavily, basically passing it off as a Pulp Fiction clone. I think it's just rubbish. This film is not trying to be Pulp Fiction, the feeling and style of each of these excellent films are totally opposite. Without wanting to look superior or arrogant, I think I fully understand this film; the humor, the sincerity, the characters, etc ... you have to be Australian, or at least understand the culture, of which obviously the other boy didn't have the faintest idea. Some Americans, whose reviews of certain non-American films, seem ignorant (and have difficulty understanding) everything that is not an American product. It's a real shame, because this is a really great movie. The love story between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real, sincere and sweet way. I am very proud to have this movie in my collection. 4.5 out of 5.
