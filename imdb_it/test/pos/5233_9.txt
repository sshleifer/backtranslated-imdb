This film is important for those of us interested in Western history because it uses authentic techniques in its production. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the wagon are particularly authentic; as far as I know, it contains the only scenes ever shot that illustrate the techniques for crossing the river at a bluff. Horses and mules must be lowered to the river level and wagons dropped by ropes and pulleys. The scene is such that I could look at it again and again just trying to understand how it was a crossing ... and the first travelers did it over and over again as they crossed the country. <br /> <br /> Apart from the melodrama, this photo is authentic in the way we dress and in style, and it will be worth looking at it alone.
