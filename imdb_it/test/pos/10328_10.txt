For those of you who have no idea what Bug Juice is or isn't, it was a reality show for kids about real kids living at summer camp. Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to the field. He was full of romance, friendships, struggles, overcoming your fears and facing the difficulties of living away from home for 2 months. It was an incredible show that is no longer shown on t.v. regularly, but it is surprising not less. The show has never been boring and has always caught my attention. It's really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it's like before they go. In addition, Disney has done a great job collecting fields to show why anyone who wants to see a show in a field is like it's just a week. The length of the fields was perfect for this show and the environment in which they were fantastic. They were fields everywhere in the United States, which offered unique activities for campers. It was a truly exceptional show, without a script.
