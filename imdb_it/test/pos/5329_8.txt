Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) committed an unspeakable crime, stabbing the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone). No one, least of all Leland himself, can explain why he did what he did, whether the act was premeditated or spontaneous, done out of hatred or love. <br /> <br /> In the detention center, Leland meets Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), a former novelist who sees Leland as a second chance. But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivations and takes him under his wing as a confidant in prison. <br /> <br /> The film jumps from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as a context in the present and vice versa. Writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crime - and the events that preceded it - influence the people of his life, from Becky to his family to Leland's (Lena Olin) mother and foreign father (Kevin Spacey) to Allen (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with Becky's family after his mother's death. <br /> <br /> The main advantage of the film is Gosling, which is perfectly chosen as a 15-year pseudo-psychopath. Like Bartleby the Scrivener, the Leland of Gosling exists; shows little emotion during the film, but its expressions deny an ocean of guilt, sadness, love and anger. <br /> <br /> Each of the main actors offered their best work to date, save Spacey (who is not exactly a novice). A special praise is for Malone and Klein, two young performers who are better known for the light comedy than for the heavy drama of this film. Another huge advantage in terms of history is that none of the characters is flawless; no one is a hero outside to save the day. This is not simply a black and white film.
