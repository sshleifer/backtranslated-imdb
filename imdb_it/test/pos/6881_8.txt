An excellent film with Anthony Wong who surely lives up to his title. Erotic, but increasingly violent, the courtesy of dreams acquired by a mad occultist who quickly turn into nightmares of a certain magnitude as the sorcerer sits in them to manipulate poor Mr. Wong. Well shot and very fast, this is an endless tale of serious magic, herbal medicines, power and corruption, but it also makes time for some beautiful sex scenes and some very bloody violence. There is also just a little touch of humor from time to time to get you more off guard and the whole thing makes the 90 minutes more exciting. Excellent all-round performance.
