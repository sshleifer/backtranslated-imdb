Greetings to all the wonderful fans of this film who not only saw and appreciated, but (based on the many literary comments) actually GET! I always considered Paul Mazursky's "Storm" a reflection on Shakespeare's theatrical work of the same name, as noted in some of the other reviews here. On the other hand, if you are looking for a more direct adaptation of the game, you should look elsewhere. As an experiment, however, it succeeds spectacularly. Fascinating, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all this and much more. Cast, location, script, music are just fantastic. Cassavetes and Rowland never went better. Susan Sarandon's shift has more than hinted at the great work that will come from her in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love the performance of Raul Julia ... she steals the show in different scenes. Moreover, the ever great Cassavetes was confident and assured enough artists to let him do it! A study on what the thematic elements of Shakespeare's classic might be life if updated in more "modern times", the "Storm" by Mazursky burns brilliantly!
