A surprisingly effective British drama on two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the "flowering" of one of them. A bitter Spike guy (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a young man (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside the house, but McAvoy has and is bound and determined to return to the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this fun and moving and often moving story of inner strength that overcomes physical deficiencies. The two protagonists are fantastic, especially Robertson, who must surely have spent some time studying the disabled to bring out this difficult role. It appears in almost all scenes and acts on an absolute storm. For anyone who doesn't know, they might think he really has CB. Highly recommended.
