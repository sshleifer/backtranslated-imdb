I'm a fan of Zhang Yimou and eventually found this DVD title from the shelves of a Shenzhen bookstore after a long search in many places. <br /> <br /> This is a huge departure from Zhang Yimou's previous work, in particular style and local terms. The same director said that this is the first and only time he will ever try to create a black comedy set in contemporary China. You could also say that this work is experimental in nature, compared to its other well-known budgets and formal pieces. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a hand-held camera and a wide-angle lens for the duration of the entire film, fast rhythm editing and high energy performance and naturalistic tone never let you go once grabs you from the beginning. It presents a very realistic account of modern Chinese urban sensitivity, which in this case is set in Beijing. If you appreciate and love this kind of black humor, you will love this movie totally. Also look for hilarious cameos by Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and director Zhang Yimou himself. <br /> <br /> A final point of importance: I find the characters in this film, as in all other Zhang Yimou films, exhibiting similar personality traits - stubbornness, always trying to beat the odds and raise the stakes. Let me know your opinions on this. <br /> <br /> David Lee
