I think this movie is actually fun, although it lacks some essential features for this kind of movie. First of all, when Doug and Chappy start their mission, they start with the F-16B and pilot the F-16A during the fight scenes. The second thing I don't like about this movie is the always repeated F-16 that rolls to its right to escape the missiles ... why chaff and flares haven't been shown in any movie yet? Third, once the F-16 is almost empty of ammunition, a lot of missiles appear again ... even the models used to simulate the destroyed plane are not good. However, I think that using IAI Kfir as opposing planes was really good, much better than the F-5 shown in Top Gun (but this film is not as good as that masterpiece). <br /> <br /> A fun movie, I love planes and I've seen it more than 3 times.
