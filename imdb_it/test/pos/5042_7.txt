The title of the film seems quite appropriate given the personality of the protagonist, Fanda. He is an older man who lives in the late autumn of his life, yet he jokes like an elated boy who has just entered a spring meadow. The weaknesses of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions for him. His wife supports this idea when he observes: "Fanny laughs at funerals and at death". In other words, death is not something that Fanda takes too seriously; it has more important things to do than worry about what is already inevitable. Life, however, and the pursuit of living life to the fullest, is the philosophy that governs the existence of Fanda. It is not just one to exist, but must live for every day and every moment that passes, because tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The film seems to express a strong comment on living as if there were no tomorrow, not to mention death. Too many people take life too seriously and consequently lose the living part of life. Fanda's wife for example; she is so worried about getting ready for death, not in a religious but a connotative way, but in a too practical way, even without life that she forgets how to smile, laugh and have fun. His humanity seems to have turned into zombie self-pilot mode. The Fanda, on the contrary, is perhaps too cheerful and distracted for its own good. He needs someone like his wife, Emilie, to help balance him. <br /> <br /> It is as if Fanda possessed the invincible spirit of a child, like a child trapped in the body of an older man. It is presented as the adventurous type; he pretends to be people who are unable to make money, he spends money, he is falsely false and he is always ready for a good laugh. After all, though, he is a kind and gentle old man who wants to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. The two move away from each other very well, although none of them really appreciate the binary quality of their relationship until metaphorically the possibility of death: the meaning, their divorce. It is during this classroom scene that Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if it is separated from its only love. His wife emotionally remembers all his faults, yet he is tenderly attracted to continuing to love him despite his crazy behavior. At this moment in which he forgives him, Fanda realizes his selfish behavior of guiding his wife and makes an inner commitment to make her happy. <br /> <br /> Ironically, however, after taking this commitment it becomes what his wife later calls "a living corpse". Does the vital blood within him drain away as it becomes more like it? a zombie that moves through movements day after day. It doesn't seem to live anymore, but it exists. For example, he quits his jokes, he doesn't waste money, he stops smoking because of his wife (not his health) and, on the whole, he only accepts what he wants from him. Honestly, it changes for wanting to make her happy. Thus, the binary quality of their relationship slowly begins to fade. Realizing that her husband is not what she was, there is a part of Emilie that old Fanda lacks. She lacks the discretion of her husband and the struggles they had, because it was in those moments when they really lived, not simply simply existing. <br /> <br /> I believe the filmmakers were trying to convey a specific message here; that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient, but often times will take sacrifice and resistance to cross seemingly ugly periods. The possibility of death at any time is what reminds people to live for every moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when it is threatened with death, be it literal or figurative, people awaken from their ungrateful sleep and awaken to start living life to the fullest. It is as if they are frightened by the fact that they will never live again, so it is better to exploit them as best as they can. Fanda and Emilie were married 44 years with struggles along the way, but it wasn't until they were both threatened by the possibility of a death-like separation that they started showing their true colors. As the old maxim says, "love does not know its depth until the hour of separation". Both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way. More importantly, the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.
