I fell in love with "Living in A Big Way" when I saw it for the first time! The reason number 1 is because I LOVE, ADORE, and I'm a HUGE GENE KELLY fan. He was a truly exceptional dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention his extremely beautiful looks and sensual personality. I love his role in this film. He was such a gentleman. This film showed his wonderful talent for acting. I also liked Marie MacDonald. It was the first time I saw or knew anything about her, and this excellent film also made me a fan of her. In fact, the whole cast of this film was fun and fantastic. The humor between the butler, "Everette Hanover Smythe" and his father, Mr. Morgan; Mrs. Morgan's court humor, and in particular her grandmother's immediate attachment to Morgan and her concern for "LEO GOGARTY". And the GENE "FIDO AND ME" number is adorable. The opening dance number with GENE and MARIE is also very nice. I would recommend everyone to see this movie. It will remain very dear to your heart forever. Or at least he owes mine. And you'll fall in love with GENE once again. I consider it my # 2 favorite GENE KELLY MOVIE, and I've seen and owned quite a few of his films. They are part of my daily routine! So believe me when I tell you, you'll love this movie! Watch it and have fun !!
