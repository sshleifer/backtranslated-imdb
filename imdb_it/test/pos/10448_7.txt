Ahhh ... the 80s. 1982 makes me think back to the really crazy moment we faced in America. Fresh from "Do What Feels Good" from the '70s, "The Last American Virgin" arrives as a wolf in sheep's clothing as yet another teenage comedy from the days of glory. Oh, of course, there's sex, but I can't think of another movie - OK, this and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" - which really wasn't killing time between topless teen scenes - there were things pretty good here among the neckline. <br /> <br /> The film follows three hormonal friends. Gary (who wants to lose his virginity), Rick (embodied stallion) and David (overweight, but not inexperienced) while trying desperately to make sure that Gary joins the world of manhood. But, on the way to the kegger, a funny thing happens - Gary falls in love with Karen (beautiful brunette who loves bad boys), and he can't follow any sexual conquests that David and Rick can facilitate. The only problem is that Rick and Karen become hot and heavy and Karen misses a point. It's Gary who is by his side as he goes to get his abortion, and it's Gary who really cares. But who is Karen dancing with the end of the movie ... Rick. Subtract the "R" and add a "D" where necessary. <br /> <br /> What separates this film from the others of the 80s to which we think is that, by God, they try a real drama here, and not "my parents have just pulled into the variety of the driveway access". And you know what? I bought it. <br /> <br /> He was not sloppy. It was not far-fetched. And, when Gary sees Rick dancing with Karen at the house party at the end of the film, I actually felt sorry for the boy. Our teenager Romeo really believed in unrequited love - and when his heart was broken in the end, he almost touched me. <br /> <br /> So, aside from the T & A, there's a really credible and compelling story here. Worthy Oscar? Not a mile, but I don't know if I'd classify it in the "let's get laid" category. Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", they were actually trying to make a real movie here, letting the hi-jinx between falling where it could.
