The sweet nurse Charlotte Beale (a fascinating performance by Rosie Holotik, a ravished redhead girl), goes to work in a remote mental hospital run by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the heterogeneous assortment of crazy-colored patients there is the insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the student Betty Chandler), the noose Judge Oliver W. Cameron (a gloriously lovable Gene Ross), the paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (played by Hugh Feagin), gentle giant Sam (the amiable William Bill McGhee), and the crazy old old Mrs. Callingham (the extremely irritating Rhea MacAdams). These patients are dangerously encouraged to recite their fantasies by Dr. Masters, which obviously results in an eruption of brutal killings. Director of the S.F. Brownrigg, who works with an intelligent and appropriately overwhelmed screenplay by Tim Pope, does an expert job of creating and sustaining a stifling, humid atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia. The spooky soundtrack by Robert Farrar, the filthy set design, some gruesome wild killers, the grungy no-frills cinematography of Bruce B. Alcott, a lot of deliciously robust and crackling histrionics from an unnamed game (Ross in particular is a total eye - rolling hoot), and the truly amazing surprise of the surprise bloodbath adds to the transgressive fun of this junk pick of the low-cost regional horror film of the 70s.
