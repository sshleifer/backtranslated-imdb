I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was first broadcast on British television. I was shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite the close competition of the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, this film remains my favorite of almost 20 years after I first saw it <br /> <br /> This leads to the problem of how I can even start commenting on the film. I could praise the technical aspects, in particular the sound, the editing and the cinematography, but everyone seems to have praised (rightly) these results in high sky, while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have been noticed, and all the others have mentioned the clear images of the Dou Long bridge and the mounting of the boat that travels on the river after crossing the border <br /> <br /> How about the script? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director, but he is always a genius as a screenwriter as a director, I said "was" in the past because making this film seems to have burned every creative brain cell in his head, but his sacrifice was worth it. In the original draft by John Milius we have an equally crazy and disturbing script on the screen, but Coppola's involvement in the script injected a plot that exactly mirrors that of the war. Check how the script starts all chauvinistic and macho with a turn from Bill Kilgore that wouldn't have seemed out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and crazy everything becomes, so much so that by the time it reaches Kurtz outpost that the audience is watching another film in much the same way that the characters have navigated in another dimension. When Coppola says "This film doesn't talk about Vietnam - It's Vietnam" is right. What began as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid-1960s, according to the film's script (the Manson trial suggests it was 1970) had changed America's vision of both the world and itself itself and of the worldview of America <br /> <br /> It is the crazy beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterpiece of cinema and says more in its chronology on the brutality of the conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians (what did you do in the Vietnam War, Mr. President?) by Michael Moore could you hope to say in a lifetime. I didn't see the REDUX version but looking at the original print I didn't feel that something was missing in the story that, like all really great movies, is very simple. In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres such as a western in which an army officer must track down and kill a renegade colonel who is conducting a war party, or a science fiction film in which a UN assassin wants to eliminate a UN colleague a soldier who is leading a resistance movement on Mars, although this is probably due to Joseph Conrad's original novel <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time and it's very appropriate that I chose this movie like my thousandth review on the IMDb
