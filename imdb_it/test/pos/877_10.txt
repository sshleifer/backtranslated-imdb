This film has been extremely well marketed. When it was published in 1997, in the midst of the fame and success of Master P, everything and everything with its name on it was selling off the shelves. That is why it is no wonder that this underground urban drama has sold over 250,000 copies and is still leaving. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of No Limit then or even now take a look. He has some old school phatty videos and he doesn't get me started with the extravagant strippers of the Ice Cream Party bonus. So what I have to say to all the people who don't like Master P or No Limit Records don't look at it because it's not for you and they don't bother voting on it because you're just discouraging TRU no fan limit to rent or buy this videos with your low grades.
