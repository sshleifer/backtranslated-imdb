You know, people who make comedies so often forget that it's really okay to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a film with Cathy Bates as a romantic protagonist ... and it works. Not only does it work, it works very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so much that I hurt myself, but the main characters were all so human, so honest and so real. But isn't it where the great comedies come from? Don't the characters need real feelings, real emotions and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do it in this movie. Unconditional love is a film not to be missed, especially if you need a seriously good laugh, or you're curious to see the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat.
