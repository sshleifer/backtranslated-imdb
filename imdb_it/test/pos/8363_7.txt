The Kid Power Hour included two segments: Hero High and Shazam. Let's start with Hero High. <br /> <br /> Hero High was to be a new Archie comic, with their superhero identities: Pureheart the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superteen (Betty) and Evilheart (Reggie). However, Filmation could not obtain the rights to do so, so they optimized it a little and it turned out. Here is the breakdown of the characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Principal Samson (Mr weatherbee) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grundy). The show featured live action sketches, as well as cartoon adventures. Humor was the typical Filmation prank, but at least it had a sense of fun. It was quite fun for the kids, although not quite up to the previous standards. <br /> <br /> The other segment was Shazam!, who was very loyal to the comics, unlike the previous live action show. All the main villains have made appearances, as has the entire Marvel family (including Freckles Marvel, in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the correct and shaded character of the WC Fields, as well as his "Shazambago" which acted perpetually. Burr Middleton, a veteran of TV shows from the 70s, like Fish, voiced the Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in the first 6 million episodes of Dollar Man and voice of Skeletor in He-Man) managed the Dr .Sivana. <Br /> <br /> The Marvels had always had a sense of extravagance towards them, so their adventures required few changes, to meet the requirements of the norms and transmission requirements (the censorship). As such, the stories were very imaginative and imaginative. Among the villains that appeared were: Dr. Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac and the crocodile creatures. Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his screen debut. <br /> <br /> Hero High will be released by BCI, but Shazam! it's still in limbo, as is the live show. It is hoped that the proposed film will help them to free them on DVD. It is worth looking at and deserving a DVD treatment.
