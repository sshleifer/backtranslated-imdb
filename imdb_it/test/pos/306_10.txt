Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) was sent on a secret mission to Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) while he went mad and no longer takes orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the military, it is difficult for Captain Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could have gone as deeply as he did, kill without authorization and take war in his hands. What could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey into the jungle to find his goal, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds it? <br /> <br /> Every movie that can start with The End of The Doors is a great movie in my book, especially if it can flow with the mood and images shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does it perfectly. I can't think of anything better to be set up for, the Vietnam War and the madness in the minds of the soldiers he created. AN is a dark and brutal story of a long journey through some of Vietnam's wildest forests, whose final destination is murder. Through his use of music and scoring alone, we are thrown into a dark world of mystery, violence and madness. A perfect example of how to set the mood through music alone is this movie right here. <br /> <br /> An exceptional cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread our desire for cinema. I don't like Fishburne, since I discovered that it was Cowboy Curtis in the PeeWee theater, my contempt and hatred for this man has increased tenfold. I realize the pettiness of this, but I simply don't care. We need to get sick of Gary Oldman. Brando is as excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor who could have played the mad good man and kept such a presence on the screen. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questions about his mission and about war in general. My favorite character in the film must be Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore of Robert Duvall. Before this film I never imagined Duvall as a cowboy in war, but honestly he is my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character, who is one of the best in the entire film, like the commander of the Air Gung-ho cavalry who loves to surf. Perhaps a little exaggerated but still brilliant. I also like the smell of napalm in the morning. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple and it does not take too much brain to understand what is happening. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, plain and simple. But it is the journey of the film that is really the heart and also the disastrous situations of the war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit across the expansive French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which adds nothing to the entirety of the film, apart from a longer journey. It doesn't seem to take anything away, it's just a matter of watching a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey, the film highlights the total uselessness and irrelevance of the war against the Americans and the massive effect it has had on the soldiers who fought in it ... in fact, this is the whole point. Furthermore, the troops were not supported by the public and this could very well have helped to make a character like Kurtz completely mad. <br /> <br /> A great lover of war movies, this is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter, all classics. Sometimes I try to compare films of the same kind between them but it got me in trouble in the past in my reviews because I had to go back to what I said. All three have their strengths and add their breakthrough to the Vietnam War ... so really saying one is better than the other is pretty useless ... although after seeing more recently AN I think it's a little better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a true classic in both versions and worthy of the status that has been given. As another reviewer previously stated, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.
