I have to say that I am an avid fan of horror, and at the moment I can't get enough of the foreign horror. Since American horror depends a lot on blood. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This film reminded me of a lot of M. Night's SIXTH SENSE. The way the film was directed was great. The director took his time to fix everything. It took about 40 minutes just to set up the film in a horror movie. I thought the film was just a drama. This film has just developed and the pay off is not too much. <br /> <br /> I've never done it before, but this is the main reason why I liked the movie .... I actually shouted out loud because a scene just scared me ... which is pretty pathetic ... but for a movie, doing it is great.
