Why should this film be so good, but only an estimated gross figure of $ 95,000,000 and have NOT been rewarded? John Travolta knows what he's doing. He knows he is Michael, a cigar smoker, a grim magical angel who came to live with a dying lady and is now in a car with the staff of "The National Mirror" and their dog, Sparky, on the road to Chicago. It then turns into a road trip that is both horrible AND grandiose. I don't even think that the scenes of death (3 to be precise) make this a tear gas. The soundtrack is the best with "Heaven Is My Home", "Up Around The Bend" and "Chains Of Fools". I have high expectations of this and I say that he should have had a little more respect in the 1990s.
