I loved the movie "Northfork". I knew nothing about the movie before watching it. Therefore, I didn't have any external influence or information to guide me in what I was seeing unfold on the screen. In retrospect, I would recommend anyone interested in the film to watch it if only for the quality actors that appear there. Do not read anything about the plot, plot or evaluation of the film. In fact, don't read anything in my comments anymore, even though I think they are general and wouldn't ruin the film for you, I don't want to diminish the value of the film for you. Find your meaningful path in this movie or it has diminished in its potential. <br /> <br /> In general, I found the 3 benevolent strangers to Northfolk disconcerting. As the film develops, they could qualify as three amusing escapes from a psychiatric hospital or, the dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish young man, or three angels "sent" to seek "the lost angel". <br /> <br /> The sick and perhaps dying boy works to convince the three "strangers" to abandon the search for the lost angel, become his guardians (mother and father), and take him far away from Northfork (no less of 1000 miles). He even claims to be the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to be his guardian. Only one of the three responds to the boy on a positive basis. The other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for this involvement. <br /> <br /> The priest who nurses the sick boy demonstrates a profound care for people and a deep conviction about his faith. It transcends the desolation and emptiness of Northfork and its people; he is the light of goodness and hope for both Northfork and the viewer of the film. Near the top of the film, the boy and the new guardian travel to the ground to a field where an airplane waits. They embark to find the other two strangers also on the plane; in fact one is the pilot. The engines start and the plane takes off. <br /> <br /> Who are the 3 strangers? If only a stranger was interested in helping the boy because they were all on the plane? Where is the plane going? Did the other two find "the lost angel"? Is there a lost angel and if so who is he? Who are the six men dressed as entrepreneurs? If all this is just the feverish dreams of the sick boy, as one of the 3 strangers did who tried to help one of the men dressed as an undertaker when he jumped and hit his head (neither the boy nor the strangers had any contact with these men)? <br /> <br /> One or two sentences written under the title that tell people what this movie is about is a tragic mistake (it's not a spoiler, it's just a statement about advertising). So, if you haven't seen the movie, Northfork, the questions above only show some of the interesting and fun hairpins on the road to thinking when you watch the Northfork movie. If you read the advertising plot summary of the movie before looking at it first, maybe you should look at some of the questions above and look at it again ... I know I will. <br /> <br /> Terry
