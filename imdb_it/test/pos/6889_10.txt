Hello everyone! Everyone's best drama is now on Gospel Music Channel! Go to their website to see the program and find out what number is on your cable or satellite. This was one of my favorite programs grown up. It has everything I want a TV show to be, a clean and familiar drama that I wouldn't mind. The story of a man who, after losing his job, decides to leave for a great cross country adventure. Along the way they meet all sorts of interesting people and find themselves in the midst of all kinds of problems. This show was originally a spin-off of Touched By An Angel, another really good family show. Make sure you take a look!
