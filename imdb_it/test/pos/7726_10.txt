Even for the non-operatic public the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as a work by Bizet on a Gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. But although the work is now considered a fixed point in every repertoire of the play, the true story of the wild gypsy created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845 has never been told as in this film version by the abundantly gifted Spanish director Aranda 'Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love', 'Amantes', 'If they tell you I fell', etc.). Incorporating the author of the novel as the main character in search of the story of Carmen by one of his lovers - José - offers the right advantage for the story of this famous wild gypsy woman to tell. <br /> <br /> Carmen (the beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory adjacent to the military station where the real José (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is located. Carmen is stormy and in a fight instigated by a fellow worker who highlights the fact that Carmen is a gypsy, Carmen kills her colleague and is arrested. José is physically attracted to the voluptuous Carmen and when Carmen flirts with him he agrees to let her escape - his reimbursement is the promise of a night of passion with Carmen. Carmen keeps her pact, providing José with her first sexual encounter, and José is condemned. His lack of military discipline translates into losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while, but when he is released José still meets Carmen, kills another officer, and in fear escapes to the hills to live with smugglers and gypsies who I'm Carmen's people. Many incidents occur to prove the passionate bond between lovers, but when Carmen's real husband is released, destructive behavior takes over, behaviors that include Carmen's infatuation and relationship with a bullfighter and Carmen's passion José reaches a tragic end. <br /> <br /> A factor that makes history (adapted for the screen by director Aranda and Joaquim Jordà moves so well is the role Prosper Mérimée (Jay Benedict) plays: his interrogation on José completes the story of Bizet The acting is superb, the cinematography of Paco Femenia and the excellent soundtrack by José Nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very beautiful film, a must for Carmen opera lovers, and a splendid action drama for those spectators who admire historical pieces, highly recommended Grady Harp
