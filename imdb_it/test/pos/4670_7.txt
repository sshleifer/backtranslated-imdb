It's not the movie to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. If you want to have a lot of fun at the theater, however, this is the only one. A lot of jokes (and even some very vulgar jokes). Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny as the comic relief. Exciting and creative emotions and hunting scenes. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexy) are catchy leads. And Donald Sutherland!
