I agree that this is one of the best episodes of the whole series - my only deduction would be the somewhat strident appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan commander. My reasoning is this: if you weren't around for the first part of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the second generation of Trekkie (or Trekker - your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he is an excellent commander, as well as the opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well performed by all. There are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war compared to the price of peace and certainly recall one of the best films of the Second World War and the following era. Those are not my favorite genre, but I would certainly recommend a fan to see this episode through that filter. You'll see that it holds up. I'll never understand why science fiction has so little respect - the best drama comes from putting ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.
