I started looking at this very tense because I heard so many different things about it. Somewhere I read that it was a drama about child abuse and rated PG-13 for violence. Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of children (and I thought it was also for the children to watch). Well, now I've seen it so many times and I still don't know in which category to put it. It's extremely funny at times, but terribly sad and depressing the next moment. Because of the good relationship and the adventures I would like to recommend this film to all the young people I know, but I fear that the dark atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the perfect interpretations and the magic of the film, I must say anyway: look at it, especially the children! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the writer for letting poor Bobby never see his family again after escaping from the King (who hasn't even returned to terrorize Mary and Mikey). It is very nice for this film not to have a perfect happy ending with everyone who is happy - and I did not expect it - but this solution left me very, very sad!
