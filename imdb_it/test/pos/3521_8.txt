Ignore the negative reviews here, this movie is great! "Just Before Dawn" is a great example of what you can do in a film with a minimum budget if you have a dedicated crew, a decent script and an interesting idea for a movie. Is very funny. <br /> <br /> I liked it a lot more than most of the other 80s, because the killer is so unique. "Wrong Turn" has torn this film to something fierce! There is a lot of blood and fear. My girlfriend was out of her mind and she almost looks at me and doesn't flinch. There is that ugly appearance. <br /> <br /> I would say that "Just Before Dawn" is the best slasher of the 80s in circulation. I loved it. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, children.
