One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world would end at the stroke of midnight on December 31st 1999. In "The Book of Life", writer / director Hal Hartley takes a look at the possible ramifications of a new millennium Armageddon, starting with the return of Jesus on Earth on New Year's Eve, 99. History examines the task of the Son of God, who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the Book of Life (now contained in a Mac portable computer), in which there are also the names of the hundred and forty-four thousand good souls that will be saved in the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan), together with Magdalena (P.J Harvey), arrives in New York to make the necessary preparations to carry out his Father's will, but he begins to have second thoughts; must judge the living and the dead? Do they deserve what must happen to them? It is a cup that he would rather not embrace at this particular moment, which gives encouragement to Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) who fears that the fruit of all his hard work is about to be wiped out at midnight, because he can only continue his work until we they are people who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams. An artistically rendered and highly conceptual film, Hartley presents the story in an intelligent, stimulating and stimulating way, paying close attention to dealing with sensitive topics so as to render it harmless even to the most ardent fundamentalists. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating, as is the effect of their presence on those they meet during their stay in the city. It is a compelling meditation on the spiritual side of man's fragile existence and a contemplation of what was prophesied in the Revelations of St. John in the Apocalypse, the last book of the New Testament. And there is a logic to Hartley's approach to the Second Coming; it maintains the aesthetics of the contemporary context with the use of altered film speeds that visually give the film an ethereal quality. Christ is unquestionably wearing a jacket and tie, harmonizing effectively with the population, while Satan's clothing is a little more casual, his appearance a bit shabby; has a bruise over the left eye. Donovan is well dressed like Jesus, giving a benevolent character and a sense of urgency held back to his character which is very effective. It is, of course, a unique portrait of The Savior, and perhaps the best since Max von Sydow is in "The greatest story ever told". Successfully conveys a feeling of inner peace and tranquility, of serenity, which is the essence in the very heart of the character. And Ryan is completely engaged in his role as Prince of Darkness; he has a distinct way of speaking and a resonant quality for his voice that make him absolutely mesmerizing to watch. His eyes penetrate darkly, a trait he uses effectively with furtive glances and captivating glances. He's the guy who could sell you something for your soul before you know what hit you. It is a memorable performance that contrasts so well with the portrait of Jesus by Donovan. The supporting cast includes Martin Pfeffercorn (Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edie), Dave Simonds (Dave), D.J. Mendel (lawyer), James Urbaniak (True Believer), Katreen Hardt (Assistant lawyer) and Anna Kohler (employee at the hotel). In his unique and inimitable style, with "The Book of Life", Hartley has developed a last-day perspective that is interesting, fun and truly unique. It has a way of capturing life as it is just off-center, a method that works particularly well with a film like this. Comparatively short for a feature film (lasting 63 minutes), however it is one of Hartley's best, and more than worth the admission price. It's a film that will stay with you and maybe make you think of some things you might have hidden in a corner of your mind for later. And that's part of the attraction of this film; makes you understand that "later" is probably now. I consider this 9/10.
