I haven't read the novel on which the film is based. So I can't comment on what's missing or if any changes have been made. <br /> <br /> As I said above, I had a wonderful experience watching THE KITE RUNNER .. I find that when I see films about other cultures here in the United States, I learn how other people live and exist. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film come from Afghanistan and other countries in that area. There are 3 young children in this almost epic film in the first roles, They were wonderful. <br /> <br /> The scenes that were supposedly in Kabul were filmed in various parts of China, I assume the area is similar to the real places in the book. <br /> <br /> Mark Foster directed and searched for FINDING NEVRRLAND, created the same magic here. <br /> <br /> All aspects of production are of the highest quality. <br /> <br /> I found this film better than those nominated and won at the Oscars. <br /> <br /> The film is subtitled, it is very clear to read. It has a correct PG-13 score. SPOILER ALERT --- The child rape scene is very well managed. <br /> <br /> I cannot however give this 4 stars as a general plot and plot that we have seen many, many times, Non-the-less this is a very useful movie to watch .. <br /> <br / > Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
