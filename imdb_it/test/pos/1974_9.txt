yes, I noticed that there are 347 other comments, I think it's a good sign for a film, even if some are negative. I saw this movie two and a half times. I love it and look at it again. he is very intelligent, but I can understand why some people hate him. they don't get its appeal yes, I have a strange taste in movies, but this is a great movie. some lines are so fast, like the whole scene in the Chinese restaurant. I started dying laughing. that and when he was in the assembly line talking to the contact. the law of Judah was wonderful, even though it was humorous, he tried to hide his wonderful accent. however, I do not consider myself the goddess of cinema as a criticism of this film and if you have nothing better to do than write comments of pseudo-intellectual films on films you hate online, I am sorry for you. because you don't write about movies you like, like me. I just like how everything that binds together makes you guess, even if you guess wrong. the ending was interesting and not exaggerated. it was purely intelligent. I wouldn't compare it to the matrix, because I think people have the wrong idea. I went to this movie waiting for nothing except the Judas law and a sci-fi. I was amazed. I have no idea of ​​any of Cronenburg's films, but I love him for his merits. another clever thing was the foreshadowing of the dog. definitely watch this movie.
