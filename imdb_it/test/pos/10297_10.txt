This is a fabulous movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a good yarn and is imagined in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view. What was intentional and what a coincidence? Who's in love with whom? <br /> <br /> You have the option of putting yourself in the shoes of each of the characters in turn (sometimes literally), and this helps define each character satisfactorily. <Br /> <br /> With a little effort after the turns, you can understand each of the characters; and the key events of the film are taken from the point of view of different people. <br /> <br /> Take the opportunity if you return to auteur cinema; looks good on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Rather than keeping you guessed, the twist to the point that you sit down and watch what happens - I challenge anyone to predict it! <br /> <br /> But more likely you'll need more than one view - I've seen this in the images in its original version three times, and each time it's improved. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good, with a standout performance by Romane Bohringer in the role of Alice torn in three directions from the other three characters in the group. <br /> <br /> A classic. The second best film of the 90s.
