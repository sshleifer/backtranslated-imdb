This film was the introduction for many of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. This is because it was easy to find. He was on every public domain label in the VHS era, and before that, late at night t.v. classic cult, slapper with double thigh. Also, how to resist the title? <br /> <br /> For the laggards, a brief explanation of the merit: Florida wheel dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films, nicknamed them in English, then minted them to the drive in . Mexican ORIGINALS were strange enough to begin with; American borders and accepted conventions on horror films have been cheerfully ignored. Large, large sets and lights were placed next to strange or laughable special effects. NOTHING in Hollywood was so close as these were out and out strange. Now we mix the social conventions influenced by the Catholics, the Mexican popular traditions and we are no longer in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Add to THAT the English scripts in which they were dubbed. Most were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted the words to match the movements of the actors' lips on the screen, not the literal translation. As a result, American soundtracks tended to shift from too rough to downy loopy. There is also a website for Murray fans that prints the best and most important lines for each movie. First time viewers at the movies complain about rhythm, purple prose, production values ​​and are told that it is SUSPENDED to be like this ... while people laugh with pleasure over things normally considered to be fatal cinematic flaws. It must all be very confusing if you don't have the taste. <br /> <br /> This was made in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; THE AZTEC MUMMY AND THE CURSE OF AZTEC MUM. All three are now available on the 3 discs AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and the time has come. It has the version of K Gordon Murray on one side, the original Mexican production on the other side. The contrast between the two is fascinating. Many times the original Spanish is not much healthier. <br /> <br /> ROBOT / MUMMY starts with a nice long flashback that takes you at high speed in the previous episodes, a sort of ... continuity was thrown out of the window in number two, and it's downhill from there, in a logical sense. You can't even get The Angel back, nor mention it in this final episode. Names, places, even family trees pass from one film to another. After a while, the search for continuity changes starts. <br /> <br /> By now, the villain of the Doc Krupp series is completely crazy about pig, almost drooling with dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec armor. Rosita Arenas is sent back in time with another nice change to the AZTEC MUMMY program, and she wanders in the dark in her nightgown to help find that armor again. Mom is no longer happy with this, then it was the last time. <br /> <br /> The robot actually has a production credit. It was created by "Viana & Co S.A.". I say this, because it seems that the handles were invented between a take and a slow afternoon when the real costume went around. No. <br /> <br /> This has been scheduled. <br /> <br /> Wait until you see the controller from which it is run. X box, where were you when Krupp NEEDed you ??? The Robot LOOKS crushed at the end, but in reality it is back in two other films made in Mexico. He had a FAN BASE .. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun and bizarre ending for a series of three films. Sit down and have fun.
