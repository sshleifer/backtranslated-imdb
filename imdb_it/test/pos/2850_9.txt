I was very impressed with Nurse Betty to the end. He has a great ensemble of characters, an original storyline and an ending that I should have seen come but he doesn't have and holds the strings of your heart. <br /> <br /> If there is anything about this film that made me the most, it was the interaction between Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. These two are fantastic and it warms my heart to see that Rock won't make Big Hollywood crap like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there should be no need to criticize his work. Hell, Kiss the Girls was watchable with him. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellwegger does the best she can with her role, and Kinnear is as good as his obsession. <br /> <br /> Sweet film with a nice touch of gratuitous violence to satisfy the male's thirst for blood. 9 outa 10 <br /> <br />
