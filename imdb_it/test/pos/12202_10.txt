I thought it was a very good TV series and I'd like to see it continue. In the end it was really interesting and I really want to see where it's going from there. Sometimes we have to kill a series quickly without giving it a chance. I think this needs a chance to go on, and I will certainly be waiting for it. The ocean is one of the places that man knows so little and I think it's a mystery in itself. What is waiting for us under the waters of the world. It is even said that the man crawled out of the water many millennia ago. Is it a new evolution? Are we going down the food chain or do we fight for our position?
