With the exception of the main character, acting didn't convince me, but the story was pretty good: it's a love story between a gay celebrated and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and, as such, has some metaphysical nuances to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance. But some stories are hilarious: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague: "Do you believe in God?" And he replies: "do you mean: besides Madonna?" All in all, the film is not one of my all-time favorites, but the script is really good and I really liked it: it's fun and clashes with prejudices and religious intolerances. I think this is an important message in our times. Since I rated the films I liked least with 9, this is clearly a 10 for me. Some people may find this exaggerated, but I think this film deserves it.
