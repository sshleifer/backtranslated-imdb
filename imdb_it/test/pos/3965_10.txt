if I had seen this movie when I hit the bottom I would probably have sunk into the deepest depression of my life, and I might have been desperate enough to try it, the only thing is in the real world, when you steal millions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals, all of it it comes roses (unless you are an investment banker or an affiliated government), so how is it important? I was rejected from school after school, and stings, so it's a brilliant topic for a film, and when you abandon yourself to the imagination to let you watch this movie without applying real-world ramifications, you can really touch someone in that situation, and let them know that they are not alone. the exaggerated soliloquy completely tears the educational system established as we know it. really, all I can say is that while I'm in college now, looking back to where I was, and watching this movie, I can really appreciate it in a way I never could have otherwise. he's young and contrite, yes, but it's an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom, and I can't think of a better way to finish my night.
