"Subconscious Cruelty" must be one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It's still extremely dark and bloody at times, so politically correct mainstream horror junk fans shouldn't worry. The film mixes many wonderful images with lots of sleaze and gore. It is extremely strange, vicious and disturbing, so fans of bizarre cinema will not be disappointed. My favorite segment of "Subconscious Cruelty" is "Human Larvae" which shows us a distorted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister. The birth scene is particularly unpleasant and not easily forgotten. The last segment "Right Brain / Martyrdom" must be seen to be believed. It's incredibly hard and blasphemous with genital mutilation scenes and gruesome torture. We see Jesus Christ captured by three naked women who mutilate him, tearing flesh from his chest, licking a wound on his knee and pissing him. There is also a statue of Jesus with a projection of a swastika on it. "Subconscious Cruelty" is a truly memorable film that should be seen by extreme cinema fans.
