I think this short television series was absolutely wonderful and gave a thorough and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. Personally, I thought it was one of the best documentaries of the last decade. This is definitely worth the money of the people! <br /> <br /> I also found the bit on the abyss and on the deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to discover that the "blue planet" team has discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life! <br /> <br /> In this documentary Attemborough is almost certainly up to its high reputation. <br /> <br /> This was a masterpiece and will always be considered one of the best modern documentaries <br /> <br /> Many congratulations to the "Blue planet" team.
