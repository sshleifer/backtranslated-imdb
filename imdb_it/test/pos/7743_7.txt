For many years I thought I was the only person on the planet who had seen TEMPEST, and I am so happy to know that I am not the only person who discovered this sleeper somewhere in their cinematic travails. Freely inspired by Shakesper's comedy, TEMPEST follows an architect (the late John Cassavettes, in one of his best interpretations), bored by his work and his crumbling marriage (with his real wife Gene Rowlads), who decides to throw everything away, to say hell with the race for success and going to live on an island with his daughter (Molly Ringwald, in his film debut), and new girlfriend Aretha (a bright Susan Sarandon). Although Paul Mazursky is credited as a director, Cassavettes' hand is everywhere in this film ... the long scenes filmed without cuts, the improvisation of dialogue ..., the self-indulgent style of storytelling, this is definitely his show from start to finish, and if you're not a fan of his work, the film will seem laboriously long and boring, but if you're a fan, there are prizes to be had. Cassavettes is surrounded by a first-rate cast ... his scenes with Rowlands crackle with intensity and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon is in stark contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in his film debut and there is a stage performance stolen by the late Raul Julia as Kalibanos, Cassavettes servant on the island. Julia interrupts the show in a scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing "New York, New York". This film is sad and tragic, fun and intense. Yes, it is a bit long and bumpy and works a little too much to be different (there is also a call to the end of the film), but it never fails to attract the attention of those who love something a little different in their filmgoing.
