I admit that I was a Harrison Ford fan for many, many years ago, so it doesn't surprise me that I enjoyed his performance here. But I also liked the way the plot developed and I thought the casting was well done. I don't know if I "buy" Kristin Scott Thomas as a member of Congress, but she is an excellent actress and a beautiful woman. I noticed her in the first impossible mission. Even though his part was small, it remained on the screen. <br /> <br /> Here she and Ford play the people whose spouses are killed in a plane crash. They are sitting together and this is where the plot takes off. Apparently Ford, a Wash D.C. police detective, discovers that his wife had an affair. He also finds out that the relationship happened with the husband of a New England Congressman. <br /> <br /> History takes on many subplots while Ford and Thomas find themselves fascinated by the revelations of their marriages, the discovery of deception, and the pure pain and anger at the loss of a loved one. <br /> <br /> I think the film is worth renting or taking the cable.
