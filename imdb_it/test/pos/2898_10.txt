How do these guys continue? They are around 50 each and behave as if they were only 30 years old. They play 3 hours of music at each concert, and barely manage to sweat. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. Even if people don't speak English, they try to memorize the words of the most famous Rush songs and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends. <br /> <br /> From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this concert DVD will keep you in the chair not wanting to stop you or move away from the classics you listened to when you were young. This is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). I went to their Scranton PA show, and that was just as good, even though they didn't play Freewill in PA, so I was upset. <br /> <br /> They have Freewill, they have The Trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red Sector A, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112 and more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else is comparable. If you never go to a Rush concert, then at least buy this DVD.
