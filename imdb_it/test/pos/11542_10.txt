This documentary on the life and comedy of Bill Hicks contains excerpts from "Revelations" by Hicks and other stand-up concerts. It also contains interviews with comedians and industry people who knew him, as well as journalists and journalists who talk about how his political comment was raw and brutal. I loved it. I had already seen "Revelations" but the comedy clips were still refreshing. It's a good balance between comedy and documentary that will explain Hicks' popularity to non-fans and will delight those who are already familiar with him. <br /> <br /> I rated it ten.
