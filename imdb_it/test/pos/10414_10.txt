This show must be my favorite of all the 80s horror TV shows. Like Tales from the Darkside, even by the creators themselves, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, PLEASE sign this petition that I started, to get the word out for Monsters and get it out on DVD. Here is the address of the petition: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes should be Glim glim and Rain Dance. I also loved the introduction of opening with the monster family. This made me crawl out! One of the things I should have asked the DVD creators to include would have been the sound of the organ heard just before where the commercial break would be. I don't know if any of you remember that part, but this is one of the main things that brings me back to memory. I mean, come on! War of the Worlds TV series has already been released on DVD, so I say Monsters, and also Tales from the Darkside, and Friday 13 also the series should be published! We fans must speak our minds! We need this awesome DVD show so PLEASE spread the word !!!
