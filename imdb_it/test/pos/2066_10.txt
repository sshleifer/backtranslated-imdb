Definitely a film for people who just ask to be entertained and who don't think too much about their films. <br /> <br /> Lots of action, lots of fantastic dialogues (such as fun to mention), a bit of intrigue and stuff that explodes everywhere. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis have had great chemistry. Violent, but not bloody. The fact that the female part was responsible for the action is a pleasant turning point. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie more than a dozen times and I still like it enough to put it back in my favorite movies. 3 or 4 months. I originally rented the film because Samuel L Jackson was in the film, but he was involved in the events surrounding Samantha's quest to regain her memory and never looked back. <br /> <br /> All you brain kids out there - suspend disbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously - you could really enjoy yourself!
