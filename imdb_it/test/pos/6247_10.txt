OK ... I've seen pretty much everything ... and some are considered classics that shouldn't be (like all those Halloween movies that suck or even Steven King's poop) ....... and some are considered OK, they are really big ..... (like the anime carnival) ... and then some are simply ignored ............ like (badly ed) or (pumpkin head and brain dead "the Cort one bud") then some stick in your head once seen and never leave ........... that's what this did to me ........ and for my money this is much better than the last house on the left ............ the last house was great until the end ... then it blew into pieces ..... that kind of mannequin is going to give someone a blow job who just killed their kids ????. Completely stupid..you find the movie "bully" or even "fun games" if you want realism and be scared ....... ..but this damn thing has been with me for years ....... .. a Connors chuck lawsuit has always been scary ......... two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ever ... ... three the girl being suffocated in chalk is still one of the worst killings of all times on the film ........ and the fourth thing of the telekinetic powers shocked me and arrived totally unexpected ....... not to mention the wax figures of the puppets dummies etc ... .... should be right there with psycho, last house, chainsaw of Texas, etc. ....... is a classic .............. and deservedly so .... .......
