"Why are there so many rainbows, and what's on the other side?" Kermit poses this relatively simple double question near the beginning of "The Muppet Movie" while singing his signature song, "The Rainbow Connection". Over time, the demand and the film only gain depth. <br /> <br /> I will give up the review of this film as a comedy for children, but I consider it a classic for every generation I love serious ideals and a moving message that gets more warmth with each passing year. <br /> <br /> As the milestones of my own life creep into me, I feel more and more the suggestive tensions of that elementary song and realize that it can adapt to the soundtrack of anyone's life, because we all dream. And this is from this movie. It's not just a bunch of puppets, it's a bunch of puppets that has the strength to pursue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> And while the humor and joy of the film always feels good, I'm not a fair judge of the film. Only "The Rainbow Connection" and the powerful emotions it will make. And everything fits: "Rainbow Connection" * is * the Muppet movie and vice versa. His existentialism meets entertainment for children: there is no easier way to describe it.
