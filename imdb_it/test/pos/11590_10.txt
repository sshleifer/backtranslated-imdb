Alejandro Amenabar, the young and talented Spanish director, shows us clearly that he is a serious director. Anyone who doubts it should take a look at his latest film "The Sea Inside". This film has been awarded with numerous awards, not only in Spain, but all over the world, wherever this wonderful film has been shown. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you might want to stop here. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro is a man confined to bed. Being quadriplegic, it depends on the kindness of strangers to everything. From his accident, Ramon only thinks of one thing: how to end his life! This is the moral issue at the center of the story, based on the real life of Ramon Sampedro. <br /> <br /> Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part. After all, he relies on facts that were well known in his country as this case has become a "celebrated cause" in favor of euthanasia, a theme that nobody in that country wanted to address in Spain. <br /> <br /> With its background of being a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Spain has evolved into one of the most democratic societies in Europe, a distinction that is more remarkable due to its long years dominated by a dictator . Yet despite the progress of this society, the idea of ​​taking one's own life is something that is not clearly understood by most of its citizens, who still considered this subject to be something that could not be done in their country. > <br /> Ramon Sampedro was a man who loved life. He lived an intense life as a young man when he enlisted as a sailor to discover the world. Having no money, this was the only way for him to see other lands, experience other cultures. Ramon's love affair with the sea is something that people in Galicia learn to love from childhood. Imagine how that same friendly sea is what takes Ramon's life, as he knew it! In a second, Ramon moves from a lively young man to a vegetable! <br /> <br /> Ramon's family is destroyed by experience. All of a sudden they have to leave everything aside to take care of him at home. His brother and his sister-in-law are stoic people who face the situation as a matter of fact. Their lives become something of an afterthought, because Ramon's life comes first. They tend to the sick without protesting, or they blame Ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive. <br /> <br /> That's why, in their minds, Sampedro can't understand Ramon's desire to end them all. Didn't they give up having a normal life to take care of him? This moral problem weighs heavily on these simple and simple people because in their minds they are doing what came naturally. <br /> <br /> The second theme of the film is the legal question of euthanasia and the well-intentioned suddenly enters Ramon's life in their desire to help him end his suffering. There is Julia, the lawyer who is herself handicapped and suffers from a rare disease. There is Rosa, the fish breeder who is infatuated with Ramon. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, makes a brilliant Ramon Sampedro. Its transformation is total. We do not doubt for a moment that it is nothing but the man paralyzed on that bed. Mr. Bardem can use his face only to convey all the emotions trapped inside Ramon. Mr. Bardem makes this man real. This is perhaps the best role of his career in Javier Bardem. He passes his award-winning performance like Reynaldo Arenas, the late Cuban poet who starred in "Before Night Falls". <br /> <br /> In secondary roles, Belen Rueda makes an impressive appearance like Julia, the woman who fights her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa, the soul mate who deeply loves Ramon. Celso Bugallo, like Ramon's brother, shows a man at a crossroads in his life. Mabel Rivera makes compassionate Manuela, the sister-in-law who never asks for anything about life, but tends to Ramon without wondering why she should do it, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Amenabar also composed the soundtrack for the film. He is a man who never ceases to surprise. One wonders what his next project will be, but one wishes him success in everything he could decide to do in the future.
