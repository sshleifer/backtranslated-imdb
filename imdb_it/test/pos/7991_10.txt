I remember that I really liked BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think this is the best of all Batman movies (even for Christopher Nolan's terrifying 2005 BATMAN and certainly over the terrible overrated 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!) . Initially I remember thinking that the first Batman with Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love him). But I think this film is really a success. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman and Max Shreck) are all lively and memorable. You can really see what Batman / Bruce Wayne is in Keaton's terrifying characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even the emerging Bale, who was exceptional in BB and could have stolen the best honors from Keaton if his character hadn't been destroyed by Nolan's TDK film production! <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito as The Penguin is creepy, scary, hilarious and deadly. DeVito is fantastic and does not need set designs, chewing to give great performances like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his condition to adapt to normal society. I've never been a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan until this movie, but this is definitely my favorite interpretation of her. Selina Kyle from Pfeiffer is silly and weird at first, then when she turns into Catwoman, she is both sexy and scary, a total deadly sexpot! Furthermore, I feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger of BATMAN; they form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> BATMAN RETURNS, more than BATMAN, is more secure and focused. The cinema is secured from beginning to end. The way Burton introduces the harrowing penguin story captures you from the start. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings for each film: Danny Elfman's music defines a disturbing and disturbing tone that defines the rest of the film. It's a modification of the original BATMAN and a big one! <br /> <br /> So let's project 33 years into Gotham now and get introduced to the powerful businessman Shreck who wants to build a new power plant in Gotham. During the same scene we meet the meek secretary, bullied and submissive Selina Kyle. And not long after all this is the exciting action sequence of the film, in which Batman must fight against The Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a fun and lethal group of outcasts and circus performers. Penguin implements a plan to attack Gotham's Christmas party, kidnap Shreck into chaos and force him to help reintroduce it into society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shreck's criminal plans and so he "kills" her by pushing her out of her skyscraper, then being revived by the cats. <br /> <br /> Sound twisted? Yes, but Burton never claimed to offer a realistic story. He created a world in which the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a dark and noir world including abused and deformed outcasts who basically just want to be accepted and adapted. Narrative trust if you ask me! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are few and far between, but they are all exciting, fun and tantalizing. I'm not there just for the show, as are some in BATMAN. And they all make sense. The culminating scene with Penguin's "army" marching towards central Gotham with Batman zoning Penguin's hideout and assistant's butler Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) Assisting Batman it's a succinct, solid and heartbreaking fun! <br /> <br /> I also love the Christmas, winter period, which adds to the dark and cold feeling of Burton's Batman world. I also like the way Burton slowly introduces Batman's "toys" without pushing them down his throat. Each "toy" is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are forced to accept them for their purpose. And although dark, RETURNS is still a fun movie. The DeVito penguin has many funny lines. So does Walken's Shreck. Batman-Catwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and full of humor! A great ensemble! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a dense web of dark forces at play in Tim Burton's hilarious comic book world.
