This is the Australian TV series. It's a classic. The stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet be an ambush? This is cult TV. The Australian actors of the series were the best of their time and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say about a timeless adventure. The music and the song are simply fantastic. The closing credits start with the first plane of the wheel, then Keir who sleeps and is pushed and therefore the long shot fails to get much better than that. All 13 episodes are equally solid in the portrait of the Australian myth and I think this is what this series has. It doesn't matter that the two main characters have been from overseas, I think it's the key to the series and why it's so good.
