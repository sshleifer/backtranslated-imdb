For many of us, life is a process of love that takes place. For others like Soo-mi, however, it is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on the Korean folk tale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woon's brilliant gothic horror story, A Tale of Two Sisters, revolves around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong) and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon-yeong ), which are part of a dysfunctional family that lives together in a terrifying Victorian style villa. Feeling alienated from the world, they cling to each other to survive with the old Soo-mi who obsessively protects the young Soo-yeon from danger. For Soo-mi, however, not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding his mother's death means mental illness and a mind that disagrees with reality. <br /> <br /> While we can recognize points like haunted houses with apparent sightings, doors that open and close by themselves, a cruel and overbearing stepmother, and other events of great oddity, A tale of two sisters explores superbly meanings deeper psychological ones including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge. Soo-tells me "Do you know what's really scary? Do you want to forget something. Take it completely out of your mind, but you never can. It can't go away, you see. And ... and it follows you around like a ghost." There is a timeline, but it is left to the viewer to extricate himself. The plot cannot be summarized, only suggested and the film asks us if what is happening on the screen is objective or subjective. <br /> <br /> At the opening of the film, Soo-mi, a clearly disturbed young woman, is questioned by a doctor in an environment that seems to be a mental institution. When the doctor asks her to describe what happened "that day", the film flashes again when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return to their father's house Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Eun-joo (Yum Jung-ah). The stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant, but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi that really hurts. While the girls try to readjust, they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house, which can be nightmares or supernatural events. <br /> <br /> Soo-sees me a figure at the foot of his bed hovering over her and oozing black blood, a dinner in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hidden under the sink and convulses, a monster emerges between the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear from the photographs and many other manic schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling to the limits of madness. While we perceive that much of the story is the projection of someone's mind, we do not know who and the film keeps us constantly challenged, at least until an important clue is offered in the second part of the film. <br /> <br /> Shot in a beautiful photo of soft lighting, A Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and another worldly beauty that transcends all fears, and there are many. She is obsessive in more than one sense of the word and her images could fix you when you least expect or want them. While the film cannot offer the tired traveler much in terms of light, it shows us where we can end up if we opt for darkness. In the words of a wise observer, "Guilt is never the answer - whether to blame yourself or others. Rather, the answer lies in coming out of judgment completely - both of yourself and of others. Forgiveness and understanding have a great healing power. "
