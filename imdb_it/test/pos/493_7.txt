Not knowing at all the characters in the comic book series, I expected this film to be limited to creating the basics: presenting myself to the characters and their intrinsic characteristics, presenting a plot and ending with the destruction of the main opponent and perhaps suggesting the possibility of a following. And that's exactly what this film transmits. <br /> <br /> However, unlike many other comic films, I felt that he did it with a bit of class. Solving a more limited audience with strong language and graphic combat scenes, "Blade" presents a very modern, credible and dismal world whose small nuances have managed to arouse a sense of terror - however minor it may be - by an observer who he is rarely involved in a story unless it is an emotional aspect (ie maw). <br /> <br /> Yes, the film has countless naps and absurdly unrealistic situations like a standard doctor smart enough to come up with what no one else has been able to do for several thousand years. But when you have a strong enemy like this one, and fight the scenes with engaging and exciting photo cuts and special effects like this, what else does it matter? It may last a while, but for what it proposes to do, "Blade" stands out in clear relief from most other films of this genre.
