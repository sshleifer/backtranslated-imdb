While watching a trivial modern film (The Runaway Bride) with my niece (22) asked me "Since you have been watching movies since 1938, what is the best movie of your life?" Boy! What a choice! It took me all summer to reflect and start some gestures before making a decision. IT IS "THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE". This film has no flaws. It is a film in which each secondary character and dialogue are essential to the whole story. There is not a single part in the film that could be excluded. The fixation of the young girl with her brothers lacks hands, the man who returns home to young adults who grew up without him and with different ideas, the portrait of a young man whose sole responsibility was that of a soda that became the head of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action. A woman who must now adapt to her husband whose life has been away from her for years. The realization of the people who were safe in those safe houses of the sacrifices made by these common men for them. The look in life to love and live with a man without hands. A first look and reaction of parents to the new deformities of the child. A man used to making decisions about life and death in an instant, having to go back to building a conservative bank. This is not comprehensive, tears and tears of the heart. THIS IS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed differently. This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS !! This could easily be considered a documentary. On this day of color films, don't be turned off by black and white because it's one of the best black and white movies, editing and directing you've ever seen. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it mandatory for all those involved in history, film production, creative writing, sociology, family council, or psychology to visualize and report on this magnificent example of film art.
