I read the book before seeing the film and the film is one of the best adaptations available. Very true and true to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are fantastic. Robbins is a talented filmmaker and I would like him to add more to his shelter. It made the film very obsessive and intentionally slow to add depth. A particularly brilliant piece of film creation was a reflection of the victims that appeared in the glass of the execution hall at the end.
