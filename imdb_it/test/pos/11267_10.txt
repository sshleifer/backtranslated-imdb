I had the pleasure of seeing Saltimbanco live before seeing the video version of the show. While nothing can be compared to being there, the people behind the video have done an extraordinary job in capturing the taste, the feeling, the feeling and much more. The wonderful performances of Saltimbanco's extraordinary crew are wonderfully captured. The video flows smoothly and artfully like the production itself. A wonderful experience.
