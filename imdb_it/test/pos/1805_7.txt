I've seen this movie quite a few times and every time I watch it, it becomes more extravagant and fun. Maybe it's the lack of research that involved Nicolas Cage's "punk" character or the cheesiness factor because it was a typical eighties movie ... but it's a cute love story with extremely funny and unique characters. I think it's right there with "Fast Times" and "Weird Science" (mostly for the eighties!)
