Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is memorable. The film was very well received and helped the land contracts to do "Memento" and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Below is an exquisite example of how films should be made. No elegant effect or dripping blood ... just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to fascinate us once again with his writings. The actors, all unknown to me and I suppose many people, have done a good job bringing the characters to live. They were all credible and that's all they have to be. The film is confusing because it plays a lot with chronology, but in the end it is very rewarding. The film is a bit short to be a feature film, but any additional length would have ruined the style of the film and the brilliance of the writing would have been reduced. Although short, the film has every aspect that makes a movie attractive (IMO): an intriguing beginning, an exciting medium and a surprising end. <br /> <br /> I dare say that following is almost as good as Memento, his best film by far. The scrambled chronology is equally masterly used in both films, the surprising twists are present and the acting is very good. <br /> <br /> This film was made for only $ 6000 but the quality is much higher than most (almost all) box office hits of a million dollars. Using b & w can be a tough pill to swallow for the general public, followed mainly by Nolan showing his skills to the studio bosses :-). And what skills are ... I rarely enjoyed writing as much as in "Follow". Even Pi is not even close to the IMO, although it is also very beautiful. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a movie not to be missed for any self-respecting movie lover. If you liked Memento, "Following" is definitely for you.
