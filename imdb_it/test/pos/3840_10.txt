This is one of my favorite movies, always. The story is simply fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the time, this film never bores the public. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but they lack what we have here. This is fun, creative and always focused. This film only has something more you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. This title belongs to BRILLIANT Toy Story. But this is a respectable second, immediately followed by The Lady and the Tramp. Watch it and enjoy what is one of the greatest cinema successes. And by the way, I'm not a kid, this is for the older audience that wants to regain their childhood. An absolute must!
