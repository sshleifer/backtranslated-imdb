Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a silly and stupid male chauvinist who is trying to sell some drugs stolen. Unfortunately for him, he is brutally murdered, while Betty secretly observes. He leaves her baffled, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his former girlfriend RN. He heads towards LA to find his lost love, not knowing that the stolen drugs are in his trunk. Charlie and Wesley haunted her (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock respectively), the assassins who inadvertently killed Del before they discovered where drugs were hidden. They pursue her all over the country, while Charlie gradually falls in love with her image of her. <br /> <br /> And in LA, things become completely bizarre, since no one realizes that Betty is delusional. Alternatively fun and moving, this film is almost perfect. Stop reading the comments and go see it.
