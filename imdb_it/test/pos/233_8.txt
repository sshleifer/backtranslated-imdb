I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always in love with Mrs. Hayworth's looks, so I thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br /> This could be the best showcase for the multi-talented Mrs Hayworth. She has never been more beautiful in a film (with the possible exception of "Gilda", where she is the sex symbol par excellence). Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy can be dated, but it's still pretty fun. Kelly does one of her tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window. <br /> <br /> But Rita drives the whole movie. An excellent cast, with Otto Kruger and the always wonderful, wise Eve Arden doesn't hurt. <br /> <br /> Rita sings, Rita dances, all the time seems incredibly beautiful! Music may be short of classic, but the lyrics on most songs are pretty smart. <br /> <br /> I find this film works better than "Guild", which I consider an imperfect film. On Mrs Hayworth's credit, she also leads Gilda, and Gilda leads every crazy red-blooded male. <br /> <br /> The film holds up well after all these years. A lot of candy for the legs for the male audience is a nice bonus!
