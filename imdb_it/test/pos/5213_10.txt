The only reason I decided to watch this film is because of Karen Sillas' great talent for acting (Alyson Haywood), "Bad Money", '99, which is deeply involved with Gary Cole, (Dave), "Cry Wolf ", '05, who is a great war hero and has all sorts of ways to make money and seems to never stop telling LIES. Alyson and Dave are trying to rebuild an old house and bring it back to comfortable living conditions. The relationship becomes problematic and Alyson decides to find out what is happening and the plot becomes very mysterious. If you are a big fan of Karen Sillas, this is the movie for you. I just want Karen to appear in more films, I miss her great talents.
