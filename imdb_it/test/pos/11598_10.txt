When I watch this movie, I get excited even when I see the scenes of the world of Miss. She has a beautiful and fascinating body. When the cute girl does the bed scenes and shows her completely naked body ... I think the males have a hard time resisting ... I think it's time for pretty girls like hrishita bhatt to do nude scenes too. At least nobody wants a naked body of ugly women like Seema biswas in c in the bandit queen.I agree with what Mallicka.b said. The film is portrayed in a way that seems to be a sort of denigration of the original content. Emotions are not transmitted correctly. I imagine a couple of not-so-good shows contributed to his mediocrity. From my point of view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of his scenes, he seems a bit lustful, which is ultimately not what the film should have been about. I also noticed some over-acting in some of his scenes. I am a harsh critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can't help it; sorry for that thing. 'Raincoat' was a good film by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed
