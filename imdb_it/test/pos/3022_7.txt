After seeing enough movies, there is little that you don't remember about other movies. However this was a watchable film, albeit a bit scary. I had to turn it off from time to time and come back later. Like "Silence of the Lambs", it's the search for a serial killer who kidnapped someone and confined her to his chamber of horrors. Like "Flatliner", the main character explores a dream world through an experimental procedure. The surrealism of dream sequences is what makes this film, how the characters are in a situation and in a landscape where literally anything can happen. And beyond this continuity and "making sense" are not necessary, which also makes a filmmaker's dream come true. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems a little off is that in the end we hope for the redemption of the serial killer or the exorcism of his demons. In reality, you feel sympathy for the child inside the man, but clearly the boy's innocence cannot be separated from the horrible actions of man. The attention fluctuates as it must from saving man to saving his victim.
