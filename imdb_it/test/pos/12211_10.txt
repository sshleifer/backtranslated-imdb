I would love if they returned to the surface. I really enjoyed the show with my family. I felt that the development of the plot and the plot were of first quality. As the other person said, it seems that everything is reduced to the lowest common denominator. Nothing but bland, politically correct garbage survives. Just look on the internet to see how many people were watching the show. Also it's not nice to leave us hanging on to what happened to all the characters on the show. This is the same thing that happened on time travel in which I think they were called 8 days, but it should have been called backstep. Did the Olympics kill the surface? I know that the writers killed another of my favorite programs years ago, the greatest American hero.
