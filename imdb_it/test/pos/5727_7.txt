OK. Overall, this three-part documentary will update most people interested in going into the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovering our universe. If you read Stephen Hawkings' brilliant book "A Brief History of Time" and understood it, you could benefit from the visual description of some concepts ... which I did to a certain extent. Greene is bearable, but obviously for the sake of the masses, he tends to explain things in a paternalistic way. This is obviously intentional and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series. <br /> <br /> The guest scientists were good. (not Hawking, but I suppose he has his DVDs) I kept waiting for it to appear, but they rotate through the same for almost 3 parts ... (very American weighted here, with few English and an antipodean) I bought the Nova 2 Disc edition (NTSC) and there were some inclusions that really penalized the overall experience. <br /> <br /> 1. The "this was done to you ..." at the beginning of EACH part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it twice more before it was over was very normal. <br /> <br /> 2. I can't be helped, I suppose, but there's a lot of overlap at the beginning of 2 and 3 that got me to the FFW button a few times. <br /> <br /> 3. This set of records was directly from the TV .. (ie advertising, what happened the last show for those who missed it and frequent "goto pbs.org for others .... ") that appeared during the presentation. (unlike the BBC material which has no equal for the presentation ... Planets, The Blue Planet, etc.) My 7/10 is based on content only. The trouble was there but I got over it. If this had been done with that classic British accent presenter (you know) it would be a perfect record in my opinion. <br /> <br /> If you have seen this and want more ... then I strongly recommend the Hawkings to book "a short history of the time" ... I wish it were also a movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it.
