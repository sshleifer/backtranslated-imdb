Chris Smith is a high-level director with rarely seen talent to spot a good story, and then get himself out of trouble. Smith's "American Movie" is the true record of filmmaker Mark Borchardt, a loser intent on milking his old uncle in cash to complete his horror short film. But never, under any circumstances, pursue gainful employment or support the children he conceived. <br /> <br /> Such is the skill of producer Smith that Mark appears more understanding than otherwise. Although he attracts Uncle Bill with dreams of sugar and credits from the executive producer, it is his desperation to be someone, to have his name paired with artists like Scorsese and Spielberg who touch us. <br /> <br /> "American The film" also belongs to that rare, often attempted but rarely achieved subtype that successfully combines hilarity with horror. Humor derives from Ed Woodwood's belief of Borchardt in his own genius. From his terrifying attempts at acting, from his replacement with the film's less experienced mother to a missing cameraman and his sweet friend Mike, who suffered brain damage, when he is an actor or crew member. <br /> <br /> the horror comes from seeing what Borchardt cannot: it is this very American attitude - I Want, Therefore I Am Entitled - that prevents him from seeing how much he has to learn about his chosen art. He is so sure he cannot fail that failure is guaranteed.
