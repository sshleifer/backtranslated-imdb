BLACK WATER must be one of the best Australian films I've seen in many years. My girlfriend and I sat down, shaking hands, jumping in all the right places. This is a crocodile film like OPEN WATER was a shark movie. In other words, creatures are only part of the dilemma, the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances. The way Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich of the director squeezes so much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is incredible to see. And when I say terror, it's not an exaggeration, artificially build moments of contention, but smaller touches that when you ask yourself "how I would feel in that situation" led you to conclude "scared without spirit". The performances were fantastic, the gorgeous rhythm and the splits towards the other real mangroves were excellent and the final moments of the film seemed very right. This is a fashionable debut of two directors who should be rightly very proud. Go watch this beautiful suspense movie and act.
