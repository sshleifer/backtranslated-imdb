This film has a brilliant soundtrack and superb acting from some rather unknown faces. I particularly like the Welsh characters of the Welsh badlands who flaunt like hard-hitting American rappers. The lines between Jip and Koop are brilliant and appear as best friends almost as if it were true in real life. I have experienced some of the things in this film and let me tell you that first of all these people don't act (especially the visa with Jip and Koop who talk and sniff coca cola). Danny Dyer is as priceless as Moff the "recipe party" retailer and has the funniest jokes in the movie ... <br /> <br /> "I'm happier when I'm out of my pickle feeling the music, take me .... yeaahhh! I knew you wouldn't disappoint me, I knew !!! "
