"The Egyptian" is set during the reign of one of the most fascinating figures of the ancient world, the pharaoh Akhnaton, who thirteen centuries before Christ tried to introduce a monotheistic religion, Athenism, in ancient Egypt. The main character, however, is not Akhnaton, but rather the fake Sinuhe. Sinuhe, since she was a child, finds herself mysteriously floating in a basket on the Nile river and adopted by the doctor Senmut and his wife. When he grows up to manhood, he follows his adoptive father into the medical profession, initially working (like his father) among the poor of the city, but he comes to the fore after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier Horemheb, save Life of the pharaoh during a hunting expedition in the desert. Sinuhe is appointed court doctor, but becomes obsessed with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer. Sinuhe not only ruins himself in a vain attempt to win his love, but is also dishonored when his negligence in his duties means that he is unable to save the life of Akhnaton's daughter. <br /> <br /> Sinuhe flees into exile, where he achieved success as a healer in neighboring countries, but returned to Egypt when he learned of a Hittite plot to invade. Although Akhnaton promptly forgives him for his previous crimes, Sinuhe finds the country in turmoil. Pharaoh's attempts to introduce a new religion have led to civil conflicts between his followers and those of the priests of the old polytheist faith, and it is too peaceful by nature to take any initiative to address the Hittite threat. Sinuhe is involved in a plot by Horemheb, now general of the Egyptian army, and Akhnaton's sister, Princess Baketamon, to overthrow the Pharaoh and replace him with a more effective monarch. <br /> <br /> The film's weaknesses derive mainly from its two romantic subplots. During the film, Sinuhe is revealed as the long lost son of the previous Pharaoh and half-brother of Akhnaton and Baketamon. It could therefore surprise a modern public that falls in love with him; sibling marriage was not necessarily considered incestuous by the standards of the Egyptian royal family, but the film audience standards of the 1950s were generally less liberal on this point. In any case, the love triangle of Horemheb-Baketamon-Sinuhe is an unnecessary complication and diminishes Baketamon's role in the film, that of Realpolitik's voice, cynical and cold-eyed. <br /> <br /> Nefer's subplot, which takes up most of the first hour of the film, is overwritten and excessively melodramatic. Nefer is morally worthless but charming, and the role needed an actress of great beauty and also of great dramatic ability to make it credible, especially when Nefer realizes the difficult task of winning Sinuhe away from a lovely woman like Jean Simmons ( who plays Merit, Sinuhe is the rival for her affections). It is therefore a pity that the role went to a comically inept actress like Bella Darvi, whose only qualification was that she was the producer's lover, Darryl F. Zanuck. Darvi was not only a wooden actress, but also spoke with a strong foreign accent, made even more incomprehensible by a lye. He wasn't even particularly attractive compared to the two legendary Hollywood beauties in the film, Simmons and Gene Tierney who plays Baketamon. <br /> <br /> The film is best when it focuses on its main political and religious themes. The other actors are better than Darvi, although Peter Ustinov as Sinuhe Kaptah's servant makes the same mistake as "Spartacus", trying to bring comic relief to a film that doesn't need it. His voice, however, was far too aristocratic for a "comic servant" role. Edmund Purdom, a little-known British actor, was pushed into the lead role when Marlon Brando came out at the last minute, but more than adequately fills the big man's shoes, even though his way of acting was very different. Take on the challenge of showing the changes in the character of Sinuhe, from the worldly idealist, to the madman in love, to the cynical embittered to the enlightened visionary of the final scenes. Victor Mature has never been the most expressive of actors, but he is suited to the role of Horemheb, a practical and concrete man of action. "Demetrius and the Gladiators" is better here than it was in his other 1954 epic. Simmons has a luminous beauty like merit. Michael Wilding (so far better known as the second Mr Elizabeth Taylor) plays Akhnaton as an aspiring philosopher-king who ends up as a sort of mad saint. His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an unsuitable ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice that gives him an air of moral grandeur far beyond those who hope to replace him on the throne. Although Aten had more in common with the Supreme Being of the Deists than with the Old Testament of Jehovah or the Christian Trinitarian God, there is a deliberate attempt to draw parallels between Athenism and Christianity. In the film the Athenian symbol is the "ankh", undoubtedly chosen because of its resemblance to a cross, but in reality it was a common Egyptian hieroglyph for life, not unique for Atenism. The Akhnaton language often has a biblical ring; his comparison of himself with "the wind whistling in the desert" recalls the "voice that cries in the desert" of John the Baptist (hence the title of this review). The discovery of Sinuhe in the river is parallel to the history of the Old Testament of Moses. At the end of the film, Sinuhe, who became the heir of the dead Akhnaton's spirit, reaches his moral greatness. The message of the film is that, while we may need practical action men like Horemheb, we also need visionaries and thinkers who are ready to ask the question "why?" For all its faults, "The Egyptian" is an idealistic and human film in its approach to both religion and politics. 7/10
