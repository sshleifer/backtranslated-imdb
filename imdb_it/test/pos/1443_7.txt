*** Spoiler in the fifth paragraph *** This was an incredibly sincere image (uh-huh, uh-huh) of 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions took the opportunity to do so, the Motion Picture Association of America hesitated to certify a film that openly shows a junky hitting a syringe full of heroin in his arm. Frank Sinatra had the chance to both play an addicted musician and fall on his face in a role that required at least twice the acting he had ever done. All in all, these games have borne fruit, the film is a classic, even if it is not perfect. <br /> <br /> The novel by Nelson Algren could be great, but it's too long to fit comfortably into a two-hour movie 'The Man with the Golden Arm' is 119 minutes and often feels great longer. However, in my opinion it's not just Frankie Machine (Sinatra) doing the film, but the other characters and their secondary storylines, all involving Frankie. In the end it is not just Frankie who is addicted, everyone and everything seems to depend on him and feels it acutely. When the pressure gets too strong, the drums start to beat the soundtrack and Frankie crosses the street with his well-dressed "friend" Louie. <br /> <br /> It is an exaggeration to say that Frank Sinatra's musical career has never really been in the doldrums, but in the early 1950s he was in limbo between his days touring with large groups and the Las era. Vegas. "From Here to Eternity" called him a serious actor and his singing career bounced, but "The Man with the Golden Arm" was still a significant challenge, the whole show sinks or swims with his performance . He pulls it off with such skill that for several minutes at a time I have forgotten that I was watching Frank Sinatra, he must have known junky musicians and made the most of this knowledge. <br /> <br /> Set side by side with Billy Wilder's masterpiece "The Lost Weekend" puts more emphasis on the sociological causes of addiction in "The Man with the Golden Arm". While Don Birnem (Ray Milland in "The Lost Weekend") seems to be fighting above all against himself, Frankie Machine is besieged by external forces and takes refuge in the needle. Neither approach is entirely right or wrong, especially since addiction is impossible to explain completely, but it seems that this film could have benefited from a little more insight into Frankie's internal struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of the problems I have with this movie is the clich√© relying on "quitting cold turkey". I realize that "The Man with the Golden Arm" was probably setting the trend rather than following it, but that doesn't make it any better. At the beginning of the film, Frankie has all appearances kicked his habit with the help of a doctor and a treatment facility of some kind. Of course the drama of the film requires you to retract, but I found the American ideal that a man has to face his problems alone (or perhaps with the help of a good woman) out of place here. Going to the cold turkey and going to sunset with Kim Novak seemed too unrealistic. The end of "The Lost Weekend" was similar but I think it was a little less rosy.
