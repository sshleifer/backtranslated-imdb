The film deals with the here and now the horror of "surrender" with a trans-global multi-cast account of all those involved. Nobody escapes lightly because we see the blindness of the players while they cut their own slice of the world game accumulating hatred and misery on their "enemies" and on themselves in equal measure. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the senator's sympathetic helper (played in a glittering way by Peter Sarsgaard) and the real power of the Washington government is electrifying. Meanwhile, in the camp, the new CIA man (Jake Gyllenhaal) goes through an epochal change in his attitude towards the new American torture stunt. Suddenly, even if his refusal of what he initially tacitly condoned is, one has to wonder why would anyone who calls themselves civilized stand up and watch someone be humiliated and abused in this way? The film has few heroes - perhaps the imperfect and faltering CIA man of Gyllenhaal is the exception and a necessary indulgence to make the film offer a little hope. <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this film is not fiction, but a wake up call to those with a modicum of decency left in them. The horrible truth is that in the United Kingdom and the United States we have lost the moral plot and this film shows how much we are willing to go. All this in the name of freedom! There is a wonderful line in the script that says torture is a sure way to increase the number of our enemies. This is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this film offers and start using our strength and our money in a much smarter way !! The message seems to be that any of us argues that the delivery, torture and abuse of fundamental human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are like stupid and rape suicides as rude and incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> Everyone praises the sensitivity of a talented South African director with an eye to the gross injustice of how power is exercised, and a cast of mainstream actors of principle from the United States and beyond. Oh, by the way, the film has a tip on its tail and the ending is a clever and stimulating surprise (which I don't want to reveal). I saw the movie at the beginning of London preview so it hasn't been widely written yet, but I'm happy to say that the wave of less brilliant reviews seems to be spinning. The BBC review was strongly supported and they (and I) suspect that most of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specifications of Hollywood - where the good and the bad are cardboard cutouts. Hence the reason why many of the really great films of the year are always more indie and / or non-US.
