I like the national anthem. I like the national anthem if nothing else, just before the Midnight News, I imagine playing the dishes of the band. It's not as easy as you might think! One two three four; One two three four; but then what? So I have a liking for the practicing bass player in Roy Andersson's wonderful movie, patiently waiting for his cue by listening to a very 70s musician. <br /> <br /> The 70s motif seems to continue for everything, with some classics, soulless furniture. Furthermore, each scene has a mysterious jade effect that emphasizes the tiny nuances of the subtlest acting. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the exceptional purple boots by Jessika Lundberg. Boots that would otherwise have inspired a Silk Cult advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> But then the difficult. Someone asked me what it was. Well, there is a scene where the opening line like "I don't have that length in green" Brilliant. Directly from a Gary Larson cartoon. <br /> <br /> I can't say what it is. Go see yourself. <br /> <br /> Ron Plasma <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Looks Swedish <br /> <br /> (Visa 15Apr08)
