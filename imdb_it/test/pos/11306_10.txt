Normally I try to avoid Barbie movies, but this was unmistakably fantastic. Congratulations on the graphics and the voice of the characters. Everything flowed well. This enchanting tale is a great spin-off from others, but it's worth buying! I have no children, but the children I babysit (including boys) find it intriguing and love the extra features of the DVD. I honestly don't know why this is rated so low, but for kids, especially your Barbie lovin '8 years will love it. It's not as simple or predictive as most movies. This "children's" film has excellent morals and shows teamwork. It has no swear words, fragments of romanticism (if you are old enough to understand it) and a wonderfully written plot. That's why I'm giving ten out of ten!
