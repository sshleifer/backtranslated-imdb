"Dead Man Walking" is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe that anyone, after watching the movie, can feel indifferent about the movie or its message. Tim Robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on viewers, but manages to make a film that is largely compatible with both points of view on the death penalty: whether it is right to assassinate a murderer or not. I have always known where I stand in this question, even as a child, and this film - despite the fact that it really doesn't make any sense - has made me even more confident in my belief that it can never be right to kill * anyone *. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrait of Matthew Poncelet, his nomination for an Academy Award was well deserved. Although Nicolas Cage does a great job in "Leaving Las Vegas", I would have been happier if Penn had won the prize. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and deserved the Oscar she won. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the vote I gave to this film: 9/10!
