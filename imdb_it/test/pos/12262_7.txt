"Broadcast News" is directed by James L. Brooks (Terms of Tenderness, As Good As It Gets) and has an exceptional cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. Everyone gives a good performance, but they are all too unlikely to really care about them. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the film are really brilliant, like the prologue and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason that it doesn't work at all is that it is a film based on the fact that the characters are fun and not fun things that happen to them. <br /> <br /> You could consider it nothing more than a drama, but often too silly to succeed there too. However, the script is worth watching. Certainly not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 10
