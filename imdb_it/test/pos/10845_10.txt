Over the weekend I saw the movie Tipping the Velvet and if I had to record this movie out of 100 I should give it 100 without asking questions. I am a true proponent of true love and this film has moved me in a lot of different ways and the actors adapt to the parts without an attack. But I have to say that the ending was not so nice because I didn't see that spark in Nancys eyes when he ever looked into Flo's eyes, while his eyes sparkled every time he looked at Kitty, Kitty just had to be in the room or thought Nancy and Nancy would shine only with that spark. Kitty told Nancy she couldn't find her and she was looking for her, but she couldn't find her. Kitty was ready to give everything to bring Nancy back. Kitty's eyes showed Kitty's pain. I think Nancy should have let Kitty see that their love was true and strong and that she wouldn't let it go so easily. You have to play a part two and have them do it together, but you don't have to let anyone else play the roles that must be the real Kitty & Nancy, otherwise it will never work. My mother once told me that true love is not real. I'm not a fool, I know we all have a real love out somewhere waiting for each of us and I believe with my life that Nancy's true love is really just the true love of Kitty and Kitty is just Nancy. Come let the game play the right way, the only way. Let Nancy's eyes shine again ... Kitty has lost everything, losing Nancy. And Kitty is not the only one to blame. I'm gay myself and being gay isn't easy !! WAKE UP!!! in 1889 I didn't want to be gay, Kitty was lost in the depths of herself and in 1889 perhaps the right thing to do was to marry a man. Even if you love a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to defend her Nancy needed to fight for her. I remember how deeply I loved this girl and I let her go because I thought I was doing something wrong and I went back to my ex-boyfriend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I know I was wrong to let her go and I will pay for the rest of my days, because like Kitty I couldn't find her anywhere. I heard she's married to a man in the United States somewhere. I even heard that he beats her. I think in the end we both lost. Give the two girls one more chance life can be very lonely if you are not faithful to you and your loved one. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Kristen Ann
