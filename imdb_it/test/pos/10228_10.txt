I'd like to see some tie-ins between NightBreed, The Fury and the X-Men series, a sort of way in which the second series of Outer Limit would tie stories and plot in particular after the fact, to create an Arco story too if one has never been designed. I would also like to know if any other information - anecdotal or not, exists everywhere on the relationship and / or collaboration between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I simply cannot think of the fact that David Cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a Clive Barker film. Is there actually more information on the subject? In the end, it's been 17 years since the film was released, and I was hoping there would be a follow-up by now. Does anyone out there know if there were any plans in preparation that were never made, or if there are actually plans for a sequel already?
