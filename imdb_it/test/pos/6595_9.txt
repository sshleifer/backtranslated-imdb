Not only was this film exciting, but it took me back to oblivion with its soundtrack true to life. These were the things we were saying, and doing ... these were the songs we were listening to ... all during the same time period, in the same era, much further south, in Alabama. I may not have been one of the skateboard sets, but I was definitely one of the observers, sitting on the curb with the old transistor radio, listening to Neil Young, looking at the bravest ones I had ever hoped to be, while they were shooting their surfboards on wheels, applying the tricks of Alva and Adams, hoping that perhaps, only perhaps for a brief moment, they adopt the Zephyr style. Show just how much we all were the same in those wonderful days. ~ KLJ
