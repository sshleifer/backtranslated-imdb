I saw the film for the second time on September 30th 2006 and thought it was even better than the first time I saw it. I really liked the acting, especially "Uncle Benny". I thought Fred Carpenter did an excellent script and direction work on this film. The plot has certainly kept your interest and I hope this film reaches the top. I felt that he moved very smoothly between the scenes and the coup de theater in the end, well, lets just say that I didn't see it coming. I also thought that Craig, the actor who played "Eddie Monroe", did an excellent job and I hope this film helps him go further in his acting career. From the beginning to the end, I loved it.
