Distributor: GOODTIMES home video <br /> <br /> Plot: a high school student is marked by inexorable terror in this suspense full of TV movies. Gail Osborne is new to the city. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way. That is until he receives a scary and frightening phone call while he is babysitting. After more and more phone calls, she is raped. during most of the film, try to find evidence that the person raped her. <br /> <br /> Audio / Video: this 1987 VHS edition of Goodtimes sucks. There are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen. <br /> <br /> Extras: No extras from Goodtimes home video. <br /> <br /> Final considerations: this suspense filled for TV movie was made in 1978, so don't expect many deaths (there are none). If you can find this movie with the Worldvision home video logo on the front side, then buy it. But the Goodtimes version is rather disgusting. This can be a bit boring, but if you're patient, the ending is pretty good.
