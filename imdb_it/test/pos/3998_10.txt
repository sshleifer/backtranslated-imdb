This movie might be a bit boring for some people, but I find this movie <br /> <br /> very interesting in terms of an attempt to reveal a tradition. <br /> <br /> The director, Lim, has made two films about traditional music in Korea before this film. The film before that showed the music throughout the film, and this film is trying to achieve similar things by having backgrounds in the film just like a painting. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that, the story is written by both the director and a philosopher, Kim, who is a well-known scholar in Korea (with many diplomas - including the doctor at Havard) I'm not saying that educated people make better films but that the philosopher is an expert on traditional culture in Korea, so give more credit on this film.
