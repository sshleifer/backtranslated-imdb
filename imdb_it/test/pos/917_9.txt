There is a spartan and little sentimental side to this film that allows us plenty of space to participate in the action without any stylistic footprint that tells us HOW we are made to feel; in "Blu", everything was openly sad (of course, powerful as hell, but anyway); in "Bianco", it was a delightful fantasy. But there are no such emotional clues, or clues to that matter, in this. It is as if in the end you let the strength of the story work its magic without dazzling embellishments. I think that is what makes it the most enigmatic of the three, but ultimately the most transcendent and redemptive. Ruthless and merciless honesty has never been so beautiful.
