Having been a marine, I can tell you that the D.I. is an accurate portrait to date depicting the Marine Corp training camp and how boys are turned into men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sgt. Jim Moore, a tough but fair instructor in North Carolina, on the island of Paris. The film focuses on a recruit who does not seem to "get on with the program". A more recent film, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic education and is worth seeing.
