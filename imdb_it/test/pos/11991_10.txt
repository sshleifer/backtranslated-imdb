I have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it junk a disguise an unexceptionable sequel is simply unfair I mean what else they could have done for a sequel then. Because seriously I think he should have had a sequel (Rodney Dangerfield) he says: hey everyone would have sex and then some dancing goffer and that's what the end of Caddyshack is even though the evaluation of the first film was and the second era (PG) was still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
