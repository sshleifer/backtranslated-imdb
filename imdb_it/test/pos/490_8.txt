Ok, sure, this movie is a bit on the hob side. It's hard to take characters from the comics and put them into films with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), But this is very difficult. I've never read the real comic book, but it doesn't matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on the fact that it is a faithful reworking of someone else's idea. (Unless it is a film based on a true story, which requires at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.) So why am I going to give this film a high enough rating? Because it tries. He tries very hard. In my book, this makes a fair attempt at a funny movie. <br /> <br /> Many films have been made with vampire arguments that are the main focus. It seems that everyone has their opinion on the traditions of vampires, whether they are the cross, the silver, the garlic, the aversion to sunlight, whatever. Some of these ideas are included here. The plot is familiar ... a group of vampires conspire to conquer the world, with one person (mainly) standing on their way. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives with the sole purpose of destroying the vampiric masses, which slowly but surely have moved into the world and shared them with the human race. For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them. Vampires have even become familiar, people who aspire to be vampires and do the dirty work of vampires to show them how worthy they are to be "transformed". <br /> <br /> Now that I think about it, there are many elements of this film similar to the plot of the Roddy Piper movie, They Live. A hidden enemy, a hidden group of people who plot against them, the struggle to save mankind ... all that is also present in Blade. <br /> <br /> Acting is not the best here. At best, lightning strikes are only slightly better than his other roles; N'Bushe Wright, a relative newcomer, is not so bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's partner (it's Blade what Chip is for The Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here, like the vampire "boss" you love to hate. <br /> <br /> I don't know, but I loved the special effects in this movie. From the blood-drenched vampire rave to the inevitable fight in the film's finale, the special effects are not bad. There is certainly enough blood and blood to go around, but after all, this is a vampire movie, right? The various forms and types of weapons used by Blade are quite unique and generally not used in contemporary action movies. Snipes has more talent with a decorated sword than with a machine gun. Furthermore, there is so much other thinking going on to fight with a blade rather than blowing someone off. (Unless, of course, you are not Indiana Jones.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not the best action movie ever made, but it's not bad either. As a bonus, the soundtrack and the soundtrack are also quite interesting. Tell me, in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek ?! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
