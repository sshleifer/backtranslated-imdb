Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict who returns to his Chicago neighborhood after a long stay in a clinic. He plans to stay out of the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can't avoid meeting his old friends. He was originally arrested not for any drug charges, but because he was caught in an illegal poker game. His skill in poker has earned him the nickname Man with the golden arm, and the men who run the game, one of which is his previous connection with the heroine, want him to do business again. Meanwhile, Frank has to take care of a woman who was injured in a car accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and recover with his old girlfriend, Molly (Kim Novak). The film is fantastic in getting us into Sinatra's mental state. When he feels confident in the beginning of the film, I feel good for him. But, when a promised phone call does not arrive one day, it goes into depression and gets back on the spot. Later, when he finally arrives at the audition, he completely freaks out. His embarrassment when he can't play the right rhythm is devastating. He has had such great dreams, and the other musicians do not even pay him any attention while he rushes out of the room. The film moves quickly and shows Frank's drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a picture of social messages. The actors are doing well uniformly. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best of his time. The only thing I don't like about the movie is the ending. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I really like the character of Zosch and Parker is very good at the film, they could have done a little more to fill his past. The finish is a bit too pathetic. While there is certainly pathos that will remain with the characters after the closing of the film, Zosch's death ties a little too neatly. Frank is free to love Molly and will not go to prison. Also, his drug dealer is dead, so at least the immediate threat is gone. Well, I guess there's always a desire in Hollywood to tie it all together in a small and accurate package. It hurts the film a little, but, as it is, it is still one of the best and most adult movies on drug addiction I can think of. 9/10.
