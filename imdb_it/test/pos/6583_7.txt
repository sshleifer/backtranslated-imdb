This was a film I kept reading reviews over and over; and despite being played at the Film Museum and not at the Pathe theaters ?? I decided to try this movie. The reasons were many ?? in reviews it was compared with Pulp Fiction, had several parallel stories running in the film and finally has already won 17 international awards in various categories. I was looking forward to seeing this movie and, due to my day off at Greenpeace, I decided to make myself happy by going and seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> It is a story based in Finland. I think it reflects the current life of people in general ?? drugs, crime, sex, anger, anguish, fear and guilt. Every emotion was captured brilliantly in the film. There are several characters and stories intertwined but some characters return in the second half ?? make a connection with the start sequences and that carries the story forward. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends ?? one of which is computer geek and the other is a drug addict ?? son of a violent father. The drug addict boy exchanges a 500 Euro note ?? printed by his friend ?? to buy back his music system, and in return he gets a huge cash change to buy more drugs. The trading of Euro 500 notes continues to bizarre events ?? from the shop dealer to an automatic mechanic thief ?? to a car dealer ?? to a vacuum cleaner seller ?? to a prostitute ?? to a police officer ?? then to his family and his children. As the beginning of a small thing ?? creates a chain reaction that leads even after 5 years of that first incident to a last depressing note ?? which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> The management is excellent. The development of the character in the film is first-rate. The character that stays in your head even after you leave the film is the vacuum cleaner salesman. All the film departments are well managed. Here I would like to make a couple of critical comments. First of all, during the sequence of one event leading to another, I felt that the coincidences were too rapid and forced. But this error in writing the script is indulgent when you see the whole canvas. Secondly, the wake of one character leading to another somehow leads back to the first two characters and again I found a forced decision by the screenwriter. There was no need to show the same characters when there are different causes that lead to different effects in such a big city. <br /> <br /> But after saying that ?? it's an excellent movie! It's a dark movie with some sex scenes. The characters are having black, white and gray shades and emotions that change from facing different situations that are brilliantly captured by the director. <br /> <br /> A high quality movie! It has all the ingredients to become a cult movie. I hope that only these films do not become and reach the status of cult films and win many awards, because without crime, sex, violence, drugs, etc. Can one make fantastic movies ?? Bicycle thieves and Panchali Pather are his first examples? The only thing is that they have been a long time back and the times are changing and I think the films reflect the current times.
