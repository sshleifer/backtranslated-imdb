The main advantage of this film is the combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. This was the first film in which this pair of comedies showed their Laurel and Hardy style humor. Farley's obvious physical comic abilities are perfectly enhanced by Spade's sarcastic grip in every situation they find themselves. <br /> <br /> This film stands out from other comedy films. Tommy Boy is part of the Blues Brothers as a comic opera whose individual scenes and bits derive from the plot, rather than serving to break the plot and give the film an uneven look like many other comedy films do. Thanks to the excellent direction of Sagal, each scene is tense and immediately prefigures or recites the story told. It is so much credit for the exhilaration of the film as Farley and Spade. The acting of Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd and many others (see the gas station 22 miles from Davenport) strengthens the film. <br /> <br /> The film guarantees multiple visions because there are many beautiful nuances to the film that could be obscured by Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I think this film is very well done and it's the most fun movie I've ever seen.
