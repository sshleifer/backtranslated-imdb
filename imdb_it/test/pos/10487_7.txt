PRICE OF HONOR aka PRICE OF POWER is an ambitious Western melodrama, light on action, which tries to tell a version of the Old West of the JFK murder. In 1881, the president went to Dallas and was struck by a window as he paraded through his carriage. Corrupt officials committed the murder and have a humble slave take rap. Our hero, the sincere but bland Giuliano Gemma, aims to reveal the conspiracy. A compelling story, bold for its subject, but amusing despite the scarcity of shooter actions. The film is a 7 out of 10, despite the poor presentation of the DVD, which is too dark with a poor sound. Look for a good copy.
