GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos must be the best Robim Williams I've seen all ... He behaves perfectly. It was like watching Robim Williams as he was and he ... almost made me cry looking at him. <br /> <br /> I had no idea that Robin was as close as John Belushi's friend as he was. The portrait of this relationship has been very good and could almost stand on its merits. Very sad, what they both experienced. <br /> <br /> I really felt for both Val and Robin during his difficult times. I'm glad they ended it on a high note! <br /> <br /> I hope Robin puts a $ 100 note in this guy's hat !! <br /> <br /> And it was great that it was shot in Vancouver!
