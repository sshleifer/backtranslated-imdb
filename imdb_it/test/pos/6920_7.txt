This film focuses on entertainment. Imagine your friends with whom you love spending time, those you know outside becoming a bit silly and maybe taking on a character or two. Here's what this movie is about. An inventive and brilliantly executed script. It's not about pleasing the masses with this, it's about having fun with a group of brilliantly talented people. This is what I'm sure everyone thought when they signed up for it. <br /> <br /> The review above seems completely unfair and I think the person who wrote had a bad mood watching the movie. In a carefree moment, there is great dignity if you are interested in watching. A job well done, I thought it was a great movie. I would look at it before the North American normality every day. <br /> <br /> In short, it is not the best film you will see but it has a lot of moments. I haven't laughed so long in an age.
