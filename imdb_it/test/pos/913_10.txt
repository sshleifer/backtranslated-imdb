"Both believed that a hidden feeling unified them. This certainty is beautiful, but the uncertainty is more beautiful. They did not believe that they had never been reached. Nothing happened between them. that time they could have been met. "Even if it didn't mean being, it was a swan song. Two young people, who are close and have never been met, are in the same places, at the same times, doing the same things most of the time. Finally they meet in the dramatic and very brilliant ending that brings them together. Meanwhile the woman met an old man. Their relationship is similar to brotherhood. He told her about his life. It was like that of young people but with better prospects. The young man can do whatever the old man has not lived. He can be happy with the woman. The finish is exceptional. There is a ship wreck. The only survivors are the heroes of the "Three colors". The man and the woman finally meet. The scene lasts a few seconds. The woman there resembles the photo she took for an announcement at the beginning of the film, sad in a red affection. "But every beginning is just continuing. The book of life is open in the middle".
