Not since Bette Davis' "Ex-Lady" of 1933 saw a movie that was much better than her star said! Most of the bum rap "Atoll K", a.k.a. "Utopia", a.k.a. "Robinson Crusoeland", a.k.a. "Escapade" has had over the years came from the horror stories Stan Laurel told of his production. Since he suffered a stroke during filming, death seemed to overheat to a great extent (from the first shot of two of them together you would never have imagined that Laurel had survived Hardy for eight years) and was later diagnosed with diabetes ( once he adjusted his diet he recovered his health as a result), you can understand why Laurel didn't think this movie was the most pleasant experience of her life. Yes, it is imperfect: the cost of production is obvious, the dubbing is horrible and Laurel and Hardy were too old to make the energetic brazenness of their greatest films. But it's still really fun, and the story of LÃ©o Joannon introduces elements of political satire (sometimes libertarian, sometimes communist) that one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians like Chaplin or Marx Brothers but never from Laurel and Hardy. The film deserves credit for being different (although its debt to Ealing Studios' classic "Passport to Pimlico", made just a year earlier, is fairly obvious) and to complement the comedy Laurel and Hardy in a rather different, rather angular context from whatever they had used before. This is not a great film, but it is certainly better than the eight dark ones for Fox and MGM they made in the early 1940s. I only suspect that the technical crudity of the film has prevented him from gaining the cult that followed among the young anti-establishment baby-boomers of the "Duck Soup" of the Marx Brothers purchased in the late 60s / early 70s.
