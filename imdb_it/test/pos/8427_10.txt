I finally found a version of Persuasion that I like! Anne does not look like a scullery maid in this version, just a skinny, elderly, pretty woman, just as described in the book. Captain Wentworth does not appear to be 50, nor does he seem perpetually angry, but rather, as described in the book, he has not aged like Anne and is quite handsome. And they interpret their parts with such conviction and realism ... this is what it means to act. They were credible. They created real characters, and it was like the characters in the book came to life. If you have not seen this version, I urge you to look for it, order it or request it from a library or library, if necessary. Worth the price and worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I saw the 1995 version and the 2007 version and it haunts the other two. Because it is not rated higher it is beyond my comprehension. The book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this film brings the book to life.
