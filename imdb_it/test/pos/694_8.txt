The submarine used was NOT Varangian! It was in fact made up of two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng in Barrow-in-Furness but kept under control by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was delivered in 1945. <br /> <br /> The confusion certainly arose because someone looked for P61 (as I did) and found the Varangian! In fact, the last digit of both the P614 and the P615 was in fact just painted .... <br /> <br /> There are some extremely realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S class. Since no S-class submarines survive, the shots of them (such as P61) and of the "Forth" deposit ship are part of an interesting record now, in addition to an excellent film.
