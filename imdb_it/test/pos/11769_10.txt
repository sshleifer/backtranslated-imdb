what a great big movie, so many beautiful roles of some random stars. Basically there are these growers who get involved in a comic adventure. In points the film makes you believe that everyone will end up dying! Which adds to the comedy. When the character of John Lithgow (3rd Rock) reappears - it is impossible not to imagine the journey, this could have caused, as a total paradox. The film is full of twists that make you guess all the way. Billy Bob Thornton Astronaut Farmer) is brilliant, in fact, looking back, the character is quite similar in the fact that he holds the family of growers together. Everyone involved in this movie should have a nice thumb up. <br /> <br /> As I say, the final scene is a dream; still a nightmare at the same time. I like it when Hank Azaria (carter) says that in the end you think we should do it every year? I felt the same desire that they wanted. <br /> <br /> I am not going to say that this film is good for everyone, but as a lover of stoner movies, I give it a 10/10. - My advice has a joint preparation; relax and have fun!
