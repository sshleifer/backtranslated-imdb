This is one of my personal favorites, a rare little gem that seems not to be discovered by the general population. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson form the heart of the piece in what is a well-chosen cast. Few films have ever captured the true hostility that characterized the Civil War, but this seems to capture all the right tones and moods. If you're a fan of the book, Cold Mountain, try this movie and see if you don't think it's a good companion.
