A pleasant and pleasant film full of Mediterranean landscapes (Kefalonia is a beautiful Greek island) that maintains many of the novel's characteristics. I think the Greek scenarios add something special and magical to a film. One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the main characters, like "Mandras" and Pelagia's father were not Greek but foreign actors. I mean, the actors tried to express the Greek way of life, but for me they didn't succeed and it was pretty clear. Even their pronunciation when they tried to use Greek words was terrible and this was not good for the plot of the film. Irene Papas was really great in her role, a typical example of a mother, who lives on an island during the 1940s, who lost her husband and tries to live a child alone. Even John Hurt, father of Pelagia, played great. It reminded me of a Greek in many of his reactions.
