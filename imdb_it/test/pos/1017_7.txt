There is a lot to appreciate in this film, despite the humble traps of a PC story about rape and the criminal who is always better than the victim. The film has created quite a bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding those who were sending the notes. (I, for example, was sure that he was the teacher, indeed, he would have been more likely on the plan because the idea of ​​the best friend's boy-friend came out of nowhere. That "rape is omnipresent, one never knows who Sara"). Mrs. Beller is as bright as ever (yet see the KB discussion forum for my qualification of this statement). Like all sermon films, the plot lasts 15 minutes after the climax, so you might want to stop looking at that point. Unless you're really curious about what happens to Phillip. Blythe Danner, like her mother, is in the role in which she was born to play: the irritable and overprotective mother. Some good scenes from the 70s for 70s fans. (The dark bar to which the father goes to drink away his pain is all stained with dark beams, barrels, oak and cork). A must for Beller fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s melodrama or 70s kitsch in general.
