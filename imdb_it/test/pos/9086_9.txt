I can't get much more than Flatliner. This deep and dark film has filled my heart. The lighting is dark and will make you want to live an experience of defying death, literally. Keifer is in very good shape as he is today. He is a great actor and plays a very convincing and shocking role that you will not forget for years to come. And what can you say for the rest of the cast? An all-star formation, Julia is more exciting than ever, Will, Oliver and Kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep you hooked on your seats. It's a refreshing sight to see a real thriller, with first-rate professional actors. You won't regret seeing this bender for 2 hours. -JL
