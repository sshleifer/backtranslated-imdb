I captured this little gem totally by accident in 1980 or 1981. I was in a revival theater to see two old fool sci-fi movies. The theater was packed and (without warning) they showed a lot of sci-fi nonsense (to make us want to). Most were pretty funny but THIS one came and, in a few seconds, the audience was in hysterics! The biggest laugh came when they showed "Princess Laia" which had huge cinnamon buns instead of head hair. He looks at the camera, smiles darkly and nods. This made it even more fun! You have to see "Chewabacca" played by what looks like a Muppet! He was extremely silly and stupid ... but I couldn't stop laughing. Most of the dialogue has been stifled due to all the laughter. Also, if you know "Star Wars" pretty well it's even more fun - deliberately making fun of some of the dialogues. This REALLY works with an audience! A definite 10!
