As few people I know, I arrived late on "Stingers"; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way to miss an episode. The show is really so beautiful and, for a better word, it has maintained its integrity, unlike "Blue Heelers", for example. Crime is the thing; personal lives are there, but they have been put out of the way only when they have influenced an investigation! When Gary Sweet got involved, some fans seemed worried, but he is really well placed, which didn't surprise me. Gary could measure up to any British or US actor in a similar series. The cast changes occasionally, but every change brings something new and fresh. "With Stingers", undoubtedly the best Australian crew behind the scenes, will continue to remain a cutting-edge drama series.
