Of all 48 Brigitte Bardot films, "Une Parisienne" is widely considered (one of) the best. What we see is special: for once the plot has a value of its own, it does much more than provide an economic vehicle for the appearance of BB against sex. <br /> <br /> This film is your true and well-worked - a light comedy, with a good and consistent story. Set in French government circles in the late 1950s, it hosts from beginning to end. Providing many fun twists and turns of scene and some slapstick - all recited by at least three protagonists, including Bardot. <br /> <br /> "Une Parisienne" (= French for "female inhabitant of Paris") focuses on telling a story, not that of showing Brigitte Bardot. Brigitte serves the plot very well using her talent for acting in light comedies. <br /> <br /> When you settle for your sofa on Friday night, tired and tired from a week of slavery, just turn on "Une parisienne". This movie will make you feel better.
