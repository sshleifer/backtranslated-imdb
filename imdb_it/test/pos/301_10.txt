Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance, openness and progressiveness among the studies that allowed the making of important films by some of the best directors that the United States ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (some are the violent death of important figures of the American political and cultural scenes, the racial struggles, the emergence of the counterculture of the 1960s, the increase in violence and death in the streets ...) seemed to influence the vision of directors who were willing to dare, be different and create fun and intelligent films. Coppola's film is a strange mixture of humanistic thought and skillful film making, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life, the reason for death, or the war ethics. It is also a passionate work, made against all odds, told in the 1991 documentary "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse"; a film that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam War to reach the screen. This may not be the definitive Vietnam film, but in dealing with it Coppola challenged the classic melodrama formula found in two Vietnamese films made simultaneously, "The Deer Hunter" and "Coming Home", or in the latter as "Platoon" and "Casualties" of War ", before Vietnam became the starting point for making products of any kind, such as horror in" Jacob's Ladder ", or comedies like" Good Morning, Vietnam ", among the most respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background for a search for answers to the questions that every man must face every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.
