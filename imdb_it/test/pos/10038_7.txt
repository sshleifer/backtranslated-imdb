Of course, along with everyone else, I was ready to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THE HOMED OF THE HEAD BOOTS ON on the legend of Custer. Just having someone like Errol Flynn plays Custer is a clue that the legend takes precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations have come true (in a really inspiring and fun way). <br /> <br /> And yet, even in this clearly (and much criticized) rhetoric of Custer's history, I was struck by some of the points made in this film that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counteract the typical clich√©s of manifest destiny and unpainted heroism that are usually found in 20th-century westerns. <br /> <br /> For example, although this film attempted to whiten its hero, some scenes still suggested the most imperfect and insane character of Custer's real life: <br /> <br /> 1) His initial entry to the West Point gate, where his arrogance and pomposity is a clear aspect of his character. <br /> <br /> 2) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's unpredictability as to the needs of military service like any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point, where he looks absolutely stupid. <br /> <br /> 3) The promotion of Custer a General does not only appear as a ridiculous mistake, but takes place as a slapstick comedy. I almost expected to see the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello enter the scene. <br /> <br /> 4) Custer's position against Jeb Stuart in Gettysburg is not whitened as a brilliant military tactical leadership, but presented as reckless and wildly. <br /> <br /> 5) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored. <br /> <br /> And although the music and some of the ways in which the Indians were shown in this film were certainly the reinforcements of the racist stereotype of wild ignorance, it still surprises me that the film actually deepened the which is why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and quite explicitly blamed the battles in the Black Hills exactly at the foot of the white man. Indeed, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils who make the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Of course, that part of the story is true, but I didn't expect to see it portrayed so unmistakably in a film like this. <br /> <br /> And another thing: usually in these films are the Indians who are depicted en masse as drunken animals apparently incapable of common sense to avoid drunk dropping every time they approach alcohol. In this film, they are actually 7th Cavalry troops, not Indians, who are portrayed in this way in at least two scenes. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film slips into some surprising moments in the middle of the Hollywood bunk.
