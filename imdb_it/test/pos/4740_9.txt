There have been many documentaries I've seen where the law appeared to be on the wrong side of the fence - The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind first of all. But this is the first film that made me boil with anger after seeing it. It seems clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened to Waco was at least an unprofessional and sloppy disorder by the FBI and AFI, and at worst a murder. Like most people, when the siege of Waco was taking place, I assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil fool who led a violent cult. After seeing this, I think Koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused boy who inadvertently caught the attention of the US government through his eccentric actions. Of course, there were many weapons in the Davidian complex. But none of this was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video of the people inside the complex, all of whom looked very beautiful and harmless. And it was irritating to see the insensitive testimony of the men in charge of government forces on the Waco site, Janet Reno's untested testimony and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco, a defense led by some members of the democratic committee. I stood out for the most part in the role of NY representative and current US NY senator Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I lived in New York - I'm a Democrat, rather inclined to the left. After seeing his actions in this committee, I wish I could go back in time and vote for D'Amato instead! For anyone remotely interested in the government, this is a very important film, a must see. I also think this should be shown in the classes - it's so important.
