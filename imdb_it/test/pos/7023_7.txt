Jennifer Gray seems the most unlikely of romantic leads and this is probably why this beloved film is such a success. He is doing a great version of Montagus and Capulet with sweeteners like dancers and schadenfreude - it triggers the trophies of the society's Jewish society thrown in but there is usually an X factor. <br /> <br /> Swayze probably makes this movie confident with his robust and post-Travolta moves and temperament, but he was captivated by this Penelope Pitstop embroidered teen that brings the dream within the reach of the impressionable market. The super soundtrack (dated "perhaps" immortalized ") helps and, of course, the cunning to set the film in a resort far from everyday life, wholly refined fantasy. 7/10
