Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a disgruntled teenager who apparently killed a severely retarded peer, the brother of a girl he dated. The problem is not whether he did it or not ?? Leland admits, right away? but rather, why. Interestingly, rather than a criminal drama, Leland becomes a character story, examining why people do what they do ?? it is not necessarily the easiest terrain to follow. <br /> <br /> And Leland offers the independent group of messy people. Apart from the title character, there is also Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is his teacher at the juvenile penitentiary institution and who immediately sees that Leland is different. We meet Leland's distant and selfish father (Kevin Spacey in a long cameo), who never seems to be excited by what his son did. But the real flavors come out when we dive into the Pollards, the family of the retarded child. First, there's Leland's girlfriend, Becky (Jena Malone), a drug addict who can't keep herself clean; his sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most normal person in the film, who simply tries to get away from it all; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with Pollard and is Julie's boyfriend. Finally, there's Ryan (Michael Welch), who everyone else calls goofball, who can't communicate and barely seems aware of his surroundings. <br /> <br /> Leland focuses mainly on his eponymous protagonist, but the film slowly ?? sometimes too slowly ?? digging into everyone's life, asking the main question, why do people do what they do? While Leland openly discusses it in a magazine that Pearl allows him to maintain, examining the notions of good and bad and personal responsibility, all the characters at a certain point in the film face a moment in which they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or another, perhaps the most basic choice that any human can make. And the film takes a good look at what happens in these choices and the consequences of them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, you are simply struck by the depth of the cast. Spacey. Cheadle. Gosling. Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein ?? these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they find themselves in, and putting them all together creates a fiery enthusiasm. For a space in the middle the film seems to stall, spitting as it unfolds; it seems a bit like being content with simply asking questions and not giving any answers. But when we get to the lengthening of the house and the film starts to take its first steps and to unite, Leland becomes a silent and powerful piece. Leland's explanation of the world and its actions ultimately focuses on every story, and all the investment you've made in the film pays. <br /> <br /> To say that Ryan Gosling is excellent is like saying a sunny day is beautiful. At this point in your career is it redundant ?? this is one of the best young actors working today, and it is a pleasure to see him realize what could have been an unlikely character in a stimulating protagonist. Gosling employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems to play; he has to face most of the film in front of Don Cheadle, which we know has the assets, and not only holds his own, but also elevates the game of Cheadle. The same Cheadle is in top form, impregnating Pearl of a humanity in the round ?? for good and evil. Spacey is a kind of one-note, but this is the character, and he manages it excellently. I was surprised by Chris Klein; with this level of acting, I thought he would be buried in the mix, but he probably gives the turn of his career so far. Terrifying work all around. <br /> <br /> Leland is a bit ruinous, and again, it is ruined to say the least. But it ends with strength and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer (on this, anyway). There is also a subtle commentary on racism in the film (on the first day of Leland in the youth class, she is the only white person in the room) who, like most of the film, is managed very effectively. Wouldn't I go so far as to call this view required ?? some may find it too slow or too weird ?? but I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in a while, much stronger and more satisfying than most. Would I recommend it ?? with the caveats above ?? if only to see Gosling further perfect his trade.
