Maybe once in a generation comes a movie that is perfection. For me, "The Railway Children" is that film - a timeless classic that has been directed and performed excellently. It describes all that is useful to humanity and the climax in the conquest of love and faith for cruel injustice. Every show is a gem, even if Bobbie stands out and, like Judy Garland as Dorothy before her, Jenny Agutter makes it impossible for us to imagine someone else in the role. <br /> <br /> The world is the best for this film and today's children would be much better at watching it. <br /> <br /> Of course, like so many young people of my generation, I fell hopelessly in love with Jenny Agutter and her grip was strong when I had the great fortune to meet her a few days ago - the bewitching smile and voice as the dripping honey were still there to send me weak to the knees like they did all those years before!
