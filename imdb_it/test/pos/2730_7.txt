I must say it was a disappointment. Overall, it's nice to see how Aparna Sen handled the issue of schizophrenia, I'm not very knowledgeable about this and I got everything that was portrayed in A Beautiful Mind, and its interesting portrait here too. <br /> <br /> But the thing that caused the disappointment for me was artificial dialogue and excessive use of English. It is true that a new class is being formed / formed in India, which also speaks English at home, but I'm sure it's not as formal as in the movie. Furthermore, Waheeda Rehmaan didn't seem very comfortable talking everything in English. Charu's dialogue in the Bihari tone was apparently much more realistic and digestible. <br /> <br /> The second thing concerns the abstract taste that he tried to give to the film. Generally I like movies with an open ending, but there were a lot of pending points here. His cut pieces are joined together to make the film. Also there didn't seem to be any central theme in the film. Schizophernia for sure was the main line but she was mixing sister-sister, mother-daughter, adding doctor-azmi report, no real use of her brother, Bose - Bose's wife's reports ... they weren't all obligatory and they were losing attention to the public In reality, he tried to represent. <br /> <br /> Overall, a watch for people who like off-beat movies, absolutely to be avoided for those who only see movies as an entertainment tool.
