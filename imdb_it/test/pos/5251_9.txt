Reading some of the other comments, I must admit that some of the (few) shortcomings found in this brilliant documentary on one of the 20th century divas (up there with Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Mercedes de Sosa) are justified. Because initially this was a television documentary of over 6 hours on his career ("ESTRANHA FORMA DE VIDA" (V) 1995/1999). Much more comprehensive and with a greater understanding of the inner world of Amalia. As for the subtitling of his songs, they're all right! Although music, voice and performance can be - I am! - universal, there is so much poetry in words that beg only to be translated. I think this was a conscious choice on the part of the producers. They aimed at the 200 million Portuguese in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, East Timor, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Canada, United States, South Africa, San Tom√© and Principe, Goa, Daman, Diu, Venezuela, Luxembourg, Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora worldwide. As for the Lady herself, she did not survive to see this particular abbreviated DVD version of the documentary, but was given a preview of "Estranha Forma de Vida". And it seems to have been to his liking. So much.
