Claudine is a film that is the representation of the American system at its worst. The welfare system was initially set up as a springboard for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet. The film showed an accurate portrait of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit. In other words, if the father or a male figure is in the lives of women and children, their financial support from the system would be compromised if it were not resolved. The struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world. I'd like to see a reproduction of this film in stores for everyone to rent or buy for their library collection.
