this is a movie for teenagers and while you watch it you expect some senseless things added here and there, but overall the film is very effective effectively makes you question and lets you think that the story is rather unlikely but credible and makes you feel good sequences, it's not like the usual journey done and tried. the characters are quite well defined and convincing. Justin distinguishes himself from everyone else and pays attention to his speeches, eventually convincing anyone with that speech that is simply brilliant in that speech. he needs to take on more serious roles, it is worth more than teen movies. engrave this movie and break free
