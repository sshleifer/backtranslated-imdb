Story of three eclipses (maybe even Indigo, ha) that begin their love for murder. Oh, and the people who are "hot" on their trail. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday, a rather mediocre title for the film, was a nice surprise. I did not expect in any way a film about bloodthirsty psychopathic children. And I can say that it's also one of the best movies I've seen with kids like bad guys. At the end of the film I seriously wanted these children to die horribly. <br /> <br /> It's a really solid horror movie from the 80s, but how these guys manage to get away with all this chaos and murder is just something you can't help thinking. Even the slightest clue could easily uncover these lilsh! Ts like murderers. But it looks like there's only a couple of cops in the city, well, in the end, just one, and he looked like an idiot, so I guess they could make it. Haha, yes, and I'm a Chinese jet pilot. <br /> <br /> However, this film delivered some wicked kids who were more than funny, lots of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage. No kiddin! If you are discouraged by the less than stellar title, throw it out of your mind and give this shot a shot. It is a highly recommendable and undervalued 80s horror film.
