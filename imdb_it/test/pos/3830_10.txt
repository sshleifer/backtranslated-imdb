I didn't realize how much of this episode was taken from The Enemy Below until I finally saw the movie (it has since become my favorite war movie). There were also a couple of items raised by Run Silent Run Deep. Nothing wrong with stealing ideas, as long as you do something nice with them. And the boy did Roddenberry and the company did something nice with this. <br /> <br /> The story begins when the Romulans violate a 100-year treaty and crossing the neutral zone and destroying a series of Federation outposts along the area ostensibly to test their upper armory and invisibility screen ( and the subsequent change of balance between the Romulans and the Federation, in their view, as a prelude to a total invasion. Kirk must decide whether it is worth risking war to try to stop the Romulan ship, or if in reality the biggest risk is to let the invaders go after destroying 4 military outposts. Kirk chooses the latter wisely. <br /> <br /> This is our first look at an enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, a warrior race, but in their own way honored, far from the relatives of the Vulcans. However, unlike the peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not give up their emotions and their violent and imperialist ways, even if they advanced technologically. <br /> <br /> None of this concerns Mr. Stiles, the ship's navigator and the leader of this antagonistic episode aboard the company (the Romulan commander has his problems with a junior gung-ho officer). All that matters to him is that he hates Romulans and Spock looks like one ... until the end when Spock saves his life (of course). This contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the Romulan commander, none of whom has any personal ill will towards the other. Both men are simply doing their duty. Indeed there is mutual respect. This is the first episode of Trek that directly addresses the prejudice, and does so skillfully (as opposed to the not too subtle 3 season "Let it be your last battlefield"). <br /> <br /> Like The Enemy Below, we have a classic chess game between two ship commanders that are actually very similar. You immediately see that both these captains are good ... ALL good. If you went into battle, you will want one of these men to be your boss. Both are honest and respectable men who have a duty. Yet even if the Romulan commander is bound to his native world, he still finds himself desiring destruction before he can return home rather than start another interstellar war. Yet he still does everything he can to get home, just as Kirk does everything he can to stop it. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, one of Trek's top 5. He has everything: a lot of action, suspense, great dialogue, acting (I still keep the Romulan Commander was the best role of Mark Lenard's Trek), and he manages to make his social comment without being overly preacher. Too bad Roddenberry forgot the last part when he did TNG. <br /> <br /> Watch this episode, then watch The Enemy Below.
