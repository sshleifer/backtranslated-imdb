Two great stars and a legendary director have created a magnificent throbbing love story that is memorable and moves on so many levels. <br /> <br /> Henry King directed Jennifer Jones in his first hit, Song of Bernadette, and still directs Jennifer Jones in this film and Miss Jones are perfect in this role and give a sharp and beautiful performance that captures the conflict in the character and Bill Holden who hit home after the home race in the 1950s with a series of hit movies starting with Sunset Blvd, Stalag 17, Born Yesterday, Country Girl, Picnic, and of course River Kwai is superb in this role. Easy to imagine that, apart from Holden, in this film I loved the ending and I cry every time I see it. For anyone who has ever loved and lost, you will understand. For those who haven't, you won't.
