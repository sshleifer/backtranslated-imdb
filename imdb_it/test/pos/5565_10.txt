I have to tell you that I've been a Star Trek TNG fan since I was a kid. <br /> <br /> Well, some time ago I gave some of my friends some DS9 episodes and asked them <br /> <br /> "Hey man, what are you watching lately because I've finished watching all the episodes from TNG "he said. "Well, I have these Farscape episodes". I said, "Ok, let me try." I was pretty sure at that moment that I didn't like it because I had just finished watching TNG and found it fantastic. "<br /> <br /> I had 3 episodes, given those, but the show didn't impress me much, I found it initially childish and I thought it was just another TV show, beautiful but regular adventures. the special effects were a little different though and I had the vague impression that the actors did not fully enter the skin of the characters. <br /> <br /> I saw 3 other episodes thinking that 3 eps was not enough to decide whether I liked it or not since then. Then the show started catching me, I had a good command of the action and I wanted to see what happened next to poor Crichton ... the rest is history. <br /> <br / > I think I especially like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action unlike Star Trek where everyone slept when they should have done and too much technological shit. <br /> <br /> The show improved with each episode, very interesting s tory line ..... what can i say, this movie it's like poetry. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it !!!
