This film was original in a non-original way. Although many films have dealt with the topic of suicide and mental institutions, it has always been about treating patients and making them better thanks to the assistance of the doctor, in this film, however, we follow a depressed boy who falls in love with a suicidal girl and she will stop at nothing to make her happy even if she doesn't care about happiness at all, she just wants to die. This was a very interesting romantic comedy that was nothing but pleasant. It's fun to check if you have the chance, you just have to have an open mind about the material. Overall, I gave him a 6.4, I just voted 9 to get the highest score :)
