I'm not sure these other people saw the movie - some apparently couldn't follow the "complicated storyline". It's a billionaire who owns an oil company that EVEN happens to big game - wow - it's really far-fetched. Anyway - his new "puncher" breaks through a glacier and on the other side there is a world separated from our time in which dinosaurs and cavemen roam around. Nothing bad, but certainly not ridiculous. However the rest of the film is about this T-Rex found (which the billionaire, Boone, claimed to be there) chasing them and them looking for him. Look - it's an old TV movie - obviously the special effects seem shoddy - they didn't have CG - they did the best they could and for an MFTVM they did an incredible job for the time. This film should be redone for the big screen: I would love it and be the first in line. Seeing that dinosaur with the special effects of today that haunt those guys would be great!
