Okay, so I read most of the reviews on this film, as well as the comments left by visitors to this site, and the feeling I get is that most people who wrote reviews didn't like this movie. That's why I'm writing now - I represent the minority because, I did it. I admit, I went to see the movie because I'm very impressed with the irresistible abilities of Ryan Gosling, and the projects he was part of lately were nothing less than incredible. He's a fantastic actor. Apart from that, I wanted to see this film because it seemed intriguing ... why? Because it's a whodunit where you know "whodunit" from the beginning, and it's quite unusual. <br /> <br /> As the plot progresses, two guys try to commit the "perfect crime" because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only by committing crimes are truly free human beings - the uninhibited, and remember, without guilt, which acts on its own will. The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, he alluded to homosexuality and was brilliantly played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was the manipulator, who controlled the good talker, and Pitt was the extremely shrewd outcast from the book and socially embarrassing. Enter the character of Sandra Bullock, which seems that most people don't particularly value. I think when people see that you are the executive producer, they automatically assume that every role the actor has in it is a thing of self-glorification. I didn't see it as the case here. Without the personal story of "Cassie" on the ex-husband who almost killed her, who, not surprisingly, shared similar traits with Richard Hayward, would never have pursued his instincts about Justin and Richard. The case was apparently hermetic against Ray, the unsuspected school janitor and friend of the boys. Even when the boys are questioned towards the end of the film neither Bullock nor his partner have much evidence of them apart from the fact that they lied about knowing each other, and Justin's vomit disappeared from view. Here lies the genius of the film because the philosophy that the boys were trying to demonstrate through the act of killing, acting without sense of will as "true freedom", ended up working against Justin, who ended up having a conscience after all (and ended up leaving part of his consciousness to the discharge site of the body). Without that crucial test, they almost had a "murder by number". And to the readers out there who baffled the title as much as I did, I looked inside and discovered that something done "by number" (like a painting) suggests careful and critical and challenging planning. There's also a Sting song called "Murder By Numbers", but that's beyond the point. :) <br /> <br /> Many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between Cassie and her partner, but I think that really meant showing how cynical and manipulative she was because of her story. Like it or not, his story plays an important role in this film because without it, he probably would never have followed his instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a bit of a clich√© "despised women, a woman who performs revenge in every facet of her life", but I think that without the depth of Cassie's character you only have another movie about teenage killers, and may have gotten away with it. There is no film there. <br /> <br /> And to the reader who commented that the boys obviously did not commit the perfect crime because the police were close to them from the start, I can remind you that the reason was because of the specially positioned and totally traceable. The boys wanted to get involved: it was a game. They were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first-hand the difficulty that investigators would have in finding out what they think is the truth. What they didn't expect was that Cassie Mayweather had a case of hyperactive instinct at her side. A little unbelievable? Could be. But many crimes were solved by police officers who followed their instincts. However, this is a FILM! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in theaters about three times, and each time it revealed a little more, and I liked it a little more. The more I looked at him, the more fascinated and frightened I was by the psychological depth of Richard Hayward - there are people like that. My main complaint about the film is that they should have had the interactions of Justin and Richard a little more central (because, let's face it, there are the intrigues of the whole film) and my main props go to characterization: each character was very distinct and interesting in its own way. He was very well played, although I would have given the character of Ben Chaplin a little more depth to work with (he is a good actor) and maybe he resized Bullock's character a little badly. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should keep it clear that for a Hitchcock type thriller like this it basically tells you the "whodunit" at the beginning, it represents a very big challenge for writers to keep the audience's attention until the end. I think they did quite well using a few twists, slowly revealing the different dynamics of the characters and lighting up the screen with some really exciting performances by young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. I think that if we remove our innate cynicism and try to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are, we might be able to look beyond any apparent hole in the plot and see the real consistency and quality of this film, if not in the characters which have been brilliantly portrayed. Especially Richard Hayward. Not that I'm blamed. :)
