For unknown reasons this beautiful masterpiece has not gained the deserved recognition and has been widely underestimated by many American film critics. So it's easy to understand that I've encountered many problems trying to find this movie. In the end I looked at it and it was so beautiful, sincere and touching that for the first time in my life I watched a movie five times in a week after getting the tape. The story centers on the friendship between two young Erik and Dexter, aged eleven and twelve, very different from each other but who are becoming the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the Cure as sincere and natural as it has never been before. There are so many beautiful, heartfelt and touching scenes (especially on the river), which strike the heart and cannot leave them any indifferent humans. The film is also full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism, (particularly strong with Erik's shoe) which also greatly increases the visual impression of such a beautiful work. The story, written by Robert Kuhn, is well written and unlike the vast majority of modern Hollywood products practically every scene, every sentence and every sentence in the film is meaningful and brings something important about the characters and the relationships between them. Peter Horton, who as I knew had not had important experiences in film directing, showed his great abilities and talents in this field. The cinematography is superb even with perfectly selected locations for the film, but the most important is the perfect acting, which with all the above mentioned makes The Cure one of the best films ever. Both Brad Renfro and Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter have created a wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificence between two main characters. Only one of these films (I haven't seen most of their other works) is enough to name them one of the best actors of their generation. Annabelle Sciorra also offers a formidable interpretation of Dexter's mother. It is terribly sad that such talented actors have not achieved great recognition, while numerous overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and enormous salaries. Finally, it would be unfair not to mention the incredible soundtrack written by David Grusin, and the amazing Mark Cohn song (one of the best songs I've ever heard in movies) My Great Escape. So all I can say about The Cure is a simple word ?? great. In every point of view this film is a beautiful work, felt and stimulating of all the people involved in the creation of this masterpiece. I have to give credit to all those people who have put their heart and soul into the film and into Universal Pictures, which has found a way to make such a beautiful film among the many formidable commercial projects. But such a rare film often comes to cinemas, which very often the studios themselves do not realize what gem they did and are unable to provide a respective marketing campaign. The only small inconvenience of The Cure for me is its short duration (only 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I don't want to write more about the film because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words, so if you have any opportunity to watch The Cure, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. I'm sorry for my bad English.
