My husband and I attended last night ... It was wonderful ... For once, he was wrong to guess the suspense ending in advance. It moved very fast and the acting was superb. I love Tom Wilkinson anyway. As for me, he never made a bad movie. The previous description of his acting hits the nail on the head ... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is fantastic. We have just finished watching the entire Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the public. There is no doubt that I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to get a few hours of complete entertainment.
