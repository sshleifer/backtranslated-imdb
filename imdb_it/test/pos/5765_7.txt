bottom to its utmost absolute perfection. who ever says that the slap comedy is dead and boring is completely wrong. not that this film will appeal only to those who are male in nature. this is another British quality dark comedy with many jokes not related to violence, but it helps if you can let go of your senses and laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all. <br /> <br /> this is a true example of prosperity. British ingenuity and our national talent hit them. at the performance level it reminds me a lot of the early works of the marx brothers, where the same level of enthusiasm and devotion is present in their acting styles, giving life to a performance in which the audience can really involve the innate human desire to see others suffer, still to be detached and still feel safe, just like the principle on which many television chat shows operate. a truly wonderful manipulation that leaves all parties feeling better.
