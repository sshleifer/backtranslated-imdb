Finally a real horror movie. This is the first time in years that I have had to cover my eyes. I'm a horror fan and I recommend this movie, but it's pretty gory. I'm not a big fan of wrestling, but Kane really brought out the whole monster. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me, but I'm very glad I did. During and after the film, I looked over my shoulder. I have to agree with the others on the entire horror movie of the remake, it's enough. I think this is why this movie is getting some good reviews. It's a refreshing change and brings you back to The Texas Chainsaw (the first), Michael Myers and Jason. And no CGI crap.
