Video Vault by Shawn K. Inlow <br /> <br /> My architect: A Son's Journey 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not Rated: 116 minutes Vault Rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What to be fatherless. "My architect: A Son's Journey" follows the Philadelphia director, Nathaniel Kahn, as he desperately searches for the answers of his father, the famous architect, Louis I. Kahn, who died in these 30 years. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn died in a train station in 1974 and left behind more than one family. The funeral service, when the director was just a boy, was, let's say, an unpleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> We discover that Nathaniel knew his father only from passers-by, from his sporadic visits with his mother, who, we were told, loved deeply. This film is about a boy who looks for his father and perhaps himself by visiting his work, as if the magnificent structures kept a secret. <br /> <br /> To be sure, Louis Kahn was a gifted architect, but "architect" is a cold word. The man was a large-scale sculptor who spoke of his craft in airy terms of silence and art. <br /> <br /> Among his noteworthy works, lovingly explored in the film, are the Salk Institute (1965), The Kimball Art Museum (1972) and the monumental Capitol building in Bangladesh (1983). The part of the film where Nathaniel first visits Dhaka, in Bangladesh, finds work, but not man. <br /> <br /> The film benefits greatly from having many shots of a very public man while working in New York City and as a professor at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. Many of Khan's contemporaries and collaborators also help shape the filmmaker's ghost father. <br /> <br /> Even so, the viewer does not seem to arrive at a particularly satisfying place. The answers that Nathaniel Khan is looking for seem empty. Not good enough. <br /> <br /> In the scenes in which the director meets his stepsisters, both coming from different mothers, one can feel the tensions of the years, the offenses and the wounds. One might expect them to burst into anger, but only the camera saves them from hostility. Each of these children has visibly lost something. <br /> <br /> It could be noted that Khan, who seemed a perfectionist driven, never became rich. Instead, it has become noteworthy. It was as if he had sacrificed his family for his art. This is a tremendously sad and wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> April 28th 2005
