OK, it's easy not to confuse this with the Stuart Gordon film, whose name is "The Bed That Eats", released a few years ago. And how do I begin to describe it? Well, to begin with, of course there is a bed that eats. This is the result of tears of demons, which obviously influence most things, I suppose, in a negative sense. The bed is in some quarters of an old servant or something, and he was responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people at the time. We have a narrator, who is a ghost who sits in the wall behind a painting and collects all the inedible sweets (jewels, etc.) that the bed transmits. He died of consumption, one of the few people to lie in the bed that was not eaten, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, while we see him hack blood in hankie ..... yuck. The thing about this film is that it has a bizarre sense of humor, but it's all rather impassive. The film is divided into several "acts", I imagine, "Breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert only". For the unfathomably bizarre and bizarre fans, well, this could be just your alley. All I can say is that you have to see this to believe it, it's quite difficult to describe. 8 out of 10 stars.
