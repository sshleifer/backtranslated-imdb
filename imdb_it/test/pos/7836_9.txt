Forget some plaintive (and useless) comments left here by some. This series is well acted, well shot, and makes a refreshing change for most paps on TV. <br /> <br /> Any fool can mess up anything. However, in this show the characters are believable, intriguing and compelling (but require a certain intelligence on the part of the viewer), overall it's fun, and it's English !! (We occasionally make gems, and this is one of those). <br /> <br /> The shows last one hour each and I think there are four of them all together (at least I only saw four of them). The show clearly impressed some US television broadcasters / filmmakers who made a longer series that wasn't even remotely compelling despite the bigger budget. <br /> <br /> If you don't like or understand the eleventh hour like soaps and reality shows.
