I recently attended Sundance as I have often done in the past and have been treated to the small pleasures of small angular indies, the excess of dark comedies and the now predictable portraits of dysfunction. But then I saw "Northfork" by Mark and Michael Polish and I remembered why I fell in love with the movies in the first place. 'Northfork' spans the screen with visionary audacity and draws attention to the first works of Terence Malick and to the existential landscapes of Antonioni. It is a film that cannot be easily explained that is one of its many strengths. Suffice it to say that it is an adult fairy tale with many carefully stratified levels of meaning. It has awakened my imagination and cast an impressive shadow over all the other films I have seen this year. It is a work of meticulous craftsmanship and a refinement of writing that is not seen in most American films. I'm going to revisit this movie several times when it comes to my neighberhood theater. Because it is a fascinating piece of magic and mystery, an obsessive work where you can wander the plains of Montana in search of angels and the very nature of the sky and the earth. The cast plays this luminescent piece with extraordinary conviction, in particular James Woods and Nick Nolte, who remind us of the courage and audacity shown throughout their career. Perhaps 'Northfork' will help us find a new wave of American cinema where excellence in craftsmanship and writing becomes more the norm than the exception. Watch it when your way arrives and you take your friends because the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings spurred on seeing 'Northfork' will awaken the memories of the great film once seen in your past and now we hope it can come back with the advent of the Polish Brothers .
