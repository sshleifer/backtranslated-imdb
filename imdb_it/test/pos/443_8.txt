I've seen this movie three times in different periods of my life and I've always loved it. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre, like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical, but in French. And a Jean Renoir a nice tribute to his time, to his friends, lovers, music and dances. It is at the same time a chronicle of the show business of that age, full of affection and French mood. It is also a clear tribute to Impressionism (people who like Impressionist painters will appreciate this photo). In particular it is a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and, of course, to the father of Jean Renoir, Pierre-Auguste. You will find a faithful and splendid colorful recreation of some of Renoir's masterpieces. Excellent casting, set design, sound effects and music. Although he talks about the creation of the Moulin Rouge in Paris, obviously it's a science fiction story (and not entirely original by the way, since it falls within the well-known moral that the show must continue). But Jean Renoir's production is fantastic. <br /> <br />
