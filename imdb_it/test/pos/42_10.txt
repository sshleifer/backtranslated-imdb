This is one of those movies you don't want to end. The characters are as rich as a well-woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters attract you and tell a story of the people who lived in a pension during the decades of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young person is welcomed by a dynamic woman with a big heart who runs the house and these are stories based on her experiences. <br /> <br /> I couldn't believe it was a TV movie. It was so well executed. S. Epatha Merkerson is as wonderful as Tata and she brings so much life into this role. You want to be right there among his boarders. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie so much that I bought the DVD.
