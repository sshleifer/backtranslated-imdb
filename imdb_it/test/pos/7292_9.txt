I don't understand why critics can beat this movie. It's a movie for teenagers that is actually serious, which is a rarity. I must admit that there are moments that are enormously sweetened, but as regards young love, it must be sweetened to be valid. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. While it was fun in American Pie, apparently he's not ready for the move to an even more dramatic rate, it's very inconvenient to look at some of his "mom things". Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, demonstrate a considerable amount of depth and credibility, as do parents. Although the script is heavily clich√© with the lovers who emit poems, the actor makes it work. The director stages some powerful images on the screen. Beautiful photography, beautiful music, great young actors, I was impressed and I'm a worn-out critic when it comes to teen movies.
