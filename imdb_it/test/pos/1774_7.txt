This film was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters does an acceptable job as a pirate and does a decent job in his sword fights. (To the extent that he can have a double that does the action, it's hard to say ... but Peters himself is obviously doing quite a bit, and he does it well.) this could have been an excellent film but it is basically cheese. Still fun though. ++++ Not up to a film by Jacques Tournier, but definitely above a normal Jean Peters film. The color is typical of this time period of the 50s, that is to say. too flashy and unrealistic The actors for Blackbeard and his first officer and the drunken doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a little weak. I don't think Debra Paget was right either. But certainly Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two most beautiful female stars of the 50s.
