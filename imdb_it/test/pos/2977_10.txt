I was drawn to "Friends" from the soundtrack of a very young and still famous Elton John I had seen in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of ​​the emotions and the impact the film would have. I was recently taken back to the film by a song that Heart called "Seasons", then I found Elton John's song "Friends" thinking it was the same song ... it's been 35 years. However, the flow of emotions of "Friends" is back as if I saw an old photograph of your first true love. I have more memory of the way the film struck me than I did of the real details of the production, the plot, etc. So forgive me for a rather poor review. I remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to watch the movie and being so touched and eyes full of tears at the end. I am both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many movies that seemed so important to me (eg "The graduate" "Easy Rider") now seem just stupid and I don't want this to fall into the same category. But I'll find it and if it turns out to be silly, then at least I'll be able to turn my wife into a big ... no ... exceptional soundtrack. When we met, we talked about it with "Last Tango in Paris". The young people I work with (I am 56) respect my opinions but it is difficult to explain the feelings of the 60s, the films and the songs that reflect such strong feelings, but they seem a little "aged" now. I can't tell if the aging process is the film ... or me. "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful film. I'm sure I will bring back many special feelings. By any means, rent or buy a copy ... The Indians were not close to the strong kind of what they are today.
