I first saw The Couch Trip (1988) on television late night years ago and I immediately fell in love with it. The funny thing is that I usually catch all the comedies I made but I've never heard of it until I saw it. Dan Ackroyd is a simple and simple hilly period. He made a couple of fantastic films with Belushi and doesn't forget Saturday Night Live. But I think the Couch Trip is probably the best and most fun. With a cast of great help from Charles Grodin, David Clennon and Walter Matthau, this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. Ackroyd's wife, Donna Dixxon, also does a good job here. My favorite moments in the film involve Ackroyd and David Clennon's character, Lawrence Baird. Those two played well with each other. So, if you've never seen a good comedy, take a trip back in 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did it, Amazon 78 cents. What a deal, a pity struck me with a shipping fee of 2.50. Oh well, it's still worth it. Every guy will love this movie will check it out.
