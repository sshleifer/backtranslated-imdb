I really liked the Manna from Heaven. The hopes, dreams and perspectives of each of the characters are captivating and we, the public, know each of them, the warts and all the rest. And the ending was a fantastic, wonderful and uplifting surprise! Thanks for the experience; I look forward to learning more.
