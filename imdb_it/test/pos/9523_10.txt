For all of us American Deneuve fans, this little gem is a little hard to get. Fortunately, I found myself so wrapped up in the short bits that I saw on youtube.com that I was willing to do everything. I found it on ebay.com, I ordered it directly from France and I changed my laptop to play DVD Region 2. Let me tell you that it was worth it. Be careful: there are no subtitles (unfortunately, Pathe should not have published it on DVD, Koch Lorber should have - they are good with subtitles). I don't speak a word of French. I can pronounce a syllable here and there, order a drink and so on. That said, this film was still a real pleasure. I could not fully appreciate the alleged "obscene" humor or witty dialogue. Looking at Deneuve and his cohorts was enough for me. I understood what was happening without the need for dialogue. He really says something about a movie when those who can't speak the language like it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is wonderful. London is as adorable as the in-love son-in-law. I liked the lesbian mom. And of course, what can I say about our dear Miss Deneuve. She is one of a kind. Those eyes, that smile. I could watch his movies all day. She really goes beyond beauty. People always say it's wonderful. Well, yes, it is. But she is also VERY talented. I believed her every second of the way. His conversation about chocolate and vanilla with London is too sweet. His character is even arrested for smoking drugs with a 15-year-old on the street. NOT TO BE MISSED! Fly to France and buy this if you have to. Great. 10
