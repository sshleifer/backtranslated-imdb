Working the night shift at a squalid police station, stumbling into life in an alcoholic fog, Detective Mickey Hayden can hardly say he has a solid understanding of reality to begin with, but when a headshot triggers terrifying psychic visions, things they get really weird. Soon it's on the trail of a serial killer and reveals the mystery of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice. <br /> <br /> The role of a bitter burn-out seems tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and makes the most of it. The plot is typical of serial killer, but it has enough quirks, twists and real surprises to raise it above the usual genre stuff and even compensate for a painfully low budget. (One wonders what this film could have been if there had been money for some other rewriting and some other take.) <br /> <br /> All in all, "After Alice" is a pleasant diversion for anyone, but for the fan of the "Alice" books by Lewis Carroll, it's a real surprise. From the upside-down reality in which things rarely seem, to more obvious references - a killer called "The Jabberwocky", which leaves playing cards on the bodies of his victims - there is a reference to "Alice" at every turn. Below is a list of those I have discovered. Since finding them alone is fun, I've marked them as spoilers. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Cast of characters <br /> <br /> Mickey Mouse - In a sense he is himself wandering through strange landscapes, meeting strange characters, but Harvey, recognizing his true nature, he identifies him as the unfortunate and arrogant White Knight. <br /> <br /> John Hatter (head of Mickey) - Is he really "crazy"? You are the judge <br /> <br /> Claudette - An African-American transvestite. Obviously, the Black Queen <br /> <br /> Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her brutal nature suggests, more specifically, the Queen of Hearts. <br /> <br /> Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the killer of Jabberwocky, his ambiguous role is more indicative of a snark (or perhaps a boojum). <br /> <br /> Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to "wonderland" and his name, evocative of another famous film rabbit, makes me think that it must be the White Rabbit <br /> < br /> Dr. Vera Swann - His surname and his relationship with Mickey Mouse suggest the White Queen. <br /> <br /> Other links <br /> <br /> Mickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down from a (rabbit) hole. <br /> <br /> Mickey, drunk, tells his cat to stop him with a grin (Cheshire Cat) <br /> <br /> The killer is revealed "through the mirror". <br /> <br /> the climatic showdown ends in a flurry of playing cards, just like Alice's adventure in the book. <br /> <br /> The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
