I really enjoyed this short, even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and Narrator Roch Carrier perfectly captured all the boy's emotions. From the feelings he felt for his hero, Maurice "Rocket" Richard, to the excitement, anticipation and hope of soon getting a new Montreal Canadiens sweater, with the expression of horror on his face when he took the sweater his mother; A Toronto Maple Leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this terrible (in his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs sweater; Not the rouge, the bleu and the blanc of the Montreal Canadiens with Richard's number nine, like his old sweater. And worst of all, his mother made him wear this Maple Leafs sweater out of the house. You could imagine and anticipate the ridicule he would have from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got there. <br /> <br /> I was laughing all the time and this is one of the best animated shorts I've seen. <br /> <br />
