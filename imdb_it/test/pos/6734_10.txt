This film begins with all the lunatic promises of a great western contemporary noir - after the ill-conceived opening flashback sequence however. The scenery is wonderfully desolate, the characters painfully isolated. While some performances are less credible, the plot eventually offers enough tension and twists to make this film worthy of attention.
