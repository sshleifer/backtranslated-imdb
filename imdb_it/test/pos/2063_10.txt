This is a film that in no way reflects the real world. Nothing in this film has a sense of the real world or has a logic of the real world. It works entirely in his little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hate for this movie. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the beginning I bought the completely unreal premise of the stricken woman who regained her memory as the past returns to haunt her. There was a moment when I remember accepting that this would be one of those movies where the heroine wouldn't know anything until it was needed, despite all the logic that wouldn't have happened that way. "Oh it's one of those movies," I said to myself, and I was won over by the fact that the movie started for a two-hour chase. <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with brains and muscles, while things follow their own logic and you actually have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns. I like it a lot and I'm pleasantly surprised when I come across people who feel the same way. People love it or hate it, if they have ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, this is definitely a movie to try. You might not like it, but it's certainly worth discovering it <br /> <br /> And as always, it leaves reality at the door.
