If you are looking for a film that is fast and you don't get bored, then this is the right place. It's fast and fun with some decent acting from the characters. It is always difficult for me to see Mark Walhberg as if he were not Marky Mark. That image burned in my mind forever. As an actor, though, he's pretty good. This film is a must see for action fans who like to see some little twists. I'll have to pick up this movie one day and buy it.
