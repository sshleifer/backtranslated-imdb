This is a rather dark and stupid horror film set in the Everglades of the 70s. It's really stupid and lame for the first time, then actually starts to become good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a group of singing churches, I don't know. It's fascinating. I was impressed by the night scenes, because it actually felt like night, unlike most low-budget horror movies where it still looks like during the day. I feel like the director was really talented, but he was working with a tiny budget and a tough program. There are some scenes towards the end, the one mentioned above and also the end credits which are extremely interesting. This film could have been a true classic if it had abandoned Scooby Doo's conventions and gone straight to the throat. I was surprised how good this movie was. I couldn't take my eyes off it, and I had to ask myself "why?"
