Certainly this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patricia Arquette is what it is promoted to be: A TRUTH! This is undoubtedly his best acting moment and he certainly deserves the credit for his work. Never in any of her other films, with the possible exception of the Holy Matrimony, has she been totally credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Plot: A young woman finds herself in Southeast Asia and is suddenly thrown into the political chaos of the campaign. It is witness to mass murders, totalitarianisms and escapes. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you MUST see or haven't seen all the best in Hollywood. I rank 58 among the top 100 films of all time. <br /> <br /> Thanks Bob
