OSS 117 was fun from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to define why a film touches or connects with you or not, and I will not try to analyze such a perfect comedy, so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it :)! <br /> <br /> Everything is old-fashioned here, from the feminine dresses (sigh!), to the Mambo dance, to the "hero's song" ... ("Child" sounds like an Italian canzonetta sung in .. . Arabic :)!). <br /> <br /> Hubert is physically imposing, but mute as hell. From all 007 years, he looks like Sean Connery, but he is definitely more sympathetic because he is ... silly, he always talks with his mind, giggles, he even has homoerotic fantasies and there are rumors about him. In short, like an antihero, it splits :)! Sometimes he just raises his eyebrows or frowns, and that's all it takes to make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Bérénice Bejo is the true queen of the film. Pretty, treacherous but with ideals. Aure Atika, on the other hand, is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts. It's amazing to see her "sexy bomb", you. <br /> <br /> You can't really compare it to "Austin Powers"! I agree with d. Hartley of Amazon (Seattle, WA) on respect for gender. <br /> <br /> What is your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is the "chicken fight" with the evil masked. But the really perfect one is when he talks to the cocktail with his contacts, how everyone murmurs banalities with confidence ... This scene alone is worth for the comedy genre.
