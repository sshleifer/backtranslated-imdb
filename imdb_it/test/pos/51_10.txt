This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances by a wonderful A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and backs. <br /> <br /> I couldn't help but worry about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will leave you speechless, as will the young man who will play the young protagonist. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the set was of the highest level. The viewer is really positioned within each era as it is presented. <br /> <br /> Even the music is fantastic. Beautiful selections to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotyped but offers some great songs. <br /> <br /> This is a great story that will survive many repeated views. Take the time to watch it!
