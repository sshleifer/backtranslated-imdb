Opera murders are not real murders as much as they are symbols of past events and parts of Betty's own fractured personality. In fact, Betty is the same person (a male) that Suzy Bannion is in Suspiria, only a decade later in life (Suzy was a ten-year-old boy who made friends with another ten-year-old boy with a more delicate version of his same background). br /> <br /> Helps to think of Betty's luxurious apartment as a military barracks; She spends most of her time in her bedroom in bed next to her stereo, apparently, and other parts of her apartment seem strange to her, as if other people lived in those rooms. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento films synchronize with a wide range of Rock music, as well as Funk (Dario starts the syncs at the beginning of his films, the flash of the eye in Opera, and the beginning of a drum roll in Suspiria). There are also standard films with which Opera (and Suspiria) synchronize. For example, Opera synchronizes with a record album by Judas Priest called Priest ... Live (as well as Suspiria), and Suspiria synchronizes very well with a Kiss album titled Kiss Alive II. Movies like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Image and The Vampire Happening are films in Silver sync that deal with the same subject as the Silver films. These synchronizations, along with many others, reveal that Betty was a male who suffered from sexual torture at the hands of his father from birth (even in the womb according to a certain novel by Anne Rice entitled Lasher). <br /> <br /> large-budget films are occult works that transmit espionage information collected by occult means, all in a symbolic / alchemic synchronized way. Usually, the point of synchronization in a film is the beginning of the soundtrack, or it is the first image of the film beyond any lead-in of a film company. Sometimes it's more creative. The heavy metal music used in Opera and Phenomena are simply musical synchronizations that have been deciphered by other films with which the films of Argento synchronize, an intellectual game of sorts among the elite of the sector. <br /> <br /> So, Betty does not do it. I normally respond to the murders that testify because she never witnessed a murder of a real person. "She herself" simply suffers the murder of souls; she is witness to her own "murder"; the father of this individual almost dropped him on a well abandoned in Arizon at the age of 4, in 1970; he was about to fall off a wooden board on which his father balanced him before Dad changed his mind, grabbed him and tore him away from it; the child did not feel anything consciously. Memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual through extreme sexual repression, and the vague memories that remain are of the large, square, deep hole in the desert and no meaning is placed upon this memory due to the lack of conscious trauma (the " the loss of the trauma, "even a" buried trait ", is portrayed in the 1975 film The Image). Those sausages in the attic in Suspiria are every single memory of the first three years of life (Toys In The Attic). <br /> <br /> The reason why Betty (or Suzy) is a female character is because the individual mirrors of Christina Marsillach's character are a male who has been trained in a female role since birth (all DVDs of the Simpson cartoon synchronized with Suspiria), with its own nature that was modeled along "queen" lines (The X - File episodes synchronize with Opera). This has even altered his body to be "beautiful" in the way a woman is. Behavior alters genetics. A more recent film entitled Death Proof deals with the same ideas and the same individual. <br /> <br /> Practically all of this person's life is reflected in large films, record albums and books made since 1966, and father before 1966 and later. The Scorpions album entitled Virgin Killer is an album by Suspiria sync, the original album cover that serves as a mirror image symbolic of the fall through the skylight.
