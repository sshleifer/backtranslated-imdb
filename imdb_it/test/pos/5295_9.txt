It has been widely recognized that Hayao Miyazaki is a master of his trade when it comes to combining rich animations with brooding narrative lines and equally imaginative characters. His films, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA and MONONOKE to the CAST of the LATEST ASL MOVEMENT, are not only beautifully rendered in terms of art, but also in terms of filmmaking. Can't this man be wrong? Not really, but it's impossible to expect all of his films to always be five-star wonders. His latest film, PONYO, a shameless tale for families of a "goldfish out of the water", is lively and full of interesting characters as one would expect ... yet this is his first film that tramples "" minor "territory. Don't get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie by any means. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story does not remain afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another compelling and in-depth storyline. <br /> <br /> For its opening time, PONYO is the fairy tale of Miyazaki at its peak, in which a rowdy and too demanding young red fish (who later becomes Ponyo) makes a journey forbidden in the human world, where it is subsequently adopted by a boy of his age called Sosuke (modeled, interesting, after the director's son) .This does not please Ponyo's father, a mysterious wizard by name Fujimoto, c he is very angry with the humans for their destruction of the sea (this environmental theme is not very different from other Miyazaki films) ... a problem he intends to rectify by creating jellyfish from the bow of his submarine. Separate the couple and try to convince Ponyo to stay underwater with him. The goldfish, however, has already tasted both the blood of Sosuke (taking care of a cut on the finger), and part of the human food (ham, which inexplicably becomes dependent), and of course steals his father's forbidden potions, turning into a hyperactive girl (which is the spitting image of Mei from MY NEAR TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami that threatens to engulf the whole world with water. Consuming with his wife, Gran Mamare, a diaphanous sea goddess who alternates alternately from a giant titan to a human dimension, Fujimoto decides to test the mutual love of the two young men. They do this by raising the sea to the level of Sosuke's home, forcing young people to move through their ocean-haunted world in an oversized toy boat (made possible by Ponyo's magical powers). <br /> It is at this point where PONYO starts to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes that involve them are fun and cute, they slow the movie down. Where the film really gets water, unfortunately, it is at the height where Sosuke must show his love for Ponyo, presented in a way that is strangely anticlimatic and hasty, leading to an abrupt halt to an otherwise fascinating story. This probably won't allow viewers to expect another instant man-made masterpiece that has delivered much more interesting finales for many of his other films. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsuki's quest for little Mei? Kiki's Tombo rescue? Porco Rosso's fight with Curtis? The rescue of the head of the Forest Spirit? Or the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All these resolutions were much more satisfying and you feel more complete than this. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, PONYO cannot be criticized. The animation is absolutely wonderful to watch, produced entirely without a single shot of computer-generated images, and of course Joe Hisaishi still gives us another breathtaking musical score; the best moments are the subdued underwater sequences, accompanied by a choir and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed like any other Ghibli movie. <br /> <br /> After proving themselves worthy of translating and duplicating the previous Ghibli films in English with very high quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide dub English complete with cast of mostly capable actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, sounding very natural and believable in everything. Noah Cyrus in the role of Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes exaggerates in shouting his lines before stopping at the end. Apart from the rest of the cast, Liam Neeson is the overprotective Fujimoto (who behaves not surprisingly well in the character), Cate Blanchett in the role of Great Mamare (in an omnipresent tone that is not very different from his Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS), Matt Damon as Sosuke's constantly navigating father, Koichi (who is good but nothing to write home about), and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them, Fey is the best voice of the entire cast, imbuing the character with the right amount of spirit and personality. His scenes with Sosuke show a true chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was as spectacular as Dola in CASTEL IN THE SKY, is disappointingly wasted as one of the three handicapped elderly women (he barely ANY line!), Who are also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of them, only the character of Tomlin, an irascible woman named Toki, shows a true personality, but if I were at the casting of the film, I would change Tomlin with Leachman. Probably the only real drawback of dub is a techno-remix blues of the captivating (but ridiculously repetitive) movie song, which fortunately does not occur up to half of the credits. <br /> <br /> whole, PONYO is a good movie; a beautiful piece of animated work that is perfect for young people and the family audience. Due to the loss of momentum towards the end, however, it is much lower than the classic status. Since at least Miyazaki is even better than most other animated films, however, I will be generous and give PONYO a recommendation for a star, because every feature is still a lot to look at, especially on the big screen. (Make sure you take it to the movies when you can.)
