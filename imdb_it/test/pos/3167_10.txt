At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The next day I had a unique film after the taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy all that exists, including life on earth. The advantage is no trace and cold. It's like all of us who want to get rich, laugh, travel, eat and have fun. Move from one place to another in a giant camper without direction or reason just to pass the time and have fun. In the end it's too late. From my first vision of the United States he grew up on me as a tailor-made dream where life on earth is nothing but a strange experience. I am an artist and a Buddhist and this film communicated to my senses. It was an ideal embodiment of impermanence. It may seem strange but somehow this film was able to touch me in a profound way like no other. I advise.
