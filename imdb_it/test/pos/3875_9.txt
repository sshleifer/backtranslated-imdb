I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it since. He was haunting: visual, material, sensual. This film took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the tent blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way he made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what happened when the film was finished, but I find that life is like that. It didn't bother me. The iniquity of the extreme rejection of an innocent character seems to me sadly real. I loved the faces, the way the camera focused on them. The camera stared at the set with the blurred eyes of a daydreamer. Borderline was real to me, in a sense, the films didn't. It was exactly the lack of explanation, color, sharpness that made me enter into my consciousness like a thief in the night. I love this movie. One day I will own it.
