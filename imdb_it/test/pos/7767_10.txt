This film reminded me of watching old black and white movies with my father. More faithful to the characters of life who are looking for love, being in love and loss. Old story new vision. Larenz Tate was thus Cary Grant in grand style as the character may have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor prevented him from looking foolish and like a cardboard cut out. Nia Long has always been my favorite, she's sweet even when it's hard, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best works and shows that it is better than always playing an angry black. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic, a superb, well-written acting, a true love story set in Chicago, what more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> SuperB Black Love Story
