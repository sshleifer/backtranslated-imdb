I caught my attention on Netflix Instant Play because it was only an hour and a half (it's almost 4 am here), and because it's Norwegian, I wanted to follow up with Dead Snow and see what else the country offers in its own international cinema now. A funny and delightfully ironic film, this film presents a man, Andreas, who is sent to some Purgatory in a New World city, where everyone is happy and tasteless and the food has no taste, no smell and even sex loses its charm. Pushed to the limit by his lack of common sense, he feels almost ready to kill himself. <br /> <br /> After a hilarious failed attempt by the latter, Andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a small, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which the music emanates. The two try to break through to see what's on the other side, tracking down some light they can barely see. But of course, in the land of the fantasy allegory, desire and non-conformism are not allowed and the elements of the city work to put an end to Andreas's attempt at freedom and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Jens Lien and the crew create a simple, direct forward movement towards the story, one that flows well with its themes and moves along the right pace so as not to retreat. The similarities in other similar science fiction films are not worth enumerating, but the film still has a unique appearance and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrible scenes. I like the limited but effective use of blood in this film, some gutting and scourging that will make you beat the strongest heart of the Passion of Christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the staging of gray tones. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a reliable actor who feels physically out of place with his surroundings, which works very well. Despite the fact that the concept itself is not something to write about, all the actors involved make it work and the film fully realizes its own world. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
