This film is one of the most historically accurate war films ever made as it shows the reality of soldiers in a battle situation, as well as the special circumstances of the Battle of Stalingrad, obviously when comparing this film with works like the book by Anthony Beevor " Stalingrad ". <br /> <br /> Unlike the more famous "enemy at the gates", where the plot turns into a story of snipers / fighters, this film shows what war can do to people. Although filmed by Germans, "Stalingrad" is anything but a nationalist apologetic film. It shows that war films can be something beyond flagrant and jingoistic distortions of the sad truth of war, as many of Hollywood's "war" products seem to be. <br /> <br /> The script, the acting, the direction and others The film techniques of "Stlingrad" are of the highest level. <br /> <br /> It is a must for anyone who is thinking of joining an army and obeying orders of any kind of "Fuehrer".
