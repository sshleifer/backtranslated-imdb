The beautiful Candace Bergen while the widow Perdicaris is kidnapped and held hostage by Sheikh Raisuli, played by a brazen Sean Connery. The incident comes in 1904 when Theodore Roosevelt runs for the full presidential election. Needing a good example to show off US muscular foreign policy, Brian Keith as Roosevelt issues a staggering statement to the Sultan of Morocco, "Perdicaris vivo or Raisuli dead". <br /> <br /> But in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing in this story. The Perdicaris in question were actually Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and amateur playboy. Indeed Perdicaris renounced his American citizenship years ago and was a new Greek citizen. No matter, however, his situation was quite useful at the time. <br /> <br /> The damsel in distress makes the best material on the screen, even if she is a widowed woman and her two children who are in danger here. Obviously, as presented here, the incident is also used by some of our European powers to get their foothold in Morocco. Intrigues go far beyond a brigand's demand for redemption. <br /> <br /> The wind and the lion have no history. But it's a funny movie and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also adapts to my idea of ​​Theodore Roosevelt and the scenes in the White House of Roosevelt sound true to all the stories told. John Huston plays the ever-patient Secretary of State John Hay whom Roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor William McKinley. <br /> <br /> But children do not use this film to skip reading a history assignment in the era of Theodore Roosevelt.
