In "The Squire of Gothos", Kirk and his crew encounter a powerful super-being, who holds the Captain, "Bones" and some crew members for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think this is the first episode of Star Trek I've ever seen and the program that made me hungry for more. It is not one of the best episodes, but the solid premise of an alien being that puts the crew of the Enterprise in a corner, is the kind of situation that makes the show so fun to watch. In a sense, the superhumanid anticipates one of the most famous characters of Star Trek, the enigmatic "Q" of Next Generation. This episode is also memorable to create a unique situation: it is the first time that Uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see which captivating character Uhuara can be when the story allows her. Too bad the show has never completely explored this iconic figure.
