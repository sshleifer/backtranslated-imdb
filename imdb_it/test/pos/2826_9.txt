Ok, where to start. Did you know that the leading robot part was offered to the famous mimi team Shields and Arnez? I bet you don't. But they refused complaining about the robot's trick. Then they vanished into darkness. Now, this movie has it all. A crazy killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of fantastic robots. It's fun, moving, it's the perfect dating movie for people who love science-fiction and romantic comedies. It is the first romantic comedy for robots. Now, of course, very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues. But there are very minor and can be overlooked. I think couples will like this movie and will want to watch it over and over again. 9 STARS.
