As listed and stated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients for its merit. In fact, more than 20 years after it was originally broadcast, it is still watched, and looked at again, and has a huge following of fans worldwide, something that must indicate that the creators of this series have undoubtedly achieved something right. <br /> <br /> The root of the brilliance of the series and remarkable appeal, however, has obtained that is based on wonderfully written dialogues and timeless characters ?? all brought to life by wonderful actors. The characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity. Unlike many other Robin Hood adaptations, and indeed of many other film and television productions in general, the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen with obvious flaws, while the bad ones, though presented as evil and ruthless , they can often be understood and even sometimes seem quite understanding. Does this make Robin of Sherwood a story about multi-faceted, REAL people? rather than good and bad people ?? something that adds a lot to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. Moreover, despite being a series full of action with numerous incredible stunts (which are remarkable in themselves given that they were realized much earlier than today's computer animations, green screens and so on.), Behind all those endless boys falling walls of the castle, horses and fire, there is actually a real person who at some point fell from a wall of a castle or a horse or caught fire), there is always a surprising dialogue between the different characters of each episode . In the final analysis, however, are they generally the villains of the series ?? Nickolas Grace as Nottingham Sheriff, Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne and Philip Jackson as Abbot Hugo de Rainault ?? who gets the best lines and who most often steals the show with his subjects full of spirit and I can't. "It's a wedding, not a party!" it's just one of their many timeless "pearls of wisdom" that seems to follow one through life :-). <br /> <br /> 20 years after the fact, is it really hard to believe that Robin of Sherwood was originally something made for television ?? and apparently not with a large amount of money ?? in order to provide fleeting entertainment on Saturday afternoons for young children in Britain. Shot in wonderful places, with intelligent and surprising screenplays and with extraordinary stunts and fantastic actors ?? many of whom give their life's performance in this show ?? this in many ways seems to be more professional and have more production value than many Hollywood movies.
