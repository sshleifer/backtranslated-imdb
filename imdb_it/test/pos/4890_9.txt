I originally saw it because I thought it would be the sequel to the League of EXTRAORDINARY Gentlemen and this film is a completely different thing going on here - a comedy! Anyway, I loved it anyway! <br /> <br /> The League of Gentlemen is apparently a British television series with some rather strange characters and a certain sharp humor. This is a British comedy, so it revolves around being very silly, dressing up in costumes and having fun with a lot of Germans and French, homosexual references - in short it's very, very funny! <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the writers of the TV show who decides to delete some characters and characters that leave their dimension in the writer's dimension to prevent this from happening. It's a fun turnaround and there are lots of great scenes in this idiotic adventure. I laughed aloud several times and applauded the brash style of humor. This makes Mr Bean a bit watered down (Rowan is much better at the Black Adder btw series) <br /> <br /> This isn't Monty Python, but you can never escape the comparison when you speak English humor, and there are some similarities but not so many as to prevent them from being their own thing and being fresh. He leans more towards young people and Guest House Paradiso in his 'comic' style. <br /> <br /> If you liked it, take a look at the series The Young Ones and the movie Guest House Paradise, and of course, I assume the TV series League of Gentlemen must be pretty fun.
