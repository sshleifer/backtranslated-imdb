This 1925 film tells the story of the mutiny aboard the battleship Potemkin in the port of Odessa. The film celebrates the twentieth anniversary of the 1905 uprising, which was seen as a direct forerunner of the October Revolution of 1917. Following his theory of editing, Eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message, in addition to him he uses different camera shooting angles and revolutionary lighting techniques. The "Odessa Steps" sequence in Potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. The wheelchair coming down the steps after his mother was struck was later recreated in The Untouchables by Brian d Palma. It is clear that the film is one of the best ever made considering its time and how innovative it is, even if you need a little patience and be a true fan of films to spend its 70 minutes.
