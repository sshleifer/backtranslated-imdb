eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, in which the characters run from the realm to the realm, from landscape to landscape trying to beat a game that they do not know the target or exactly where it is leading them. Within that virtual reality game there are more levels of virtual reality games, which question the reality they come from is the "real" one. Obviously it is not spectacular to hide the fact that it will not respond reasonably to a true reality, instead of questioning the idea of ​​seeing if it is real or a video game being discussed until the end. I'm not even sure Cronenberg pretends that the twist won't be there, it's so incredibly obvious it's kind of baffling in a sense. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is its basic nature, in a sense. Cronenberg questions reality and criticizes the game. Yet the same things he uses to criticize the game make him have fun: the violence, the discontinuity, the lack of focus and in a certain sense, the pixellation, even if there is no such pixellation in the film. I once heard someone say that Cronenberg's violence is actually a criticism of media hypervolence, but it hides it well from the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in plucking new orifices in humans, animals and amorphous piles of biological mud. /> <br /> What is brilliantly written and done about this film is the use of video game omens (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during the cut scenes, the relative lack of environment or surroundings that don't they make sense, only a few people around where you feel that there should be many and vice versa, all these things) along with the reason for the penetration. Definitely deconstructs the reality of the video game in a way that is nauseating and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing the electronics of video games with literals "pod" of biological matter that contort and change and are, frankly, disgusting compared to that of the most horrible degrees. For what it's worth, this film provokes a reaction in you. <br /> <br /> But for what? He criticizes virtual reality, but it is a film: it is his virtual reality. He seems to criticize the banality of the game lines of the video games and the design of the characters, yet he maintains this banality. Surely he seems to worry if killing a character in a video game is more correct than killing a real human being and how video games can be confused with reality and make people not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, yet I say about new, it gets the maximum pleasure from the tearing of people, objects, beasts, things and organisms in bloody shreds. <br /> <br /> So, while it has a focal point of anxiety, it doesn't really do anything with it, not really. Only what it does is present that anguish in such an original way that one cannot really deny one's moment of splendor. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it would be much easier to hate this movie for being gory and violent, because there is no good reason that I can see to love it and yet I can't ignore it as mediocre or bad. It would be easier not to be able to take it, but since I can, there is nothing I can really do with it. I think it's a bit excessive, it doesn't really need to go that far, but Cronenberg's intentions are so confusing and confusing. I don't know if this was Cronenberg's fault or Cronenberg's point, and I don't know. I think there's really a way to figure it out, except maybe ask him directly. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
