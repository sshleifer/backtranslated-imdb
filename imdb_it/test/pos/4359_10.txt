We see at the beginning of Little Dieter that Dieter Dengler, the subject of the film, an obsessive-compulsive must fly. Or at least that's what it seems to be through doors that open and close constantly and with its big pile of food in the cellar. In a sense, director Werner Herzog poses a central question, so to speak, as to why Dieter is so. Well, in fact, it's not necessarily obsessive-compulsive since it's just, well, prepared. And why shouldn't it be after the life in which he lived? Apart from the saddest, the most obscure and hilarious and terrifying and simply disturbing story of survival that is the heart of the image, Dieter's background is also fascinating. Dieter's own childhood, for example, was already a setback from the start, being in post-war Germnay, poor in a family without much food or prospects, eating wallpaper for "the blue between the walls" . But entering into a passion, into a desire that does not yield (which, of course, is part of the bread and butter of Herzog and of love for man in his films), which is flying, and for Dieter there was nothing there other than fulfilling this. What ends up becoming, after becoming an American citizen, is more than he could have bargained for. <br /> <br /> Dieter is one of Herzog's most compelling, eccentric and compassionate figures in his entire career, a man whose memory is marked by brutal memories of his time of being a Vietnam POW, although at least he provides one the most compelling stories in any documentary of the last 20 years. Ironically, the narrative arrives - unlike The Wild Blue Yonder - mostly in a lot of Dieter's exhibits on some of the most minute details of his time in different prison camps (tactical torture, insects, brutals , the miserable violence and threats as with the fairy tale of wedding rings), and bringing in the most interesting and sad parts with his best friend Duane. They fled from the prisons together, but found that their journey to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, through most of this, talking does something that is compelling, which is that Dieter goes through his stories and occasionally does re-enactments (in Herzog fashion he could do nothing else, with Dieter already middle-aged being carried in handcuffs and all through the jungle), you can imagine all this in mind. It becomes even more vivid to try to get these little details and the intensity of it all in a form of reality. Let Herzog keep these simple parts, and know when to keep Dieter in his answers, make him even more a key figure of interest. It's never completely 'normal', but unlike a Timothy Treadwell, you will never even think of laughing at him. <br /> <br /> So, along with his hero (whether it's war or not it's hard to say, Dieter complains that those who died were the true heroes, typical but perhaps quite true), Herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old movies when describing Dieter's life (the film of the scenes of the Second World War and the German rubble is always a captivating show, and with Herzog rises one step in its timing and assembly with music), and in capturing the shooting of Vietnam in aerial views of jungles and fields. Herzog is also very wise in not injecting much politics into the process, there is no "I was used by the Americans" or whatever was thrown into the mix. There is also the feeling that Dieter does not hold too much resentment for all that has happened to him, which is exactly what happens in wartime (and, of course, he was dropping bombs on people from his plane). Now, through many of these heart-rending - and even in the smaller fragments that relate to what happened in the prisons, bathrooms and food scraps are always heartbreaking - fortunately Herzog also keeps the level of humor under control. One of my favorite scenes in the movie, where Herzog leaves Dieter for a moment, is when he shows a "trainee" movie used for American soldiers to show what should happen if they are left alone in the jungle. .with all the equipment that could have included a knife, a rocket launcher and a very fast helicopter to come around (and this is put into an exhilarating and effectless voice-over job). <br /> <br /> Yet even the moments in which we laugh are limited to remembering moments of absurdity in a moment of absolute crisis, and how we can never really imagine what it means to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people that they will do everything to keep that person as a form of guarantee in time of war. Dieter, besides knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have (and Herzog ends the film with a wonderfully dark and elegiac note in which he flies over a vast field of airplanes), he knows what it means to survive at all costs. But, however, as in many of Herzog's films led by the protagonists, there is the almost unalterable spirit that will continue to endure if one is strong enough, even through horrible moments (Dunae's fate) and problems until the rescue by the helicopter (it's an American, or a spy, ask about the helicopter). Dieter is such a man with a spirit, and gave Herzog a fantastic, tragic, creative, well-turned, though perhaps too short, tribute to his life. And of course, it excites me even more for the upcoming Rescue Dawn dramatization.
