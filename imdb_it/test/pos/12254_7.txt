I really don't know when it was the moment when TV stations preferred having handsome men like their reporters - regardless of men's IQ - but it was clearly a problem when "Broadcast News" came out, and the film does a great job at look at him. Depicting a love triangle between the air-head reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), the intelligent but nervous reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the film doesn't punch. Probably the best line of the film is when Tom says something like: "I really don't understand anything of what I'm reporting". And in the era of FOX News and things like that, a film like this becomes even more important. <br /> <br /> All in all, definitely a film that I recommend. He also played Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson in a secondary role as an anchorman.
