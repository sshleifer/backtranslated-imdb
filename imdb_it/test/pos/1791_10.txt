As Margot in "Fear of Fear" is a victim of her ambitious husband, as Fox in "Fox and her friends" is committed suicide by her boyfriend who took away all her money, like Xaverl Bolwieser in "The Stationsmaster's Wife" which goes to jail to give the traitorous wife the chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann who seeks refuge in madness to escape from his stupid wife and his bankruptcy, so even Hans Epp is a victim of the German "Wirtschaftswunder" - Society after the second World War in "The Merchant of the Four Seasons" by RW Fassbinder. Simply from the fact that Fassbinder played with social abuses among men and women and between hetero and homosexual couples, it should be clear that it does not favor any sex. <br /> <br /> In the case of Hans Epp there are women who lead him to despair, to illness and finally to death. When he returns to the Foreign Legion, where he flew because he could no longer bear his mother's pressure, he complains that he is still alive while his neighbor's good boy was killed. Then Hans gets a job as a policeman, but is surprised by his foreman while he is seduced by a prostitute. After losing his job, he works as a fruit trader with little income, going from the courtyard to the courtyard "shouting" his products. Her mother, one of her sisters and her husband are ashamed to have a "street worker" in their family. "The love of his life" (he has no name in the film) refuses to marry him because his work does not match his social status and his origin. So he marries Irmgard who does not love and does not love him. From his constant pressure on him he runs away into drinking. One evening, after his wife was following him, he explodes and hits her. She flees to her family for which this event was just what they were waiting for. When Irmgard calls a divorce lawyer, Hans suffers a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him, but from now on he is no longer allowed to do heavy work and drink alcohol. So he starts to feel more and more superfluous, he becomes more calm and silent and more and more depressive. When he discovers that Irmgard cheats him, he chooses to end his life, but not like Hermann Hermann, having a journey into the light of madness, but he drinks himself to death before Imrgard, their little daughter and his alcoholic companions. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question, however, is: Did Hans commit suicide just because he could no longer bear his miserable environment or did he do himself justice?
