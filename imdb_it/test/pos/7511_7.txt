this movie is fun, funny, funny my favorite quote from the movie "I think I saw a half-naked Indian in my room last night" the answer that was not a hallucination was an Indian in your room "and another is" that hell are you talking to about, what the hell are you talking about "but if I ever get admitted to a hospital like this I'll be ready to write my will on the spot ... I would say that in my opinion there were three very funny characters in this film is the most fun , but three is the funniest for me even if their lines were few ... and don't let me start on the crack-pot patient hehehe what I'll keep secret too.
