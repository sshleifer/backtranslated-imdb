I really enjoyed this movie ... but the ads I saw implicit, and a review published actually said, that this film "benefits from a light touch". This is very misleading to me. <br /> <br /> There is really a lot of humor: eccentric, inelegant, sometimes a little twisted humor: the kind of humor I generally find really very attractive. But most humor is the type that appears to be conscious at all times of profoundly profound, deeply sensitive, even deeply painful things. The film weaves themes of Past and Present, Perception and Truth, Memory and Activity, Life and Death. The entire film is suffused with the history of European anti-Semitism in general and the Holocaust in particular. <br /> <br /> How can Humor and Horror be combined in the same film? The review I saw suggested that humor is Absurdist. I don't think it's that way at all; at least not in the usual sense. Instead, I think this film is in the tradition of much Jewish / Yiddish literature / theater. I don't claim to be any kind of expert in this area; but from what I have seen, Humor is used, in this cultural context, both as a coping tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people; and also Humor is used as a means to "recover the Divine" for men and women who choose a path of Faith rather than a path of Despair or Absurdism. See "Fiddler on the Roof" for Humor used in both ways in this rich tradition. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Jonathon) Wood wears horn-rimmed glasses that make him look really weird: he compares Sin City when he wore the same types of glasses with chilling effect. In this film, it is easy to see how glasses become a metaphor for both his research and his struggle between perception and truth. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Old Alex) are both simply wonderful. Jonathon and Young Alex belong to the same generation, yet they seem very, very different; and then discover that they are not so different. And the way in which the Apparent Narrative Voice gradually changes from that of Jonathon to that of Young Alex .. like a journey of intentional discovery for Jonathon becomes a discovery for Young Alex and Old Alex ... for me it is so moving. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful scenes and views from (they told me) Prague and its surroundings, standing for the plot Ukraine. Everything looks very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of the place; although I have never been in Ukraine myself and I can hardly testify to it from direct experience. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for a light comedy, I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie. On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, delightful and moving film, please watch this wonderful film.
