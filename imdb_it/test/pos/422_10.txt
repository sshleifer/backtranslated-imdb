Ok, this series of series takes the path of "here we are again!" Week in week, the character of David Morse helps his ride which is a little pickled - but what's wrong with that !? David Morse is one of the greatest actors of characters out there, and certainly the most beautiful, and having him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is a paradise !! <br /> <br /> Due to the lack of love for this show by many, I can't see it going to a season series - but never know? The amount of garbage that has gone beyond this confuses me - we hope that something good can overcome a first series !!!
