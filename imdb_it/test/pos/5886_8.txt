With the Second World War, film studios hurried to focus on veterinarians returning home. "The best years of our life" was probably the best example. It portrays various people who return home and how they must re-adapt not only their pre-war lives, but also the changing world. Probably the most interesting member of the cast is non-actor Harold Russell. Having lost his hands in war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands were and reminds people that he wants to be treated like everyone else; he went on to win the best supporting actor and a special Oscar for the role, making him the only person ever to win two Academy Awards for the same role. There will probably always be a debate about whether this deserved the best film over "It's a wonderful life", but I certainly think they did a good job with it. Very well done.
