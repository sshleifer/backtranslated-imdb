First of all, the alien saves a black boy and a Mexican, despite what the plot summary for IMDb suggests. This film is the fulfillment of the purest of male fantsies, interracial rape. The main character of this film is a drug by George Michaelesque, who does not understand the primary human impulses like drug abuse and murder. In fact, every time he uses violence to solve a problem, he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him. What a square. In any case, my favorite scene is when he writes to the gang members a letter stating if they want the $ 500 they get from the Reading Center for the protection they have to meet with him. At the meeting he is surrounded by countless Chicano gangsters, but he remains calm. In slow motion, it hits the wooden pole of a stop sign that shatters on contact. Then, still in slow motion, he points to the leader of the band and says "Noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" The gang members conform. Fantastic, right? The beauty of this film shows through these simple solutions to social problems such as prostitution and group violence.
