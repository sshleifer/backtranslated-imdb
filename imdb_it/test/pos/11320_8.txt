This is a great product for the TV flick of the "what if" variety. As in, and if the terrorists exploded a "dirty bomb" in a big city, in this case, in London. A lot of people who say "we are all ready in an emergency" which then reveal that they are not telling the whole story. And is anyone prepared for something like this? You can bet no. This shows the material for the smuggling bombs introduced into the country, the bomb making, the secrecy and the double lives that the people behind carry, etc. It also shows public employees (ie firefighters) who give everything to save people when they receive no help, when the government does not want to send anyone else to the affected area. It also shows how sadly inadequate "preparations" are for any such event, since the government speaks everything but then stays there with open mouths as the tragedy unfolds. And could this happen right here in the good old United States? Well, unless you've lived in caves for the past 20 years something somehow already has, to a certain extent, not bet that someone would be prepared for something of this nature. This is quite realistic and yes, even scary. It's worth seeing, but I just hope nothing like that ever happens. 8 out of 10.
