What a fascinating film. The cast is wonderful, and the story is witty and fun. A pleasant cinematic experience all around. Although the plot is quite predictable, it does not make the story less pleasant, in fact, I didn't want it to end. I've always been a fan of Ingrid Bergman, and I was interested in seeing her in a comic role. It didn't disappoint me, Ingrid Bergman's performance as Dickinson is fun to watch. I loved his interaction with Toni in the music store as well as his dancing and doing "the dentist". He further demonstrated what I already knew, which is one of the greatest actresses of all time. Even Goldie Hawn is delightful to watch. His funny, tender and tender Toni is the driving force of the film. Don't even question why she'd be so worried about Finacee's wife, just accept that he's just the kind of person who wouldn't be happy if she didn't know that others were too. And Walter Matthau is as big as Julian. His actions never create animosity for the viewer, on the contrary, make it almost more durable. There was no unlikely character in the group. This film has certainly stood the test of time, I've only seen it last night and I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you are looking for a fun, carefree and romantic comedy, look no further.
