For me it's almost impossible to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people in on some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski explored in the two previous voices of this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them, and I imagine myself in their world, the more I get his theme: that we are more connected to each other than we would like to think ourselves, and a small hand of destiny is enough to set some events in movement. In BLU, Juliette Binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without ties to the past brought someone unexpected. In WHITE, an act of cruelty generates an unlikely friendship between two men who, against the tide, conspire to bring the culprit to justice and to the point of departure. And now, in RED, all the elements of destiny and apparent coincidence apply to the meeting of a young Genevese model and a retired judge who has the habit of intruding on other people's lives. <br /> <br /> This girl is called appropriately: Valentine (a luminous Irene Jacob), who has this splendor on her and smiles openly as she works on the catwalk. Not that he is without a baggage: he has a boyfriend, unseen, who also asks to know what he is doing at all times, he has a brother who upsets her and refuses the advances of a photographer who is working on his image for a huge billboard. It hits a dog while driving and brings it back to health, but when he takes it to the owner, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he doesn't want it. "I don't want anything", he says coldly, and the elements of BLU suddenly reveal themselves when this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and in apparent free freedom, leads surveillance on unsuspecting people. This masculine version of Juliette Binoche's character at Valentino's first shock - states that she can only feel pity for him as she walks away horrified, but a fortuitous case brings her back to her home, and that's where she begins to reveal who she is, and her big loss. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Kieszlowski is carrying out a parallel story: the story of a young man, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), who is about to become a judge and lives on street from Valentine - but they still miss each other each other. The case is the word. Like Valentine, who wins the jackpot for the grocery store she visits, elements of luck that cost her life and those of Auguste. He has a girl who also provides people with telephone weather reports. One of them seems to be the old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste does, and he never met her. How God, or Prospero, is slowly creating a storm that will break the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression "We meet again". It is this parallelism between the old and the young judge that makes the RED so beautiful and transcendent, because time is, in reality, much more fluid than we would like to think. There are people we meet in life that if only we were born in similar times, so many things would be different. <br /> <br /> Such is the case with Valentine and the old judge. I believe there is certainly a strong brotherhood of souls that binds them together in a close bond: it is that woman who has not met - by chance or not - and is, whether she knows it or not, trying to make amends from here the reason for which runs the great risk of revealing its surveillance and becoming the social outcast. But it doesn't end there. One of the many links between the three films is the character of an old woman walking in a large garbage container. Where Julie didn't see her (and he wouldn't have helped her anyway), and Karol, fresh from his public humiliation, chuckles at his thought: "Someone is worse than me," is Valentino who helps her. The fragility of need can happen anywhere, and Kieszlowski applies it here too in a minor character. <br /> <br /> Now, RED is much more than a story. Valentine, the old judge, Auguste, also Rita the dog: these are not characters confined by storytelling. An American version would ruin the idea and market casual encounters and also produce a stupid ending. RED is so devoid of a linear and definite plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the chances that this story could have turned in so many directions, if a crucial element had not occurred at the exact time and place. > <br /> The addition to the concept of characters that reflect each other despite time or position is the theme of sexual betrayal. This is also an important and characterizing element in all three films: in BLU, Julie's husband had a lover and also betrays Olivier when it is clear that she is emotionally dead. At WHITE, Dominique has Karol listen to his groan on the phone (which becomes an important device in RED) while having sex with a man while the CONTEMPT poster by Brigite Bardot looks. In RED, the story of the old judge's love and betrayal is re-enacted. And all this time, the image of the Valentine's Day poster hangs over them like an omen of what must happen at the same time that Rita, the Valentine's dog struck, brings seven puppies, the life renewed for six main actors of this complex trilogy, obviously filmed with care and love. Why do I say you are? You will have to watch the movie and be amazed.
