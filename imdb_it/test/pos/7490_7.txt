It looks a lot like films like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS that it is impossible to think that Tarantino's films were not a source of inspiration for this THURSDAY. However, it's not bad for a low-cost B-Series movie. The gangster storyline is catchy and fun and also has some dark humor and sarcasm that we can find in PULP FICTION. The resources were certainly not many, but the film is well produced. Even acting is good. I liked the scene when the girl was sitting on the couch teasing the doctor ... It was warm and fun at the same time! Even the soundtrack is beautiful. I didn't hear too many songs but the ones I heard I liked. I report it 7/10.
