I had the pleasure of watching this movie at the Big Bear Film Festival, where it won the audience award. And I must say that he was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and makes things grow. It also has a great current of suspense flowing through it. You don't know what will happen after the main character tries to understand that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to live with him. The jokes are fast and unexpected. The plot makes us guess. The dialogue seems very real. I thought the direction was top notch and the director Travis Davis shows great potential to make it big in the world of studio comedies. Not small praise since he is also the main actor of the film, so he had to do the triple duty on this, writing, directing and acting. If you have the chance to watch this movie on iTunes, it's worth downloading. It will make you laugh out loud a few times. And that's more than most shorts these days.
