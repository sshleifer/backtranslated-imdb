A powerful film that has recovered much of its meaning in this second half of 2007, after the desperate new movements of the Burmese people against their tyrants. I felt a complex mix of feelings for people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, along with a little bit of anger because I feel that nobody, neither the countries of the world, nor themselves, are doing something effective for Poni end to this shame I think these feelings have come directly from the film, and were thought of when it was made, so it's a hit movie. The desire for peace, the search for enlightenment, and respect for life sometimes lead to submission. In fact it is the Burmese Buddhist culture that has left the doors wide open to their dictators. But how can you feel angry about these poor people?
