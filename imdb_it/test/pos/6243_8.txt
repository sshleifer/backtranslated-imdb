"Tourist Trap" is a bizarre, great horror movie from the 70s. The film is about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry and Molly, who are traveling in a jeep through a desert area. Their other two friends, Eileen and her boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When a wheel becomes flat, Woody takes it to a nearby service station - and encounters a horrible fate in a bizarre telekinetic chaos and some gruesome mannequins. Friends get tired of waiting for Woody and go to a local mannequin / wax museum "tourist trap". In front of the entrance, the car breaks randomly, and the girls find an oasis area to swim, where they are approached by Mr. Slausen, who manages the attraction along the road that is now closed. He takes them to the old western wax museum and the girls stay behind while he and Jerry go to repair their car. Eileen, the curious of the two, wanders around an old house nearby, where she also falls into the hands of a mysterious masked assassin and a handful of dummies. After waiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly go looking for her. At that moment the real horror begins, and the telekinetic (can move objects with his mind) masked brother of Mr. Slausen starts killing the boys one by one, while he checks his large quantity of mannequins transformed into humans. <br /> <br /> It looks similar to the 2005 "House of Wax" remake? Well, it is. I had heard of this film, but I never saw it when I saw "House of Wax", but now I see the striking similarities between the two parts of the film - "Tourist Trap" was obviously a great contribution to the remake of " House of Wax ". The dummies in this film are scary to begin with, some with moving eyeballs, some without eyes and some with mouths that sing. The singing was extremely disturbing if you asked me, and the mannequins were strangely drawn. The mannequins are creepy to begin with, they're so realistic yet they really aren't. The film closely mixes elements of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (the masks used by the murderer are similar to those of Leatherface), with some of the original "House of Wax" and the telekinetic powers shown in "Carrie". The result is quite satisfactory. Telekinesis was a nice touch to the film, making the killer even more threatening and ineluctable. The masks were terrifying, and the plaster scene was truly disturbing. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film was really well done, if not a little abused during some scenes. Acting may not be particularly important, but it wasn't that bad. Chuck Connors was as good as the shady Mr. Slauston, giving the character a shady but friendly appearance. A young Tanya Roberts is also in the film, is best known for her role in "Charlie's Angels" and most recently on the sitcom "That '70s Show", playing Donna's mother. Robert A. Burns is the artistic director, did a phenomenal job on the original "Texas Chainsaw" and does a good job here too, creating a moldy and moldy atmosphere both in the degraded museum and in the old house full of mannequins. I found it a bit strange that the original evaluation of the film was PG, it seems a bit too scary to have such a docile evaluation, but the film is not really too violent. <br /> <br /> In general, "Tourist Trap" is an extraordinarily unique, fast, extremely little appreciated horror classic. Full Moon gave him a decent DVD release for the 20th anniversary, the comment was interesting and the image was clear and sharp for the most part, better than the video versions. If you like old slasher horror movies from the 70s, "Tourist Trap" is an understated retro gem. 8/10.
