Four unhappy women sadly leave London to spend an ENCHANTED ENCHANTMENT in a castle on the Italian coast. <br /> <br /> The novel by Elizabeth von Arnim comes alive in this fascinating little film that beautifully shows the virtues of a screenplay and literal acting ensemble. All the elements come together to produce a film that, although almost forgotten, still produces a feeling of appreciation for the appropriate resolution of the story. <br /> <br /> The actresses all earn beautifully. Ann Harding is the free-spirited wife who wants "wisteria and tranquility" away from the misty London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife who wants the elegant responsibility of acting as a hostess in the castle. Jane Baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman temporarily escaping from the crowd of male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals every scene she finds herself in like an old lady who wants to be alone with her memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Even men in history are well expressed. As a husband of Miss Harding, Frank Morgan has a rather complex role as an insecure researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. Reginald Owen, as Miss Alexander's bride, is wonderfully pompous as a well-equipped man to be bored for England (her hilarious attempt to bathe in an Italian bathtub is made even more fun with Charles Judels and Rafaela Ottiano while the castle is tormented servants). Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the best forgotten actors of the decade, is joyously eccentric as the carefree landlord of the ladies. <br /> <br /> The film stars will recognize an unaccredited Ethel Griffies who plays the owner of the Hampstead Housewives Club.
