I saw this film from 1918 recently in our local Helsinkian film archive. It appears that the Danish Film Institute rebuilt it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Nordisk film company, which was one of the largest in the world at the beginning of the 20th century. I believe that at the moment there are several copies with English translations circulating in Europe. <br /> <br /> I found the film fascinating and the journey on Mars well thought out. The plot is certainly original, but in reality I don't want to reveal any more at the moment, because now the danger of ruining things for you really exists ;-). <br /> <br /> The film is also available on DVD, query the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) web pages on dfi.dk with 'Himmelskibet' for more information.
