First of all, I vaguely remember being told this story in elementary school, about 6 or 7 years ago, so I am somewhat familiar with the story. <br /> <br /> Much of this has changed anyway, and there are many differences and errors (sometimes unnecessary) in the movie that fans won't like very much. <br /> <br /> But overall I really love this movie. I saw it for the first time near Christmas about 2 years ago (well, the first part), then I took the whole scene last Christmas probably on the same channel. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed, sometimes it could be a little twisted and long, but with a compelling story, a decent acting (especially from the icy Fonda and Hobbs) and beautiful landscapes, costumes and little touches magic make this film really special - which really reminds me of Christmas. <br /> <br /> Despite the differences from the book, I think the film does well to incorporate new themes and ideas (the seasons with Autumn, Winter etc. with a new thief character to represent autumn) through the imaginary, once you notice it is rather surprising and brilliantly executed. <br /> <br /> I live in the UK, so I waited a long time for the DVD, and luckily I saw an advertisement showing a series of free DVDs offered in the Daily Mail newspaper I usually don't get, so I got the problem of yesterday and finally I have my DVD. If you missed it and want this rare DVD for region 2 I suggest you collect the tokens from the Daily Mail and send them away as your DVD will be delivered by Christmas. <br /> <br /> So for a little getaway during this year's Christmas season, light the fire, relax and watch this like you and the kids will probably really enjoy this great movie. If you don't have it, it will probably be repeated on Channel 4 this Christmas, so register it!
