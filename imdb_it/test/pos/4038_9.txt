"Snow Queen" is based, of course, on the fable of the same name, collected in (at least) Andersen's Fairy Tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other fairy tales, this one preserves the spirit of Faerie, a not easy result and not well understood by many, especially among Americans. Talking animals, arbitrary prohibitions, appearances of goblins, dragons and demons, must not be questioned in a fairy tale; they are a natural element of Faerie as, to say, gravity is in the scientific world, and the reason or explanation for them is completely beyond the point of history. Nor is history bound by modern rules of Hollywood composition: direct, often to the point of being grotesquely linear in minor, and obvious (in retrospect, at least) works. <br /> <br /> With this defense against the common criticism of those who do not understand fairy tales, "Snow Queen" is a delightful film with wonderful visual effects, acting skills and great feeling. The only flaw in the film was, I think, not that it was too fantastic, but that some parts of the dialogue were too conspicuously modern in jargon and expression, a mar on its otherwise timeless nature.
