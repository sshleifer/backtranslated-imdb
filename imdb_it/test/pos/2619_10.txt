I'm not going to digress about it, but I'm going to make it short. basically for those who don't know how the prue really died ........... the first time the demonic killer gets hit with a piper and bows with an energy ball flying through the blood of the wall everywhere. phoebe the third sister goes down the stairs, says the spell that sends him away but not defeated. (YOU NEED THE POWER OF THREE) Leo heals both and so on. they are exposed along the line and the only way they can be saved is for a demon called tempus to go back in time. the only way he can do it is that the phoebe remains in the underworld. she agrees, Tempus turns back. now around 7:00 again. the demon comes from the piper and prue structures with energy ball. they fly through the wall again. but this time phoebe is not there to say the spell to repel demon. demon kills the doctor. the doctor flies through the window he is dead. the demon goes into a kind of swirling wing and the glass on the doors shatters, which is a big hello effect, and there's an airy sound. this is where it ends. NOW .......... what the whole world doesn't know if it didn't pay attention to the next episode. even if what I'm about to say wasn't shown is what happens trust me ................ because this time there was no phoebe to call Leo this time it comes later. Piper survives because his injuries are not as fatal as those of Prue and Leo heals them before he does, so at that point Prue is already dead. there mystery solved. ps who called Prue with a spell should have worked !!! and he should have made a surprise appearance in the last episode ever
