Shame on you if you rate this movie low. Like you don't like a movie that has Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, silly rubber monsters, fights, (and for the boys, that woman who was the bad woman of The Spy Who Loved Me and one of the 1970s Sinbad movies, who didn't wear much that my mother said "She wasn't chosen for her eye color"), lava, silly wigs and a crazy Victorian drill very similar to the one used in the old Thunderbirds series? Anyone who watched this movie and disconnected it was watching it for the wrong reasons. It could be crap, but it's definitely good shit. Don't make them like before, sigh ......
