It will be a company PLEASE make a (good +) DVD of this movie! ??? Besides being a wonderful film about relationships and friendships, "Four Friends" is the ONLY movie I've ever seen - and I've literally spent * years * of my life watching movies! - that captures the essence of the experience of the 1960s (and I was there!): idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, betrayals and, ultimately, its optimistic but bittersweet ending. And all this is accomplished without being a story of any of the many upheavals of that era, although many are simply touched ... as part of the tapestry. But the story speaks mainly of the characters and their friendship for about 10 ~ 15 years ... and that those survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade. Absolutely a film of joy and to see ... even if you are not an old hippy !!!
