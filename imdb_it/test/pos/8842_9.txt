"The Thing" is John Carpenter's best film. Mixing his talent for tension and shocks with decent production values, he made a perfectly made science fiction / horror film. <br /> <br /> Filming in really difficult conditions creates an isolated and credible research base that puts the tension before something happened. The ensemble cast works well with Kurt Russell, proving a charismatic protagonist even under his beard. <br /> <br /> By slowly building tension with moments of bloody horror (thanks to Rob Bottin to direct the effects - currently directed against Freddy vs Jason) Carpenter creates a film that has rarely been combined. Considering this came out the same year as ET, it couldn't be more different! <br /> <br /> It is worth a watch / rewatch. 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> p.s. the DVD is excellent. A lot of extras in addition to the best DVD commentary in progress (with Carpenter & Russell). Plus remixed in Dolby Digital for even scarier sound effects.
