Well, I saw it yesterday and it was much better than the other coming out of VH1, too bad that this is rather obsolete, but you can see all the staff that makes South Park, very interesting stuff. <br /> <br /> It is also amusing that this documentary portrays Trey and Matt as greedy selfish snobs who do not work and spend all their time having fun or relaxing (which is rather ironic because they work quite hard on the show). > <br /> Also show the whole animation process to create an episode of South Park, interview the actors who carry the voices of the characters and much more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of South Park I recommend this.
