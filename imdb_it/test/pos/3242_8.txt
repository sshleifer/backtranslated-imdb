I'm a fan of the independent film. The study pieces on the characters guided by dialogue are the right place for me. Some of the other posts are right: "Wannabes" doesn't rival "The Godfather" for the best film ever. On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well written and well directed photo that has surprisingly good performances from every actor / actress. My problem with one of the other reviews: <br /> <br /> - Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians <br /> <br /> - Dubin is a Hebrew surname, and as such has a dark, non-traditional Irish skin. It doesn't stand out at all, it offers great performance. <br /> <br /> He didn't win many prizes, but he deserves a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it for 7 dollars at Blockbuster and I was pleasantly surprised to say the least! Highly recommended.
