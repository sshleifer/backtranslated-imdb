I won't bore you with any synopsis, you probably already know them. And hopefully you're already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work. <br /> <br /> I do NOT at all agree with some of the other commentators that "Park did not go from the trilogy vendicativa bla bla bla". Why do you know what? He has!!! The trilogy of revenge was different from one another in style, to begin with, how can one compare the similarity and subtlety of "Sympathy For Mr Vengeance" with the frenzy and extravagance of "Oldboy"? Park Chan-Wook has an incredible style, but his films don't all share the SAME style! This was true and remains true with the release of "Thirst". <br /> <br /> "Sete" is an incredible image, literally has EVERYTHING you want in a movie. Stunning violence, cold blood, great humor, incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes. The plot is so crazy that at no time can you guess what will happen next. I'm so happy to say that Park is back in full form with this fantastic dark-comic-vampire-love fairy tale. Watch it as soon as possible!
