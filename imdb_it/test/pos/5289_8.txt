For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: it is still in good shape and has made another useful experience. Ok, no need to read further now. <br /> <br /> I think most readers are older than the two main characters in this photo, so I should say that Ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child: discover the world how you wanted to see it, create your own rules and boast an exuberant enthusiasm for doing things alone for the first time. Ponyo deviates from many of the problems that films of all ages face. It is never worthy of condescension, all the characters have good sincere hearts and credible problems. <br /> <br /> The two main characters can be two of the most believable children I've ever seen on the screen. They are not simple, arrogant or naive, they are just curious, enthusiastic and learn the ways of the world. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify. Many films involve children from the outside, while the adult looks at a world in which only a child could enter. Ponyo brings everyone back to that world. At Ponyo, there is the first time to learn and choose what interests you most, which the film values ​​with great esteem. It is worth remembering, hearing it again.
