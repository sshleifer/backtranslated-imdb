(This has been modified for space) <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror film, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analogue of a body's viral invasion), romance and a few other things. It's a film that has almost too much in mind. The film takes its own issues and mixes them with classical European literature, in this case "Thérèse Raquin" by Emile Zola. It's a strange mix that doesn't always gel, but that still has incredible power. It's been almost 24 hours since I saw the movie at Lincoln Center (with a post-film discussion by the director) and I find my cage getting more and more shaken. It is not so much what happens is annoying, it is more than its broad history and its themes play many bells in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film has a beloved priest who decides that the best way to help humanity volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected by the disease, he eventually succumbs and dies, but due to a vampiric blood transfusion (not explained) he actually survives. Hailed as a miraculous valiant, the priest returns to the hospital where he served the sick. Unfortunately, all is not well. The priest discovers that he needs blood to survive. He also finds out that he has all the typical problems of a vampire and that he can't get out during the day. Things get even more complicated when he becomes reactive with a childhood friend and his family. The priest, some of his awakened animal passions are taken with his friend's wife. From there everything goes sideways. <br /> <br /> An ever-changing film, this is a story that spans a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who discovers that his life has been radically altered by chance and discovers that he is no longer what he thought he was. It is a film with which you have to stay until the end because the film evolves forever into something else. It is also a film that has great importance for his mind and the themes he is playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways <br /> <br /> The film has enough things that could happen and people will probably do it, write the books that talk about the film. <br /> <br /> The two strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its love story. The vampire part of the story is brilliant. There is something in the way he describes the basic rules and the nature of "affliction" that has such a perfect sense that it drives away old vampire ideas. Sitting at the theater last night, I was amazed at how impressive the way it worked. I think the fact that he played more or less straight is what is so shaken by the earth. Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. It is in contrast to what happens next, it makes it clear that living an existence of human hunting does not really work. It's not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, rather it's something else. I personally think that the film changes the field from a cool or dream idea to something more real and tangible. (The sequence in which the powers come into action is simply fabulous.) The love story is also wonderfully managed. Of course, the sex scenes are smoky and well done, but it's the other things, the looks, the speeches, the off-sex gestures that make this special. I love the looks, the fixed silences while the forbidden couple look at each other hungry and incapable of acting, the disappointment and the pain of betrayal both real and suspect, and the crazy passion of a possible fulfillment. This is one of the great novels on screen of all time. It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of a deep passionate love (and lust). If you've ever loved deeply, I imagine you'll find a part of your feeling on the screen, I know I did it. The statement "I just wanted to spend eternity with you" has a sad anguish. It is both a declaration of what the intention was, and the depth of the emotions. The tragic romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you and say that the film is perfect and fantastic. It is not good, as the pieces are and almost all are great (especially the actors that I have unjustly omitted to greet as surprising) the whole does not always meet. The various genres, thematic elements and tones occasionally shrink against each other. I often wondered where the movie went. I hung there even though the film seemed to wander aimlessly. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie. I loved the pieces more than the film as a whole. It occurred to me in my mind since I saw it, and I suppose it will do so for several more days. Like or love are irrelevant since this is a film that should be seen since it has so much to give you enough material to think and talk for the next few days. One of the most entertaining and full films of the year.
