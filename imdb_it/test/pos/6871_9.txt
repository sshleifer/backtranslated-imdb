Late one night, in Tom Snyder's "Tomorrow" Show, I saw Tom ask his host Henry Morgan what he considered "perfect". Morgan replied: "Anything with Glenda Jackson". And even if I don't consider this film perfect, it does it very well. I was going to use the clich√© about Hollywood, not to do more images like this, but then I saw "Up in the Air", another clever film about 2 people over 35 who fall in love. That's where the similarities end, though. "House Calls" is simply fun to watch 2 professionals like Matthau and Jackson impose themselves and seem completely natural while they are there. I saw this film in the theater in 1978 (at the venerable age of 18) and it took me another 20 years to get all the jokes. Any film capable of making jokes about the great 1920 tennis player Bill Tilden, and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain would not have played the megaplex too well these days. Another thought: the original theatrical release included a "Walk on the beach / fall in love" montage set to "The Something" by The Beatles / George Harrison. At the time it seemed a bit forced, but that song was then replaced with a rather generic Henry Mancini music score for subsequent home videos and the cable version. Too bad, because that scene is standing there now, another music victim firing hell.
