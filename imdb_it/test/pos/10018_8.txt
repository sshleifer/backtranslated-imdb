I have certainly not seen all of Jean Rollin's films, but mostly they seem to be bloody parties of naked vampire women, which if you like that kind of thing is not bad, but this is a great start and it could almost be Cronenberg minus the bio mechanical nightmare stuff. Except that it is in French with subtitles, of course. A man driving on the road at night meets a woman who is in slippers and a bathrobe and picks her up, while in the background another woman lingers, wearing nothing. While they drive it is obvious that there is not something right in the woman, in the sense that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. However, this does not prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to Paris and to her apartment. The man leaves for work and some strangers come to his house and take the woman away in this "block of flats", a huge building called Torre Nera, where others of his kind (for whom things "without memory" seem to be the last of their problems) are held up for some reason. Time and events follow one another in the film, which mainly involves trying to find out what is going on and leaving the building for this woman, and manages to call Robert, the boy who chose her, to come to his aid. The revelation of what is happening comes in the last moments of the film, which has a rather strange but moving ending. Avoiding what appeared to be his "typical" formula, Rollin created, in this, what I feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film. I really like this, take a look. 8 out of 10.
