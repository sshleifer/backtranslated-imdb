I loved this movie, the independent film at its best. Cinematography, rhythm, rhythm and acting were perfectly synchronized. Fred Carpenters works best today! The film is well written with a lot of twists that lead you to a fantastic ending. It moves well and keeps you involved. Being a photographer, I was very impressed with cinematography. lighting creates the atmosphere and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger economic film. This gave the actors a large canvas from which to work their magic. And that's what they did! Great performances by all the actors and everyone was well cast in their roles. As I said at the beginning, it's a wonderful film and one of Fred Carpenters' best films. You will love it.
