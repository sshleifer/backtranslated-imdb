I recently read the story to see how these two combine, and if you believe it, this movie improves on Balzac. The story is moved, I believe, to get home the idea that Colonel Chabert is a man who suffered a lot and yet returns home, not a hero, but as an outcast. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned in the beginning I was confused if Chabert was similar to The Return of Martin Guerre. No. It is firmly established by Balzac that Chabert is the real deal. The interesting thing, however, is not that he, he is not, but how his wife and society treats him. <br /> <br /> I think this is a timeless story of men going to fight for their country and when they come home time has left them behind. Chabert is a tragic figure made even more touching by the extraordinary Gerard Depardieu. I don't care that it was in 1 million movies, it's captivating. <br /> <br /> Fanny Ardant has a horrible character to play. Once a prostitute, Rose used her feminine wiles to scale the social ladder. Are his emotions true for Compte Ferraud? I think they are and maybe they pair it with his social position at the time, and you start to feel a little empathy for her. <br /> <br /> Fabrice Lucini is slowly making its way into my heart. It's exceptional here like Derville. <br /> <br /> I think if you can get your hands on this jewel of a movie, you won't regret it. French cinema at its best.
