Despite a stupid premise, ridiculous plot devices and low budgets, Tourist Trap <br /> <br /> manages to be surprising. An inventive film, beautifully marked, a must see. You have to throw rationality out of the window to fully appreciate what the director was trying to do. If you can do it, it will pleasantly surprise you. Also note that this is one of the few semi-classic horror films that has not been spoiled by numerous sequels.
