The Best of Everything is a big-screen soap opera that follows the careers of four career women, Hope Lange, Suzy Parker, Diane Baker and Martha Hyer in a New York publishing house. What is best for some women is not necessarily the best for everyone. <br /> <br /> Presiding over this group of young fillies is the wise old mare Joan Crawford who has been around the track a few times on the screen and in real life. At home he seems to be just like the landlady. <br /> <br /> At the time he was doing The Best of Everything, Joan Crawford became a widow when her fourth husband, Alfred Steele, died. It was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found him dead in the bed next to her. He inherited all his shares in Pepsi Cola where he was chairman of the board and during the same period in which The Best of Everything was released, he finished with the queen bee at Pepsi Cola. Life sometimes imitates art. So that authority, while barking dictation and coffee orders for Hope Lange, is true. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the women here, with the exception of Lange, have gone out of their way for a bad sled. It's hard even for Lange, but it literally does the best of everything. <br /> <br /> What a stinky collection men are in this film. The best of them, Stephen Boyd, is a heavy drinker. The other Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans and Brett Halsey, are a thin collection of rodents like never before for a film. <br /> <br /> I can't forget Brian Aherne, who is the capricious headstrong of this firm publication. Half of that office would have had sexual harassment causes today. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful shots set in New York in the 1950s make the film a real show. Take it by all means.
