This was a great surprise for me. I had never heard of this film when I saw it for the first time, and the title really aimed at something other than a great situation of terrorism / hostage in a high school. Toy Soldiers has the best of his time in the early 1990s, where action movies were carefree and very funny. The action is good, the plot is interesting and really exaggerated, the villain is a hateful one-dimensional douchebag (which is fantastic), there is Louis Gossett Jr., it is simply a wellness film that I appreciated very much. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong with this if you like the action. I give him a solid rating of 8/10.
