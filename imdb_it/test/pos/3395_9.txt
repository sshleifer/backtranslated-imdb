Having just seen this with my mother (who took it for Christmas) I was excited to find something different from the usual things I used to watch. All the stories have been detailed and you are able to experience a strong emotion towards each character from the beginning. Each plot is followed brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for each individual character. The cast is fantastic, my favorites are James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, like George Hazard and Madeline Fabray / LaMotte / Main. Everything is thorough and wonderful, making the vision very compulsive, I recommend it to almost everyone.
