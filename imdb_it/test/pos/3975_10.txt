The best thing about the "pie" of the American Pie. I found the humor and plot to be a much more engaging audience than any American Pie movie to date. Also with regards to the adequacy of the content, I found that this is acceptable for a much wider audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I really enjoyed this cinematic experience. When the movie came out, I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not seeing it while it was still in the theater ... Now I regret this decision. The film far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialogue / scripting and general quality. I give him two thumbs up!
