The Golden Door is the story of the journey of a Sicilian family from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, convinces his family to leave their homeland in Sicily, to make the arduous journey through the stormy seas and to live in a land whose rivers seem to flow with the milk. In short, they believe that risking everything for the New World will make their dreams of prosperity come true. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, intelligent and very imaginative. Silver coins rain from the sky on Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he will be in the New World; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being collected to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will produce. All these images are surrealistically intertwined with the characters and pleasantly contribute to compliment the gritty realism that history reveals to the public. The contrast between this imaginary and the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps to give hope while on board the ship for the New World. <br /> <br /> The journey to the New World is turned almost completely in the dark, especially when sea storms roar and almost kill people inside. The dark reality to which I referred is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is depicted as a bit indigent and primitive. This is shown as Salvatore hastens to sell the few belongings he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) to get the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was quite interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code to be accepted into the New World; he was almost suggesting that people had to adapt to a particular stereotype or mold to be recognized morally fit. The most powerful image of the film was when the ship was leaving its land and sailing for the New World. This shot shows a view from above of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from each other, depicting the separation between the Old and the New World. This shot also suggested that people were ripped from everything that was once familiar, wanted to divorce their previous obscure living conditions and were eager to enter a world that had more promises. <br /> <br /> As later opposed to how the New World visually looks, the Old World looks dark and gloomy compared to the bright but foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty was never shown through the fog on Ellis Island, but remained hidden. I think this was an intentional directorial choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty represents: "Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry" seemed a joke about what these people had to go through when coming to the new world. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (ie explanations, maths, riddles, etc.) to prove themselves fit for the New World. These tests have completely changed the outlook of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the most difficult time submitting to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams offered hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore does not change much with respect to his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like what the New World actually seemed to disappoint him. This attitude was shared above all by all those who traveled with him. Their characteristic arcs refer more to the fact that a dear dream is very upset and an obscure reality that must be accepted. <br /> <br /> The film seems to make a strong comment on preparing to enter a heavenly and civil society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. To adhere to these rules is to prevent illness, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a comment on how America has learned from the failures of other nations and so has been specially established to make sure these plagues have not infested and destroyed. Although the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help people thrive.
