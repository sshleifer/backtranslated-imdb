One of Scooby Doo's many cartoons, "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster" turns out to be fun, exciting, interesting, fun and also makes a surprisingly good interpretation of the Scottish Highlands. One annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters - Americans trying to play Scottish in this film unfortunately can't do very well (although some people do better Scottish accents than others). <br /> <br /> Daphne came to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland games at Blake Castle. Gravely Shannon tells the band that he believes he saw the Loch Ness monster. When more chaos arises, the Mystery Inc Gang has another mystery in their hands ... <br /> <br /> Good for Scooby Doo fans and for people who want to learn more about Scotland! Enjoy "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"! :-)
