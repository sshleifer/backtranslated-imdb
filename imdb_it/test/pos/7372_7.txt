"Campfire Tales" is essentially composed of three ghostly stories told by a group of friends after a car accident in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic story of "Hook", and then we are introduced to the group of friends who return home from the concert. They crash into their car, turn off the flares and light the fire in a small abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, terrified honeymooners, a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house. As they tell disturbing stories, each story becomes more and more terrifying, but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the scariest and some effects genuine and scary. The first story was fine, and the sequence of campers towards the end was a little disturbing. The second story built a lot of suspense, more than both of them did, but the unoriginal plot was ruin. I remember seeing this movie a long time ago when I was eight in HBO and the third episode scared the hell out of me, even though it doesn't scare me now. You will probably recognize some of the casts here, especially Amy Smart from the preview of the "hook" interlude, and Christine Taylor as one of the main actresses in the film. Even the ending was interesting, I know I didn't see it coming, I thought it was cleverly put together. <br /> <br /> To sum up, if you're looking for a horror movie that's worth it, rent this, you should be happy. It's a great anthology of some classic urban legends, and the whole film has been tied in an orderly way. It's much better than you'd expect. 7/10.
