Some users are confused about the identity of the gunmen walking along the steps of the "Scala Odessa" sequence. These men are not Cossacks but regular army troops. <br /> <br /> The Cossacks arrive on the scene a little later and it is the men on horses who strike the crowd with their sabers. <br /> <br /> For experts in Russian history: correct me if I am wrong. <br /> <br /> But there are a couple of lines in the film that nobody apparently commented on. After the acquisition of the Potemkin, someone in the crowd says "Kill the Jews!" This is on the screen for just a couple of seconds, but it's there. <br /> <br /> As cruelly typical of history, not only in Russia but in many other countries, for immediately, without thinking about it and instinctively, accusing the Jews of any domestic problems! <br /> <br /> Perhaps other parts of the film are not historically real, but the protest against the Jews is all too real. Comments, anyone? <br /> <br /> Also, why can't English speakers learn to pronounce the name like "Potyomkin" instead of "Potemkin"? It is necessary in Russian to distinguish the two possible pronunciations of "e": as "ye" or as "yo". Sometimes two points are used to distinguish these two pronunciations, but usually the difference must simply be memorized.
