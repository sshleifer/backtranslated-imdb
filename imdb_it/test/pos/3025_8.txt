"The Cell" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot, "a psychotherapist travels inside a coma-killer serial, hoping to save his latest victim", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But this does not do justice to this film. There is a fantastic aspect to subconscious minds that is amazing, with sumptuous visions and incredible scenarios of awareness. There is a drama like the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez before she becomes an exclusively romantic comic) she comes into contact with the child and bears witness to her terrifying education. And there is certainly a horror facet due to the disgusting actions of the evil character of the serial killer. The film attempts to function on many different levels and crosses the boundaries of the genre at will. While I feel it ends up being a pretty bizarre experience, I find it completely fascinating. <br /> <br /> Right from the opening credits, with Lopez riding a horse across the desert dressed in a stunning white dress, you will know that you are in for a visual treatment. Every time the public leaves reality and follows it into the sub-consecrated depths of its "patients", a party of visual and sound delight is guaranteed. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colors. The camera leaves regularity at the door and crosses a world where up and down are the same. The characters become rulers of their domains and become creatures worthy of such importance. If you don't like anything else on "The Cell", you will surely be impressed by the work done in these scenes. <br /> <br /> Casting is also top notch. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here, using her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibility, combining her striking appearance with lush surroundings, make-up and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and personally I want someone to find another role for her outside the rom-com world where she was randomly inserted, which would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is quite convincing as an FBI agent who will do anything to save a young woman's life. But it is undoubtedly Vincent D'Onofrio who has the biggest impression here. It is an extremely difficult role as it is required to bring out more emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted by his actions, yet sympathizers towards him because of the trauma he experienced during his life. He looks magnificently powerful in his realm, but insecure and vulnerable in the real world. It is a great performance by an undervalued actor. <br /> <br /> While "The Cell" does not work as well at every level ambitiously tries (some actions of the characters are not credible) and while it is all based on a fairly inconsistent scientific logic, it is a trip occasionally shocking, visually stunning that rewards more visions.
