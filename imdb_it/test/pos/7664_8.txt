I love Thackeray's novel on which this film is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is a B movie, Loy's casting, in his first leading role, is quite fascinating. <br /> <br /> Before Loy became the good girl of MGM in a series of noble and comic roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was Loy's next film at EMMA, in which he plays a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the faithful housekeeper (Marie Dressler). <br /> <br /> Loy's Becky is much meaner than Miriam Hopkins version 3 years later in BECKY SHARP. Loy Becky is a very early film character with his deep necklines and amoral ways. It's the kind of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could easily have interpreted, but Becky should still be a fine set here. This is what makes his character fall so tragic. <br /> <br /> In contrast to Loy's acceptance, Becky is the good friend Amelia (Barbara Kent) who is not an interesting character. Mary Forbes is as cold as Mrs Sedley. Most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are almost Dickensian is their bizarre: Billy Bevan like Giuseppe; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu Love as the Marches; Lilyan Irene as Polly the maid; Elspeth Dudgeon is the housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Loy is in front of and at the center of everything. While the ending is rather shocking, it has several excellent scenes, like the casino gambling scene where it attempts to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. The more Becky of Loy falls morally, the more beautiful she becomes until she is "captured". The conclusion is that this is a very solid performance of Loy in a film that should be seen.
