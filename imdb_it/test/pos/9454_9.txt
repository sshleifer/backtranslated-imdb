I thought this movie would have been totally lame based on the ads I saw in theaters. When my sister borrowed from a friend, I decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . .I wanted to say ten minutes in the film and I loved it. Amanda was a great actor in the film, her comic timing was perfect. The guy who played Duke was warm, simple and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda walks by the gardener and a classmate who is suspicious of her and is talking to her mother about clothes - like she's pretending to be a boy! I saw this part over and over again ... in short, the film I thought would be lame - now I have it.
