I don't know what the CKY crew is, but everything they produce seems to be brilliant in its simplicity and stupidity. Haggard is so incredibly stupid and funny that it's almost comic excellence. Sometimes it makes absolutely no sense, but who cares? <br /> <br /> It made my ass laugh. A must-have for the CKY / Jackass enthusiast!
