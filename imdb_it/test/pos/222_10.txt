The most entertaining show ever on TV, even if humor is not for everyone. I realize that it would have been difficult to keep the show cool if it lasted longer, but it's a pity that only six episodes were shot. The gags fly quickly from the opening credits to the end, when you see Drebin and his boss, Ed Hocken, pretend to be in still image while the credits roll, during which the criminal (still in motion) would see everyone else motionless and try to escape. In another episode, the building began to collapse around them while Drebin and Hocken remained in freeze mode. <br /> <br /> Was Leslie Nielsen a comic genius like Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show? how he managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me. Since the jokes and the gags of sight arrived so often and quickly, you can watch the episodes a second and third time and capture the things you lost the first time. If you are like me, you can watch them again and again and still laugh. Even the jokes that made no sense or apparently had any reason for them, such as the tag "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln" in the opening announcement, somehow worked ?? maybe they were thrown out for this reason. <br /> <br /> Cleverly spoofing old Quinn Martin cops / cops from the 70s, the Police Team would return from the commercial break with the words "Act Two" appearing on the screen, which was immediately followed by "Yankees One "or some other line. On the opening credits, the title of the episode appeared on the screen, but the announcer would have uttered a completely different title. My favorite lines and jokes in this series are too numerous to list, but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks an unlucky boxer who had previously fought the fights, "Do you think you can beat the champion?" The boxer replies: "I can wear it blindfolded!" To which Drebin replies, "What if he wasn't blindfolded?" A minute later, referring to the boxer's small and squalid apartment, Drebin says to him: "I'll help you get out of this sewer". The next thing you see, Drebin is popping up through a manhole on the road! In another episode, Drebin and Hocken are questioning the fragile alibi of a bombing suspicion. Drebin, not believing it, says "Okay, let's say you went to the cinema". After a brief pause, Drebin, Hocken and the suspect all look towards the camera and in unison say "You went to the cinema". Moments later, when Drebin is forced to leave the suspected free bomber due to lack of evidence, he rushes off and shouts angrily: "Tell that bomber to take off!" What you see next is a policeman giving his thumbs-up to a WWII plane on a runway right outside the building! While there were many classic quotations from Drebin, a particularly memorable one was: "I'm sorry to disturb you Mrs. Twice. We would have come earlier, but your husband hadn't died then." Another classic was: "I am a blacksmith and, I am a blacksmith". When a visibly shaken kidnapped father asks Drebin, "What do I do?" ?? Drebin, in a classic and impassive way, answers: "Well, as I understand you, you are in the textile sector". As I said, humor is not for everyone ?? many people simply do not "understand" it. During the short series of the show, I remember that the reaction was very mixed. Some thought he was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things around, while others thought he was stupid and not funny. For me, Police Squad, even 20 years later, is the most fun I've ever seen on TV. For younger viewers who love this kind of humor but have never seen the police team because they were too young when the series first aired, I highly recommend it. I found the six episodes even more fun than the next "Naked Gun" movies.
