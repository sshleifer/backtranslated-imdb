It is not often that the last film of a great director becomes a moving, brilliantly realized and filmed masterpiece. The cast is excellent as is the camcorder. What begins as a cheerful meeting of a group of well-educated citizens from the beginning of the twentieth century, Dublin becomes a dark and philosophical narrative on all our fear of death and the sometimes obscure shadows of the past. Thank you, Mr. Huston, for this last piece of great cinema!
