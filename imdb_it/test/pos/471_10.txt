This was a fantastic film about two people, a young teenager and the other, a middle-aged man, who are each looking for someone to help them satisfy a certain void left by ex-loved ones. <br /> <br /> Both actors offer brilliant performances to which the public can refer. The script, although written by Gorman Bechard, looks like it was written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time, men can relate to male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you silent. I would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt alone or abandoned by a loved one. In this film it is clear that you are not alone.
