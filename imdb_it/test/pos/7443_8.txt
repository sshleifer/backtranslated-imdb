The film is really beautiful, I thought. It sticks pretty well to the original game, and some battle scenes are represented with such a high detail, it's incredible. I thought the film could have been a little better if they gave you some more information before the end, but trying to figure out what's going on is what attracts you to this movie. <br /> <br /> The CG is nice, I don't think they could have done a better job with regards to graphics. Every little detail, the way they move, the way their swords appear, everything is perfect. The way they make characters appear is almost like real people. <br /> <br /> The music was fantastic, and I found it fun to hear how much the original game has been remixed with new instruments and effects. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves fast-paced action and a good storyline. I would definitely play before watching the movie.
