In the end I got Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and aroused the score of Henry Mancini to the maximum. After having watched Lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, I have to say that the "uncut" DVD version was both great and disappointing. The American version is so * very * better than the DVD version (European?). The American version of Lifeforce moves much faster (the DVD version is terrible. It looks like an unfinished cut). And the many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, a "new" moment almost destroys the entire film, when Caine (peter firth) meets the male alien in the cathedral. I love this scene, however, in the American version. On the DVD, the male stranger talks to Caine and what he says is very hilarious. It is the pinnacle of hilarity: <br /> <br /> "It will be much less terrifying if you come to me!" the male stranger says, in a deep 50s-style voice. I was speechless when I saw it. It simply does not belong to the film. That scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious film. I'm happy that Hooper (or anyone else) cut that scene when the movie was released in North America. There are several changes made to the American version that make Lifeforce much better and I wanted the DVD to have the American version. The editing is sharp and frantic without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the American version are even more boring in the DVD version due to the added scenes. And the DVD headlines are terrible. Much better in the American version. Thinner. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. In practice, the aliens make a pit stop on the earth and suck as much as possible Lifeforce. The film has too many flat and carefree sequences (talking, talking, talking) but when the action goes to London, it's fun. The film really shines in these scenes. One can see Hooper finally doing what is good at: chaos, ferocity, horror! Lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. They are the best apocalyptic scenes ever staged. It's also the best zombie movie ever. Zombies are hungry (for life force, not meat) and are crazy, agile and terrifying. Not the annoying movements of other zombie movies. Moreover, many people have criticized the ending, but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, like one of the dried up victims of life force. <br /> <br /> And to think that this film came out during the eighties graceful and cuddly, when people crowded the E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good science fiction movies. No wonder he was bombed because he was far ahead of his time with his super nihilistic point of view! <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, well, it's not great. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras. But it's nice to see the movie in its widescreen format. I just hope they will release a clean and sharp American version on a DVD and with comments from Hooper and Dykstra.
