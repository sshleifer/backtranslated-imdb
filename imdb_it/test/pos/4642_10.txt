For a movie that was PG, this is a funny movie. I grew up watching this movie over and over again. It's really fun, I don't know how the public will react today, but if you've grown or loved the 80s, then this is a great movie. Stephen Furst is as big as Harold, who, I think, is one of the best characters in the film. Paul Ruebens also opens for about 10 minutes. I love nostalgia
