The masterpiece of silent cinema Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the 1905 uprising and to establish the event as a heroic omen of the October Revolution of 1917. Ironically, the director of the film, Sergei Eisenstein, was one of the first and most influential supporters of a formalistic approach to the art of cinema. Subsequently, Eisenstein's formalism and suspicious politics would have caused countless conflicts with government agencies that insisted on "socialist realism". Influenced by Russian film theorist Lev Kuleshov and through him by DW Griffith's Intolerance (smuggled to Russia in 1919), Eisenstein built his films from a "collision" of rapidly modified images, a montage of shots of varying duration, movement, content , lighting and camera angle. Without doubt the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the most quoted and studied sequence in the history of world cinema - is the "Odessa Steps" sequence in Potemkin. <br /> <br /> In the structure Potemkin is a "five reeler" divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the arrangement in five acts of Western drama. In "Men and Larvae", Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and the discontent of the sailors of the working class of the battleship when the situation inevitably turns into mutiny. Even before sailors and their upper class officers / masters are visually introduced, Eisenstein symbolically establishes revolutionary conditions by modifying the collisions of waves that break violently and threateningly into the sea. On board the ship we witness crowded and unhygienic conditions. Eisenstein emphasizes the dehumanization of sailors with arbitrary strokes of lashes, hard work, and - the most memorable - the larva-infested meat for dinner in the evening. The short-sighted doctor of the ship is carried forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suited to be served with dark soup, boiling as the anger of the sailors. In agreement with the Marxist maxims, the church also fails the men, and we see one of them smashing a slab engraved with the words of The Lord's Prayer from two different angles of shooting (perhaps the first deliberate "leap" in the history of cinema). br /> <br /> Identified by titles such as "Drama on the Quarterdeck" and "An Appeal from the Dead", the second and third parts of Potemkin depict the real mutiny and the funeral on the ground of its leader and the first hero of the revolution, Vakulinchuk. United by appeals to the brotherhood of Vakulinchuk, the first mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack against the officers. A chaotic scene follows whose violent passion is well served by Eisenstein's editing techniques. The officers' quarters are trampled and the symbols of their privileges are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic shortcuts to the meat full of larvae and his glasses that hang metonymically in the rigging. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the revolt (no omelette without breaking eggs) and is placed with dignity on a pier in Odessa. Hundreds of Odessa ordinary citizens meet with sailors to honor him and to swear "Death to the oppressors". Fists of fists that tighten and open reveal the birth of revolutionary consciousness. <br /> <br /> The complex and unforgettable sequence of Odessa Steps is the fourth act in the film. Start with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the exalted faces of different people on the shore and selected objects (umbrella, eyeglasses, baby carriage). Suddenly (as a business card exclaims in huge letters) the music stops and the lines of soldiers with handguns and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. Here Eisenstein frees all the strength of the collision modification when nearly a hundred shots are put together to counter the terrified chaos and victimization of citizenship with the relentless onslaught of soldiers who lead citizens to walkable horses and the waiting Cossack sabers below. The staging is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the end, symbolic methods for the oppressive institutions of Russia: tsarist monarchy and Orthodox Christian church. <br /> <br /> Punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children. In the first, a mother and a boy who were introduced among the joyful faces of the crowd are among the first victims of the massacre. The boy is hit, but the mother continues to run until the close-ups of his face transmit his horrified look to the fallen body of the son trampled by the crowd. With a very slow pace of editing, the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of the child up the stairs to face the soldiers (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). They kill it summarily. After this pause, the carnage continues for another series of cuts until a second mother is hit through the stomach (Mother Russia's womb?) While trying to protect her baby in her carriage. In a scene imitated in The Untouchables, the carriage slips incongruously down the stairs. Distraught faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress towards its destiny. When the carriage reaches the bottom, there is a cut to a Cossack wielding a sword and a classic Kuleshov effect suggests what we don't really see: the massacre of this pure and symbolic innocent. The final series of strokes in the Odessa sequence consists of three stone lions, one at rest, one sitting and one roaring. The montage animates them in a visual metaphor of the awakened anger of the people. <br /> <br /> In a slightly anti-climactic way, the fifth act takes us back to the battleship while the mutineers sail on the high seas and wait for a meeting with other ships from the fleet. They and the spectator expect a salary, but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors salute and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of camaraderie. Eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years. But apart from this quirk, Battleship Potemkin stands as one of the fundamental works of the silent film era, and retains an extraordinary cinematic power.
