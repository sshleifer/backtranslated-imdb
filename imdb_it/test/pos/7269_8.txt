I've been waiting since last October to watch this movie! (He had to go out in October 1998) and now I've finally seen him I'm not disappointed. Honestly wonderful! OK at first it was a bit slow, but once it started it's an exciting fingernail, Robert Carlyle is so different from Gaz in 'The Full Monty' and Begbie in 'Trainspotting' that it's hard to recognize! And Johnny Lee Miller, no longer with his blonde Sick Boy 'Trainspotting', plays his gentleman author with the right sense of humor and sensitivity that it's easy to see why Liv Tylers Rebecca falls in love with him. A great movie. As Hades in "Hercules" by Disney would say: "Two thumbs up!"
