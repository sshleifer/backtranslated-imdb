All budding filmmakers should watch this film - it's like a masterclass for making digital movies in itself. Some scenes seem to have been shot at much higher production values ​​than they actually were. It is very encouraging that a job so well done can be done on a low budget. The acting is very good, and the characters are very interesting, in particular that of the protagonist (John Kielty), who manages to play a teenager who encounters difficulties while remaining very nice. Her beautiful but faded mother was also very well represented, and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing. This is a very bizarre and interesting piece and I will look for anything else made by the same team. The director is definitely one to watch.
