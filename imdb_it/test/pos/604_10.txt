Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a fascinating, fun and brilliant film that can be seen and appreciated by adults and children. I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters, great history and great spirit that is irresistible. The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteer and voiced by Henson) in her odyssey across America to follow her Hollywood dream. Along the way he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and DR. Teeth and electric chaos. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many good things I can't even say. But it is memorable and every time I think of a puppet or a muppet, I will think of this film. Look for the cameos of Mel Brooks, Dom De Louis, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles. Excellent and spectacular, one of the best films of the 70s. A ++
