For all the spectators out there who have beaten John Waters for creating a movie like Pink Flamingos, just stop. It doesn't get you anywhere. Someone has never bothered to stop and think about Mr. Waters' ambition and dedication. To bring your best friends together and make a movie just to get thousands of spectators out of it, this man has a great ambition within him. Just read his biography Shock Value. Discuss the lengths he went through to finish this film. Perhaps it was not just the fact that John made this film to get people out, it was to show that there may be something good in bad taste>
