I waited almost 25 years to see this horror thriller hard to find and I finally did it since it's a real rebirth on DVD. Obviously it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have been if I had seen the 80s, but the director Lieberman (his movie "Squirm" is excellent) makes good use of the adorable Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just for having them sent creatively. An important note, the music of Brad Fiedel's whistles is truly gruesome and adds to the desolate acts making this great fun for fans of the genre. A must see if you like horror movies that are underestimated. To describe it would be an intelligent "Friday The 13th" sprinkled with some tasty pieces of "Deliverance". Apart from that, there are some really fantastic and original moments like my favorite when a couple is swimming in a lake and the boy disappears underwater to play a trick for his girlfriend - just when you think it's the usual scare, he suddenly looks ashore and ... honestly I can't ruin it, you just have to watch it for yourself. Besides, is the ending just one of those you just have to see to believe? it came out of nowhere and it's weird and wild! The DVD includes comments by Lieberman.
