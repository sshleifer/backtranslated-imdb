Born in 1946, I was about eight years old when I was watching this film and left a deep impression. Not only scary, for lack of a better word, this film haunted me for more than 50 years. The goon mob played by John Larch was terrifying. The only scene that came to my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the indifferent cop who referred to her as a "little n ----- boy ". Those words were replaced when the film was recently shown on TV, maybe there are two versions of the film or someone feels obliged to change this heart-breaking scene a little. Accurate or not the film has come a long way in formulate my opinion on the South and still to date the closest I came to visit a southern city is El Paso. That stand may seem extreme but there is a little more to the story. When the film was shown recently it became clearer because it haunted me for years. With the newsreel how to start this film gives the impression that what is shown is done. The film is supposedly made only a year or two after the incidents represented have added to its realistic credibility. The terror in the film is not provided by creatures or space aliens but by people who live in our society at the moment. Let's kill the girl: The recent vision helped me to better clarify the impact she had on my 8-year-old mind. When this film came out, the only school I had ever been to was frequented mostly by African-Americans. The victim looked like a girl in my class, it was like seeing a real murder. It made a horrible scene much worse. Perhaps no one will find this review useful but it helped me.
