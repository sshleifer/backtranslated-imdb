I'm a guy, so I was very reluctant to watch the movie because I know Richard Gear likes to be in the tear-jerky movies. I'd rather watch action / adventure / sci fi. I was right, the film is definitely a rip. Diane had a tendency to act a few times, like Richard did, but they took it around and made it work. The daughter was a repressed teenager with a huge attitude, so you started to hate her. The film is too predictable, but for entertainment purposes it was a masterpiece. Go and get it, see if you don't leave a tear. If you like the notebook, you will love this. The beach scenes have been immaculate. even though the hurricane scenes were a bit out of sequence, it was still a bit of a panic to watch them react.
