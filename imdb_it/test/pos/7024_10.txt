One of the biggest movies released in the 1980s, Dirty Dancing was a low-budget film with high returns. With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance, to a love story that we all want to be able to live (at least if you're a female), this is a movie you'd like to see over and over again. <br /> <br /> Music, which is what drives the film, is optimistic and flows well with the emotions that are drawn from the viewer. From the classic successes of the 60s such as "Love Man" by Otis Redding and "Big Girls Do not Cry" by Frankie Valli to the 80's hits like "Hungry Eyes" by Eric Carmen and "Overload" by Frank Zappacosta, Dirty Dancing is a mix of fun and sensual, which shows the transformation of a young girl from a shy teenager into a woman in bloom, all against the background of a summer love story that we all hope for and we want to transform ourselves into more. <br /> <br /> The dance in "Dirty Dancing" should not be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in the role of Penny, a dancer who could challenge even the most fluid and supple gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than a fantastic job and shows more and more of his abilities, not only as an actor, but also as a dancer and singer. And Jennifer Gray shines like Baby, while her transformation in dance also portrays her transformation into the state. <br /> <br /> All in all, Dirty Dancing is one of the best films of all time, and it's worth looking at least once. It is unlikely that the first rhythms of "Be My Baby" by Ronette in the opening title do not catch your attention and attract you into a magical world of sensual dance and musical charm.
