"The Gig" is a small, fun and moving film about a group of friends who have gathered regularly to play Dixieland for fun. The group unexpectedly lands a real paid job, in the language of a musician; a concert". <br /> <br /> They travel north to New York for a two-week concert at a summer resort minus a member, who bows because of contracted cancer. At the last minute, they hire a professional to take his place. Things get sticky when a guy Frankie Valli on a hill attempts a return to the resort and tries to use the group as his band. <br /> <br /> The attitude of the professional bass player gave the boys a real tone. By signing up to play the two-week concert, they were taking bread from the mouth of someone who needed work to feed their family. While the stars Pop, Rock, Rap, Country and Western, and R & B earn with the albums. Jazz musicians must travel abroad to earn a living. Hardly anyone gets rich. The boys who live their dream also cost others a necessary income. <br /> <br /> I believe that almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with some dreams of competence in playing a "concert" at one time or another, Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two famous examples of this crossover amateur-professional. I especially recommend this film to anyone who has ever played music professionally. My mom, who was a musician, loved it.
