I was at a friend's house for Thanksgiving and was watching a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years, (I loved the McMullen brothers), and I was impressed by the goodness of this movie. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this film was shot on Super 16. The picture was so good, it looked like it was a 35mm shot. Furthermore, the music combined with Fred Carpenter's directing was art. The plot was original and led to an ending that surprised us all to look ... very nice. The acting of the whole cast was good, especially the actor who played Uncle Benny. He was fantastic. This film was a real pleasure for the holidays and I was happy to have been one of the first to see a movie that many will see in the future.
