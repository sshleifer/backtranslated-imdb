I did not read the source, the Richard Brooks novel "The Brick Foxhole", which I hope is not as unhappy as the title, but I understand that the original villain was a homophobic not an anti-Semite. (And to be honest, Sam Levene was written as a gay guy who picks up a drunken soldier.) But, okay, you have to go with the flow. Consider 1947. Not even anti-Semitism was treated on the screen. Many of those responsible for contemporary films were themselves Jews, but anti-Semitism had been pronounced for years because it was considered unpleasant. So we can't blame the creators of this movie for not leaving the homosexual victim. This is REALLY unpleasant - and also there may have been many in the audience that cheered on Robert Ryan to get away with it. We are not at all without prejudices, but we are still far from 1947. <br /> <br /> Looking at him again for the first time in years, I was impressed by the rather slow pace of the first half of the film, the numerous shots of two people who talk, the shadows, the time that passes between the question and the answer, the uninspired assembly. But I could live with it for the subject of the film and for some other things. <br /> <br /> One of the things that keeps me glued to the events as they unfold so deliberately is the performance of Robert Ryan. The boy does a magnificent job. Sometimes it can seem thoughtful, cheerfully subordinate and useful to the police - "In any case I can help you, yes sir." Then, alone or with another soldier, latent hatred rises upward, not so much through what he says, but the way LOOK does. That frown, that piercing look, those dark eyes that sparkled. Wow. <br /> <br /> The film took a lot of heat due to Robert Young's preaching speech about his grandfather's murder. This doesn't bother me at all, although I imagine Dmytryk didn't need to have Young push his face towards the camera while he was talking about "MICKS and PAPISTS". However, taking into account the context, it is one of the film's most shocking moments. Part of its impact is due to the almost random delivery of the message by Young, and part of it is due to the fact that the message was never heard on the screen before. <br /> <br /> Another feature of the film that turns it almost into the surreal is the character of Paul Kelly and his relationship with the whore Gloria Grahame. Holy Guacamole, to which elliptic conversation Kelly is given. "Do you know what I told you? All those things I just told you? They are all lies." His character perfectly crosses the pathos with creepy. It is impossible to know what to do with him. It adds practically nothing to the plot, but the film would be much less without its presence. <br /> <br /> It's a moody, dark movie. His people live in darkness. And there is murder on foot. Virtually no one screams or shouts. The horror that these men lived and that some of them still carry with them as malaria seems just below the surface. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you get the chance.
