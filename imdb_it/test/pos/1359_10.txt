Some say that this anime could be offensive to girls ... not really. Embarrassing situations are fun; The first time I see this series I was in the video store, the people around me started laughing, no matter their age or sex. One teacher said that to ensure someone's attention in a book the beginning must be fun and the ending should not be obvious simply by reading the last page. During the first minutes of the series the boy is hit by a car, during the last moments of the series, the same machine appears. The episodes had a touching and amusing ending, especially the last one. I don't regret buying these series.
