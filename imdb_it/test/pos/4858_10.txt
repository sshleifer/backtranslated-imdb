The essential message - which Miller would certainly have wanted after seeing Vichy's war crimes trials - is that someone's hatred without a rational basis is a waste of life. Meat Loaf's character, Fred, has known Lawrence for many years, yet when the time comes, at the request of his fanatical supporters, he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their "target" group. For me, this is the crucial message: no matter what Lawrence and his wife do from this point on - they are tagged and have a chance to save themselves by reason. The aggressiveness and anger of animals have made Fred's Union thugs blind to reality. A friend of mine suggested that I should see "The Wave" to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realizing it. I once conducted an experiment in a role play and was shocked to see how normal and balanced people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state, which would threaten them all - because it crept in gradually. > <br /> Fred is the beginning, his friends from LA and the preacher's idol are the catalyst that pushes his neighbors beyond the threshold of violence without stopping to think that what they are doing is wrong. <br /> <br /> between Lawrence and Finkelstein, the Jewish merchant is fascinating, because Lawrence loses the point until the end: if the fanatics force Finkelstein to leave, where should he go? If his family has fled from the Nazis, that irony must be tormented again in the land of "freedom". <br /> <br /> That big poster (it's a fairly famous piece of propaganda) about American families who enjoy the highest standards of living in the world is a very important detail. When you see this movie, look at the graffiti on the subway train and all the little posters. The message also hides there. <br /> <br /> This film should be in the curriculum of every school, especially in our times when unfounded hatred is so widely promoted by "reasonable" people who are just extremists in subtle disguises.
