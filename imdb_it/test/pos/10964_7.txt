In many ways, the film career of independent film legend John Cassavetes is the exact opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock, the consummate director of the studio. Where Hitchcock treated his actors like a bad animal, Cassavetes tried to work with them suddenly. Where every element of a Hitchcock film is impeccably composed, Cassavetes worried less about the way a scene was composed figuratively than in what it felt, or what it emotionally transmitted. Hitchcock's stories have always been stories of plot, with the human element placed in the background. Cassavetes puts the human experience at the forefront of each of his films. If some things didn't make much sense logically, so be it. <br /> <br /> You can also see this from his first movie, Shadows from 1959, shot with a 16mm handheld camera, on a shoe string budget of about $ 40,000, in Manhattan, with the company of Cassavetes workshop repertoire and touted as an improvisational film. The story is rather simple, as follows the life of three black brothers in Manhattan - Benny (Ben Carruthers) - a trumpeter and no story, Hugh (Hugh Hurd) - a washed singer, and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) - the younger sister of both. The three main arches of the film concern Hugh's failures as a nightclub singer and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny's walks in a Manhattan with his two friends without accounts; and Lelia's lover - first with a white boy Tony (Anthony Ray), who does not realize the breed of light-skinned Lelia, not even after having looked after her; then with Davy (Davey Jones) stiff and correct, which could be a misogynist. <br /> <br /> In the first arc, nothing happens, except that Hugh, with dark skin, begins to pontificate on how degraded he is to sing in low-class discos, and open shows for female acts. He dreams of making it big in New York, or even in Paris, but it can be said that he is the kind of man who will continue to fool himself with his meager skills, for the only time we hear him sing, he shows that he is a marginal talent , in the best case. That Rupert continues to encourage him gives us a glimpse of how destructive friendships work. But this is the least important of the three strings ?? While this film is overall better than, say, Martin Scorsese's first film, a decade later, Who's That Knocking at My Door ?, another story of failed love novels and frustrated New Yorkers, has none of the bright moments - acting-wise or cinematographically - that film has. Moreover, it is not naturalistic, because naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve, especially in cinema, even if the exteriors of the 1950s in Manhattan, on the ground floor, are a gem to be relived. Although Shadows can, in effect, be an important film with regards to the history of the independent film circuit, surely it is not even close to a great film. Some parts are sermons, little recited, the scenes end up wanting or not, almost like darkening sketches, and sometimes they are apparently cut in the middle. All in all it is a very sloppy work, especially the atrocious jazz soundtrack that is often not synchronized with the rest of the film, since Cassavetes has shown that, as a director, at least in his first film, he was a good actor. The only reason why nobody sees Shadows is because Cassavetes eventually improved with subsequent films, and this gives a clue to his next work style. <br /> <br /> The National Film Registry rightly declared this film as "culturally significant". All this is in line with the belief of art that Cassavetes had long held, as indicated by this quote: "I have never seen a helicopter explode. I have never seen anyone go and blow someone's head off. So why Should I make movies about them? But I've seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way. I've seen people retreat. I've seen people hide behind political ideas, behind drugs, behind the sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and me. I did all these things myself. So I can understand them. What we're saying is so kind. It's kindness. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems. " That this film is "culturally significant" is true, but that truth is not synonymous with "artistically significant". It is in the difference between these two definitions in which great art really thrives.
