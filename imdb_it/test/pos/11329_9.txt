For those who like their movies full of explosive planets and extreme violence, this is definitely not one to see. In fact, there is really little plot (or, at least, very little that cannot be summed up in a few seconds: A meets B. Mr A falls for Mrs B and has a relationship with her. A and B then fall in love and amazed (for a long time) whether to have a relationship alone). <br /> <br /> This is the Cantonese Visconti. The story is not there, but what you get is a succession of wonderful images and acutely banal music that convey the slow passage of the emotions of the central characters. There is also the possibility of seeing one of the most beautiful women in the world in a series of extraordinarily elegant dresses. For my money, it's worth seeing just for that. Why would this woman ever be a heroine of action? It looks like it's straight out of Vogue's pages.
