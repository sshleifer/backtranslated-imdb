I just saw "A Tale of Two Sisters" last night and loved it. I have been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and I think this is a strong entry from South Korea. There aren't many scared jumps like in the usual American horror movie, but the director keeps the offensive mood very well and omen, especially in the interactions between uncomfortable characters. Most fears are more conceptual and play on all the fears of "there is something under the bed" since they were children, but in this case, it is the wardrobe and the sink. I also liked how the director managed to capture how dysfunctional this family is through scenes like the first dinner the characters have together. He's also good at revealing people's inner life and fragility through simple scenes like the stepmother wiping her makeup in the mirror or sitting in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is primarily an exploration of the guilt and consequences of living with that guilt looming over you. <br /> <br /> MAIN SPOILERS AHEAD (DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DON'T WANT THE TWO FACES OF THE REVEALED FILM I was following the story pretty well, but I started to get confused while dragging the bag. However, I think the flashback to the The film is very similar to "The Machinist" in the way that two of the character's guilt feelings eventually lead to mental collapse and disappointment. <br /> <br /> Here is my interpretation of movie: The Su-Yeon we see after the girls return home is the Su-Mi illusion or the real Su-Yeon ghost that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. My opinion, an illusion of Su-Mi. There is a real stepmother, however, and she appears for the first time in the film when she is wearing the gray suit, I believe she is the real stepmother that the father is talking on the phone for the whole first part of the film and she does not appear until she takes it and the door ac asa The stepmother before that point is imagined by Su-Mi (perhaps part of her dual personality?) Who explains the bizarre sequence of the party when the stepmother's brother looks at her as if she were crazy and does not remember anything of what she tells. I think it was Su-Mi who played her stepmother part of her dual personality. The film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes like the stepmother cleaning her makeup in the mirror, which later turns out to actually be Su-Mi cleaning her makeup in the mirror. <br /> <br /> I think the ghosts at home are not entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and either they are Su-Yeon or their mother or both. In the final flashback, it is revealed that Su-Yeon wore the green dress and had the hairpin in his hair when he died. This is the green dress they first showed on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink. Moreover, it is the hairpin that Su-Yeon wore in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother looks under the sink. <br /> <br /> The true stepmother, in the end, is punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes in a scene a bit like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene binds everything together in terms of how both the stepmother is primarily responsible for her death, while Su-Mi has unwittingly played a supporting role. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the "mother" Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry in the flashback is already a ghost. Perhaps by then the mother had already killed herself in the closet. This has remained ambiguous. <br /> <br /> Other things that are suggested but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems that the stepmother, at one point, was a nurse, perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow contributed to the his death also It is not clear when his relationship with his father began and if he caused the death of his mother. It was also suggested that the mother also had mental problems, requesting a nurse. The stepmother alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi that you are starting to take care of your mother. I don't think it meant only physically. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if we accept that the initial stepmother we see is actually Su-Mi, then there is also the suggestion of incest, since the father sleeps with her. Is that why Su-Mi goes crazy and shouts "Don't touch me" every time her father joins her in a subsequent scene? Are they the "dirty things you did" to which he alludes in a later conversation with his father? This film is interesting because of its capacity for different interpretations. Some scenes, however, were a kind of derivative, like the woman in black that crawls around the scene, which reminded me of Kayako's erotic jerky movements in the Ju-On / The Grudge movies. Furthermore, the final scene in which the stepmother finally gets her sweets is a reminiscence of The Ring. Furthermore, the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from "The Sixth Sense" or "The Others". <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked it, however, and it will be interesting to see how The Hollywood remake (which is already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both "The Ring" and "The Grudge", so I'm not one of those haughty guys who insist that remakes can't be good. A remake I'm really excited about is "Dark Water" which will be released this summer. I haven't seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my list to see.
