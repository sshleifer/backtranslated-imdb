Strange but wonderfully original film. Really scary, gruesome and ridiculous in equal measure. The setting of a tall red brick apartment is the perfect backdrop for the eerie action. The thought of a secret room closed in a place like this is pretty good, but when the naive couple starts cleaning the old bed they find in this room, the scene is set for some classic chills. The cast is fantastic. Tanya Dempsey can really chew up some scenarios after being underestimated in other Full Moon movies. Joe Estevez demonstrates why his brother Martin Sheen is much older in Hollywood - his round eyes during the making of the bed scene are really hilarious. Charles Band co-produced with Stuart Gordon and this is truly an exceptional version of Full Moon / Darkwave. Danny Draven also directed Hell Asylum with Dempsey.
