brilliant screenplay .. <br /> <br /> the screenplay is very narrow ... that I will be jellied in the venue .. <br /> <br /> this film is an example for film can only survive with the script and no-story needed .. <br /> <br /> the story is very simple to write in a row. but the script was amazing ... <br /> <br /> brilliant performance by Vijay and Prakashraj .. <br /> <br /> although the plot is similar to okkadu .. the director has only adapted the plot. The Tamil version is much faster than Telugu. <br /> <br /> The film travels straight ahead without any possibility of deviation, even if you can understand every single character. <br /> <br /> continues
