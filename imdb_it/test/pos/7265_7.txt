This film, without a doubt, is the best I've ever seen and really shows what British talent can do. The effects are extraordinarily good considering that the film is set in the mid-eighteenth century, and all the dirt and disgusting dirt of England at that time is captured very well. The characters of the character are developed and enriched, from MaCleane's funny antics to his development in the bandit and the exhibitionist The Gentleman Highwayman contrasts well with Robert Carlyle, whose cynicism and honor show that you can love a thief and a criminal because I quote: He's more honorable in his little finger than any of you fat bastards! "<br /> <br /> It doesn't refer to you of course! But it's probably the most moving and emotion-filled scene ever seen in a movie, but you just have to see it to find out, suffice it to say that it involves the rope around your neck. <br /> <br />
