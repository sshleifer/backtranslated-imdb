We like a movie like "Fame" because we imagine ourselves there - music, dance and theater students, enjoying our self expression. This film has had humor, entertainment and must be an inspiration to young people to try the performing arts. Bravo "Fame". Certainly worth 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Chris
