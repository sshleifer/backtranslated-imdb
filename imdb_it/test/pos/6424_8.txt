"Footprints (on the Moon") is almost certainly the most complicated, twisted and most atypical yellow ever made. It could be a restriction for some of the subgenre's fans, but this film does not feature many of Yellow's brands, such as bloody knife killers (preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves), enchanting and unpredictably dressed beauties and unpredictable red herring. However, to compensate for all this ?? and more ?? "Footprints" benefits from the indescribably mysterious and uninterrupted atmosphere I have ever experienced in this type of film. The level of mystery in this film is so high and unbearable that it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared. Like the female protagonist Alice Cespi, you have absolutely no idea what is happening or why, and this feeling of absolute powerlessness is undoubtedly the main strength of the film. As a spectator, you need to help this poor woman understand the things that overwhelm her, but you simply can't. Alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet and peaceful life is brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize that she has absolutely no recollection of the previous three days. Find a torn photograph of a hotel located on the tourist island of Gama and decide to go there to investigate what happened. On the island many people including a lonely child seem to recognize Alice, only she uses the fake name Nicole, wears a red-haired wig and acts as if she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger. Meanwhile, even the poor girl's nights are restless, as she has repeated dreams of hopping astronauts on the lunar surface and a haunting scientist called Dr. Blackman. The plot of "Footprints" is really bizarre and slowly ruminating, and in particular the cosmic subtagic is really difficult to connect with the rest. Alice assumes that they are just images of a science fiction film that she saw a long time ago, which seems a fairly reasonable explanation, but feel that there is a deeper meaning and an actual connection to all the other events. Fans of fashionable and fashionable Italian cinema cannot afford to miss this movie, really. This is the psychological tour-de-force of director Luigi Bazzoni, with incredibly beautiful photographs and mind-altering music. Despite the lack of violence (or maybe just for this), the film is truly disturbing and the mental agony that Alice honestly crosses affects emotionally even the viewer. As sadly too often in the case of the Gialli cinema, the climax suddenly arrives rather abrupt and almost does not provide an impermeable explanation of all the embarrassing events you have just witnessed in the last hour and a half. However, the content of "Footprints" will keep you thinking long after the film is finished and its strong impact will only increase. Florinda Bolkan is sublime as the tormented protagonist and receives excellent feedback from the limited support cast, including the young Nicoletta Elmi. Even the eminent Euro-cult star Klaus Kinski receives the award, but his role is simply an extended cameo. This film is actually much better than the more acclaimed yellow "The Fifth Cord" by director Bazzoni (and much simpler available), so he hopes "Footprints" will soon also receive a fantastic DVD-release.
