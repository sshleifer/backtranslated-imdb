Directed by a veteran Hollywood director Henry King, who began his career again in 1915, Love is a Many Splendor Thing was one of his last great films. It was based on a Han Suyin bestseller simply called A Many Splendor Thing, the phrase that was borrowed by the author from the poem The Kingdom of God by Francis Thompson in which that word of great splendor "love" was used rather different and rather transcendental context which means the love of God. Made in the 1950s, the film marked, together with the works of directors such as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli, a sort of rebirth of melodrama, its flowering and reaching once again a peak of popularity. <br /> <br /> The story begins when a handsome American reporter, Mark Elliott played by William Holden, once again typecasts into one of his irresistible "playboy" roles, arrives in Hong Kong and meets a young and handsome Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) of semi-Chinese origin half-English who works as a doctor in a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by the Chinese communists. Immediately Mark feels a rather strong attraction towards him, but at first his deep feelings are not at all reciprocated by Han's heart left cold after the death of her husband ("I believe in the human heart now only as a doctor"). But he soon yields to the persistent courtship of enticing Mark and both enter into an apparently unstoppable passionate relationship out of nowhere, including the fact that Mark is unhappily married and his wife does not want to give him a divorce or social relationship differences and prejudices caused by the Chinese origin of Han. But it is still the destiny that has a final word to say in determining the fairness of the eternity of such a blessed love relationship as long as the two presume that it is the ruthless time that is waiting in a rather alarming form of death, prepared at any time to prove its impermanence. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made, Love is a Many Splendor Thing presents beautiful performances by William Holden and Jennifer Jones, a splendid soundtrack winner of an Academy Award from Alfred Newman and extremely romantic, moving, touching, but in the end a story to break the heart. Don't miss this film of great splendor. 8/10 <br /> <br />
