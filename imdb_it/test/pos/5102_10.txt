I saw this movie when it first came out and I didn't know what to expect exactly. What followed Overture was one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. A lush soundtrack of songs and music by Britisher Leslie Bricusse (by Dr. Doolittle and Wilie Wonka and the chocolate factory, as well as making his mark on the Broadway music scene), and marked by the incomparable John Williams. There is no bad song in the whole movie. In addition to some of the most exquisite cinemas, costumes and cinematic settings I've ever seen in a movie. Not to mention the performance nominated by Peter O'Toole's Oscar, and the equally strong performance, in my opinion, of the wonderful Petula Clark. Now, since Peter is not the same caliber as a singer who is Petula, he still manages to sell his songs to the public, and this, after all, is what it is about. This is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by James Hilton and deserves to be appreciated for generations to come. I recommend this film for family viewing, although most men will regard this film as a "chick". But if you like a really big musical, then this movie is for you. But keep in mind that a Kleenex spare box is as important as the popcorn for your watching pleasure.
