Good job! It was very exciting and had great stunts. A show that has really shaken. It was a great job for everyone who worked on this; and above all the acting to the part of Bobbie Phillips. It would have been great on the big screen. I would like to see more of these films of the week or maybe a weekly series. This was great entertainment and I'm glad I saw it! By far the best of the three. Keep up the good work UPN and Bobbie Phillips. I'll try the next one.
