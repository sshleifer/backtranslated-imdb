I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and actually didn't start to love the show until the beginning of season four. This "Hush" episode was seen by me only in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing furiously from storm to storm. The authors of this episode did a great job scaring me. I was amazed by the whole episode I just finished 2 minutes ago. Incredible does not touch the surface of what this episode accomplishes almost without dialogue. If you've never thought about this show, at least watch this episode. If this doesn't impress you, probably no episode will. <br /> <br /> BTW My Heart is still running ...
