Wow, what a strange film. It's a David Lynch movie so it's not surprising that it's weird. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone to totally explain everything in this film. I can't be done. After some research that I followed my second vision of this film, I know practically most of the story but, at first sight, and without the help of other reviewers or outside help, it is difficult to understand things. So, if you're on that boat and have been confused, don't feel bad; it's normal. Let me say that the key to the film is the character of Naomi Watts. <br /> <br /> However, I find the film fascinating. I love the wonderful images and the intense colors and find every character in this film really different and fun to watch. The work with the camera is excellent and the music is disturbing, "Blue Velvet" by Lynch. There are also some good sound effects to help some dramatic scenes. In all, it is very well marked. <br /> <br /> Like Lynch's "Twin Peaks" television series, this was a movie in which the end was put together after Lynch thought this movie would be long, designed -out TV series . When this did not happen, he finalized this ending at the last minute. This could explain part of the confusion in the end and the lack of explanations about the characters that we see before in the film, but which mysteriously disappear. <br /> <br /> The theme of the story, presumably, is a negative comment on Hollywood and what it does to people, especially those whose dreams of being an actor are crushed. <br /> <br /> Both Watts and the other main character, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their famous lesbian sex scene. Apparently, both women were chameleons, sometimes average, incredible on other occasions. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this film in second view compared to the first one. It is not just a piece of curiosity; it's a very intriguing movie ..... just don't feel stupid if you can't make sense of a few things.
