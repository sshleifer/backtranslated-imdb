Even the technological balls of Maria Montez / Jon Hall from the 1940s are eclipsed by "Princess of the Nile", Fox's entry into the Hollywood obsession of the 1950s with Egyptian things (see "The land of the pharaohs") , "Valley of the Kings," etc.) Pure, genuine, mindless Hokum, generously produced (in low budget, actually, but using sets and costumes left behind by "The Robe", this technicolored show seems to cost millions). 71 minutes of eye-pleasers (the plot, which has something to do with the nefarious darts - in ancient Egypt, is next to the point) offers the filmmaker and the public the delightful view of Debra Paget wearing an assortment of veils transparent, most of which hit the ground when she shakes and shines through a slave production number unmatched in film history. Film buffs have not recently been changed: Fox's youngest contract player, Jeffrey Hunter, is as photogenic as Mrs. Paget, while Michael Rennie hides in the background, triggering evil deeds in the land of the pyramids. For those who might think that Paget & Hunter can't act and were hired only for their physical characteristics, take a look at their thin, neglected, excruciating work together a few years later in "White Feather" (another production of the Fox who sadly faded into the realm of "lost movies"). "The Princess of the Nile" is still a class of its own as a cheerfully senseless, incredibly fast and breathtaking testament to the glories of Technicolor with 3 stripes - and the seductive charm of Ms. Paget (all 20 at the time). Put this unique classic kitsch on your list of "guilty feelings" and have fun. Satisfaction guaranteed!
