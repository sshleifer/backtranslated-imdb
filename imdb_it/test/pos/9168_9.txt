As I said in the title of this review, it pains me to say it, but "hitch" reaches the zenith of what Hollywood Romantic Comedyies can ever hope to aspire to. I was a critic both of the genre and of the namesake until I can remember myself, but on an almost tragic note, "Hitch" made me pass somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile on my face. <br /> <br /> This film can be misogynistic and presumptuous at times, but still has a certain humor about it, whose subtlety can only be described as English. This is a wonderful attempt by Hollywood to make (or redo the case ...) a film that appeals to all our desires for a romantic comedy that can make us think and laugh at the same time. Reluctantly and evasively, this film gives 9 out of 10 ... Something that you would hardly see me doing for a romantic comedy in the near future, or so I hope.
