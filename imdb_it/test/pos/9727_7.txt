Apparently a B ... B film must be synonymous with Better acting and a Better message than what we get today with big budget "A" photos. Today's films aimed at young women are certainly not designed to encourage depth of character over superficial selfish behaviors ... or to increase the self-esteem of girls who do not conform to "feminine" standards. (After all, criticizing the fake and flashy, as this film does, will not help sell more products that depend on whether girls * are * not satisfied with their natural attributes or their inner beauty.) <br /> < br /> Laraine Day is as adorable as a mechanically inclined tomboy who "confines" herself in the rooms and confesses that she is not capable of flirting. He ties himself to Robert Cummings due to similar interests, a shared sense of humor, and his honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which gradually evaluates the superficial "spells" of his selfish glamor sister (which only brings out his own tendencies of selfish and reckless playboys). Although Laraine is also outwardly beautiful, it is refreshing to see the inner beauty appreciated the most, and the representation of true friendship that leads to the most fulfilling romantic relationship. I would like girls (and boys) to receive this kind of concrete message today. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Hollywood went back to making "B" movies again, with modest budgets, and trying to be happy with modest profits ... what am I saying? Sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a smaller scale would be like expecting a boy to give up the superficial sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him. It's a chat. <br /> <br /> Please, someone has already invented a time machine! I belong to the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I rate this film higher, but the finish is a little too abrupt, and perhaps a sufficient indication of Robert Cummings' change of heart was missing. (I like the fact that the B series movies are short and snappy, not inflated and self-indulgent, but this may have taken more than 70 minutes.) He also found it unrealistic that a widow and small children would not be influenced by a sudden death in their family ... or be so lenient of the one who caused it. I mean, I suppose it's * cute *, but a little more pain or bitterness would have been natural. Perhaps a deliberate choice to ensure that this family act is carefree for their loss, to reduce the impact of the tragedy and to make sure we * forgive those involved in death - since it's just a plot device, not the real point of the film. Still weird though.
