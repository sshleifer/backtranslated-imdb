This is really a funny movie. His tape dance scene is one of the most fun scenes I can remember. I thought the "I am gay" scene at the high school graduation ceremony was a bit surreal, although it was fun. As I watched it for the third time, I started collecting on small segments that I had lost. One was when Matt Dillon's girl, a classic girl, tried to use a phone she had never used before. Kevin Klein made this hit movie along Tom Selleck. This was also the first time I could appreciate Debbie Reynolds; showed that it can be fun. He confirmed it in the TV series "Will and Grace". A discovery I found after the third vision is Lauren Ambrose of "6 Feet Under". He leans over with his red fringe, but it is obvious that this is one of his first films. Even Bob Newhart is very funny at the beginning of high school.
