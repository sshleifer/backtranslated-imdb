The dott. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) and Jo McKenna (Doris Day) travel to Morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named Louis Bernard (Daniel GÃ©lin) on a bus. The next day this man is killed, but before he dies he tells Ben a secret; a murder will take place in London. The criminals will kidnap the Hank couple's son (Christopher Olsen) making sure that Ben will not reveal their plan to anyone. The man who knew too much (1956) by Alfred Hitchcock is a very intense thriller. it's superlative as always in the Hitchcok films. James Stewart is wonderful. Doris Day is a delightful and actress and can also show his talents. The song Que Sera, Sera plays an important part in the film. it's a film of many classic scenes. In the final scenes at the Albert Hall, done without dialogue, you can barely blink. This film is fifty years old now. Time has not diminished its power in any way.
