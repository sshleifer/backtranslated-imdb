When I went to see this documentary about communist block musicals, I was expecting something totally insane, along the lines of a communist "Cop Rock". Some scenes delivered, including an exciting clip of a Soviet film called "Tractor Drivers". <br /> <br /> You would think filmmakers had the task of creating ideologically correct musicals that sing, dance and marry the Party line to face insurmountable difficulties. Still, one of the surprises of "East Side Story" is that some of the films presented seemed really promising. One was an effort by Germany in the early 1950s called "My wife wants to sing", in which, as the title suggests, an unfortunate hausfrau tries to launch a career as a singer for objections of her traditionalist husband. <br /> <Another really interesting looking film, also from East Germany, was called "Midnight Revue". In this film, inside a film, the producers question their own creative situation with the story of a group of directors under the Party's command to make a musical. (The same filmmakers on the screen go so far as to make a musical number avoiding "too hot" subjects that are very reminiscent of the 1957 film "Silk Stockings.") <br /> <br /> The documentary is marked by a rather insipid narrative , but it's still a lot of fun to watch. (Look for the final dedication to the person who made it all possible).
