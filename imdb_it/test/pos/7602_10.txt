I thought this film was fantastic, not only because of its plot, but because it was played by an excellent cast. I read that Drew Barrymore was not as great as Josie Geller because she is beautiful. Yes, perhaps, but in the film that he played outside of himself, he brought a simple girl in search of those in the world. The story is sweet and certainly for the hopeless romantics out there, I'm sure they are. David Arquette is as angry as his brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is gorgeous as is Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did a great job as her partner Aldys, someone who wasn't afraid of being herself. I think this film should have more credit than being branded as a "teeny boppy" movie
