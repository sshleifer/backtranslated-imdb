Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) begins this story in disguise, helping to smuggle the famous physicist "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) out of Switzerland and under the watchful eye of the Nazis, who want his bombing plans. Obviously allies want it too, and Sherlock is there to help. Dr. Tobel has invented an instrument that greatly helps the accuracy of aerial bombardment. <br /> <br /> Holmes and Dr. Tobel arrive safely at Baker Street, but the scientist would prefer to be alone, for some mysterious reason, although he had promised the British to help them, not the Germans. It remains true to this promise, but there are some desperate moments for Holmes and the British along the way. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie and one in which our famous detective uses not one but three different disguises. He needs all the help he can get when he comes up against his rival, "Professor Moriarity". One complaint: if Moriarity were so wicked, he would have given up Holmes without blinking, instead of giving him openings to escape. It's also pretty sad when the usual Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) has to save his boss from certain death a couple of times! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some credibility issues in this story but if you can put your brain on hold a few times, it's a fun movie to watch .... and it's great, thanks to the excellent restoration work done on this DVD. It makes the old print come alive with some wonderful images, especially night shots. <br /> <br /> Another note: anyone who did the English subtitles was wrong to type or misinterpret at least half a dozen words. It's a very sloppy job, and it's not the first time I've seen it while watching the entire series on the restored DVD set.
