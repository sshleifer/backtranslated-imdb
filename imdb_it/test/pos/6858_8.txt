This is a great German slasher, which is often quite suspenseful and creative, with a fun story and solid performance. All the characters are fantastic, and Benno Fürmann is as big as the psychopath, besides Franka Potente offers a fantastic performance as the main protagonist. It took a while to get going, but it was never boring, and it also had some beautiful scenes of death, plus the music is wonderfully creepy. I was lucky enough to have the subtitled version instead of the dubbing, and I thought that all the characters were pretty nice, plus it is also very well done and written. It also has some really good twists, and the effects are extremely well done, plus the finish is great. The ending is particularly full of suspense and Franka Potente was the perfect casting choice in my opinion, moreover I wish Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey (David) wasn't killed so soon, because he was a really interesting character. Actually there were a couple of moments when I felt uncomfortable, but in a positive sense, and I have to say that this film deserved all its praise, besides, while it has holes in the plot, it's not enough to hinder the movie. This is a great German slasher, which is often quite suspenseful, and creative, with a fun story and solid performance, I highly recommend this!. The direction is great! Stefan Ruzowitzky does great! I work here with excellent photographic work, great angles, great close-ups (watch the opening sex scene), doing a great job adding an eerie atmosphere, and keeping the film at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of blood and blood. We have cut corpses, lots of bloody surgery scenes, a lot of bloody stabbings, people are dissected while they are still conscious, fingers cut off, self mutilation, gutting, a bleeding throat, a lot of evil-looking frozen bodies, a lot of blood and so on . <br /> <br /> The actor is very solid! Franka Potente is fantastic as the main protagonist, she was very nice, she remained cold under pressure, she is vulnerable, easy on the eyes, and we are able to take care of her character, the only time she seemed to suffer, it was when she had to he spat out some bad dialogue here and there, but it wasn't very often, it was wonderful! Benno Fürmann is excellent as the psychopathic killer, he was simply chilling, and wonderfully OTT, he really gave me the creeps, and he was an effective killer! Anna Loos played her role very well, like the smart slut, I dug her. Sebastian Blomberg was exceptional here as Caspar, he was quite likable and had a mysterious character, even his chemistry with Potent was active, and eventually there were great twists. Holger Speckhahn was as good as Idiot Phil and did his job well. Traugott Buhre is as good as Professor Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey was great like David, he had a really nice character and I wish he wouldn't be killed so soon. The rest of the cast is fine. <br /> <br /> Overall I highly recommend this fantastic German slasher! *** 1/2 on 5
