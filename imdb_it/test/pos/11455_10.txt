This film took me by surprise. The opening credit sequence presents well done animations. After that, we are immersed in a semi-poor production, betraying its low budget. The characters, typical American boys, are introduced slowly, with more personal details than those usually found in films like this. When the shlitz hits the fan, we know each of the characters, and we hate them or hate them based on their distinct personalities. It's a slow uphill set-up, a bit like the climb up a really high rollercoaster slope. Fortunately, once the action has started, the old-school HORROR is in full swing! Steve Johnson's make-up effects are fantastic. Equal in quality to films with much larger budgets. And the scares are going crazy. Kevin Tenney offers his best film ever, with thrilling surprises and creepy gatherings. The ironic, sometimes joking humor characterizes this film as pure 80s horror, in contrast to the dark tone of the previous genre, such as "Night of the Living Dead" or "Hills Have Eyes". But for true horror fans, it's worth a try. Play as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of "House on the Haunted Hill". The set-up and the dynamics of the characters are so similar that you really have to ask yourself what movies they were actually doing again?
