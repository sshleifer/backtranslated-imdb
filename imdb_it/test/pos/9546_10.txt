I'm salivating for the sequels. I needed something to keep me from going crazy with tension, anxiety (and if it wasn't so beautiful?!) And constant lack of information. I needed something to calm myself down, something to pass the time, apart of course, The Matrix. This was the right thing. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (like the part on Keanu's neck ...) and some were funny. I always took pity on Carrie-Anne when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys. I found only one problem with it. Since 95% of people were actually male, they just let their mouths go wild, and there was language. It's not as bad as The Shawshank Redemption's performances, but that scene is that Keanu is describing a bad day, plug your ears if you're small. > <br /> <br /> It was fun and it was just what I needed. That's what all the crazy Matrix fans must keep quiet. They talk a little about the sequels, and someone gives almost something, but it recovers in time (shoot!). It gives you almost no spoilers, but it's nice to have if you're a Matrix boss like me. <br /> <br /> There is no spoon.
