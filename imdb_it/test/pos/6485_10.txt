"... the rhythm is too strong ... we are now deaf mutants - like them", Rex Voorhas Ormine <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this film was uniformly hit. Let me be the first to actually talk about the virtues of "The Beat" and why YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM NOW. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this film is poor and "bad" in the conventional sense: the story is absurd, poetry is stupid, and acting is inconsistent. <br /> <br /> But these are the CHARMS of the film - all these ingredients form the recipe for one of the MOST SUBSCRIBER FILES CHEEZY of the 80s. <br /> <br /> If the reference to "deaf mutants" did not arouse your interest, then perhaps this will be: what kind of name is "Rex Voorhas Ormine", anyway? It's such an unusual name (for the North American public) that I said to myself, "even the names of the characters in this fucking movie are incredibly foolish." <br /> <br /> Well, "The Beat" is so fabulously cheeky that the "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "Rex Voorhas Ormine" is revealed not too subtly by Bart Waxman (the misguided orientation counselor you love to hate). I don't want to ruin the revelation behind the name of Rex, but please don't get too excited, OK? <br /> <br /> Overall, the acting is inconsistent (John Savage - who plays the "interested master" Mr. Ellsworth is pretty good, as is the colleague who plays Bart Waxman, but the rest of the cast doesn't convince ). That being said, acting does not detract from the film. Why? There is a SINCERITY in each of the performances of the actors that makes the characters that they interpret captivating. So even if the performances could suck, you still have the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best. As a result, the sincerity of the actors is successful where their acting fails (which is quite often). <br /> <br /> The tribute to the "beat poetry" in this film is bad, bad, bad. But this is a good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment. Would you really like a poem of "better quality" or "more respectable" - especially in a film like this? <br /> <br /> Folks, which would be BORING (think of the funny ones who had us read in high school- -sanitized to avoid "bribing young people", politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis, etc.) Even if not you like films of poetry or "arty" (with all the "intellectual" positions that they imply), you certainly can (and should) appreciate THE LUDICROUS POETRY in a WANNABE FILM OF ART !!!! How could you not enjoy the following? <br /> <br /> "Do you remember the dinosaur roaring? A crap from a woman on the floor of bad villain, oh the woman is so sad that she washes her hands and then waits for the door today, yes - today!" <br /> <br /> Yes, this is an example of some of the extraordinary poems disseminated freely in "The Beat". But as for the story, do you ask? <br /> <br /> Well, the story is absurd. But then again, this is the beauty of this movie. Apart from some predictable clich√©s, stereotypes and plot points, there are enough truly unique plot / story elements to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where is he from? What the hell is he talking about? Deaf mutants? Illiterate angels? Billy and Kate REALLY know what Rex is saying? Should the public understand Rex and his poetry? (I've seen the movie several times and haven't figured it out yet.) <br /> <br /> Do bad poetry and high school talent really show FINE GANG VIOLENCE? <br /> <br /> You guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like "The Beat" - a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, mediocre and sincere acting, and a plot of "mythopoius conquerors gang of violence" that IT HAS STILL BEEN REVALATED BY ANY FILM NEVER MADE. <br /> <br /> Bonuses for fans of the classic New York hardcore: Cro-Mags make a rare film appearance like "Iron Skulls" and it's a real fun to watch them perform in different songs. I would like them to include more footage of a concert, but maybe that will be an "extra" included on the "collector's edition" DVD that I imagine I have. <br /> <br />
