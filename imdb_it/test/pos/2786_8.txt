Surprising, witty, fun and totally engaging, the film captures a little-known reality: that of the student studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, since the story starts, obviously it has some moments of calm in the central part, and the story sometimes moves away from the main character, but the viewer won't worry - the film is young, fresh and light - heart, although I disagree with the idea that when you do Erasmus and you come back you are no longer part of that universe. But it's just me. The film is deep and at the same time very light. Fresh and recommendable.
