When the circus arrives in the city and positions the lion's cage directly above Bugs Bunny's house, Bugs ends up in a place in the range between the mad and the intrepid. Despite the title "Acrobatty Bunny", it is only at the end when Bug and the lion perform stunts. But even before that, it is quite funny what Bugs does to avoid being eaten; somehow, he always manages to use the other person's weakness against him, and then pulls out any cheap object out of thin air! Bugs later ended up in the circus in "Big Top Bunny". I liked this better, since the second one did a bit of drugs giving the antagonist an accent from Eastern Europe (I know it was during the Cold War, but still). I recommend this. <br /> <br /> And with the end, we can say that it will never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon.
