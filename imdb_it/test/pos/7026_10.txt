I must admit that, before I watched this film, I thought, this is one of those sloppy love stories where everything works beautifully and completely dandy. but I proved wrong when I sat down to watch this. I found out that it was a really nice story about a family going to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and there the youngest daughter, small, finds love but finds it difficult to arrive with her new love found of disagreements with her father. But along the way he helps another dance instructor, and risks the whole relationship ... A really moving film, like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
