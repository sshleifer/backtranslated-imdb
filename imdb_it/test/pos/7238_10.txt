This film is truly unique. It really captures the spirit of the game, but makes it fun for the modern generation. The love story between Tromeo and Juliet was credible and erotic, not pulled out of many adaptations. It's also so funny that I was almost crying with laughter. <br /> <br /> As with most of Troma he is in the face, taboo topics, blood and sex, yet he adds a really good acting and a Shakespeare plot. You really have to see this movie to believe it! <br /> <br /> There are some hilly jokes in the credits (the best titles I saw after Hot Shots) loaded with Troma in the beats as well as in satire and shakespeare in general ref. And Lemmy of Motorhead's house tells. I loaned this film to a friend and I had almost impossible work to get it back. Troma at its best, this film is really a gem and goes into my 5 favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Even if it's not the kind of movie you watch with your mother, it may offend some people. For anyone tired of the run of the mill cinema, with a strange sense of humor you MUST SEE THIS FILM.
