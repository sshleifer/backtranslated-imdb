Well, I don't agree with Leonard Maltin in this animated short film. He loves it and says it was hilarious. I liked it, but I didn't see any humor. He doesn't even like hockey or he knows nothing, and in any case he loved history. Living across the border with Canada, I saw hockey for 50 years both there and in Buffalo .... but I didn't think much about this cartoon. Oh, it was interesting and I know what would happen if I wore a Toronto shirt in the Quebec area - disaster! This is especially true in the glorious years of Les Canadians. However, that doesn't make the story fun. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, everyone in the provinces of Quebec idolized the Canadians of Montreal and their protagonist, Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. When his mother orders a new sweater, he has the Toronto Maple Leafs emblem on it, so the child doesn't want to be taken to death wearing it .. When he finally does and heads for the local track, he is ostracized from the rest of his hockey friends. What's so funny about this? I could see the same thing happening to a child in Boston who is tough Red Sox and that his mother takes him the Yankees shirt! Horrors! You could not wear it, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Perhaps to someone who does not follow the sport at all, like Maltin, this situation seems strange and amusing to him ... but it is a fact of life or of any sports enthusiast. his favorite team. It was an interesting and absolutely credible story, but nothing that made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Art was fun to look at all, almost as if I were looking at a long series of pastel paintings made by a gifted school boy. Even the French Canadian accent was good. This film was part of the "Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites" DVD from the National Film Board of Canada.
