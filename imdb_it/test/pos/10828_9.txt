"Bon Voyage" has the fast pace that somehow reminds me of the Indiana Jones movies / Star Wars: it's like I'm on a fast train or roller coaster. <br /> <br /> romance, mystery, thriller and farce; it is all this and also includes spontaneous observations on the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion at the beginning of World War II. And it is also a juggling exhibition involving 7 main characters. All the scenes seemed historically accurate (to my eyes) and gave a great feeling for that period. <br /> <br /> All the actors were well cast and gave great performances, but IMO the most superb was that of Isabelle Adjani who played the role of a star of opportunistic and egocentric French cinema; not only was he convincingly interpreting the role of a young actress perhaps half his age, but he also interpreted his loving wiles convincingly, so that the public sees that he is only a serious and complex person like a person who is not a gold digger. His character and energy push the film from beginning to end. It wasn't until I read Roger Ebert's review that I discovered he was 48 at the time of the film. How beautiful !! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the ending: it is satisfying, but it allows you to write your conclusions about what happens to the main characters. <br /> <br /> As noted by another commentator user, DO NOT arrive late; you have to be there from the opening scene. Good advice. <br /> <br /> I gave it 9 out of 10.
