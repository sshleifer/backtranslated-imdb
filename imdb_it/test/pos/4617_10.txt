I must confess that I fell into the cynical trap of believing that Australians could not play drama unless it meant a lot of crying, and I am an Australian. Sad, isn't it? While this film involves crying, its not dramatic tears, its honest emotion shines through. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this film is a whodunnit. I knew what the end result would be when I started watching it, so I tried to guess who would do it. I lost for a mile. <br /> <br /> I was amazed when I discovered the director, Murali Thulluri was only about 21 years old when he shot this film. I'd like to shake his hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope he has more. <br /> <br /> All the characters we meet before the main title credit (about 12 minutes in) is an antihero. All of them were worried in their own way and all of them were as selfish as their neighbors. Even when they are nice. <br /> <br /> The saddest scene in the film, and there are some difficult to watch) is the final scene in which we are formally presented to the true protagonist and we are told to their nephew. That scene made me cry. <br /> <br /> My confidence in the Australian drama has been restored. We are masters of comedy, but I was getting bored with comedy. <br /> <br /> Murali, if you happen to take a look, you touched my soul and for this I can only thank you.
