I entered "The Closer She Gets" knowing it was the story of the director's mother who fought against cancer. I expected it to be a very harrowing and depressing film. And even if the topic is certainly exciting, the extraordinary thing about this film is the positive message it sends. Show the total dedication of a family to face the cancer challenge together. They refuse to lose faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> The most moving moments for me are when this faith is revealed. Small comments that the mother and the family make to each other to reveal his (and their) will to survive, and their provocative emphasis on love and the family. In this way it is an uplifting and deeply hopeful film. We should all be lucky enough to be surrounded by a family like this in times of serious illness.
