I'm like the rest of the fans who love this play, I've been waiting for it on DVD. I got it on VHS and I was so fed up that I was expecting a release and worried that my VHS copy would ruin the equipment to get it to DVD. The image and the sound are excellent for my absolute surprise. If someone else wants a copy, send me a line at <br /> <br /> stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and for £ 7.00 I put it on a DVD, print the DVD and get it in post. £ 7.00 only covers my registered costs and deliveries, etc. With maybe a little more so I'm not going to make any money out of it, I just wish the world would see this gem ignored by a comedy. I recently saw a copy of ebay obtained for over £ 26, unbelievable. How can they not release this classic. Send me an email for payment details like check or Paypal etc. Etc
