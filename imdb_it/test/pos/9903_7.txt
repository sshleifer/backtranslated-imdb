I was lucky enough to see this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival and I have to say that I liked it a lot. When I asked the director if he had attended film school, I was very impressed that he hadn't done it. Films like these don't come from people without talent. Starting in the commercials and then producing a family comedy felt in the heart like this, shows a real range. I will certainly keep an eye on what he does next. As a good independent film should be, the film is very character driven. As for your average Hollywood movie, which is mostly story-driven. The film focuses on a Jewish family in New York, the Applebaum, who were all invited for the feast of "fathers suicides" of their fathers. The film is full of witty, fast, jabbing dialogues. The fact that the small Jewish family is obsessed with being Jewish and whoever is Jewish is the unrealistic situation of a "suicidal" party in reality. Director Jeff Hare does a great job of getting the characters out of the actors and bringing them to life on the screen. The design of the production gives life to the sets with great attention to the small details that make the environment feel like a home lived for 40 years. The editing continues with the dialogue so that you sit on your seat wondering who is going to stab anyone with the next witty or punch line phrase. And when appropriate, the film slows down to allow the audience to dive a little deeper into the hidden meanings and motivations within these adorable characters. If you are a fan of Woody Allen or movies like "As Good as Gets" go see this movie.
