If you want to see the true vile nature of communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodr√Ω Svet) It tells how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the communists feared that they had collected dangerous Western ideas on freedom. So, these heroic Czech pilots were thrown into a nightmare prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis risked their lives to defeat. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their films fall flat, they should compare parts of the drama of the character of "Pearl Harbor" with this film. In Dark Blue World, you really make a connection with all the characters. At Pearl Harbor, everyone is like a cartoon version of a real person. <br /> <br /> There are countless examples of brilliant writing in this film. A funny scene that remains in my mind is when the character Karel is taught English by a rather formal English woman. When he can't pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. In typical English stoic fashion, the teacher faces Karel calmly but forcefully, and tweaks him in his behavior. <br /> <br /> The aerial battle sequences in this film are incredible and help keep the film alive. I read that it costs $ 11,000 an hour to rent planes, but it was worth every penny. <br /> <br /> Sir, you are expected to cry in sad films, but boys ... be careful! This film would make General Patton cry. And if you're a dog lover, you'll use half of the Kleenex box. Don't say I didn't warn you.
