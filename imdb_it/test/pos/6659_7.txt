This film worked for me because I see this film as the exact opposite of "Gone with the Wind". Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; Ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until Ruby, (Renee Zellweger,) shows up to save the day. A little, in an approximate way. Deserters instead of officers try to return to their families, the lists go on forever. Even the love story was the opposite. If this is what the producer and the writers were trying to overcome, he succeeded with me. <br /> <br /> There are only two things I don't like about the movie, the rest I thought was well done and I liked it enough to recommend it to friends. First, I could not see the attraction between Inman, (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) as strong enough to allow Inman to give up and return to her. Inman said he had written to her only a few times when Ada wrote to him almost constantly. Second, something or someone who was killed or dying in almost every scene was a little too much. I have to say that he was full of action because of this, but after the second scene I knew something or someone would die in the next scene. I like being surprised by the next scene, I don't know what will happen before doing it. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was very well done, with Zellweger the best. He deserved the credit he had for this. I thought he played the girl in the hills very well. He must have done the homework for the part. Zellweger also said in the film that he was smarter than people thought he was. I think it was true. Law did well with his part with everything that had to pass to get back to Kidman. It must have been a much stronger love to deal with everything I thought it was. Now he showed many emotions on his face during his rehearsals. The Kidman part may have had something to do with the fact that I chose his performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed, she didn't show much emotion, I don't know if that's how the part was written or if that's how she felt the part. He did a good job anyway, I just thought the other two were better. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene with Zellweger, Kidman and the rooster, even though it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought the "House Guard" was exactly as they probably were then. Even though we don't hear about them, they were part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful. The film had everything it needed to be a good historical novel.
