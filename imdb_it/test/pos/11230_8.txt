"It all depends on how you look at it, or we are halfway to heaven or halfway to hell," says priest Rev. Harlan in "Northfork". The Polish brothers' film is ambitious and will make any intelligent observer sit down, provided he has patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment that the film provides bring a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is obvious for a less obvious socio-political and theological comment that should cause a relaxed American to reflect on current social values. The adoption of the surreal film (coffins that emerge from the depths of artificial lakes to float and disturb the living, homeowners who almost "crucify" their feet to the wooden floor of their homes, angels who need more glasses to read, etc.) and absurd images (of half animals, half of toys that are alive, of bells that make the most delicate musical output of a harp, a blind angel who continues to write illegible traits, etc.) could to make the viewer unaware of the surreal and absurd traditions in literature and the arts to ask what the film is bare for entertainment. Although European cinema has better credentials in this field, Hollywood has made such films in "Cat Ballou" in the past, Lee Marvin and his horse leaning against the wall to take a nap several decades ago. "Northfork", in a scene where citizens left the city by car, seemed to pay tribute to the line of cars of "Citizen Kane" that took Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic. <br /> <br /> The film is difficult for those who do not know or for those who are impatient, the most interesting epilogue (one of the best I can remember) can be heard as a voice towards the end of the credits . The directors seem to leave the best moments to those who can stay with the film until the end. If you have the patience, will you taste the layers of the film ?? If you swallow or swallow what the Polish fanatics are doing, you will lose their many flavors. <br /> <br /> What is the movie about? ? At the most obvious layer, a city is freed to make way for a dam and the hydroelectric project. Cemeteries are also excavated so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial sites. Real estate developers are selling properties on the lake to 6 people who can evict citizens. Of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup, while others cannot get anything served to them. <br /> <br /> On the next level, you have Christianity and its interaction on citizens. Most are devout Christians, but many conceal their instincts to survive at the expense of true Christian principles, exemplified in the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with these actions. <br /> <br /> On the next level, we have the world of angels interacting with close human beings and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on Hercules and dreams of a mother, finds one in an androgynous angel called "Fiore Ercole". While the filmmaker gives clues to the fact that Flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, Flower's subsequent actions disprove this option. Are you really in the world of angels - not gods but pure in spirit ?? and therefore not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is evident in these shots. <br /> <br /> On another level, Irwin's toy plane becomes a real plane that transports him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> The final level is the social commentary ?? "The country is divided into two types of people: the people of Ford and the people of Chevy." There's a difference? They think they are different but both are consumers. <br /> <br /> For the religious, the film says "Pray and you will receive" (words of Don Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). For the consumer, the film says "it's what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the 6 evictors also has wings, a goose feather and a goose feather stuck in their headgear but their actions are different , often far from the angelic ones, as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a machine). <br /> <br /> The film is certainly not the best American film, but it is certainly a remarkable demolition work - extraordinary visuals, extraordinary performances (especially Nick Nolte) and a loaded script that offers different levels of entertainment for an audience adult.
