Enchanting. The best time to watch this movie is sometimes unhappy or sad. Everything is so cute, everything, even the way in which that white bear secretly loves the Queen and finally gets it, even the undertaking that the two young actors of Gerda and Kai have given. The music is also very beautiful. We two will always be one, combined with sad piano tones, in some places it gives a very touching result and if one looks at both sides simultaneously, he will see that the Snow Queen is not so bad. Just try to surround yourself with love the wrong way. The night that this film was here (part one) I only watched it because I was bored, but I liked it a lot more afterwards and I was very angry when they didn't show the next part because of the Pope's funeral. Yes, it was terribly sad for me. But when they said it would be next week, I was so happy that I recorded it and now I'm glad I did.
