Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He's a great actor and I could be his girlfriend at any time. He's fine like that. I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to ruin the end, but wow. The girls are so bad. His girlfriend was wrong. If Eddie were my man, I will never miss him. Those mobsters were ghostly. The moral of the story is Trust No One. Your friends will hurt you if they can. Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that mine, she should move the eggs! I would suggest seeing the film. Why? I told you Becasur. He kept my eyes on the screen. My sister also loved it, so I'll see it again because now my friends want to see it and it's worth seeing it twice. Peace, Happy New Year!
