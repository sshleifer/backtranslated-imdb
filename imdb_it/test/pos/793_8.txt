Not everyone, but most of this story is Buster who is mistaken for "Dead Shot Dan", a notorious criminal. <br /> <br /> There is really no story, just a series of adventures to show Buster's physical talents, which are incredible, and his comic timing. The 27-minute film is basically an adventure after another that mainly involves someone chasing our hero. <br /> <br /> Previously, a couple of cops on their pace run down the streets after Keaton and later it's "Big Joe" Roberts, an uninterrupted cop - and father of a girl Buster is interested in - he chases it. These last scenes were the best I thought of, with lots of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live. That was Keaton at his best. <br /> <br /> It's only half an hour of madness that makes little sense, but who cares? It is Buster at the best of his slapstick, or close to it, and so serves its purpose: to entertain us. Think: 85 years after making this film there are people (like me) who continue to discover and appreciate these classics of silent comedy! Cold!
