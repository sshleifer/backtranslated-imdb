Almost missed. While visiting friends in Philadelphia in the early 1980s, I was surfing the canal after everyone else went to bed. It wasn't just Bogart who was obsessed; but rather the whole was of those old movies that my peers know so well. Add to that a plot similar to The Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters interact with Sacchi - and you have a piece of art for me. About ten years later he appeared on TV and recorded it. >
