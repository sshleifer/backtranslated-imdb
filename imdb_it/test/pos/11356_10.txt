I think the New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best review of In the Mood for Love, when he said it was "dizzying with a romantic spirit that was missing in the cinema forever". How true those words are! Really romantic films are so rare these days, while movies that include a lot of sex and nudity (which are often portrayed in an obscene and free way) abound. So, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai's latest film looks like a much needed breath of fresh air. In the film Mood for Love speaks of the tragic love story between two neighbors ("Mr. Chow", played by Tony Leung and "Mrs. Chan", played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses have an illicit relationship while they search " no "being like them", but after spending each other on lonely nights (while their spouses are away "on business" / "caring for a sick mother"), they fall madly in love and must resist temptation to go too far.> <br /> Several factors are responsible for the creation of In the Mood for Love, a new classic among "romantic melodramas", in the best sense of this term. First of all, the specific period of the film (ie Hong Kong from the 1960s) is faithfully recreated in a surprising way: the clothes (including the adorable dresses by Maggie Cheung), the music (for example Nat King Cole) and the general atmosphere of this film evokes a nostalgia for that specific period. Secondly, the award-winning and extraordinary cinema tography of Christopher Doyle creates an environment that not only envelops his two main characters, but seems to exude romantic nostalgia in every one of his sumptuous meticulously composed frames. Make no mistake: in the film Mood for Love was the most beautiful film of 2001. (It must also be said that Wong Kar-wai's usual hyperkinetic visual style is (understandably) attenuated for this film, even though his pallet remains equally colorful. ) Thirdly, there is the disturbing score of Michael Galasso, who is accompanied by slow-motion sequences of, for example Chan walking in his elegant clothes, Chan and Chow "looking at each other" as they pass each other on the stairs, and other beautiful scenes that are engraved in the memory. The main soundtrack - which makes its instruments play as if they were literally crying - is heard eight times at various points in the film and serves to highlight the sadness and desire that the two protagonists feel. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both offer wonderful performances (Leung won the Best Actor Award at Cannes) and are able to generate real chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> The elements mentioned above combine and work so well together to create a film that feels timeless, "dizzyingly romantic" and, in a word, magical. In the film Mood for Love, perhaps more than any other film of 2001, he reminded me of the reason I love "going to the movies". And I think it's the highest compliment I can pay for a movie. <br /> <br />
