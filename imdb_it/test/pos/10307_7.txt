The subject of the film is intense and very real. It happened. We can discuss artistic freedoms taken by the director and screenwriter. The subject is what makes the film beat - nothing else. I saw the film for the first time since the real Phoolan, was shot dead in New Delhi and served several years as an elected MP in India. By the way, it was not the first untouchable elected to Parliament, as some reviewers have stated. The so-called "untouchables" have been elected to the Indian parliament for decades in private colleges. <br /> <br /> While Shekhar Kapur as a director is a hero for many in India, because he made internationally accepted films - - "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and a tolerable children's film entitled "Mister India ", which was accepted by the average Indian public - and even received an Oscar nomination for Elizabeth, I don't put him in first place director from India. He fails in every department as a director, except perhaps that he manages to get performances above the average of his actors. The subtlety, the finesse, the charm are not easy to find in his films - the melodrama in them is rich. <br /> <br /> His idea of ​​using the vocal rendering of the song by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan in the early parts of the film was perhaps his only major success on the indistinguishable sound track of "Bandit Queen". And then maybe the doors creak during the group rapes sequence. Otherwise the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music associated with them. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good living Indian filmmaker who makes a realistic quality film of international quality, it is not the Shekhar Kapur movies you should see; are the later works of three Indian directors Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen and Girish Karnad and of course "Umrao Jaan" by Muzaffar Ali. It is a pity that none of these directors had the financial support that Kapur had to give them and their films an international audience. For example, "Oka oorie katha" by Sen made in Telugu, or "Sadgati" by Satyajit Ray based on "Kafan" by Munshi Prem Chand, are more complete as films for an intelligent observer who deals with the state of the untouchables in India. Sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence, but simply suggested them. Of course, Sen's nugget didn't make headlines, while Kapur's effort persecuted them. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kapur, he is articulate and has used his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai film industry to take his products beyond the public home. For that effort, I greet Kapur. But "Bandit Queen" will remain a great subject waiting for an experienced director to address it.
