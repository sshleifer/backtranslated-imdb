This film is a refreshing change of pace from the sad films about the Hong Kong triad that I became so tired of. There are no spectacular firefights. No car chase. And practically a minimal action to talk about. The audience is mostly held in suspense, although some aspects of Andy Lau's so-called "ploy" are pretty obvious. <br /> <br /> The film was hailed as a deviation from the genre of the violent film triad, and as a "smart" criminal film. In part, it is. But, to a certain extent, the "credibility" test still fails. One can hardly imagine that a member of the triad is so stupid as not to see through Andy Lau's female disguise in a second. He also seemed to have fallen in love with the fact that "if someone was seriously ill, someone would regularly cough with copious amounts of blood" which Chinese films always seem to go for. <br /> <br /> The subtle relationship between the two protagonists is a refreshing change. <br /> <br /> All in all a funny movie, even if the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >
