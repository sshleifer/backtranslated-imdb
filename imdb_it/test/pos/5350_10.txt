In 1989, Aardman Animations introduced the two heroes in The Grand Day Out. In 1993, they fought an evil penguin in The Wrong Pants. And in 1995, they had to save sheep from an evil robot dog in A Close Shave. In 2005, they returned and will fight something that was cute and cuddly in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. In this feature film, Wallace and Gromit work at Anit-Pesto, a company that controls pests. There will be a Giant Vegetable Competition, but the rabbits continue to eat the nearby vegies. Wallace and Gromit take care of this problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will brainwash rabbits with his car. After doing that, something suddenly eats all the vegies in the neighborhood and is big. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to save the situation. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. It retained what the previous 3 chapters had and instead added many Hollywood actors for voice-overs, cast an unnamed cast for the job and boy, did a fantastic job. Wallace and Gromit have not changed. Wallace is still the cheese freak as always and Gromit is the dog that reads the silent newspaper. Moreover, the script was not too sloppy as were other family films. There is a turning point in who the real rabbit really is. Directed by Nick Park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a great job with the plot. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula into it, it has just taken on the style of the previous chapters and adds a touch of dark fantasy. Well done, Nick. Rabbits are also fun and adorable, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is the one who has Wallace's mix in him. The characters weren't bad and weren't annoying, but they would never exceed Wallace and Gromit. The entertainment is really fantastic and wonderful. I've never seen such an amazing clay animated film since Chicken Run came out. Overall, fans of the two knuckleheads (including the boys) will love this awesome movie. It is a well made film that should receive an Oscar next year. Urr√†, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10
