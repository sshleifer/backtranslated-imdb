If you are in the IMDB audience that puts High Fidelity in the top 200 of all time, then this movie is NOT for you. This film is a bravado like Steve Frears is aware of the hip. Renee Zellweger is excellent as a writer of fashionable urban magazines who returns to her suburban Bucks County nursery to care for mother Streep (who still offers another performance as an honor room). William Hurt is the ideal cast and reckless, faithless and selfish husband. If this movie doesn't make you cry and laugh, then you're too trendy to enjoy it.
