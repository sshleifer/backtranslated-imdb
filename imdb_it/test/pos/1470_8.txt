Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, finally step out of their grueling program to talk to the cameras as they sip champagne in their hot tub. At first, observing this, I didn't perceive as much sarcasm as what was in it. I knew they were joking when they complained about the different actors on the show and when Trey said he wouldn't give his mother any of his money, but there's so much sarcasm everywhere, that this documentary is more than a mockumentary full of inside jokes . <br /> <br /> This "documentary" shows everything about South Park (until the second season anyway). Show what happens behind the scenes with animation and recording. He has interviews, many of which are fake interviews, but some, of all the demonstrations, give an idea of ​​the show. The clips of both of the short films Spirit of Christmas by Trey Parker are shown, as well as many good films taken from the show. If I were a fan of South Park, then this would have to quench your thirst for knowledge of the show at the end of 1998, when this was done. Now obviously the show has changed, but this is still interesting. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a fun documentary in which Trey Parker (in particular) and Matt Stone come out as arrogant shots, and that's exactly what they wanted to come like. They can be like that in real life, but here was a joke, a discerning 51-minute joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** on ****. 51 minutes. Not evaluated, contains language and sexual content.
