I think I'm kind of a Road Runner fan. I don't care how predictable, I laugh anyway. 'Beep, Beep' is predictable most of the time, even if it is quite clever at the same time. Of course the Road Runner is chased by the Coyote and obviously the Coyote fails to capture the Road Runner with every new attempt. Coyote's plans are great fun. See exactly where it will go wrong and you will not be disappointed. Well, once you're a little disappointed, what you think will happen no, but it makes the joke even more fun. <br /> <br /> If you like the Road Runner shorts you will love this. The predictable gags work and the animation is great and quite original sometimes.
