Well, let's leave it this way - I've always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; I've always loved rock music and especially heavy metal !! That's why this movie is like a gift from God! I think this film is one of the best movies ever (well, except for Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's nice to listen to all the classics, like "Long live rock and roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold (Ted Nugent), songs by Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and many other legendary rock bands.! Absolutely GORGEOUS !!! I hope they make more movies like this (otherwise they are just shitty movies, like "AC in from USA" or what they call it, and "8 miles". Bulls ***!) Well, I highly recommend it anyway! All I miss is a couple of Stratovarius songs! But other than that, it's one of the best movies ever! Ten out of ten!
