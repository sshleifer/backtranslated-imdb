Once again, the sacred home of Bugs Bunny is violated by careless people. This time the traveling circus put a lion cage right above the rabbit hole. So Bug's has to get out of the hole and face Nero (that's the lion's name), which he does in his usual hilarious style. After a slow and rocky start to the cart, it keeps getting better and ends up being pretty fun. Nero the lion turns out to be a great foil for Bugs and this turns it into a memorable one, if still lacking a classic. This animated short can be found on Disc 1 of Volume 3 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A-
