I really like Traci Lords. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but she's pretty good at it. She plays the reckless, conservative, reporter of a "T". It's a great little thriller that keeps you guessing for a while. Jeff Fahey is also good as Traci's boss. I think given a decent break, Traci could be a great actress. Certainly it is not worse than some of today's leading women.
