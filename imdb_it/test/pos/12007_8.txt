Funny movie! The script is terrible but the quality of the actors saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, as is Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is right and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. History is the real star. Based on a true story, the rhythm moves well and the whole concept of escaping from East Germany drains you and holds you back. The joyful ending provides enough euphoria to compensate for the script. Don't expect the quality of the Academy Award but it's a nice ride for the whole family.
