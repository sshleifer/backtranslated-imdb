I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was there, but because it was a good baseball story and it also had a semi-dramatic view of some of the problems that a BASEBALL player got at the end of their time in Major League Sports they have to face. I also really appreciated the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the little things about how games are played differently. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie to watch on cable TV or to rent in the cold winter night and watch the "Dog Day's" of the summer and know that spring training is only a few months away distance. A good movie for a baseball fan and a good movie "DATE" ?? Trust me on that! *Wink*
