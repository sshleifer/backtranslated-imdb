Wow! In my opinion, THE NET is an excellent techno thriller that bites your nails and makes you feel good everywhere. When I saw it for the first time, I felt good everywhere for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought to myself: "It's a really nice place for the holidays". From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) started chasing her, I thought to myself: "Don't let something bad happen to her! I've even taken some deep breaths to avoid screaming more than I did I already did. On the positive side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I gave this excellent, techno thriller edge-of-your-seat, four stars.
