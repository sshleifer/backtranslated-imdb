The Last Dinosaur is a film designed to be fun and exciting. He managed to do both. <br /> <br /> Maston is a great hunter who hunts the big game (go figure). Owning a company, he plans an expedition with a group of people including a photographer named Frankie, a Japanese scientist, a guy who works for his company named Chuck and an African boy who helped him on many safaris called Bun Ta . The point is to study what is believed to be Tyrannosaurus Rex, the dinosaur that killed the last expedition in the area. They will reach this prehistoric area by taking a drilling vehicle that travels underwater called Polar Borer. After arriving in the area, they soon find the Tyrannosaurus, which Maston tries to shoot but his gun jams. Chuck immediately realizes that Maston always wanted to hunt the dinosaur to add it to his collection of "stuffed animals". While they were away, Tyrannosaurus invades their camp and drives Polar Borer away from their camp. Upon returning, the group realizes that they may be in the area longer than they expected, and Maston claims he will kill the tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> History is fantastic for a science fiction movie. Punching in a prehistoric area is something that seems to really happen. The scenery is beautiful and looks like a place where dinosaurs can still reside. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. Maston is the typical big time hunter who wants to get everything that could be a trophy kill. Great also Bun Ta, played by Luther Rackley, former NBA, who really looks and acts like an African pursuer. Jackie is the typical female that causes problems for the group and seems not to belong to the desert. Chuck is the former Maston employee who changed his point of view about his boss when he's at liberty with him. <br /> <br /> The tyrannosaurus in this film is one of the best in a film. He's a little too high up on the right as Godzilla does and he drags his tail, so he's a guy in a suit and tie. But the suit looks good, especially the head and tail, and the tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. I've seen many other films where dinosaur suits look worse. The tyrannosaurus in this film sometimes emits a roar similar to that of Godzilla and at other times it roars like King Kong from "King Kong Escapes" and "King Kong vs Godzilla". So a great tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in The Last Dinosaur. Of particular note is a great struggle between tyrannosaurus and triceratops. Also a great scene in which Bun Ta tries to pierce the tyrannosaurus. There are other large parts that I will not give away. You have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. Watch it and you won't be disappointed.
