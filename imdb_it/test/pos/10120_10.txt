I just got home from seeing "Radio". I've never seen such a stimulating story in a long time. My children are 8 and 5 years old and I'd like to take them so they can "hear" the message like I did - you should try to find the best in people and love them for what they are, don't judge them for their differences. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris both deserve the Academy Awards for this film. I don't know why we can't have more films like this, rather than the stuff that is served in theaters every day.
