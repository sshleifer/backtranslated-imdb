Hair is one of my favorite movies of all time. While not part of my generation, I have already seen this film 9 times and I can't get enough of it with the beautiful message of understanding, passion, beauty and love. This film is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should be united regardless of color, origins, religions and classes. I love the characters Berger and Woof and I think that 70s Central Park is one of the most beautiful places I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I still have this music in my mind: <br /> <br /> When the moon is in the Seventh House And Jupiter aligns with Mars Then peace will lead the planets And love will guide the stars <br /> <br /> This is the dawn of the Aquarian age Aquarius Aquarium! Aquarium! <br /> <br /> Harmony and understanding Plenty of sympathy and trust No more falsehoods or decisions Living sweet dreams of visions Mystic crystal revelation And the true liberation of the mind Aquarius! Aquarium! <br /> <br /> ps: I'm surprised to see that the director of this film is the director of AMADEUS himself. I love both movies!
