especially considering that I can count on a hand the romantic comedy films that I have ever liked. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is as good as the heart transplant patient, who has a mysterious connection with Duchovny's recently deceased wife. (I can think of several terrible films that have used this plot - I think there was an LMN film with Jane Seymour) This film, however, is a guardian. <br /> <br /> Duchovny is funny and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad - the dog is missing from his dead wife. All his friends want him to find a replacement, and there's a funny scene where he's in the dark and Driver is the maid. His date is horrible, and he finds himself intrigued by Minnie Driver. <br /> <br /> Caroll O'Connor is also good at one of his last roles, like the bitchy grandfather. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (this is the only film I liked) complete the comic look of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie because the plot works, it's not overly romantic, and doesn't insult the public's intelligence. Highly recommended 9/10.
