This game was one of the main reasons I got a PS2. I remember playing Soul Edge (sometimes called Soul Blade) during the day and got passionate. <br /> <br /> I played the original Soul Calibur but I never had the chance to play it for an enormous amount of time. However, I purchased the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur II and this is what really fascinated me in the series and I was thrilled when I heard Soul Calibur III. This game still gives us the classic characters like Mitsurugi, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. However, he also adds several new characters like Zasalamel, Tira and the unplayable Night Terror. (The real head of Tales of Souls) The mode based on "Chronicles of thes Sword" is a new feature that I really like, it can be quite challenging in later reports, but it's a good addition to the series. <br /> <br /> Soul Arena mode has several missions where you have to fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances. (The exception is "Final Battle" where you simply have to defeat Night Terror) It's another fine touch that makes the game even more fun. <br /> <br /> In some scenes in Tales of Should you will be pressed certain buttons to get a different result, this can be to dodge / block an attack or to get a better ending. (Each character has two endings) All in all, this is an excellent game and I would recommend it if you are a fan of fighting games.
