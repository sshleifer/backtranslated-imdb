First of all, let me say that this film is not for everyone. He has a very strange topic. A spinster who lives alone and lives a boring life discovers a young man in a park right in front of his town house. She notices him sitting outside in the rain and invites him to dry and warm up. The man does not speak and the woman assumes that he is deaf and dumb. However, she is fascinated by him and sexually interested in him. He finds it strange and continues his silence even though we find out later that he is not at all silent and that he tells his sister everything that happens between him and the woman. I won't give away the rest of the plot. If you can find this movie watch it. You can't take your eyes off it. What makes it so interesting? Well, it's totally unique. I've never seen anything like it and watching these two together is very inconvenient. Especially when you discover what this boring, boring and obsessive spinster is capable of. You will not forget it soon.
