In this offer, just see the Westminster Kennel Club's annual offer to see the parallels. Shockingly funny and captures the true essence of competition. One can only imagine the intelligence of the producers and the incredible skill of the artists. I too would have named this movie for a Globe Award and I think it's one of the most fun I've ever seen.
