I do not understand why more people have not commented on this, apart from the fact that perhaps not many have seen it. It's an incredible cast of characters, one after the other after another, all done by the guy who wrote the play. If you don't like the filmed works, you might not like them (after all, usually the comedies don't go well on TV), but it's a show of one man that will pay you attention everywhere. Highly recommended.
