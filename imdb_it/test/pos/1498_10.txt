Responding to those "Good Old Days" of 1971, we can vividly remember when we were treated with an entire season of Charles Chaplin at the cinema. This is what the promoter called when we saw it on somebody's old talk show. (We cannot remember who he was, neither MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest spoke of Sir Charles's career and how his films were out of circulation since the 1952 exclusion of previous "Little Tramp" of Los Estados Unidos based on his being an "undesirable Alien". (No Schultz, he is NOT from another planet!) <br /> <br /> CHARLIE was considered a "subversive" due his interest and his inquiry open on the various political and economic systems. Everything, from the anarchist movement of the 1920s (and before), the craze of technocracy to socialism in its various forms was a fair game for discussions at the Hollywood parties of Chaplin, which obviously meant inclusion of the Soviet style, which we commonly call communism. <br /> <br /> COMPOSED Mr Chaplin's situation was confused by a small detail: he had never become an American citizen. <br /> <br /> ANYHOW, enough of this sfon do it already! <br /> <br /> SUFFICE to say that he had become 'Person not free' in the United States of America. The time had come to get the old movies out of mothballs and go back to the movie houses. It would certainly be a great gesture on our part to easily forgive and quickly forget about Americanos. <br /> <br /> It would be a nice gesture for the great film artist; in addition, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences intended to honor Chaplin with a special tribute to the 1972 Oscar. This would surely be a pack of pathos full of tears, but a lot to have America invite Charlie back and get him and receive a special Academy Award career ahead of a worldwide television audience numbering in the millions. <br /> BESIDES, it would be natural to promote the Chaplin season at the Theater! (Remember, the little tramp was as crafty as a man from Bu $ in $$ like a film director was!) THE program consisted of performances of MODERN TIMES, CITY LIGHTS, THE GREAT DICTATOR, MONSEUR VERDOUX, A KING IN NEW YORK and finally THE CHAPLIN REVUE. Remember to be very excited about the anticipation of the multi date festival. <br /> <br /> In our beautiful city of Chicago, it was booked for the Carnegie Theater on Rush Street. The celebrations conclude with MODERN TIMES and all the others will be shown one at a time, each for the time necessary to satisfy the desire of the public to see each image. As we remember, the last one in the program was THE CHAPLIN REVUE. <br /> <br /> IN RETROSPECT, let's look back and wish them to have started the race with REVUE; since there were undoubtedly legions of spectators (very similar to us) who knew very little about his achievements in films, except for those Keystone, Essanay and Mutual Silent Shorts that were shown as regular features in so many Kiddy shows around the world . nation. Oh well, once again, no one consulted me! <br /> <br /> CONCENTRATING on today's honor film, THE CHAPLIN REVUE, we discovered that they were actually three separate images; carefully linked together by the use of the narrative of Chaplin (Himself), some lively themes and incidental music (again written by Chaplin) and some happy speeches and serious narratives (idem, by Chaplin). He opens the proceedings making use of some home movie type films that describe the construction of the Hollywood studio Chaplin, as well as some films taken from some tests, which show the director Chaplin that shows what he wants to a group of actors. <br /> <br /> THIS segment was well done and well received by the public. Both the building's humor and the tests were amplified making them seem accelerated. (He tries it of course, the building with the use of speeding up the photographic process of the camera. The old trick makes it seem that the buildings were almost building themselves. <br /> <br /> THIS amalgam of short films incorporates three of the Chaplin's short comedies from his experience with First National Pictures, from around 1917 to 1923. The choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of topics and moods. <br /> <br / > PRIMO was SHOULDER ARMS (Charles Chaplin Productions / First National Pictures, 1918). As the title suggests, this is a story of World War I. It came out in October 1918 with about a month before the day of the Armistice of November 11, a comedy of comedies was a love story between the private Chaplin and a French girl (Miss Edna Purviance). Lightness is fast, physical and in the great ancient tradition of ridiculing the enemy, the German army. br /> <br /> DISPLAYING an ec A striking example of an old adage about children and dogs that bring people together, the upcoming film A DOG'S LIFE (Chaplin Productions / First National, 1918) traces the parallel lives of Chaplin's tramp and a recently adopted stray. The story of the film involves families, two of them. A Homo Sapiens, a Canine and both provide us with great surprises. <br /> <br /> AS THE FINAL, WE HAVE THE PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923) was a good choice to have as a final. It was bright, light and narrow. It was an excursion to the Western Spoof area, comedies of this type having been made by every comedian and team. The "Pilgrim" in history is not of your standard Thanksgiving variety; but rather a "guy" or "Tenderfoot", who ventured out of the west. The tramp is not just that boy; but his character is an escaped convict who is mistakenly thought to be the new ecclesiastic of a church in the western city! <br /> <br /> Our score (which is Schultz and Me) is ****. (Here are four derbies) <br /> <br /> POOL SCHNITZ !!
