As often happens when the manga is translated into live action, there is a bit lost in the translation. However, this remains a very funny film. The premise is unusual and is presented in a quiet and sober style, so widespread in Japanese films (ha!). The special effects are a small field of the 70s but, it adds to the comic the atmosphere of the film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone but, if you know (and enjoy) other Japanese horror films like "Evil Dead's Trap", you'll like this movie.
