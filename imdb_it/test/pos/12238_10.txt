Your heterogeneous assortment of intrepid leaders: hard-nosed, pretty but insipid blonde head of the miner, exuberant geologist lady, drunk, inexplicably accented in Australian style (!) Old mining hand, without charm, dozen, cheerful boy and probably , the most annoying character of the uniformly irritating group, an aspiring nerd and bespectacled writer who is inclined to speak with floral and melodramatic expressions - trek in the dark, an unexpected cave in search of gold.
