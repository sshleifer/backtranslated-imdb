Fritz Lang has directed two great westerns: "Western Union" and "The Return of Frank James". Frank James's film is the same as "Jesse James". "Western Union" is one of the great westerns of Randolph Scott. I've never seen Robert Young in a western before; he is exceptional as a telegraph employee. This is the only film that comes to mind about the telegraph society that is opening up to the west. It's a high-profile story about the telegraph to the west, a love story in a triangle and about loyalty. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is superb. Dean Jagger, who created some westerns, plays the telegraph manager. Virginia Gilmore, who plays Mr. Jagger's sister, is the love interest in the film. Ms. Gilmore had a short career in the movies. He left the films in 1952 and became an acting teacher. She is primarily known as the first Mrs. Yul Brynner. It's nice to see Slim Summerville in a movie with Mr. Scott again. They were in two other great films: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James".
