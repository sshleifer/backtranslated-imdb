After having recently seen Cry Uncle by the same director, I decided to look for it and I'm glad I did! This is an extraordinarily good film. Far, far better than the ingredients seem to be. How many times have we had to suffer the embarrassment of someone playing with a bourgeois dad mixing it with the children of the aagh flowers! Yet here thanks to a perfect script it is made credible. Not ideal, not good or bad but credible. Peter Boyle, like the working class, hippie and ni ** er hater and Dennis Patrick as the hermetic outfit, recite their respective parts immaculately and I don't remember ever having seen the two classes together like this without things become sentimental. Susan Sarandon is as effective as a hippy girl, but she doesn't have much to do in her first film. It is a real film to be immortalized, as it is a very short period in the western period and in particular in the United States, when the counterculture was about to open up completely.
