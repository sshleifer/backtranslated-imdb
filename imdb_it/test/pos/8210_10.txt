Why all the negative reviews ??? You didn't expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece, right? What we have is a film that tried to entertain us and worked for me. Not an Oscar competitor, just entertainment. You can really see how the film has aged, especially with everything the internet has to offer today. I still remember when it was released for the first time and the network was still so new. Crazy and scary thoughts when I saw it for the first time; I was 15 and seriously thought that anyone could get information about your information on a computer and destroy you. But who says it can't happen ??? I'm not the kind of person to put a movie to death, analyzing it until I'm blue in the face. This is not my style Media acting, suspense and again, very funny. Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so cute. This is my favorite movie with her because it's like the computer genius, which I find very attractive. Of all the movies that were released in 1995, this should be my favorite, although I didn't see it until 1996. My vote, 9/10 because it slowed down a bit.
