I have heard that Rupert Grint has many promises from that role that everyone knows him. So even though I had never heard of this movie before, when it appeared in my cable TV programs, I immediately switched to that channel. I'm so happy I did it! <br /> <br /> I have read from other reviewers who generally do not like adult stories; On the other hand, I do it enough. I am one of those who is always of age; I have been since I was 12, I am now 52 and will probably continue up to 92 years. Arriving at the age of majority is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day brings. The suddenness of realization, its scope, sometimes throws us into disorder. If we try to protect our delicate self from that, then yes, I can see how it can end maturity. But if we simply resume and enter the new direction that we have discovered, then we are suddenly on a new road, and we are still alive like yesterday, only stronger, brighter and I would dare, more interesting. <br /> <br /> Here's what this movie was about. This has been a story of continuous growth; young Ben, his father, father Robert, and certainly Dame Evie ... have undergone a marvelous transformation. In fact, even Mr. Fincham did it, didn't he ?! All this, I suspect, except actually the mother, despite her enormous opportunity to do, provided by the events of the end of the film. One remains with the feeling that she continues exactly in the same path she was in, only with perhaps a different supporting cast. <br /> <br /> So an excellent film, which could not have been made in America, which is absolutely depressing to think about, but thank God we have a constant supply of films made elsewhere that we occasionally come to see. I highly recommend this film, as long as you don't mind using those parts that are too familiar to us all and smile for the rest.
