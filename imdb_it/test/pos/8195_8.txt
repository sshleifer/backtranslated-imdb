This is an excellent film. No, it's not Mel Gibson in "Braveheart", but then, he's not trying to be. In reality, "The Emperor and the Assassin" has probably (fortunately) more in common with a Shakespearean production than with a successful Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> In the third century BC, the King of Qin is attempting to join (in other words "conquer") the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the kingdom of Han. Now he needs an excuse to invade the Kingdom of Yan. <br /> <br /> This is where Lady Zhao comes in. She and the King have been friends since childhood. They are obviously very in love, but they cannot marry for political reasons. Together they design a plot. He will pretend to have fallen out of favor with the king and to flee to Yan. Once there, he will convince the Prince of Yan to send back a murderer to kill the king. When the murder fails, the King will have his excuse to invade Yan. <br /> <br /> Once in Yan, however, Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Listening and seeing more and more examples of the ruthlessness of his old childhood friend, he begins to wonder if the King might need to be murdered for real. A sure sign that you're not watching a Hollywood production is the final encounter between the king and the murderer. Unlike a Hollywood movie in which the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final result already predetermined, this is a fight that could really go either way. <br /> <br /> This is a well-built and well-made story of a tumultuous time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. The most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as Lady Zhao. I grow more and more convinced every time I see that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. <br /> <br /> I must say, however, that you have an unintentionally funny joke in this movie. Soon on Gong Li asks one of his servants "Do I have a pretty face?" <br /> <br /> Duh !!!
