The End Of Suburbia (TEOS) is a very useful film. It is also important and provocative. There seems to be no middle ground with the film or its main source of entertainment, the anti-sprawl Meister, James Howard Kunstler. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm not a big fan of New Urbanism, my criticism is due to its small vision. In the case of the New Urbanist Peter Calthorpe - another talking leader - finally feels what's obvious in and between the special TEOS out-outs added ... Calthorpe doesn't understand the peak of oil. I used this as a teaching tool in economics lessons to understand the importance of the earth as a factor of production - a fact long diminished by the neoclassical economy - and also as a vehicle to educate on: the peak of oil, our misuse of earth, global warming, our food production threatened, public transport our future compromise <br /> <br /> Move to South Park! .... Made by Canadians in Toronto for $ 25,000 and released in May 2004, this video has sold over 24,000 copies by October 2005. A major DVD vendor recently ordered nearly 400 more copies. <br /> <br /> The End Of Suburban sales were rising 1 1/2 years after its release and are also available on one of the leading online video services since September 2005. <br /> <br /> A sequel, Escape From Suburbia, is in the works with a possible release by August 2006.
