If you want to see what could be classified as the "stage" version of GYPSY, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> If you like (e) to list in the MERMAN recording of GYPSY then you really like watching MIDLER as Gypsy's mother, ROSE. In my opinion, Midler has the volume, the vibrato and the gifts that Merman once had. <br /> <br /> It doesn't often happen these days, when you listen to the updated versions of musicals, that I have that tingling feeling that makes my hair tingle, but Bette Midler certainly shows her talent in this movie - see how you like apples ..... <br /> <br /> I know you might not like it, but for me Ms. Midler is the definitive "Gypsy".
