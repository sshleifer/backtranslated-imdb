"Rififi" is a terrifying robbery film, and one from which subsequent robbery films have drawn since then. Jules Dassin had an idea of ​​the wicked evil world in which these thieves live - you won't find the Hollywood charm of "Ocean's Eleven" here. The "Rififi" thieves do not want to steal from the thrill and are not playing a game. They steal to survive, to pay for their children's education, to show themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The much appreciated robbery scene is a nail, filmed in virtual silence. I had the feeling that the plot went a little longer than necessary, but the high-speed race to deliver the child to his mother that ends the film is classic. <br /> <br /> Be careful-- - this film is very sad But it is also very good. <br /> <br /> Vote: A-
