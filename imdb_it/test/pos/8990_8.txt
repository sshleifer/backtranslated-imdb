Like most sports movies, it's not surprising that people who know something about sports can find flaws. As a soccer referee, I have yet to watch a movie or TV show doing it right when it comes to a game. "Forever" has good actors, but I found Sean Astin a little young to be an administrator in a juvenile prison. I was very grateful that the plot didn't involve the main character who turned his fellow prisoners into rugby players and faced Flagstaff and Highland. Which translates into credulity: a police car stops just as the Flagstaff villains are spying on Rick Penning. Although rugby is not a nationally sanctioned school sport, the team is a school club sport - very similar to the rodeo. Having said that, I find it hard to believe that high school officials can allow students to play with open wounds: it is not done on this day of AIDS and hepatitis. I don't care what the tradition is and the macho image. Nevertheless, it was a fantastic film where teenagers were expected to behave as adults (and sometimes they did). Unfortunately, too many coaches are like those in Flagstaff, or worse.
