I really don't care that anyone here likes this movie, I do it, and that's what this review is about. Lou Diamond Phillips is great in this comic role. that line on the ab and c train is now an instant classic to me, the cg is fantastic, yes the train seems a bit fake, but the aliens are always rock, Todd Bridges, where is Arnold and Mr. Drummond,, wow, is out of the loop, I suppose that's what makes you jail .. a bullet train is on its way to Las Vegas with the senator to make an important speech, a meteor has just hit, and now all of a sudden there are aliens escaping aboard the train, and our hero's cop must save the day, to make matters worse his ex-wife is on board to discuss with him. I just thought this movie was wonderful, a must see if you like action.
