This film fully deserves to be one of the best Hindi comedies ever made. Rajkumar Santoshi is mainly known for his gritty and tough social dramas, but this is without doubt the simplest film I've ever made. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around two small buffets Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan). They want to get rich quickly and then move to the big city. The same plan opens up separately - to woo a rich heiress Raveena (Raveena Tandon), daughter of a wealthy businessman, Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). Therefore, whoever marries Raveena puts his hands on all his riches. but when the other person's plan is known, there is an intense honesty struggle over who marries Raveena. Fun jokes and situations are unleashed as the battle rages on. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the identical twin brother of Ramgopal Bajaj, Shyamgopal Bajaj, wants to eliminate his brother and his niece and usurp the family's fortune. Add to this an assortment of funny characters including Raveena's maid Karishma (Karishma Kapoor), an error-prone butler named Robert (Vijoo Khote), a manager named Bhalla (Shehzad Khan) who imitates Ajeet's bad guy and cute gangster Gogo (Shakti Kapoor) who looks more like a pirate and a bizarre comedy awaits you. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time searching for LOGIC in the movie. Leave the company of your brains and enjoy only ENJOY. The actors are so in tune with the script that there is no room for errors. The dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are witty. The music (Tushar Bhatia) and the lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are memorable. The picturization and choreography (Saroj Khan) of "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Doori", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Karta Hai Tere Paas Aaoon" is right and will remain etched in my mind forever. <br /> <br /> The film starred in two superstars-in-the-making, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (who eventually became superstars). Aamir Khan is impeccable in his first comic role. I honor his sense of comic time. Salman pales in comparison to Aamir but is still nice. Among the supporting characters, Paresh Rawal stands out in his dual role as Ramgopal and Shyamgopal. <br /> <br /> The film was surprisingly failed at the box office. I can't understand why. I still recommend it to everyone.
