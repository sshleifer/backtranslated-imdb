Ah, classic comedy. At the point in the film where brains fit together, a two-minute scene with Bruce Campbell partially beating, reminds me of how films and simplistic ideas can grab you and wrap you in an entire movie. <br /> <br /> For years and years, Bruce Campbell knows what kind of film we want from him. We want to see weird movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see the cameo roles in the films of Sam Raimi and we want to see "The man with the screaming brain". With the title alone, it is known that it will limit that kind of completely silly film, like Army of Darkness, only with more fools and fewer monsters. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is simple. Bruce sees the doctor. The doctor has a new idea. Bruce happens to have some bad things about seeing the doctor. Coincidentally, it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him. It follows the hilarity. <br /> <br /> With the addition of Ted Raimi as a bizarre Russian boy, and the waiter Stacy Keach in the role of Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, it's fun, this is the movie. Complete fun. Never a point of fear. <br /> <br /> If you like the silly Bruce Campbell, you'll like this. Then again, why would you watch this if you didn't like Bruce Campbell?
