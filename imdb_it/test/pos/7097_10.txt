This film was a great Universal Monster movie. Once again he plays Lon Chaney as The Wolfman and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's Monster. Oh yes, that idiot John Carradine is back again like Dracula. I like every actor in this movie. I particularly liked Onslow Stevens as Dr. Edelmann. (It is written with 2 n's) I thought it was a good idea to have the good doctor sentenced to death as a Talbot. A scene that I think is very good is the scene in which Dr. Edelmann is in deep thought as he changes. Everything that worries him flashes before your eyes. The good doctor is saying no as his evil side is saying yes. This is the only reason I didn't want Dracula's character to be completely eliminated from this movie. I thought Dracula had no problems with House of Frankenstein. If his character was eliminated, you wouldn't miss it. In this film the doctor's blood is contaminated by Dracula, giving him his curse Jekyll and Hyde. I hate John Carradine and I don't think he should have played Dracula. I didn't mind that other actors played Frankenstein's monster after the great Karloff because everyone did a good job. But when they take another actor to play Dracula, he stops right there. John Carradine thought he was so tall and powerful. They once offered him the role of Frankenstein's monster and refused him because he thought he was too trained. I could only imagine Carradine acting in The Monster discussing with the director on the set: "I don't have to take this, I did Shakespeare." John Carradine was not Dracula and never will be. I'm sorry John, Bela Lugosi is the only Dracula. Thank God they brought back Bela as Dracula for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. It doesn't disappoint you and you'll like it like you did with the other. This is a great addition to monster movies. If you are a collector, make sure you don't leave this out. <br /> <br />
