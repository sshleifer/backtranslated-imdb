A quick look at the premise of this film would seem to indicate only another stupid 80s party inbred / backwood; the type in which sex equals death and actors are all boring stereotypes that you actually want to die. However, "JBD" offers much more. <br /> <br /> Rather than focusing on naked flesh and blood (though there is a bit of each, no sex anyway), the film focuses on providing an imminent tension of terror / montage between beautiful panoramic background. These feelings are further accentuated by a cast of realistically sympathetic characters and antagonists who are more amoralistic than the definitions of evil in cardboard. Oh yes, is George Kennedy here too and when is it not a good thing? <br /> <br /> If you liked "Wrong Turn", look at this to see where much of his methodology comes from.
