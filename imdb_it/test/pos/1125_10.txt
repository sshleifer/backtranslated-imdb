I'm so glad the Greek is back! This season looks really busy. I'm glad Casey is trying to get serious at school but he's still involved in the sisterhood. It's really funny that you want to get into politics and that you're highlighting your "intriguing talent". I loved Calvin's new haircut! It makes it seem more mature. They should also shave Cappy's head. All the guys are sexy but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I can't wait to see more! I'm particularly interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam and Rusty! I also love Rebecca. She is really pretty. In fact, I think Rebecca and Calvin should connect. Come on, Calvin! Join my team!
