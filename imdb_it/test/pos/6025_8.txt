The plot begins in an interesting way, however, towards the end, too many people die in too short a time, transforming the thriller-mystery aspect of history into a massacre. <br /> <br /> The only real highlights were Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who were once again their excellent selves. Nice try with an inappropriate third, even if a good ending.
