I must say that this is my favorite movie of all time. I've seen it more than 100 times (actually I had to buy a new copy after overwatching). It's what the eighties were like and what a romantic story with some inserted morals. I strongly recommend anyone who wants to relive the film back to high school. Buy a copy now it's a classic !!!!
