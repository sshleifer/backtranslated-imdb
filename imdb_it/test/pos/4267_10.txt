I watch a lot of movies and I had no idea that everything would be fine. I couldn't wait to do it after reading the plot (although I find the Nirvana overrated). It seemed like a lot of fun, but it was more than that. Jansen puts in small touches such as books (Kubrick's book among others), movie posters, etc. I like it when I see a director who takes his time and puts his heart into a movie. And you can really feel it in this. There are a lot of scenes and moments that I love, I'm trying to think of other movies that are like this now and I'd say the only thing I can think of is Cameron Crowe's movies. It takes small moments and makes them stand out and special. The soundtrack is incredible and every song works perfectly with the scenes and sensations of the film. This film is incredibly filmed and the editing is exceptional. I could really go back and forth on the film. I can't recommend it enough. If you want a funny story with great melodies of a director who clearly puts his heart into his work, take a look at it.
