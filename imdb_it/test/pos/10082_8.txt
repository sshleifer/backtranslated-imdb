I've seen this movie twice, both times on Cinemax. The first time in its unrated version, which is soft-core porn at its best and the second time in an abridged version (cuts all sex and most of the nudes out) that was fun in a typical street beach movie . The unrated version has an incredible sex scene with Nikki Fritz, a boy and a bottle of oil that is out of the world (no pun intended). Unfortunately, in the cut version that scene is almost completely cut off, like all the other sex scenes. Rated or unclassified, it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc.) who try to act. We also receive B-queen appearances Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin from the old Batman series).
