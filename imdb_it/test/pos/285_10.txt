My friends and I used to gather in a house to see it on a Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only program that ever made us lose our opening hours. It's one of the best comedies I've ever seen but the best. David Jason was brilliant and has been compared many times to Buster Keaton with his clever stunts that were believably pulled out. I wish I could get the series on DVD to watch it again. He had an extraordinary ability to make stupid things believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions. It's a "Trip and Fall guy" and I remember watching a trailer once where it showed people how to do this professionally. Certainly he is the one who teaches people this art. He only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did. Pshaw, this program shows how talented I am. I'm lost by why David Jason vetoed another series, because for me it was one of the best things I've ever done and I've been a fan of him since he did this series. It is said that he did not like it because it showed the crudeness of his career. In my opinion, that might have been the right decision when he took it, but now his career has progressed so far, I think it would be a good time for him to do another series that shows him looking back at his "secret life "" full of mistakes he does not see
