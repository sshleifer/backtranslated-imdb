A fabulous film, which I've seen several times since I bought the video just four days ago. Yes, I'm a fan of Colin Firth and Colin was his usual natural and wonderful talent. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Nimi's 7-year-old son) was very special and natural to watch. They were hilarious and together they also touched the strings of my heart. The scenes that I liked the most were Sammy and Matt sitting on the wall chatting and Matt then falling back out of the wall hilariously (I won't reveal the contents of their discussion so as not to ruin the plot). Also very funny was Sammy who questioned Matt about sex, Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene and made what can be an uncomfortable topic between adult and child so natural. The words and face of Colins at the end of that scene were so delicious and they said it all! simply brilliant. The credit, of course, must also go to Fissy Roberts for his delicious portrait of Sammy. He played such a lovely and brash character. The two actors were simply perfect together. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Nimi) was perfectly balanced and I could no longer agree that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch, showing love, tension and of course passion. It was exciting to see how their delicate love story had gradually developed, also showing how their cultural and social divisions affected their relationship and it was good to see how Colin and Nia sensibly retracted Matt and Nimi by discovering, accepting and overcoming these differences. He kept me fixed to the TV and guessed right up to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Even Colins' portrayal of Matt's vulnerable and youthful side was perfectly interpreted, so much so that I found it hard to watch when Matt was so mean and childish about Sammy because he (Matt) he felt that Sammy was hindering his romance / relationship with Sams Mother Nimi. He could not help feeling very disappointed, angry and frustrated with Matt for treating Sammy this way and this in turn threatened to ruin the special relationship of Matts with Sammy and Nimi. Colins special talent "getting into the head of a character" and showing the public the different sides of a character, was very obvious here and pure magic to watch. I must also say that Colin also has a good relationship with the young actors (see also "My life is a wonderful and unmissable film). <br /> <br /> I also loved the relationship between Matthew and his wife Jenny, both they were excellent in showing the public the dark side and tensions within their marriage and that not all "happy Marriages" apparently are just what they may seem from the outside. <br /> <br /> I don't forget to mention the reverend that I thought was very funny, in some ways serious! Even Nimi's mother and family were hilarious and brought to light the importance of Nimi's culture and her situation. <br /> <br /> On the flip side, I can't really find a disadvantage, but be objective about the film and give credibility to my review, the only negative comment I would like to make is that the writers didn't explain in detail enough why Matt collapsed in the car , there was only a vague suggestion, from Nimi, of something wrong with his heart. However, this did not detract from my enjoyment of the film, far from it. I just needed to rewind the tape a little for a second take. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie had everything, fun, uplifting and I liked the intense colors and sunny scenarios. The film warmed up a cold winter day and made me smile :-)) All the essentials were there, laughter, love, tension, sadness, anger, drama and a feeling of warmth good factor, with, yes, a lot of those delicious Colin Firth moments including a very soaked Colin in a 'wet shirt' scene, not to be missed by any fan, what a girl could want more ;-)) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie , especially to all Colin Firth fans ;-)
