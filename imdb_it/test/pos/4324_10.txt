First of all, I just have to say that I'm a big fan of LOST. All those who do the show, I love them. There is everything inside, really. <br /> <br /> I'm glad they were great at it, for example Jack Bender is the greatest director, well, maybe after J.J. Abrams. And, of course, full credit to Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. They are geniuses. <br /> <br /> However, the season 2 finale is definitely one of the best LOST episodes ever !!! Live together, Die Alone focuses on the story of Desmond David Hume reaching the island, and Henry Ian Cusick is so nice to play that character! The creators of the show would have been very stupid if they let the old men die. <br /> <br /> So, in LOST, the survivors of the plane stayed there for 65 days ... 65 days, man. Whileas Rousseau has been there for SIXTEEN years, and the Others have been there for God knows how much. Referring to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof & Abrams. Anyway, I hope we will get the answers we need, in season 3. I can't wait! My vote is nine.
