This film was clearly an initial attempt by a new director, but it nevertheless managed to be original and fun and at times exciting. However, I must say that the story would not have occurred even without the stellar performance of Paul Anthony as Pip. He made the parts well written very credible and influential, and the parts written more weakly much more bearable. Also, I must mention the performance of Alan Cumming. It was nice to see it in a part like this. He put a weight on his role which provided a very rooted element in the film. As for Paul Anthony: who is this guy? Why didn't I see him anymore? Someone will give him more roles, please!
