Nothing like this was seen on TV at the time and probably never will. From the first image of that police light that blinded you and you heard the words: "Police squad - in color", you were forced to see that it was not a normal sitcom at all. <br /> <br /> kill a "Guest Star" and then never refer to him again, where you've ever seen him before. Then the real show started and if you didn't pay attention, you will miss several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to something or you would mind. This was the show for which the VCRs were made, long before Married with Children or The Simpsons. <br /> <br /> The stories made absolutely no sense and the dialogue was sometimes so strange that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before realizing it was a joke. <br /> <br /> The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came out of Dragnet and were absolutely straight (without accents or funny expressions) but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely impassive. Only once, as I recall, was there a segment interpreted for silly laughter - a scene involving a trip to a dentist, an aspiration and a lot of saliva. <br /> <br /> There were a few boring moments - like the informer Johnny and an appearance of some celebrity. That was a heartbreaking moment, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh good. Everything cannot be perfect. The important thing is that for the rest of the time you were on your knees laughing. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was fortunate to have resumed his career when he included the character of Frank Drebin in 3 features, but he must have was also an Achilles heel. Do you remember seeing it in anything except the Naked Gun type work since then? And don't count the horrible Mr. Magoo reworked for live action. He probably made a lot of money, though.
