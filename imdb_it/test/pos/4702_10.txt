Oh so beautiful, oh so full of tears and so heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> It makes everything so superficial, so pale, so insignificant in comparison. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen is not a true saint. <br /> <br /> She is a true human - imperfect, raw and frank, but passionate and with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> What I found most interesting was that this handful of miserable, miserable people found meaning and laughter. <br /> <br /> What I loved most is how the documentary described the polarity of human nature.
