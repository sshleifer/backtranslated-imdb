It would be unwise to judge that both narrative and documentary are more authentic than the other. Both formats have a form of basic fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers try to reconstruct and narrate stories in their perspectives. Since both formats usually leave some undisputed problems due to the "complexity of the subplots" and the display time, they deny viewers the opportunity to open debates and further deepen knowledge and build truth. Adding to the inability of the viewer to evaluate the sources (eg. Comparisons with written history) and the logic behind the arguments, the story can be open to distortion through narrative and documentary. <br /> <br /> For most people, the documentary can be seen to be more truthful usually involving testimonials from participants and real footage. However, these visual elements are selected and modified, to be arranged so as to allow the producers to present their version of realism to the spectators. In The Real Buddy Holly Story, Paul McCartney tries to establish Buddy Holly as remembered by family and friends and how Buddy influenced the rest of the music world. The testimonials may have been distorted because the memories may not be accurate and the emotions evolved to create a Buddy legend. The documentary made corrections to the film version and covers other events, such as there were 3 Cricket members and Buddy's music was actually heard outside the US at that time (he had to take a world tour!). However, he did not enter into a thorough discussion of what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. Criticism and / or negative discussions may have been left out of the documentary as the producers try to present a friend the world should have remembered. In the end, we are unable to construct the whole truth because we limit ourselves only to the "realities" of the past that the documentary tells us. <br /> <br /> Personally, I prefer a narrative film because it provides rich visual images, which helps us reconnect with the collective memory of that era. It gives viewers a more constructive structure in history, and this leads to a better preservation of memory for the public when they tell the story. There is also an element of flexibility that allows directors to express their thoughts and points of view on specific topics. In The Buddy Holly Story, racial problems have been highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to these problems with current situations. <br /> <br /> Viewers constantly try to revisit certain emotions when they watch a movie and use these emotions the audience can choose to establish personal connections with the applied meanings that a director wants to offer. In most stories, people are more likely to selectively remember struggles, inspirations and the way the story ends. Through The Buddy Holly Story, we remember the struggles of Buddy and the Crickets, of how Maria was a source of encouragement and that Buddy Holly was a great interpreter until the day he dies.
