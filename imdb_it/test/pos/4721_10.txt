This film should be seen by as many people as possible focusing on human rights issues in Burma. When I saw this movie for the first time in the mid-90s, it totally changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her movement for democracy. I was impressed so I wanted to understand more about the situation. Every film that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly. Patricia Arquette is as superb as the American lady who because of a personal tragedy has become reckless with her life decisions and gets involved in the resulting conflict. It is a powerful film on a topic that deserves more publicity. As the film itself says, the 1988 massacre against democratic activists was not broadcast on television and therefore passed largely unobserved in the world. I implore all those who read these comments to take the time to find out more about the current situation of the Burmese people. <br /> <br /> The time has come to release this movie on DVD. Can anything be done?
