I've seen this movie at least 8 times, and I keep laughing every time. The film is about how an intelligent and motivated man, against all odds, can fool the whole system too confident. <br /> <br /> This film is for all people who love a fun movie. <Br /> <br /> The action and comedy are well mixed in a brilliant film, which I hope to see soon on DVD. <br /> <br />
