In a completely invaded Morocco of Europeans and Americans, at the beginning of the twentieth century, the Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), his son and daughter His intention is to get some money and guns as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In times of election, US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from prison with American soldiers. I don't like films about explicit colonialism and the lack of respect for the sovereignty of other countries, but "The lion and the wind" is really a great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress in the 70s, is wonderful, she plays a kidnapped woman like in the movie "Blue Soldier". Sean Connery is perfect, as usual, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. Brian Keith is as big as the American president. I don't know much about the history of Morocco to analyze if there is anything true in this story, but this film is a noteworthy entertainment. In Brazil it is only available on VHS. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `O Vento e o Le√£o '(` The Lion and the Wind') <br /> <br />
