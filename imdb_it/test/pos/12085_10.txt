I saw this film a long time ago, but the saddest film of all time remains in my memory. I cried relentlessly. My mother will never watch this movie again because it's almost painful to watch. However, apart from that, the story is not exactly complex ... Ann Margaret is dying and has to give away her 10 (?) Children. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's during depression and she has to break the neighbor brothers one by one. I guess this was very sad for me because I too come from a very close and united family and I can identify with the pain of every child leaving their mother and brothers. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm a masochist but I'd like to see this movie again because it was well done and in the end, surprisingly, it's slightly happy (so at least we could smile and sob at the same time). He should come on TV sometimes so I can see him again.
