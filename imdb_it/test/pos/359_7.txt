Being the penultimate film by Chaplin Essanay, CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B. Demille's drama with the same title. It is obvious that Demille's acknowledged film did not impress the king of the comedy, which he later admitted in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin. He had already made several, namely HIS PREHISTORY PAST and HIS NEW WORK, and would have continued to do so until the end of his career in film (for example in A KING IN NEW YORK). <br /> <br /> Chaplin makes a great portrait of Don José, and Edna Purviance's is as good as Carmen. Nor do we act as we are used to; Charlie is not the lovable Tramp and Edna is far from an innocent little woman, but they weren't even Chaplin's intentions. A BURLESQUE SU CARMEN is a slightly strange, very different Chaplin film, but still includes good material. <br /> <br /> The main story is, though very differently structured, as in the original drama. Don José is very much in love with Carmen, but he is not the only one in this field; "Carmen, Carmen, (the) beautiful Carmen, (is) loved by all men under 96", but she has the great advantage of being an officer, and we are there; this is the famous story of rivalry, love, greed and honor, seen from a humorous perspective. Thanks to the performances of Chaplin and Purviance and to the wonderful and wonderful music of George Bizet that I admire a lot, this could have been an almost touching masterpiece, it's time taken into consideration. Could have been. But unfortunately, although it's a pretty good comedy, I don't think it's fair to blame the people who claim that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece. But it is important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with the lack of talent, but rather the result of conflicts concerning the business. When Chaplin refused to sign the contract with Essanay after completing his last film for the company, POLICE, they took their revenge by taking back all the scenes that Chaplin had originally modified by CARMEN. Thanks to this, the film is a bit confusing and has several useless scenes that are more annoying than funny, and the film turned out to be a Ben Turpin film - Turpin played Remendados - from a Chaplin short. Of course, Chaplin was desperate when he found out what Essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several days. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended to Chaplin fans and fans of beautiful music.
