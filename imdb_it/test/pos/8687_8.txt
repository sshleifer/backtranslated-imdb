This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. To begin with, there are exceptional performances of the beautiful Debra Paget as a dancing princess / girl, by Michael Rennie as the villain, the handsome young man Jeffrey Hunter investigating crime in his city / state and others. The film is an unusually colorful adventure, and we even see the princess playing the dance she will play later (for once). He manages to stab Hunter before he learns he is on his side; photography, Travilla's costumes, Lionel Newman's music and the style of the film are also unusually good. Add to this compelling action, clever characterization and good direction from veteran Harmon Jones of a script by Gerald Drayson Adams set in 1249 AD, and you have the ingredients of a pleasing Greek-Middle Eastern taste. But there is much to praise for the unusual and well-developed plot here, as there is much more to praise than the rapid pace of the film, sequences of well-managed physical actions and superior technical aspects. Classically trained actors such as Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Dona Drake are not commonly found in a "B" movie together; nor are there any fascinating ensembles, a variety of venues and a mystery of the quality that is provided here. One way to evaluate a film is: "If I had the guarantee of living the experience, would I choose to undergo these events and perform these actions?" Since my answer is a resounding "yes" in this case, this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very underestimated cinematic work. Could it be the all too frequent disdain of American criticism of women as warriors and thinkers who, as in so many other cases, caused closed minds to misrepresent the obvious anti-tyranny and pro-entertainment qualities of this reputable film?
