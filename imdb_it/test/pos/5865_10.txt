I went through the highs. I crossed the lows ... I cried, laughed, vomited my guts always loving. But through it all, I was made complete. I became a better person for having lived this experience in self-imposed degradation. It is not every day that you have experienced the worst, and to go out on the other side with something that is very similar to our sanity and intact. Friends ... neighbors: unite and be like one now. Go out and find this movie and languish in its extravagances. Put it up on the mantel and kiss its polystyrene box. Take him to bed. Take it out with you when you go shopping or in the dark with strange people. They will appreciate you more for your sublime and uniquely schizophrenic inclination to the cinema. And then they will throw their favorite drink in your face (but you will have the last laugh). I ran for Governor with this little beauty under my belt (and you can do it too!). It is a pleasure that is worth having again and again.
