Like a winding country road, "Tough Luck" takes the viewer for a ride. There is nothing wrong with the plot curves, as long as credibility does not fly out the window. Unfortunately, in the end, the film calls into question the tolerance of faith of an audience. However, it is easy to forgive this guilt because of the higher acting, the character development and the wonderful carnival atmosphere. Don't expect to appreciate any of the characters. Armand Asante, Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk, play shady scammers, not exactly the kind of person who is easily admired. The double crosses arrive fast and furious, and the final cross is somewhat elongated. Recommended. - MERK
