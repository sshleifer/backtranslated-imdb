Sure, how could he. Obviously he co-opted several aspects of that excellent film, also based on the sensational French case of the "doctor in the World Health Organization" who described himself and killed his family and himself when he was exposed as a fraud . Emilio refers to his son as "monster", sings on the radio in his car, hangs on the benches of the park, and specializes in investment schemes to defraud his family and friends - all this and more directly raised by "Time "Out", which was released the year before "Nobody's Life". Too bad because this movie is good enough on its own, with good acting and writing, considering that Vincent of "Time Out" is a much thinner character that seems to have a sense of ethics even if sometimes it turns into knots, the protagonist here seems devoid of any character, apart from his appearance and his winning charm.Seriously, the part where he used X-rays that show the cancer of her mother-in-law to draw more money from her father, then uses a subtle turn on the same scam to avoid eviction from her luxurious home for not paying the lease time - it's almost too much. The boy has no shame, in fact, it's more as the protagonist of the "stepfather" of a poor schmuck who is fired and is so humiliated that he cannot face the disappointment of his family and friends and feels compelled to invent a brilliant new life for himself, as Vincent did in "Time Out". Thus, one could feel the tension mount in "Nobody's life" and the violent conclusion coming. One thing about "Nobody's Life" is that "Time Out" definitely lacked a love interest, apart from the protagonist's confident wife. It is not difficult to understand how the sexy babysitter was able to fascinate and ensnare Emile to the extent that he ignored the danger of his natural curiosity and allowed him to expose his demeanor less than carefully constructed. Given the reservations mentioned, this is a pretty good movie that we found funny. If you crave something that touches similar elements that go deeper and is more intellectually and spiritually satisfying, I strongly suggest "Time Out".
