"Admissions" is a nice drama even if there are some problems with the finale. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie who is trying to avoid college. In order not to be noticed by her stressed mother, she composes poems that everyone thinks her mentally ill sister wrote. All the acting is top notch, especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. Both have done great shows. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. The first is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd. Its part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the ending. It goes in circles, which I didn't expect with the 84 minutes of execution. In addition, the film is definitely worth watching.
