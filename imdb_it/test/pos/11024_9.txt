Niagara, Niagara is a breathtaking and heartbreaking story about the two outsiders Seth and Marcy. Robin Tunney gives a fantastic performance while Marcy suffers from Tourette's Sydrome, becoming increasingly ill as the movie progresses. This film is not very optimistic and is very difficult emotional, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but look at it and find out for yourself. It is certainly worth it.
