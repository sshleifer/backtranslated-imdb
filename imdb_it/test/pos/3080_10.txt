I thought this movie was fantastic and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the pieces I missed as I leaned over my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ on the size of the shoe to find this funny movie, well, my IQ is roughly: 135 ... I challenge this person to interrogate me and then eat the his own words! This film is brilliant and if the aforementioned critic was not such a boring idiot, he could smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they intended !!! <br /> <br /> The musical numbers were so imaginative! ALL when you watch a movie over that period of time you will notice the men in tights and understand how different today's clothing is and how fun it would be to find today's male population if they wore tights day after day! The idea of ​​dedicating a song to the dancing butch men in tights was so fresh that nobody can laugh !!! (Also, seeing hip-hop rapper doing ballet is always hysterical - as a dancer, I did ballets and hip hop and I danced with men who had to do both ... make me once again every time !!!) < br /> <br /> I love this movie, if someone hasn't seen it yet, don't listen to the critic over ... look at it and then decide for yourself !!!
