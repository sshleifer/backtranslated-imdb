Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, being first Namak Halal (although that was technically a drama). History is nothing revolutionary, but the resulting complications make it fantastic. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Observe his expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He's extraordinarily good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also as good as a bit dimmer than the two characters. The noises he makes are almost as amusing as those of Aamir. Raveena and karisma serve their purpose but they are nothing extraordinary. The real choice of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless children of poor fathers. They don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way. So both their brains run into an idea to woo the daughter of a rich man (Paresh Rawal) (Raveena Tandon) who comes to India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet during the journey and come together to drive away the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they succeed, they must free each other. Somehow, both enter Raveena's home, Amar as a wounded man and Prem as a doctor. From here on they try to hunt each other. But things are complicated when Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls in love with Prem and pursues him. Even the evil twin of the rich man (Rawal) tries to get rid of the heir and his father, so he will inherit the money and send his two most trustworthy but clumsy fools to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you don't want to lose. Watch it! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, it's so beautiful. And if you like this movie, I'd also recommend Gol Maal if you haven't already watched it. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
