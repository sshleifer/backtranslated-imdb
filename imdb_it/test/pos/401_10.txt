The kind of "small" film in which studies used to excel, but which rarely do anymore. A sort of "soul" version of the most famous "The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells". Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and soul music enthusiast who becomes obsessed with bringing together the members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his businesses and those of group members; a cast that includes such genuine musical talent as Isaac Hayes, as well as supporters of the acting Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. It is not meant to be an epic in any way, this is still a piece of solid gold.
