Based on "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking, this extraordinary Eroll Morris film documents the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. He has contributed more to science, despite his debilitating illness, ALS, than a skilled scientist can only dream of. <br /> <br /> The film begins by telling the story of Hawking's childhood and how he was a poor student who was recognizably bright. He made his way between college and university, where he was diagnosed with the disease that would have taken away his normal body functions, but would have allowed him to continue living and thinking perfectly. <br /> <br /> Morris discusses how the bright Stephen's mind developed from childhood to the present, at one point his mother tells how-when she was pregnant-she prophetically bought an astronomical atlas to read while she was in the hospital. Hawking himself tells the chronology of his discoveries, while Morris interviews with friends and colleagues who were fortunate enough to make friends with the magnificent man. <br /> <br /> It tells of how it was first intrigued by the discovery that the Universe was expanding similarly to how a star would expand. We also know that the stars will eventually die and become what are now known as "black holes", if this is the case, the universe will not start to contract too much, reversing itself until it reaches the "great crisis"? as Hawking says. And when the universe begins to retreat, won't time "reverse"? When I asked this question, I started thinking that death might not be the end, maybe one day it will come back, and our death will become our rebirth and our birth our death. The universe is a great cycle just like anything else in life. <br /> <br /> This is what Hawking is telling us, everything in the universe is recycled. This is completely logical and can make your mind reflect in a million directions by pondering them. This is why I love this movie and why it is a must see !!! An 11 out of 10 ... Morris never stops joking!
