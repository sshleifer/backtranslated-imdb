They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of a previous Warner Brothers movie, The Life of Jimmy Dolan, which starred with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prize boxer. <br /> <br /> Even with the restrictions now in production by The Hays Office, this remake turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscible as a boxer. John Garfield with his background and his style turns into a part for which he was born. <br /> <br /> They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley which Jack Warner believed in keeping himself busy in musicals. Berkeley would soon leave Warner Brothers for MGM. <br /> <br /> Berkeley does a good job here, keeping the action flowing at a good pace. I particularly like the scene where four of the Dead End Kids and Garfield are swimming in a water tank and run aground when the water level goes down. They pull it out quite narrowly and with good ingenuity. <br /> <br /> Other performances besides Garfield and the children to remember are May Robson who runs the summer camp for children and Claude Rains as detective obsessed with Garfield's Runway.
