Peter is top notch, acting and looking good. seems to be watching a live performance, it works with a good camera, and I was sad it was over. I'm looking forward to the big screen. Super cast, this could be a great success. I like the way children interact as a sister and two brothers, it really made me think about my brothers going through a situation like Peter's, the happy father who thinks he will end his life after a big party ... I colors and sets were delightful for the eyes, they help you so much to attract you into the movie / play ... I was so happy to see Peter not being Colombo, this guy could always act, and now this is a movie that gives him that reach. I suggest you bring your family in this movie. Maybe teenagers won't get much from this, no guns, fast cars, stupid lines, stupid fart jokes ... but your adult kids will love it. Good show for one night with them. <br /> <br /> Jason
