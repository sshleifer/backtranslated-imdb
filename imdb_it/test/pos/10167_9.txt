A film that tends to be buried under prejudice and prejudice - It's a remake! Doris Day is in! She sings! - Hitchcock's second crack at "The man who knew too much" is his most underrated film, and probably a true masterpiece in its own right. <br /> <br /> This is, in more ways than one, Doris Film of the day Not only does it give the best performance of his career, more than having it run by James Stewart, but the whole film is subtly structured around his character rather than his. This is, after all, a film in which music is both a motif and a plot. What better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? Think: Day's Jo McKenna abandoned her career on stage to settle down with her husband and raise her child. This seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't seem to be unhappy. But look how Stewart teases her about the horse-drawn carriage for her concerns about Louis Bernard, which implies that she's jealous of the fact that Bernard didn't ask her any questions about her career. This is clearly a recurring joke between them - she responds with a 'har-de-har-har' which denotes the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that she has some latent resentment for her confinement, and that both realize it. br /> <br /> After their son has been kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. This is a cruel scene, brilliantly interpreted by both actors, which illustrates the imbalance of power in their marriage - is trying to control and subdue his reactions, essentially using his professional knowledge to suppress his voice in marriage just like the his medical career suppressed his singing career. <br /> <br /> The power of that voice is demonstrated in the sequence of the Ambrose chapel, when it must reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of women in carnage - almost as a warning about what will happen of her if she continues to suppress her talent. At Albert Hall, it's his need to shout, to exercise those awesome lungs, which saves a man's life, and in the Embassy's final, it's his talent and reputation that allows them to locate their child. On the contrary, all of Stewart's male activity is counterproductive: his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end, he is left in church while everyone else moves to Albert Hall, and his efforts there manage only to have the murderer killed , thus depriving the police of potentially useful information. It is only when his action joins his wife's voice, in saving Hank from the embassy, ​​that he actually manages to do something useful. <br /> <br /> Far from being forced into the film to give one day the opportunity to sing, "Que Sera Sera" acts as the first musical device in the film, foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the McKennas; 'the future is not ours to see' really. It also prepares the way for the final cleanly, in which the close bond between mother and child through music will allow Doris to save the day. <br /> <br /> The film's most famous sequence makes music the main feature - the construction until the attempted murder in the Albert Hall. This long sequence without words could be the single most extraordinary thing Hitchcock has committed to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually. We see people conducting conversations in this sequence, but we never hear a word they say. We don't need - the images say it all. It's also his most exquisite suspense sequence, with the pieces moving slowly in place as the music builds. The editing is incredibly tight, perfectly matched to the music. There is no out of place frame - everything that does not directly refer to murder is giving the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which all this is being revealed. It builds slowly, but in the end the suspense is almost unbearable. When Jo screams, it's not just a relief for her, but for the audience. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the Ambrose chapel is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has had to attend a service in particular non-conformist church of the stick-in-mud. The embassy sequence seems a bit flat after that of Albert Hall that preceded it in first vision, but the second time it seems actually more effective, with the final armed hand walk that benefits from the wonderful use of the singing of Day in the background, reminiscent of music-as-ambient-noise in 'Rear Window'. The score as a whole is subtle, allowing you to put music on the screen from the sources. <br /> <br /> Bernard Miles is a villain, a bit banal, but with a dry spirit. He is surpassed by Brenda de Banzie like his wife, who walks in a thin line between the left and the sympathetic. Just look at the way you smoke a cigarette while your husband prepares the killer - his position is the gangster's moll, denying the outside of Middle England, but he clearly has a soft side, and perhaps maternal feelings towards Hank . <br /> <Stewart is excellent, although Hitchcock has always played him as "Everyman", as the director's daughter seems to think, so he confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who married the fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in Rear Window and an obsessive necrophile in Vertigo. The day is nothing short of phenomenal. Just look at his reaction to the news that his son was kidnapped - he never overflows anything, but he doesn't sell it soon. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. It never makes us forget what is at stake for the McKennas; they feel the most completely human of all its central characters.
