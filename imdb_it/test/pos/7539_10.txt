Alistair Simms inspired the portrait of Miss Fritton transcends resistance. He is one of the great characters of comedy in cinema. Equally wonderful is the character of Joyce Grenfell - Ruby Gates. <br /> <br /> This is a film that you should curl up on the couch with a wet Sunday afternoon and be transported to a long time ago only when terrifying, wild school girls earned our respect - not our wrath! Did I hear that a remake is staged with Rupert Everett as Miss Fritton? Will he have hard work competing with the master - or should he be a lover? - Alistair Simms. <br /> <br /> Go and rent it - it beats so much of what goes for comedy today.
