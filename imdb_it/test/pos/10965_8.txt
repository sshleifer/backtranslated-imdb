1st seen 8/26/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-John Cassavetes): Cassavetes' first independent film presented a style very different from what Hollywood shows to the public. This film also introduced some very taboo subjects, in particular the true racism that was probably widespread throughout the country, but was not shown by the mostly white filmmakers of the time. About the only black actors who had a lot of respect in this period were the ones who played and showed personalities like whites (aka Sidney Poitier). In addition to this, the idea of ​​finishing a film without really concluding the relationships that have started leaves many viewers stunned but in reality it makes spectators understand that life is like this (more ...). I prefer this kind of ending because it makes you think more about the characters and what might happen next and the conclusions are not only illustrated for you. The film follows people's lives (especially a couple of people who have a brief relationship and happens to be facing skin colors), so let's look at what happens when the white man realizes what he did. This is done very well and makes the film very special. The acting is supposedly performed suddenly, which makes the film even more surprising. I guess you can say that I liked this movie, if you can't tell. If you can find it, watch this classic independent film in the beginning.
