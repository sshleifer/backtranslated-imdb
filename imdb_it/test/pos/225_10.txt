I saw this series after watching the Naked Gun movies. I found it much better than the movies and I thought the movies were fantastic! This series literally takes you to the TV waiting for the next pun, gag sight, or funny situation (the night club, the flamingo of the club). I don't think I've ever laughed so much in a TV series in my life, even after seeing the movies first and then meeting some lines. I think it is a pity that only six episodes were produced, but I agree that writers would be very hard at maintaining this level of comedy for other episodes. Overall, the series is a must see for those who love word games, jokes and gags.
