Family Guy must be my favorite cartoon of all time. It's definitely the funniest TV show ever made and it's better than The Simpsons. I've never laughed so much on a TV show in my life. The things that make the show so funny are the plot, characters and themes covered by the show. There are very few topics that have not been treated on Family Guy. <br /> <br /> I've seen almost every episode of Family Guy ever made and I have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons. My favorite characters are Peter because he is very funny and he is the best character on the show. My second favorite character is Stewie because he's the funniest villain on TV show. If you love Family Guiy you should take a look at American Dad because it's so similar and created by Seth McFarlane. I hope this show never ends because it's a comic genius! 10/10
