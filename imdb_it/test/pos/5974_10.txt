The Ascent (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Shepitko is a name few know. His brilliant career as a director lasted only a decade, ended abruptly by a tragic car accident. Despite her short career, she still managed to create some of the best Soviet films of her time. His latest film, The Ascent, is considered one of the best Soviet films of the 1970s. However, his work remained in the dark in the years that followed, usually available only on rare and poor copies on video. Now it's changed thanks to the people of Criterion. They have published two of Shepitko's best works through their Eclipse - Wings department, and his penultimate masterpiece The Ascent. <br /> <br /> Set during the darkest days of World War II in snowy rural Russia, two partisans cross the land in search of food after their party has been attacked by Nazi patrols. Originally I'm just going to a nearby farm, but when they arrive they find it razed by the Germans. Not wanting to return empty-handed, they continue to penetrate deeper into enemy territory. Along the way they face not only enemy soldiers, but the harsh conditions of the Russian plains, the potential betrayal and their souls. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into simplistic devices or destinations. Face difficult questions with painful rationality. He never takes the easy way or gives us comforting answers. The second part of the film is full of moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the horrible horrors of war through the internal conflict between the Russian comrades - those who collaborated and those who fought. While showing collaborators as light heels, it also shows why many have turned to such tactics - survival. <br /> <br /> The film contains a series of religious references, in particular for the approach to the crucifixion. This is a spiritual journey, in the hearts, souls and minds of the two partisans and those they meet. Shepitko and his director of photography capture the journey in a beautiful black and white photograph. The camera moves with long strokes, similar to that of another Russian director, Andrei Tarkovsky. Shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by Tarkovsky's style, and the Ascent takes some of his rhythmic notes from Ivan's Childhood. It's a great movie to watch, and it does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied Russia. Shepitko's husband would pay tribute to his great film a decade later. Elem Klimov made his masterpiece of war with one of the greatest movies I've ever seen - Come and see. The story and themes of that film were clearly influenced by The Ascent. Although that film is also rather obscure, it received much more attention from Shepitko's films. Which in any case served as a bridge for Shepitko, and was one of the best aids to keep his work alive. <br /> <br /> The Ascent is a truly magnificent film, and should rightly be considered one of the best films of the 1970s. His extraordinary cinematography is stimulating; his mood is frighteningly authentic; and his lessons are unforgettable. It is, in any definition of the word, nothing less than a masterpiece. How unfortunate it was that Shepitko's career was interrupted just as she was reaching her peak.
