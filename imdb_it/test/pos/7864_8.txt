Combining the conventions of Western and Gothic horror, and often directed as if it were an art film, this is one of the best collaborations of Siegel and Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the civil war, takes refuge in an isolated southern seminar for young women. Disappeared from the world, women project their romantic fantasies onto him, and he responds with callous masculine manipulation. But jealousy and resentment raise their heads and find themselves in a world of brutal revenge. And the boy is brutal revenge. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed by Bruce Surtees, and carefully traced, "The Beguiled" is a haunting and elegant work that seems to have influenced the troubled sexuality of "Play Misty" by Eastwood Io "and" Tightrope ". <br /> <br /> The film is a compelling representation of a fierce battle of the sexes and exudes an dreamlike mix of horror and sexuality.All the characters are ambiguous, showing traits of both good and evil, leaving us the task to choose whom we should support. <br /> <br /> Don Siegel has left behind a legacy of good films, everything from "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" to "Dirty Harry", but even if his first images in black and white have aged well, most of his color films seem grainy, dated and badly shot, his rough "realism" must have seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but seen today, I don't think they passed the test of the time. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled", however, is in one different alloy. Mature, ambiguous and merciless, it is a pity that it is no longer known. While technology and evolving technique have made most of Siegel's violent and masculine action thrillers obsolete, "The Beguiled" still attracts audiences today because of its surreal atmosphere and unique topics. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10 - Better than the "Black Narcissus" with a similar theme, this is, in my opinion, Siegel's best film. The horror part, partly dramatic, partly the sexual odyssey, "The Beguiled" is a surprisingly arty film (especially considering that Siegel considered his films to be, cite, "meaningless"). Much of the film's artistic ability is due to Clint Eastwood, who from this point on will strive to choose the mature material.
