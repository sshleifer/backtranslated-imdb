My film with a score of 8 is related to other feature films of the 1930s. By the standards of films made a few years later, this film could receive a score of only 6 or 7, mainly because the sound quality was so poor. Now it is possible that the film sounded better and that the Fox Movie Channel showed a degraded print (it had many lines and scratches), but I assume that the sound problem has always been a problem. This is because the sound in the movies was still a novelty in the 1930s and many of the 1930's Hollywood images seemed terrible - with background characters that often drowned the cables, crowded characters to make sure they were caught by microphones or by inconsistent quality has been seen in THE BISHOP MURDER CASE, HELL'S ANGELS and other films of the day). All this went much worse in THE BIG TRAIL because most of the film was shot outside - something unheard of at the time. Quite an innovation but also something that has really stretched the talents of sound engineers! So, while the film was very difficult to hear, I realized that they had to start somewhere, so I can forgive it - especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking - a great innovation for 1930. <br /> <br / > The plot is quite similar to CIMARRON - a western released the following year and that captured the Oscar for best film. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not an exceptional film and I actually like THE BIG TRAIL more for the purpose of the film. While some might jump to the slow pace of THE BIG TRAIL, I saw it as a great history lesson on the difficulties faced by those traveling in the west on carriages. Furthermore, everything looked so good, as the director Raoul Walsh had serious difficulties in filming externally and THE BIG TRAIL seems almost like a film version of some Ansel Adams prints. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it was pretty good. This was a great occasion for young John Wayne - as his previous screen appearances were, at best, minor and insignificant. Here, he was given the command and did a dandy job - even though he was obviously young and a little less "John Wayne-ish" than he was in later films, since his on-screen character was not yet consolidated. Another interesting part was played by Tyrone Power II (Tyrone Power's father). He looked nothing like his beautiful son, he looked and looked almost exactly like Bluto Popeye cartoons! He made very few sound films - dying only a year after making this film - so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth seeing the movie, despite some sound problems and some scenes too long here and there. By 1930, it was a remarkable achievement - more than the most famous and award-winning CIMARRON made the following year. Much of the reason why THE BIG TRAIL didn't win an Oscar was probably the fact that ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT came out the same year and is truly one of the great movies.
