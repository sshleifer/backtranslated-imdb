Well, this is new ... The famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci makes a film about a famous Italian horror director called ... Lucio Fulci. After years and years of gruesome horror sequences, it becomes difficult for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and often alludes to committing violent murders. It quickly descends into a seemingly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable poison. Even the dedicated psychiatrist does not seem to keep Fulci on the right track ... Now, when it comes to pure entertainment and entertainment value, Cat in the Brain is certainly one of Fulci's most enjoyable films. The blood is oppressive and plentiful, to say the least. The amount of dirty massacres is impossible to describe, especially when you can get your hands on the completely integral version (referred to with the well-known: "Concerto Nightmare"). Decapitations all around, victims' intestines are scattered on all sides of the screen and chainsaws are working overtime! The film also becomes involuntarily funny early enough (since it's so exaggerated) and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there's beer in the fridge. Of course, from a more professional point of view, this production cannot be called exactly a masterpiece! There is not the least tension or atmosphere to be detected and the characters are completely emptied. To give more space to the blood, the characters are introduced for 5 seconds and then die in a horrible death. Especially when compared to Fulci's highlights - such as "The Beyond" or "Do not Torture a Duckling" - this film looks like a quick heated snack. The best way to play "Cat in the Brain" is like a personal statement made by Fulci and a direct attack on censorship. Maybe after seeing so many of his films ?? especially the last ones ?? having been cut by the censorship committees and struck by pseudo-artistic critics, he wanted revenge by delivering a bloody mess that simply can't be cut! If you take away all the explicit violence and the effects of really sick makeup, you only have about 10 minutes of footage left! Especially since the crazy killings recur later in the film when Fulci hallucinates them again. You can almost hear our director think of things like, "Let's see how you'll censor him now!" The entire development of the murder investigation also takes place in the background. Are the victims missing any of their friends or relatives? Are there cops looking for clues that will lead them to the murderer? You don't know it and Lucio doesn't bother to inform you about it, because this would lead to sequences that don't require cutting. Oh, and it's damn pretentious too! The name "Mr. Fulci" or even "Lucio" is mentioned every 3 minutes (34 times during the entire movie, to be exact) and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlight for a change. Hey, I certainly don't blame him ... After over 30 years of making funny movies; deserved a little more fun. You are a god, Mr. Fulci!
