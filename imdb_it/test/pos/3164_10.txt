Completely to try. I saw it at MLK's birthday in 2006 and it hit me big. Sometimes it seems that we are all trapped and we are doomed to repeat the past, no matter how we try to change. All we can do is go ahead and talk. Keep going. I don't want to be a downer because that's not the point, but maybe we have to go down before we see how much we have to work on ourselves. What happens when we continue to be told by the best people like MLK what needs to happen to get us out of our "dead end" but we don't listen. I know some of us listen, but how do we see the rest of the world as they really are? Keep going, I guess. This film made me think even more of it, so I guess he did what he intended to do. This is what I consider a good movie, a game, a book, a poem, a speech or something like that: something that makes you think and set in motion to move in an active direction instead of being stuck, bored and hopeless.
