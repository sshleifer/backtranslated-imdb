This film shocked me. It was so realistic and the story was incredible touching. They speak German and Russian, which makes it more credible and real. This is a must-see movie. Even the actors are fantastic. Really a nice piece of work. The plot takes place within a German troop in World War II. They must go to Stalingrad, Sovjet, to fight against Sovjetian armies. Become more connected with every soldier in this group and follow all the dangers as they are captured in Stalingrad. They receive face-to-face encounters with the death, blood, pain and coldness of Russia. This is a must-see movie and you can't afford not to see it.
