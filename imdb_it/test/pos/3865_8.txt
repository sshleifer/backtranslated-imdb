No. I'm not kidding with this. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this film a positive score. And who can blame him? This is a fascinating, optimistic and rather amusing Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music of Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later, when Cats Do not Dance was released, I saw a musically amusing film. What the Aristogats lack in animation and in history, makes up for in charm. Moreover, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain is not so scary. It is perfect for the younger set while not being so corny that adults may not like it. If Snoop were here, I'm sure he would say the same thing. Yeah. Dig those CRAZY cats, man.
