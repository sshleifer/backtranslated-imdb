I saw Conrack on a night when I couldn't sleep and I was never so happy to have insomnia! This story of a young white teacher taking a position teaching poor black children on an island in Carolina's is a great advertisement to teach and simply to help each other. Set in the early 1960s, with the problems of civil rights, Viet Nam and everything that came with the 1960s, he forgot that the Peace Corps and many young people did something to help the indigent. With his open teaching style he is interested in these guys as people, and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the power that he is. Most was that Jon Voight said he had a 20-year meeting and 18 of those guys became teachers !! It is enough to make you think that we humans can have the chance to survive, perhaps, hopefully. See this movie.
