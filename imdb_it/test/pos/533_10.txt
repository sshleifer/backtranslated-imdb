Adam Sandler's films are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror film. Matrix is ​​my favorite science fiction film. Anywhere But here's my favorite drama. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the single most valuable asset of this film is acting. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon is absolutely incredible. At the end of this film I felt like I knew his character better than I knew myself. He did a simply fantastic job. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently rented his first film, Leon (1994), in which he plays a 12-year-old girl. I believe you are a contradiction in terms; she was a good actress. Well, five years later she is still a good actress. In fact, it's much better. <br /> <br /> Sarandon and Portman not only performed their characters well, but they also worked perfectly together. I mean, even now I can't believe that I'm not really mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is about a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) leaving their hometown in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> At first Portman hates his mother to take her away from her cousin and her friends, and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over a couple of years (usually below, I could add). <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is a bit vague, the plot can only be roughly summarized. But when you see this movie you will see that the plot is not really so vague or weak, because in reality it is very deep. What I'm saying is that the plot is sketched weakly, but then they focus on it to make it strong. <br /> <br /> And it's very strong, but even the sequencing of the plot is fantastic. And there are some brilliant scenes that I hope can be seen as "classic". <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And although, of course, there are some gaps, it is still a stellar film and in the end it really unites.
