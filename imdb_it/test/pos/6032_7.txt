Being a drug addict with the self-confessed slogan means that it is very rare that I have the opportunity to review many films with higher budgets with accreditable casts. In addition to the successful box office success of James Mangold, Identity; There have been no big name voices since the Scream trilogy once again referred to as Wes Craven on the Hollywood map. That's why Mark Malone's last stop ?? a thriller thriller with flashy slasher tones, intrigued me instantly. With a decent lineup that includes Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that also finds space for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden, I must admit that the first signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature. As far as I know, there have always been only three other snow cutters, unless you consider Demon Possessed to fall into the category. The first slice and dice on the ice was the bone-dried Satan's Blade, then came the Lisa Loring cheese festival which was Blizzard of Blood and the funny Shredder followed about fourteen years later. <br /> <br /> During an extreme snowstorm, state soldier Jason (Adam Beach) fights against the snow to reach a remote cottage in the Colorado mountains. His job is to inform guests that the road is closed and they must stay for at least another night until a route can be eliminated through dangerous conditions. This news does not go very well with the suspect group, which includes two nervous brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver who doesn't really want to hang around (William S. Taylor), a rude pair of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason's ex-girlfriend, Nancy (Rose McGowan). Even motel owners (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are not enthusiastic about the news, but offer rooms to blocked guests and try to calm the tense situation. Things get worse when Jason finds a mutilated body and a bag full of stolen money lying in the snow behind the coffee. Just like a chapter of Agatha Christie's mystery, boarders begin to die at the hands of a masked assailant who seems willing to claim the money. With so many shady characters to choose from and no way to leave the crime scene, does Jason have to try to stop the maniac before he kills again? <br /> <br /> A good mystery requires at least a handful of shadowy suspicions that each have a credible reason, a remote position from which no one can escape and an intelligent protagonist to help unravel the clues. Fortunately, The Last Stop provides each of those essential ingredients in a thriller that has its own moments of brilliance and real stupidity. The film kicks off superbly while questionable personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that manages to keep the tension high during runtime. Malone keeps the interest levels raised while each character reveals their reasons for attracting some of the suspects, and to be honest, the essential turning point is not the one that you will easily guess. In fact, I found myself watching the movie one more time to see if I could catch any suggestions that had escaped me for the first time. Unfortunately, when the maniac turns out to be a psychopath above the minds that wise as a bad comic guy, The Last Stop loses a great deal of credibility. Fortunately, all is not lost when an unexpected and brilliantly orchestrated twist saves the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The similarities can be drawn with the excellent identity, as the two weaves are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's effort must be the best of the two mainly due to John Cusack's billing star and the ever-reliable Ray Liotta. With that said, however, Adam Beach does a good job in the lead, while Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and the brilliant Callum Keith Rennie add credible support. Rose McGowan behaves as presumptuously in this role, as she probably does from day to day in reality, and Winston Rekert started off fantastically before going completely out of the climax of the film. If you are a huge fan who is watching him for some bloody killings, then you will be disappointed. The psychopath wearing the balaclava opens only once and the rest of the murders are committed off-screen. But as I said before, Malone's directorial talent means that the suspense is never too far away and you can forgive the few flaws because the positives are just for the triumph. <br /> <br /> The Last Stop is worth a look at slasher fans and movie buffs. Yes, there are a handful of negatives, but overall this is a solid example of emerging Hollywood talent. If you liked Identity then definitely try it ??
