I had the PRIVILEGE to attend the UK premiere of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers I had high hopes but I had doubts due to a series of self-indulgent films (let's go honest, self-indulgence is his middle name). I was surprised to find that he had taken the cat out of the bag with this. The film is full of interesting dialogues, a perfect-time comedy with a hint of brutal murder. <br /> <br /> The crowning glory of this film, however, lies with Christoph Waltz, who has found no errors or errors. He manages to create a real tension in the public while remaining rather "theatrical" (he couldn't think of a better word). He certainly deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading to the Oscar without a doubt !!!! Hoping to see him again soon in something!
