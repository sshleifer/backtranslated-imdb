I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were fantastic, particularly Powerful, which is different in every role; FÃ¼rmann, who is also able to interpret anyone; and Loos, which enriches things (he is also a talented singer - sings the song "My Truth", heard when a character does the stereo in the laboratory). <br /> <br /> Anatomie is a good horror flick, which pays attention to its characters. Sometimes it is also very bloody and the scenery is innovative. Too bad they had to make a sequel, which is not close to the original at all. <br /> <br /> From a side note, two other things definitely worth mentioning. The DVD is not dubbed, which makes it the best movie experience. Also, make sure you keep watching after the final credits start running.
