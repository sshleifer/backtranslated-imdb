This was a great series for blacks at the time. We liked it so much. It was the only show about middle-class black families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many ... many people who still talk about the show. If he has been released, I am sure that many young blacks will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalries, single parents, peer pressure and much more. The show ended so abruptly and left the fans speechless and wondered why the air had been removed. Since then we have seen only a few actors and actresses. Please release it on DVD as soon as possible.
