Although defective in his view of homosexuals, this film will shed light on the viewer about the myths and inaccuracies regarding AIDS. Despite the depressing themes, this film describes a warm friendship between two boys and will make you laugh and cry. Very well performed by everyone, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is a bit strong, though appropriate, and is a fun and intelligent film for the whole family. But remember to have the Kleenex ready!
