Kar Wai Wong's incredibly impressive romanticism is perfect for me. Set in the Hong Kong of the 1960s. As shown, this is set in a turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman who meet in an apartment in Hong Kong, in which they both move. Chow Mo-wan works for a newspaper company. Su Li-zhen Chan is a secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan create a special bond after both have discovered their spouses, are constantly making extra-marital encounters. One with the other. <br /> <br /> The characters of Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are amazing to say the least. Both Leung and Cheung succeed in obtaining such an extraordinary chemistry between them, it is better than any Hollywood novel that is published today. Combined. The film focuses on the two protagonists and their feelings after the infidelity of their partners. Kar Wai Wong manages to create such a strong character development between these two characters, you really start to try for them. Leung and Cheung are both incredibly fantastic, they are better than any Hollywood match shown on the screen today. Combined. <br /> <br /> There is nothing much else to describe Fa yeung nin wa as well as a romantic and energetic novel that also presents an atmospheric and atmospheric piece with a splendid cinematography. Many elements of this film help to create it impeccably. In addition to Kar Wai Wong and acting, the cinematography of Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee is disturbing. Beautifully undervalued. Kar Wai Wong's shots help your mind create a world of its own. A world that creates these characters. Original, melancholic and nostalgic. This film is incredibly unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The costumes created by William W Chang regular by Kar Wai Wong are absolutely beautiful. Cheung, wearing an elegant dress with a deep ankle and beautifully decorated in every scene. She is a scene thief. His costumes tell a lot about his character and an emotion adapts to all the colors of his clothes that are used in a vivid and intelligent way. Highly original. Chang, the set designer also creates a brilliant set for the moody piece film. Especially with the help of the wonderful music used in the scenes and the editing of a masterful film, also by Chang. William Chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an unsung hero for this film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is one of the best of this millennium. Incredibly compelling and full of nostalgia. The shots are fascinating and disturbing. Kar Wai Wong somehow proves to be a master at the top of his game. The acting; music; cinematography; editing; production; costume and direction all help to create A small, perfect little movie. A masterpiece in the love film. Visually spectacular. Overall, a masterpiece for the cinema. A film that reminds me of old classic Hollywood was what it never was. Never forget Fa yeung nin wa. I know I won't.
