It was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch. The economy with which it was modified and the structure of the film itself are the main elements that contribute to this. <br /> <br /> The film really captures the spirit of the revolution with which it has to do - you are truly sympathetic to sailors and citizens. Obviously, this film has its own program, but since it is a virtually redundant cause, it can be seen as a piece of entertainment in a much clearer sense. <br /> <br /> The tension created on the screen is excellent - starting with the battleship itself, and then moving to the mainland. Things grow credibly and for a film of his era, it is really adamant in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> It is really worth sitting, (that is, if you can adjust your modern viewing habits for 90 minutes).
