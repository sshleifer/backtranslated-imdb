In Victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and is sent to live in the country. The children adapt to their new situation, make friends and use the help of an old gentleman who greets on the train to help bring their family together. <br /> <br /> Actors who direct films are often not very good at it. Jeffries however, the great veteran actor of dozens of British comedy classics, is one of the few exceptions. His ingenious conception (he also wrote the screenplay, taken from the novel by E. Nesbit) of a classic British children's story is what elevates this film to art. While the story can be highly idealized, the wonderful performances and fabulously suggestive settings of the Yorkshire Dales come together to make a film truly memorable. Arthur Ibbetson's photography is the definition of a good cinematographic production: a shot is not wasted in telling the story, but at the same time the images combine to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere. Agutter is just as perfect as good-hearted Bobbie (ok, I fell in love with her at an early age, but I challenge anyone to disagree) and Cribbins, whose comedy acting pedigree is like Jeffries, is as unforgettable as Perks the humble but proud rail goalkeeper. This is a timeless film; romantic, charming, extremely pleasant and with a wonderfully naive sense of kindness to all.
