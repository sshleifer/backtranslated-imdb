Very pleasant 50s. I have it in my collection and I recommend it to Western fans. <br /> <br /> Mostly Victor's film is very well done in my opinion. <br /> <br /> It is a trapper who joins a frontier post like a scout. Red Cloud has captured three of them on their land and taken their possessions. Everyone joined as explorers after their loss. <br /> <br /> Victor has his eye on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the premises without much regard to regulations. <br /> <br /> Action made in a fairly convincing way but no great depth or feeling for the other characters. <br /> <br /> The 50s are my favorites and this easily slips towards satisfaction. A Western of this type is in the pages of the past and perhaps it will never be done again. One to have fun. He gave a rating of 7. Probably 6.8 worthy, but films like these become more valuable over time. <br /> <br /> For fans of film noir ... "The Big Steal" "They Live By Night" "Side Street" are wonderful films to be enjoyed. Bought and displayed. The Noir seems somehow similar to Westerners. Some time ago and never forever.
