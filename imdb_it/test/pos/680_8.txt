I see that the ratings for this film are not that high for this film, so I have to be in the minority for appreciating this movie so much. Well, I'm right and everyone else is wrong (I'm kidding). I think I like it because I'm a psychology teacher and I really liked the brooding character Ryan played. While it's really dangerous and VERY threatening, you can't hate him exactly because he's clearly mentally ill and probably suffers from some sort of brain trauma. And Wow really did a great job portraying this man! You really find yourself trying Ida Lupino while destroying his life. So, with such intense acting and threatening, why is the film rated relatively low? Well, probably because it's not exactly credible, ... but the guy is fun and creative. Give it a try and don't believe the score of 6.4 - it's much better than that!
