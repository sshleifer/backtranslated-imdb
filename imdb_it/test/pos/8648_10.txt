10/10 <br /> <br /> PLOT DISCUSSION <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films ever made and I'm not saying this because I am deceived by the seemingly absurd presentation. Those who do not like the film because they do not understand the story often criticize those who praise the film by saying that they are taking its genius because they do not understand it. I don't see this film as very allegorical. For me, it's a story with a beginning, middle and end. People become confused by the film because they expect it to have a profound philosophical meaning that they must interpret from scenes that are supposedly meaningless. I feel that they fail to realize that the enigmatic derives from a fragmented and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. Due to the limitation of the length, I will try to keep this brief and to the point and touch the main concepts. <br /> <br /> The general plot: Diane moves to L.A. after the jitterbug contest to get into acting. At an audition, he meets Camilla with whom he falls in love. Diane has been furious with jealousy since Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) during a film shoot and discovers the other woman (a casual blonde) at the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Motivated by his anger and possessiveness, Diane hires a hit man to kill Camilla. After doing so, she is overcome by loneliness and slips into a world of unconscious fantasy where she lives the life she desires. Diane is then woken up. In her conscious state she is obsessed with what she has done. <br /> <br /> The meaning of fantasy: the film begins, after the end credits, with a first person p.o.v. shooting depicting someone collapsing on a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. This is where the fantasy of Diane begins. The incident is there as an excuse for her to "bring back" her dead girlfriend and justify her fantastic life. He paints his girlfriend as mild and innocent because he is what he wants to be. Meanwhile, he acts as if everything were "like in the movies" because he has an escapist personality. Also, in a sense, he kills himself and assumes the identity of a waitress named Betty in a restaurant. The story that revolves around the director is a direct result of his feeling that he was in some way victimized in reality just as he was and "convinces" that he was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control he felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in fantasy is actually the casual blond of the engagement party. He hated her so much that he turned her into Camilla and became the ultimate antagonist. Then he took the real Camilla and turned it into a perfect and submissive girlfriend and used Rita Hayworth as a source of inspiration. He also paints the assassin as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify Camilla's survival. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diane that ended up being herself and made the world of dreams die, bringing it through a series of memories of reality. The first reminder was the Club Silencio that sang "no band" and the "tools" you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor of fantasy. He begins to tremble violently because he shakes his perception of his surroundings. The other reminder is the blue box ... Actually, the blue box is not the same reminder (more than a Pandora's box, actually), but the blue button that opens the box. The blue key reminds her of Camilla's real death because that's what the gunman said he would show up when it was done. Along with love, his entire creation is an escape from reality by living in the idealized Hollywood he expected to be a part of when he arrived. <br /> <br /> This is a story that shows the psychology of a very tormented woman who has lost a dream. It is not a series of random things specifically designed to disturb and is not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate slice of the human condition that is beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, this is just my opinion. I could be far away. Or it cannot be intended to mean anything. There are many who disagree with me. Great! After all, why does it have to mean something? Why can't it just be a statement in itself? And if the coherent and sensible narratives were chains for artistic expression? Peter Greenaway, for example, has spent many words eloquently supporting that idea with statements such as "I would say that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don't be a director, because I think the film is much more exciting in areas that have nothing to do primarily with fiction ". And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the film is not related to his art. "I did not get it!" So...? "Mulholland Dr.", history or not, strikes viewers, torments them, drags them, buggers them, cradles them. The way it lends itself to interpretation is surprising. Never gets old. He never loses his shine. His images are always effective and beautiful. It's cinematic perfection, no matter what. To enjoy.
