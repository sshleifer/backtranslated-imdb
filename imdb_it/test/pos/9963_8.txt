Venice, in 1596. The Jews are separated from the good Christians. Bassanio, a young but poor Venetian, loves the beautiful Portia, which is a rich heiress. He approaches his friend, a merchant named Antonio for three thousand ducats to go to Belmont and Propose Portia. All of Antonio's ships and merchandise are occupied at sea, so he turns to Shylock, the Jewish faith. Thylock doesn't like Antonio, because he spit in his face. He offers Antonio a three-month loan at no interest, but if he does not pay the money at that time, he will own a kilo of meat. Furthermore, Shylock's daughter, Jessica, escapes with the Christian Lorenzo. The merchant of Venice is based on the work of William Shakespeare who is believed to have written between 1596 and 1598. I read the play last summer and now I saw the film, made in 2004 by Michael Radford. I liked the play, and I don't entirely agree with the accusations of being anti-Semitic. The Jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster, nor is th ready to cut off a piece of Antonio's meat. There is a lot of depth in his character, which emerges in his speech in which he asks "If we sting, don't we bleed?" And so on. There is much more human in the character of Shylock than in that of Antonio, who spits the good Jew. Al Pacino is unbeatable as Shylock. It offers such a strong performance. Jeremy Irons is also fantastic as Antonio.Lynn Collins is the most beautiful and brilliant in the role of Portia. Zuleikha Robinson does a great job as Jessica, and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good. Kris Marshall plays Gratiano, and does a good job .In the role of Nerissa we see Heather Goldenhersh. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Hunchback. As in Shakespeare's plays usually, this also contains the most brilliant dialogue. The film paints a fantastic portrait of the era. These are some great questions, in a Shakespearean way.
