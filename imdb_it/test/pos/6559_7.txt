<br /> <br /> Time of the horror film, Japanese style. Uzumaki / Spiral was a total maniac from beginning to end. A funny freakfest, but sometimes he was a little too dependent on kitsch rather than horror. The story is difficult to summarize briefly: a carefree and normal teenage girl begins to deal with extremely disturbing events because the small city she lives in seems to be under the control of spirals. Spirals are everywhere, in the air, in clouds, in dirt and in everyday objects. Spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them. Oh, another thing, people turn to snails at random. Why? Who knows or cares, people are turning into snails, that's enough for me. This was not so scary as it was disturbing because it doesn't have a lot of suspense or strident attacks like horror movies often do. Uzumaki prefers to crawl and crawl (like a snail could!) Rather than shake. A favorite scene: a woman lies asleep in a hospital room when this long, thousand-legged and long-legged creature enters the room and slowly climbs onto the bed, through the sheets, over the pillow and into her sleeping ear. I made my toes shudder and curl. Uzumaki has a handful of really violent scenes that are also fun. For example, a man is obsessed with spirals, enters his washing machine because he sees a spiral in it when he turns, he commits suicide in a spiral inside the washing machine. The last shot we see of him is his body all rolled up and rubbery, a spiral of human flesh with a single swollen eye that flashes in the middle of the washing machine. A bizarre image. Uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic inclination that increases its charm and fun. I love horror movies like this. It's not about killing, about a slasher movie, it's a force of evil (the spirals!) That takes you and tries to kill you, forces you to kill others. Movies like Uzumaki show that there are many ways to make a horror film and thank God for it
