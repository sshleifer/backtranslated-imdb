This film has broken a lot of ground and receives on the whole a lot less credit than it is due. It touches on a topic that is always present in our daily life, but which is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not merit discussion. This phenomenon is that of caregivers (whether they are doctors or, as in "Broken Promise", a senior social worker) who abuse their position to harm those who have been accused of protecting. <br /> <br /> In Broken Promete, Patty Clawson and her family are abandoned by their parents; but they are soon picked up by local law enforcement. Faced with the certain prospect of custody, Patty asks a young social worker to hold her and her brothers and sisters together. This social worker approaches a senior member of another department, but his request is denied. <br /> <br /> Children are divided into separate houses, thus following the prevailing opinions of the day and ensuring a "clean break". But it is this event, the "broken promise" that gives the film its name, which causes the dramatic tension that must continue throughout the film. Annoyed by the apparent betrayal of the young social worker, Patty Clawson escapes from the house where she was sent. <br /> <br /> Faced with the arduous task of finding his family in a climate in which we see the ideal a complete separation from the past; she does the only thing she can to find out where they are and breaks into the Senior Social Worker's office to steal the file. <br /> <br /> Close immediately after discovering that you have made a dangerous enemy. Furious at the embarrassment this little girl has caused him and his department, the Senior Social Worker decides to use his power and authority to destroy it; something he can legally do. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This argument, of the caregivers' harm to customers, is relatively taboo. Certainly very little has been touched on in the films, given that few directors wish to take the road that would imply that those who take care of them will hurt. <br /> <br /> I think this film has a very important role in making the public more aware of this kind of thing. The portrait case is not only plausible, but it has probably already happened many other times to many other children in all the world. This film is essential to change public opinion in order to get rid of the laws that protect harmful people like the Senior Social Worker in "Broken Promise". <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend Broken Promise. It is particularly appropriate for social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and other careers. It is an avoidance lesson that should be taken to heart. <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> In terms of acting in "Broken Promise." Melissa Michaelsen plays an excellent part as Patty Clawson. Especially in films like this credibility is fundamental. If the viewer did not identify with the character of Patty, the entire message of the film would be in danger. It is a pity that Melissa does not play again in today's films, as her performance in "Broken Promise" shows her that she had an exceptional talent.
