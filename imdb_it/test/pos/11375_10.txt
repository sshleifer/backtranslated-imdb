This film is a masterpiece. It was exhilarating from beginning to end. The story of writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson on a porn star is told with style, grace, humor, even intensity. The actors and characters they play are all first rate, including Mark Wahlberg in the lead, who proves to be a solid actor and can bring a movie. Burt Reynolds gives his best performance ever as a porn director who discovers Wahlberg. The film recreates the late 1970s and early 1980s with impeccable accuracy, from the record scene that begins the film to Don Donald's "Wahlberg's" Don Johnson dress he wears in the final scene. Most regular viewers who will see this film will certainly compare it to PULP FICTION, but it has much more in common with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese. The film is a triumph in style. The initial pursuit shot that starts the film is as impressive as those of THE PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNER. The editing of Dylan Tichenor is simply phenomenal. I could not believe that the editing had not received an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL HUNTING was a more curated film?!). The best scene in the film must be the one with the firecrackers. I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. When I saw the film a second time, I had the exact same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, it may not have the same impact on TV as in a theater with good stereo sound. It is a pity that many people have not seen this film during its theatrical run, because it is the best way to watch it. The use of Widescreen by Anderson will suffer on TV (so take the DVD or a letterbox tape). It's amazing how easy it is Anderson makes it look like everything, because this is just his second film. Music, sets, costumes, photography, unusual characters, sex, violence, happiness and heartbreak are captured by a boy who is clearly in love with cinema.
