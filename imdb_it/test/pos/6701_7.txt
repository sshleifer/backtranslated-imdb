Ok, first let's remove this: like a piece of cinema, Lifeforce is rubbish. As a little fun for SF fans, it has a lot of merit. If you enjoy watching those old black and white SF B movies - mutant spiders / giant ants or alien monsters that roam the desert - you will really get rid of Lifeforce. <br /> <br /> Bad things: the story makes little sense and the acting is rather poor. Good things: the special effects are halfway decent; has a history centered on British hospitality (it's set in London) that gives a different touch to most science fiction films; and has the well-endowed Mathilda May (publicly amused as "Space Girl") who walks naked naked. <br /> <br /> In short: it's fun. <br /> <br /> I've seen it half a dozen times now, and every time it comes on TV I have time to watch it - of course this is partly due to Mrs. May May - but it's also about enjoying a bit of SF unpretentious and silly.
