There was a recent documentary on the making of films, which featured a long list of actors and directors who talked about what it meant to make films. A common theme is that you can have a fantastic script, a fantastic cast, the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Down Periscope is proof of the corollary of that theory. Not an original or terribly well written script. Some solid actors, but mostly unknown, and this movie makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to say that Kelsey Grammar made this film, but it is not quite so. Other actors, like Rob Schneider, and the hilarious Harland Williams, have significantly added to the enjoyment of the film. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the cast, or the mysterious "magic of the film" are really what happened here, creating a film that runs smoothly, has incredibly well executed transitions and one line after another of well written and well executed dialogues. <br /> <br /> An absurd premise, many and many technical inaccuracies and plan only stupid things that could not happen in the real world, or the real navy, but you don't care. As a merchant marine, I discovered that the overall impression of the film, though not plausible, was not too far removed from the mark with regards to life at sea. <br /> <br /> This is a VERY fun movie, a good family movie, and, especially if you're a fan, a lot of Kelsey Grammar wit, sarcasm and just damn fun.
