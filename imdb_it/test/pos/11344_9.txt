SPOILER ALERT !!! <br /> <br /> You can listen to Wong Kar-wai's films as a radio show: invisible vibrations between the characters, the rooms where they stop, the rhythm that presses them, attraction and aversion - the whole spectrum of atmosphere is reproduced from the soundtrack. Dialogue is mostly completely unimportant. <br /> <br /> The narration is similar to a childish loving look of a beautiful woman and a sad man whose pains are obvious but defenseless. "In The Mood For Love" is told from a childish perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. The aesthetic of the film is developed by an extreme drama of light and color, hard cuts, an independent, almost documentary camera and a complex and discreet sound. <br /> <br /> The brilliant use of Nat King Cole "Maybe, maybe Maybe", whose mysterious power grows more often is repeated and the melancholy waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two protagonists. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful clothes is brilliant, the perfect vis-Ã -vis with the beautiful and elegant Tony Leung. The public has a romantic relationship between them, but Wong sees only sad resignation. The two potential lovers turn to each other like satellites, knowing that they will never share the same orbit. You want them to find each other. They will not and the emotional power of their non-love-sexual relationship makes the film immensely fascinating. <br /> <br /> It is broken luck and unexpressed love. In all of Wong's films these are the leitmotifs. Love, if it comes too early or comes too late to take one or the other person. The desire of the characters who are never satisfied, their loneliness, the grief and the luck they feel when it is too late.
