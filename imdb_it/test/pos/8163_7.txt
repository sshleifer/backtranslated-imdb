LAST DAYS <br /> <br /> Proportions: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Brilliant difficulties when an LA party guy (Wes Ramsey) falls in love with a handsome Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). <br /> <br /> A great success in the festival circuit and in limited theatrical release, this nice film - the first feature by screenwriter C. Jay Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) - is an exercise in 'opposites that attract' , in which the superficial character of Ramsey has changed forever after he struggled for the vulnerable beauty of Sandvoss, which is bound by the dictates of his religious convictions. Here, the path of true love is paved with difficulties, not least the reaction of his Mormon colleagues to his rediscovered sexuality, which translates into his excommunication from the church and the anger of his indignant parents (Mary Kay Place has a small but devastating cameo like the outraged mother of the boy). But Cox's screenplay focuses primarily on the path to Ramsey's redemption, while his hedonist lifestyle is messed up by Sandvoss's influence and the responsibilities that emerge as a result of his growing maturity: he volunteers as a participant in awareness raising, delivering food to AIDS patients living at home, leading to an unexpected friendship with former party boy Erik Palladino ("TV er"), whose illness provides Ramsey with a much-needed appeal. <br /> <br /> Cox's screenplay is full of juicy one-liners and various pearls of wisdom (on Mormonism: "Your church doesn't like alcohol or homosexuals? Well, surely I'm not joining - I can't imagine heaven without both! "), and the characters are surprisingly complex and well designed. Ramsey has the most showy and sexiest role (he saw for the first time doing something rude to an available participant!), But it is Sandvoss that has become something of a gay icon, with his delicate interpretation of an innocent from the song dark whose journey from darkness to light leads to a surprising revelation of his place in the world around him. He and Ramsey are well matched, and their inevitable (short but memorable) sex scene is followed by a compelling sequence in which Ramsey describes a childhood trauma that has defined his life to date. <br /> <br /> Filmed on Ciao -def video and transferred to 35mm for the theater show, the film's meager budget places limits on the scope and magnitude of Cox's ambitions, although the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this small inconvenience. Jacqueline Bisset shines as a socialite restaurateur at the restaurant where Ramsey waits for tables to live, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("Third Rock from the Sun") steals everyone's lightning like the Sandvoss Mormon, as opposed to his friend's relationship with Ramsey on religious principle ... but ONLY on principle. Although a bit prickly in some places, the film suffers from a romantic desire, and deserves praise for its honesty and compassion. Better seen with a crowd of spectators who think like you, preferably with a loved one by your side.
