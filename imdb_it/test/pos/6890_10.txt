All I can say is that I really miss this show !! My wife and I just got married when this show started !! Why did CBS remove it from nothing ??? I think it was the best show for the whole family! He made me laugh!! It also made me cry. But when CBS took off, my wife and I thought CBS had made a big mistake. Do you know what would be so nice ?? Make a reunion show !! It would be so beautiful !!!! Does anyone know if it's already on DVD ?? In the last season of Promised Land, did CBS show last season ?? I think CBS took it out of the middle of the season. My wife and I will never forget it. The opening with that acronym was fantastic !!! This show comes only once in a lifetime! That we never forget the promised land !!
