Wow! Where to start? <br /> <br /> This adaptation of the third Sarah Waters novel is one of my favorite movies of all time !!!!! <br /> <br /> I'm not too fanatical about fiction novels (seriously I never read fiction), but the book is just as FABULOUS as the movie! Or should I say that the film is just as FABULOUS as the book ?! I JUST LOVE THIS STORY !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm watching this three-hour movie (2-part DVD series, 3 TV / book series) for about a year and a half. It just didn't seem so interesting ... BOY WAS SO WRONG! <br /> <br /> I was immediately immersed in the rich and suspenseful plot ... completely fascinated! Just like the book, you can't stop looking / reading. Grab your attention for all 3 hours ... and when it ends ... you wish it wasn't. <br /> <br /> The story flows so beautifully and you're wondering where the time is going. <br /> <br /> The lesbian subplot was just the icing on the cake! The parts I love most are the subtle facial expressions and the looks / the visual contact between the two characters. I really feel their desire for one another, yet they can't act on it ... until they have to. <br /> <br /> I would like to emphasize that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the film, obviously, at the center of the film there is a real unexpected love story, but it is certainly not what the the whole film is about Per me, this is what makes this story so unique and intriguing. I've never read or heard anything like this. Sarah Waters is pure genius! <br /> <br /> The twists that takes you leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. Seriously! My hands were tight on my couch with every surprising twist and I even screamed several times ("OH MY GOD! NO WAY! YOU'VE NOT JUST HAPPENED! DID IT?") ... I NEVER DO IT! <Br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this film is that I wish I had added more from the book. But obviously having limited adaptation over time they couldn't add everything I wanted. How terrible ... I think I'm simply brutally selfish now ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes seem a bit hasty. However, they put all the important pieces where even if you only watch the movie and choose not to read the book, you will be more satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> Actors are simply SUPERB! BRILLIANT too! Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Maud) have a great on-screen chemistry that your TV transmits. Simply electric! Emotions ... despair ... the struggle that each of them feels is apparently effortlessly expressed by these wonderfully talented actresses. Rupert Evans plays a bad guy like Gentleman. I found myself seething every time it appeared on the screen, but loving it because it is so damn cute and somehow still fascinating even if you want to twist its neck. Imelda Staunton offers another fantastic performance like Mrs. Sucksby. She is such an affectionate actress that you can't help but love her ... even when the character she plays is not so delicious. All the other cast members were perfect! They represented the characters really well and were just as I imagined them after reading the book. <br /> <br /> This is a must for every movie fan! Actually, ANYONE and EVERYONE should see this movie and read the book! You probably won't be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars from me! There are only four other films that I gave the same score. It is very rare that I can really enjoy a movie so much that I give it a 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingersmith is truly a masterpiece!
