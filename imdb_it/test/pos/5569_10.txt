Watching this series will probably make you feel like our parents felt like watching Star Trek for the first time. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. The kind of stories that make you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that make you want to get on TV to join the action, and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair cradled in admiration and endless admiration. <br /> <br /> In short, let's start with John Chrichton, an astronaut, who is shot in a wormhole and ends up with a band of prisoners fleeing from the bad guys in black, ironically known as Peacekeepers. <br /> <br /> Other colorful characters are made of D'argo, a great guy with a quick temper and a sword / laser rifle. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeper and PhD in buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan, which is a plant. No really, she is. He is also a priest, but with a bad streak. There is also Dominar Rygel XVI, a fat and lazy bastard who flows helium and generally hurts more than good. <br /> <br /> Later in the series we meet the sexiest stranger who has ever been on television, Chiana. A young and apparently chronically excited Nebari. It is played by Gigi Edgley, which is a name you should remember. <br /> <br /> One of the many things I love about these series is that since John Chrichton accidentally ended up in this part of the galaxy, he continues to refer to "Real Life". That is to say, when John is having a bit of a hard time accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaints is that when he returns, Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead. <br /> <br /> So Frell all the other series, gather your Dren and spend an Ahn in one of these episodes. I can assure you that Sci / Fi as you know it will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series has it all. It's sexy. It's full of action. It is hilly. It's Farscape
