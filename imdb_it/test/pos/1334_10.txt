Despite his critics, I enjoyed it immensely for what it is. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg has done the most difficult things in art before, he won an Oscar, he is at the top of his game. Ocean's 12 is light, commercial, soft, Steve's day in Midway, if you want. Generally I'm not a fan of Zeta-Jones, but I have to admit that Kate is TIRING in this movie. The screams of an imminent trequel will end and I will be one of the millions of people who flock to see 120 minutes of George, Brad and Matt clashing through Clooney's excavations in Lake Como, while still rubbing some rich bad boy again it's still. If we tolerate 3 episodes of the Lord of the Rings, I ask if we can drool on the lid with Clooney salt and pepper again?
