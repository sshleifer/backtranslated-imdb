This film was so well set that I don't think I blinked while watching. An intense situation after another kept me glued to the set. However, I would have liked to see Corey Feldman much more in this picture. He just steals every scene he finds himself in. It could be my favorite Corey performance. The ending was clever and, unlike other films that move away from the parts of the body that play friendly supporting characters, this film is fine! I liked that it was not graphic blood and blood but that it left the imagination of the viewer more. Good boy. I literally had to wipe the sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter. Ultimately, the film works thanks to its very nice main character and the extraordinary presence of my all-time favorite villain, James Remar (48 hours, remember?) I highly recommend this film to everyone who tries to make them sweat. <br /> <br />
