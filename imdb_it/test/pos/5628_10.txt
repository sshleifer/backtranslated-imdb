Whenever I'm not giving 150% to my dreams or my goals, I think of Mark Borchardt, the subject of real life in "American Movie". Mark's stubborn perseverance in producing and shooting his first feature film is so endearing that it will make you laugh, shaking your head sadly and cheering for him. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen such an honest documentary since the film about R. Crumb. The support "cast" (Mark's royal family and friends) are all fantastic. Give this film a chance and you'll see a great movie and a splendid portrait of the things the American dream is made of.
