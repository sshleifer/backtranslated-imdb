The novel "A Way Through the Wood" by Nigel Balchin was adapted by Julian Fellowes who also directs this "terribly British" piece of living room suspense. It is a film whose effect is based on the cast that portrays variously benign / malign characters and this is where Fellowes' choices of direction are superb. The plot has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film is the metamorphosis of each player as a single incident that lights up a minefield of disasters. <br /> <br /> James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a successful business lawyer in London, married to Anne (Emily Watson) who needs more in his life: the couple who live childless in the country in a beautiful estate, assisted by Maggie (Linda Bassett) in the long term. They participate in social outings and meet, among others, William Bule (Rupert Everett), the passively lazy and wealthy neighbor. Anne decides that they should entertain their neighbors and against the harsh protest of James Anne proceeds with the planning: James organizes "not to participate because of business". On the night of the party there is a fatal accident in which Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by someone in a Range Rover (he observed). When James returns home, he sees a scratch on William's Range Rover and suspects that William is the perpetrator. Anne discourages James from entering the police with information - "what good can he do, but ruin the life of Bill as a socialite and father and son of an important offspring?" From this first "lie" the virus spreads: James confronts Bill who speaks James to go to the police, Anne confesses that she was the one who led Bill's Rover and is the only one responsible, James convinces Anne to keep her quiet because it would ruin her her reputation, Anne confesses that she has a relationship with Bill, and all three agree that they will remain united in their great lie for the greater good. Eventually Anne succumbs to the guilt of not telling her beloved Maggie that she is the only one responsible and Maggie, herself guilty of a previous theft whose life was saved by Anne's mercy to hire her anyway, is the agent who draws the story at its surprising conclusion. Lies generate lies that generate lies, and so on. <br /> <br /> The major impact of this intrigue is the way the isolated tragedy affects each of the characters involved. Everyone changes dramatically. Tome Wilkinson offers the best performance of a career full of brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his posture and facial expressions than on any actor in front of today's audience. Similarly, the talented Emily Watson adds another beautiful role to her repertoire, as well as the surprisingly slender Rupert Everett who, despite being yet another rich English gentleman, gives us a man who is both dry and at the same time needy. And the ever beautiful Linda Bassett takes a small role and refines it making her character silently central in the chaotic network of lies. <br /> <br /> Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography and Stanislas Syrewicz's soundtrack immeasurably add to the multiple atmospheres that history meets. This is the ensemble that plays at its best, which always means that the director (Julian Fellowes) has a good knowledge of the piece. The interaction of these good people makes the story dubious that it works really well. Grady Harp
