I have just seen the DVD version of BORN BAD and found it tense, gritty and, almost at the end, too graphic for the faint of heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman turn into superior performances. For a low budget film, this image offers. The depth of the character and the intelligent dialogue are two things that are not usually seen in an image of Roger Corman. Check it out on DVD!
