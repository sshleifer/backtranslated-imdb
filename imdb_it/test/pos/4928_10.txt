Tiny Toons is the first cartoon I remember seeing as a child and I loved every minute of it. When I was four or five my parents bought the video How I spent my vacation. I looked at it again and again until I made new words. Well, a few days ago, my three-year-old cousin approached and I had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old relic from my childhood. <br /> <br /> I new would have laughed, but I was surprised at how much I laughed. Like every Tiny Toons movie and episode, humor relies more on wackiness and slapstick humor and is tremendously successful. Bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Maton Pig and Fifi endure incredible Bugs and Babs adventures, white water rafting with a little help from Superman, Plucky Duck and Maton pig travel to the largest amusement park just to ride the monorail and Elmyra does a strange quest to find cute kittens in a safari land. <br /> <br /> Some of the classic humor can be found in this Tiny Toon adventure and is one of the best extravagant comedy I've ever seen. My favorite gag was to be the monorail when Hamton and Plucky arrive, they ride the monorail and leave) to Plucky's dismay). No matter what your age, you'll laugh until you cry without having to face language and nakedness. <br /> <br /> Tiny Toons Adventures: how I spent my vacation. The voices of Charles Adler, Tress MacNeille, Joe Alaskey and Don Messick are the protagonists. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
