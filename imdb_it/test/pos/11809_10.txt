*** Contains spoiler *** <br /> <br /> A beautiful film, with Brad Renfro and the ever-wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Mazzello, among all his films I've seen so far I've loved each one for many different reasons and The Cure is no different. Brad Renfro does very well in this film too. The Cure is a drama / old age film from the point of view of a sick child and his friend. <br /> <br /> The basic idea is: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) has AIDS. He ends up making friends with the boy next door (Brad Renfro), but Erik's mother has a very narrow mind, ill-informed and a little "thick" when it comes to Dexter's illness. He thinks AIDS is as contagious as the common cold, so he doesn't want his son to go anywhere near Dexter. <br /> <br /> After many attempts to heal their care without success, the boys go to New Orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it. After getting kicked by Playboy magazine, Dexter's health goes south soon after and while his health goes out, there is still enough life in the boy next to Erik for two pranks to pretend to stop breathing. Unfortunately, poor Dexter really dies from his illness, leaving poor Erik behind and wondering why he couldn't find the cure. Throughout the film he ends up bonding more with Dexter's mother than with his. <br /> <br /> It is a very moving film to watch and it is not absolutely perfect (the films are rarely), but you will not care less about how you are involved in the film more. A must for Joseph Mazzello fans, one of his best performances ever. Highly recommended movies - if you can find a copy :)
