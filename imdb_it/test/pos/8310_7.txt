AT THE EARTH'S CORE's main criticism is that it is cheap, special effects are bad, and so on and so forth. Yes, some of the special effects are painfully bad, but what many people ignore is that it's pretty funny, which is very important in my book. <br /> <br /> In comparison, look at the latest STAR WARS films: they have the latest, greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances that are able to create amazing visual effects as much as human imagination can imagine yet , with all the glow, those films were as exciting as a funeral. As Yoda would say, amusing they are not! In other words, who cares if FX is not the biggest when the spirit of the film is fast, fun and clearly set on the action side. I like everything about AT THE EARTH'S CORE: the contrast between the ungovernable Victorian England VS the wild and worldly environment of Pellucidar, the cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, the telepathic Pterodactyls, the rebellious human slaves , Jubal the ugly (lol!), The inspired group of Peter Cushing (which is fantastic!) And Doug McClure, the excellent music (it's really good), the cinematography of the extraordinary Alan Hume and, last but not least, Caroline Munro . It's getting sexy in this movie. One of the sexiest movie B girls ever captured on screen. Seriously, everyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what's funny. Give me the EARTH CENTER on any turgid STAR WARS prequel at any time! At least he has Caroline Munro, which no CGI FG can ever recreate.
