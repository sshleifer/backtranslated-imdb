Kate Gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, is also one of the most talented actresses Meryl Streep (Out of Africa). She is wonderful is every part she plays. The graduate of Yale is the pride and joy of American cinema. <br /> <br /> Kate's health is deteriorating and her husband George, a well-developed role by the brilliant actor and also Oscar winner, William Hurt (Smoke, Kiss of the Spider Woman) has difficulty worsening his health of his only true thing and seeks his daughter's help. Poor daughter, Ellen Gulden, Ren√©e Zellweger (Jerry Maguire) expects too much from her. No break! The story takes a very realistic view of a parent's illness. In this film the only child must set aside her life to take care of the needs of others. There is always one in every family that has to face this kind of responsibility. Ellen is angry at the beginning of the film, but over time she ends up understanding the dedication to the life of her mother's mother. He even asks his mother: how do you make her, every day, inside and out and nobody notices? This is what women do, much of what I call invisible work. We also clean, repair, repair, iron, celebrate, are the best friends, we are confident, the lover, the sensitized, the disciplinary, the sensitive. Some of us, like both women in this film, have a perfect education, they are the psychological pillar of the whole family and they also do all the invisible work! This is Kate Ellen and many women in our society. Many of us have already gone through that phase of life when our parents grow old and die. I have been there. They went too young. I thanked my parents, but I never understood them as well as when I had to play their roles and I had to walk in their shoes. This film reflects the reality of life. Maybe it's sad, but that's how life is sometimes. George a Harvard professor is a complicated person, who seems to think his work is more important than all the others, and has a "master / servant" mentality towards the women of his life. It's not strong enough to do it. If you want to see good acting and the reality of life don't miss this movie. Favorite scenes: the restaurant that comes to Kate, the violins and everything else. The creation of a table with broken porcelain. That I am so symbolic! We are all broken pots! Favorite quotes: George: "It's just going uphill, you realize you're really going downhill". George "You have an education at Harvard but where is your heart?" <br /> <br />
