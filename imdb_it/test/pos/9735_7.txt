I don't understand all these negative reviews. I think this film was one of the best in the Puppet Master series. Being made on a low budget, one can see why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they were not completely horrible. Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma in the role of Andre Toulon. It has a lot of potential and I hope to see it soon. And although the cinematography was not excellent, and there was minimal violence and gore, this film was a lot of fun. I'm a big fan of Puppet Masters and I've grown to expect blood and blood from the films in this series, but I can say that I've never been bored during the whole course of watching Retro Puppet Master. So if you ever get the chance to watch this movie, don't consider it automatically unworthy of your time. Give him a chance. You might like.
