As I said earlier in previous comments, some programs are there to be 'light entertainment'. So I feel a little frustrated when commentators seem to be expecting a program that will reveal the meaning of life, you won't get it from Cleopatra 2525 and don't pretend to offer it. What you get is a girl who has been frozen and is brought back to life some 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. It does not settle in 10 minutes as happens with other time travel adventures and neither is she the female equivalent of James Bond ready to conquer all visitors. The delirium is intimidated by his new environment and frightened by some of the weapons on display as most of us would be. However, it is a light entertainment, the stories have a beginning in the middle and an end in a short time and are surprisingly good moments of acting. The episode in which there is a Cleopatra double is particularly moving and I believe that Jennifer Sky gives one of the best performances of someone who has been dying for a long time, and being a fan of cinema and television I know what I'm talking about. Finally to prove my sincerity I bought all but four of the episodes and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I don't have the complete set is because I bought the other episodes before realizing that there was a complete box set. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio credibly and for the light entertainment Cleopatra 2525 has certainly entertained me.
