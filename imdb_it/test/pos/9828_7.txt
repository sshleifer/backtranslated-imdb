Of all the actresses in today's film, Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice if I had to choose one to run aground on a desert island. <br /> <br /> I could simply see it, for example, sitting in a chair for a couple of hours. So it's hard for me to be completely objective about one of his films. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this film and its history, in itself, more than the one indicated by the average ranking among the many people who previously commented on this site. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is not one of the actors, though, whose interpretations I like best. But he is one of those who have reached the transition level from 7 digits to 8 per film, so who am I to discuss? <br /> <br /> Although Ford is often funny in his acting style, and sometimes seems to need a serious antacid and caffeine shot - and "Random Hearts" is in this group. <br /> <br /> His obsession with probing losses, that both he and Thomas have endured regarding their spouses ties, is understandable, given his detective profession - but not to the level presented here. Although not far away, he crossed the finish line in the "annoying" category. <br /> <br /> However, most of the scenes after he and Thomas were involved were interesting and well played. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a 9 *, but I would have lowered it a couple of levels, based on Ford's overall performance, and another, because they contained a little more than the extraneous sub-plot elements of how necessary it seemed.
