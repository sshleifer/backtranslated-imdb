Buddy Holly was a pioneer and a victim of the early years of rock 'n' roll. The young singer / composer from Lubbock, Texas, has left his mark on the model of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly spent a lot of time fighting the system to record her rock-un-billy sound. Before his premature death, he mixed lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take her place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as voices of teenage angst. <br /> <br /> This easy to look biography is not without flaws. Some situations, events, places and even names were incorrect for various reasons. What makes this film so believable is that Gary Busey sang alone as Holly. A well-produced soundtrack has become a multi-million seller. <br /> <br /> Busey was nominated for an Oscar. Other notable stars are Don Stroud, Conrad Janis, Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine.
