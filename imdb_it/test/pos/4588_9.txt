Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting film and one that its fans will no doubt find and see. <br /> <br /> Before starting the review, I would say that if you have the chance to see it, it's certainly worth it, as it's worth watching, and it's not the easiest movie in the world to track down. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the premise: Luke Wilson is the private Joe Bauers, an army librarian believed to have absolutely no exceptional attributes or obvious flaws, making him totally average in every way. This, together with the fact that it has no living relatives, makes it an exceptional candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure. Also frozen with Joe is a prostitute named Rita who was exploited at the project by Upgrayedd, his abusive pimp. Unfortunately, a few days after they were frozen, the top secret project was abandoned, and they were forgotten. <br /> <br /> They wake up in 2505, and discover that with the stunning of the company it follows the trends of recent times, everyone on Earth is only slightly smarter than a chimpanzee. The way the "common man" talks about Joe Bauers is seen as "faggy", as someone who talks like Shakespeare would be ridiculed now, and a former professional wrestler is the President of the United States (actually, this probably isn't really outrageous). The best show on TV is called "Ow! My Balls!", Which sounds good, and not only is everything badly written, but the signs seem to have run out of space for wording, leaving them grouped together fine. <br /> <br /> It's a fun premise for the movie, but that's the problem. Apart from the initial premise, not so much in the film is really fun. What I mean is that the ideas that come to mind after reading the premise of the film are probably as fun as the movie itself. Obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been more fun. <br /> <br /> There are some winners in the script, like Starbucks who now offers "happy ending" and people who put their blind faith in what is universally misunderstood "electrolytes", but they are too few and far between them so, unless you giggle hysterically every time one of the idiots of the future brings out a sentence full of soft and insulting jaw with little or no logic and / or intelligence, then the laughter could be quite far apart. <br /> <br /> It is unfair for everyone to be confronted with Office Space, because it is a very different film, but as a movie, regardless of what came before, Idiocracy is a fun concept that will probably make you laugh a lot more in the first 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I give him 5 out of 10 because it's fun, but he doesn't. Don't do enough to lift him over the center of the road.
