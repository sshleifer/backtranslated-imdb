Coherence is perhaps this film its biggest problem. The film begins as a quick, elegant and simply funny political satire, but in its second half the film becomes more serious, in a way almost Oliver Stone. Obviously it is also a very serious subject, but I would say that the film would have been much better and even more effective if it had been made completely in the same style as the first halved of the film. <br /> <br /> For a biography and a film on the subject of this film, the film is also quite short with its 102 minutes duration. Because of this the film seems to be not telling the whole story. Of course the sequel to the events after the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan is hinted at in the film, but the film does not elaborate and does not explain much about it, which seems like a cheap way to glorify Charlie Wilson without showing the other side of the coin. Even the real events in the film itself are rather simplified, although sometimes the story is told (unnecessarily) complex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film would have been much better if it wasn't trying to be so serious at times and generally lighter with its style and atmosphere. The film should have been for example more like "Wag the Dog", which achieved the right combination of satire and delicate political issues. <br /> <br /> Due to this incoherent style and way of telling stories, the recitations are also mixed. When Tom Hanks plays the character in a more playful and more comical way, it is simply excellent. But this makes it difficult to take his character seriously in the most serious and sensitive / shocking moments of the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent, like every movie he plays. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this film. Most other actors seem to be walking around in this movie, just to be in the movie. This is especially true for Julia Roberts, whose character I found too mysterious to have a purpose quite clear for the film. He made a redundant impression on me and is therefore also really forgettable in this film. <br /> <br /> It's not that the film is a bad watch, it's actually quite good and even fun, but if the film had dared to be a little more edgy, the film would have been better and above all more effective in what he tried to get obviously. <br /> <br /> 7/10
