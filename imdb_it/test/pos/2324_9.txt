I just discovered this movie and I love it. Just the right mix of moving stories, funny characters, hilarious moments (but not overloaded with stupid jokes) and fun performances by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Torn and more. Buckman is particularly good at it, and I really enjoyed watching the guy who played Stapanick. I also found it interesting that they used a real submarine, the Pampanito, to run on the best scenes and emulate it almost exactly for their sets. The decoration of the set is really impressive if you take a digital tour of Pampanito online and then compare it to the scenes in the movie. They did an excellent job in this film. <br /> <br /> What a fun and really nice movie!
