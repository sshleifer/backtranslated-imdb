Captain Corelli's mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's best films. Turn a beautiful performance into a title character. This is a love story set against the background of a torn and worn-out island. The character of John Hurt gives his daughter, beautifully played by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This film is not to blame for being completely predictable. This film also allows Cruz to transform a performance into a strong woman who knows her mind and heart. Once the film heats up beyond the opening sequence, this movie keeps you focused on it. Once again, Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.
