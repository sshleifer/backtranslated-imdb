I saw this movie for the first time in the 40s when I was a child and I always remembered the ending. There is nothing like the first impression, but some films are always a pleasure whenever they are displayed. Something is only in resonance with them. This is one of those films and I agree with another reviewer who said that Fritz Lang should have directed more westerns. To add it I have always liked Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young is the protagonist of my favorite movie, if I have to name just one, it's not an easy thing to do. That movie is Northwest Passage. It brought me to Kenneth Roberts' superb historical novels. Similarly, Western Union led me to read the Zane Gray novel which, in this case, turned out to be one of those rare cases in which I like the film better than the novel. Not that Gray's novel is bad; I like the story of the film better. The film in no way resembles the novel. It's a completely different story, one of the biggest departures from a book I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can't add much to the other reviews except to say that I agree with many of them. I too would like it to be published on DVD. "Whatever happened to Randolph Scott happened to the best of me."
