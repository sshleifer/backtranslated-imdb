This is another of John Travolta's "comeback" films, and if he continues with characters and movies like this, his return will take hold. <br /> <br /> This is so sweet ... disgustingly so if you're not in the romantic comedy scene. If you are, this is an innovative RomCom. Every performance (including that of Skippy the Dog) was beautiful, without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in "Dogma". (Although, like the movies, I adored Dogma!) <br /> <br /> Travolta is not as brazen in his interpretation as the previews could lead you to believe. He is an angel and if you think you read well, then you understand that angels were anything but perfect. So you won't be insulted by this movie. Even those who are overly sensitive to these things should not be insulted by this work, since Nora has done everything to ensure that it is the least abrasive possible given the argument. <br /> <br /> I love it and love it every time I look at it. It is beautiful and sweet, captivating and captivating. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 7.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
