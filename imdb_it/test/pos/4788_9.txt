I saw it when I was twelve. It was the film that made me understand what a really good mystery was. I had read the whole series of Happy Hollisters' children's yellow and was about a family of child investigators who always had their man. But we readers were not able to solve the mystery with them. This film showed me that a good mystery is what makes the viewer / reader, in the end, say "OH !!!!! OF COURSE !!!!!!!"
