I don't think I've ever seen a better parody of the film. Mel Brooks is crazy. EVERY time I look at it, I find something new and it makes it even more fun than the last time. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a fantastic and unexpected ending that lets you collapse. Each character is fantastic from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed all the way and I will never get tired. Watch it !! <br /> <br /> If you liked Cary Elwes in this movie, you should definitely see The Princess Bride.
