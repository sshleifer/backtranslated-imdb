One of the best movies I've ever seen: a classic "Matrix" movie. For many years, I tried to do it on VHS or DVD - to no avail. The German film / television industry continues to favor valuable cultural contributions (and this is Fassbinder, after all!) And destroy the dust in an archive rather than distribute it commercially (and make a lot of money with it if that's what stimulates them instead of the promotion of creative thinking). However, WDR once told me that if I paid 200.00 DM to check the copyright (non-refundable), and then 8 DM per minute of copy, plus the cost for the materials, then they will consider preparing a copy ( single!) For me. A way to sell something! The same problem we have with many other films or TV series like "So weit die Füße tragen", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder" and others. Excellent TV series - of which you will never hear again. Germany, wake up! <br /> <br /> UPDATE since March 2007: last year I finally got a copy of the DVD from the WDR "Mittschnittservice" for about 50+ Euros. Great!
