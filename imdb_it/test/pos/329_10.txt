Hello everyone! I went to this movie without any expectations, even though I knew that Maniratnam would give an excellent movie! I was stunned !! The background is the struggle between Tamils ​​settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how a young Amudha girl who lives with her adoptive parents in Chennai, India, leaves Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The highlights of the film are the performances of each actor and actress and ofcourse, cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks for the cast and crew. I have to mention cinematography as it pulls out the war in such a way that you feel there. Excellent work! Although the war sequences reminded me of saving Soldier Ryan, such work was never attempted on Indian Screen. Overall, the film is fantastic! And hat to Mr. Maniratnam. Mani Ratnam has once again proved to be a director who can bring Indian cinema to great heights! I'd like to see this movie again and again. An excellent film and a must see.
