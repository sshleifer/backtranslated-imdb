Greta Garbo is the protagonist of 'Anna Christie', a 'talkie' of the first MGs of 1930, the first time in "Garbo Talks". 'Anna Christie' is a powerful film but not for everyone. The film is filmed as a theatrical show, short of sets and cinematography, long dialogue and dramatic characterizations. Eugene O'Neil who wrote the play 'Anna Christie' is famous for his obscure work and the character of Garbo Anna Christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was mediocre. Not helping things is that George F. Marion, who plays Anna's alien father, Chris Christofferson, is verbally difficult to understand. Marion performs well like the old drunken sailors who are poised on madness with his fixation on the diabolical "devil sea". But his dialogue is written with a very heavy Swedish accent, this is true for O'Neils' original comedy. Marie Dressler's dialogue as Marthy Owens is equally difficult to understand. Dressler credibly portrays an old drunken woman destroyed, a "dock rat". His dialogue is also faithful to O'Neils' original comedy, as is Charles Bickford in the role of Irish sailors, Matt Burke, who chases Anna in a troubled relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film is Greta Garbo. Exhibits a harrowing performance as a victim of negligence and abuse, leading to a life of prostitution. At the time Garbo was a huge star and considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Here his look is not glamorous, he is tortured. His body posture almost bends into agony. Scratch your face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. Garbo transmits these anguished feelings to the viewer to convince us of his suffering. <br /> <br /> This is a dark theme and Garbo gives it to life. It's not a light dish, it's not fun, it's not for everyone. 'Anna Christie' is a strong emotion pulled out of the deep to be examined, this is an incredible race.
