I am surprised that this, well above the 80-year average, only got 5.2 votes from all IMDB voters. Dan Ackroyd does his usual satirical shift as a scammer who takes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prison doctor. He retires to California to start his job giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous Dr. Lawrence Baird. The only person who knows he is an impostor is the drunken priest (Walter Matthau) who comes to be pampered by the new wealth found by Ackroyd after he escaped. Charles Grodin also offers a good support performance. For his genre I think this film deserves the same credibility as "Ferris Bueller" or "Trading Places". 7.5 / 10
