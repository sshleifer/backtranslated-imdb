ManBearPig is a rather fun episode of South Park. It breaks Al Gore and his talks on global warming, replacing only global warming with ManBearPig (an imaginary monster that has parts of a man, a bear and a pig). in a school assembly and Stan feels sorry for him, so he and the boys decide to go out with him. Eventually he gets them trapped in a rock cave where he believes he is a manbearpig and they are stuck for days. Meanwhile, Cartman finds treasure but wants to keep it all to himself. ManBearPig is a good parody of Global Warming and overall a fun episode of South Park. <br /> <br /> 8/10
