As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I feel I can answer some of the questions and confusion that have been put forward. I think I can also offer some information about the club and previous stories. Oh, and this will be a long post, I can already tell. <br /> <br /> First of all, the people who claimed that the film doesn't show the real rugby, have a valid point. The film is full of bad contrasts, people in the wrong places and much more. If you want to know what a real rugby game looks like, you won't get the best idea from this movie. But the fact is that anything other than sitting down and watching a roller of light or jumping into a game alone will not be satisfactory. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really, how many sports movies really make you feel like you're in the game? Not many I've seen. I think it's important to remember that the film is about rugby players, much more than it is about rugby. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, the Haka is VERY much part of Highland Rugby. It's not something they just threw in the movie. To be honest, I don't know how the tradition started, but Highland emulates the All Blacks in many ways. The uniform is also based on the All Blacks. The film didn't do a good job explaining Haka's origins and, to be honest, I don't think it's right. But I can tell you that every team member knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. As for the person from China (?) Who said that only a Maori can perform a Haka, I would suggest you take a look at the All Blacks and tell me if they think they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a large Polynesian community, and a good part of them like to play rugby for local teams. I am part Hawaiian. Whenever possible, the Haka is led by a Maori. The team does not do it because it thinks it is Maori, it does so because of some of the problems shown in the film. The concept of unity and "those who went before" is a huge part of the culture of human resources, and the message behind the Haka, for anyone who is familiar, supports these values. It is a song of a chief who thought he would die (Ka Mate), and those around him supported him by telling him that he would live (Ka Ora) and strengthen him. How appropriate it is for a group of white boys to do it is not for me to say, but this is the ideology behind it and why it is made. "Kia Kaha" is also a well-used team motto, even if the actors have had difficulty saying it. <br /> <br /> Also, for people who have questioned Highland's Rugby's playing skills, I would just like to remind you that you weren't really watching Highlands in this movie. Many of the extras were former Highland players and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland is really good at what it does and highly respected in the international community. Sure, some years produce better teams than others (that's what you would expect from any sports team), but don't accumulate the record of HR wins simply by staying well. The year after I graduated from high school, (1998) Highland was one of 12 teams to be invited to the Zimbabwe World Rugby Championship. The teams were handpicked from around the world and represented the best of high school talent at the time. The Highland obviously didn't win the first place, (New Zealand did it), but they managed to take third place in the tournament, beating the national champions of Tonga in their last game. And while American rugby can never reach the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa have, the third in the world has nothing to think about. Highland also has a tradition of visiting New Zealand every few years, and usually returns with more victories than losses. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters portrayed in this film are based on real people and true stories. I saw this movie with my brothers, who also played for Highland, and between the four of us, we were pretty sure we could identify ALMOST main characters. No one knew a white Rasta. Of course since this was not a documentary, Hollywood has taken some liberties, but to tell you the truth, not all of those you could think of. The film was actually precise enough to show the daily practices of 2 and a half hours, as well as personal training and weight training. Sometimes it really worked until you threw up. He also showed the team's service and other activities (such as the chuck-a-rama buffet) that were an integral part of the team bond. <br /> <br /> And finally the film, in my (obviously very biased) opinion, was a good film. And I think the reason is that I saw it as an inspirational sports movie. I didn't think it would be a pure rugby movie or an academic award-winning drama. It was just an uplifting film about a rugby team, complete with morale, encouragement and a good dose of fun-filled jokes. I hope I have dealt with some of the problems people have had with the film, and I hope you can enjoy it now for what it was. <br /> <br /> Kia Kaha
