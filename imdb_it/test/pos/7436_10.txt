It is not difficult to understand this film! I watched it without expectations and without knowing the history of the games. I was completely blown away! <br /> <br /> Initially, I wondered how most of the characters had some sort of super powers, but it's called "FINAL FANTASY ...". I also wondered about Cloud's past, but it was easy enough to look up. In any case, these questions do not spoil the enjoyment of the film. Just the opposite; shows that I kept thinking about the story long after seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> It is one of the most beautiful films my eyes have ever seen. The music fully supports the film. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
