First of all, I've seen this show since I was a small child, and I've always loved it. Of course, maybe I didn't understand it when I was so young, but I always liked it! And now that I've been able to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The soundtrack of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed soundtrack I've ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don't even need to hear the song to enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Switch to this particular production - This is great! Of course no one can play Mrs. Lovett apart from Angela Lansbury, and she does it perfectly. And she should, she played this part for several years. George Hearn is absolutely brilliant. The best Sweeney Todd I've ever heard. He has a wonderful voice, yet he can express his voice so well! His "epiphany" is incredible, as can be understood from the public's reaction to it. The judge, Toby, Antony and Pirelli are also so wonderful in their roles. All are perfect! Well, I still have to go on with Johanna's green finch and the bird. You simply don't sing that song well. <br /> <br /> This show can be enjoyed by all ages, but it is not always accepted. I'm not the typical lover of middle age theater, I'm only 15, yet Sweeney Todd gave me more appreciation for music than I got from any other musical.
