An inspired director's choice for this latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, which broke out on the scene with the NY Dykes' no-budget fairy tale, "Go Fish" brings a sweetly crumbling vision to this story of a Londoner who chooses a slightly environment inappropriate of a male bonding company to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of male truths. The highlight for me is a scene where the company tries to go back to being primitive hunter-gatherers but ends up ordering a take-away. The film as a whole is wonderfully performed and Troche, which would never have been accepted by some of the lesbians he played in his previous film, savors the larger budget by indulging in some wonderfully persistent views that contrast with _Go Fish_'s granular hyperkinesis . A really nice movie
