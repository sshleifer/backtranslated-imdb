I always like watching this cartoon, with Sylvester trying to catch Tweety on a train, rather than at his grandmother's house. It's actually a standard but fun fare, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop cord. One of my complaints about this is the way the animators were sloppy on the train. When you look at it again and again, like my child (who loves trains, which is why he liked it so much), you start to notice some things. <br /> <br /> In all this short, the position of the baggage changes on the train, 3rd, 4th or 5th, and in long shots it is not at all. The engine has the number 651 or 814 or none. The offer of coal has the number 99 or the letters "S.P. and Q.R." on it, or no number or letters to everyone. The coaches carry the "S.P.Q.R." without "&" in long shots, and then in foregrounds has the words "Southeast and West". <br /> <br /> All this does not interfere with the story, but the details of the production have obviously not been looked at very carefully. <br /> <br /> Again this cartoon is one of my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.
