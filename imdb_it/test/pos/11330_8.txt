Two hours ago I was watching this fantastic movie that overwhelmed me with his imprisoned picture. It is quite understandable how he won the prize for the best camera in Cannes 2000. The first plans prevailed. Close-ups of walls, humans and many other things. The colored and warm lighting (which is usually also of the director) gave the film a warm atmosphere. Only two people are mainly to be seen in most of it. An interesting music and above all three songs or themes have accompanied the film almost all the time. Each of these themes represented a certain atmosphere throughout the film. Silence and slow movements characterize the film. Some scenes were prolonged moments or a series of close-ups. Not only does Tony Leung deserve an award for his superb acting, as even Maggie Cheung was so brilliant. I wonder how many clothes he wore in different scenes. History was also connected in some way with the history of Hong Kong and the 1960s region. This prevented me from understanding some details of this especially at the end. In short, I would recommend art film fans to watch it at the cinema.
