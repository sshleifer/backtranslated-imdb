After seeing the film a few times, I found subtle touches and emotions within the dialogue. Jing Ke, the murderer has become one of the favorite movie characters of all time. This good Chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements, so any American big-screen actor today. Qin, the Emperor, is brilliant as he guides the public to believe in the kindness in his heart, only to unleash the most cruel actions on the people around him. The promises he makes with incredible passion and shattered with an evil punch. Gong Li, as in almost every movie I've ever seen, is simply amazing. His screen domination is so graceful and emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> In case you can't understand it, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />
