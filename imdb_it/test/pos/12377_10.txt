Some will say that this film is a guilty pleasure. I loved this movie but I don't feel guilty about it. You can tell the whole cast and crew that they enjoyed making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 will not get along very well with some people. From the beginning you can say that this film will be made of cheese and certainly has an amateur aspect. Well, if you have the privilege of watching this movie, after seeing it remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now, since I can't fill ten lines, here are some fantastic scenes: <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The three women on the beach have had great deaths. The first had Jack in a tree trying to make the icicles fall on one of them. He kept missing and dropped an anvil on her. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. The last was stabbed in the eyes with pliers. <br /> <br /> The other big one was the point where two surfers clashed near a frozen pole. One of them puts the glued tongue on it (obviously). Jack Frost pulls him back and tears off his tongue as he says "COWA-LANGUAGE-A DUDE!" Well, you have to see it alone. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the snowball kids kicked ass. <br /> <br /> ** FINE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> stars of infinity
