This film is really sick and funny. I made my friends shudder by describing them for them. I saw it about 8 months ago, and I still have the song 'Shall we Gather at the River' that echoes in my head. <br /> <br /> So, basically, it's a Romeo and Juliet with a whiff, but it goes beyond what you'd expect. Let's just say incest, references to child molestation, gore (obviously), but unfortunately, it has a sort of happy ending. .. kind of ... it's weirder than happy. Cappy Capulet was brilliant! It has this sort of intellectual snobbish tone, it is abusive, but civilized. He quotes more Shakespeare than anyone else in the film ... all while engaging in his sadistic role as a husband and father. <br /> <br /> The type of meat was also very nice. He was Juliet's boyfriend, deeply infatuated with her, and soon he would break his heart because of Tromeo. And Tromeo, a true romantic. He's a handsome boy, really sweet, desperate for true love. "She makes torches to burn brightly!" Unfortunately, Troma simply had to resort to that terrible fake green vomit and their other antics. Sometimes they are taken away with that stuff. But hey, this movie made a big impression on me. How often I refer to it in real life situations ... wow is pathetic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, have fun!
