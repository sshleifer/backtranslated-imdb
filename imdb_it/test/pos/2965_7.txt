To summarize this story in a few sentences: A teenager (Amy) uses her hot body and the "supposed" virginity to entice a troubled young boy (Matt) with a potential scholarship to provide her with a "Full Ride" out of town. Come to find out that you have enough reputation and slept with many soccer players in the past hoping they would offer you the same deal. Both of these guys come from distressed and dysfunctional homes. Matt's mothers are an alcoholic who repeatedly embarrasses him in front of his friends and Amy's mother had a bad reputation and got pregnant with Amy at a young age. Matt falls in love with Amy and tries to straighten out his life for her. Very predictable end. The actress who plays "Amy" actually has 33 years trying to play a teenager!
