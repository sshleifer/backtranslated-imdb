I was disappointed that this film is not at all popular even in Hong Kong. However, for all Chow fans, this will be a masterpiece that will not be left out. This is "Mo Lei Tou" (a comic style based on an unrealistic and ridiculous plot, pioneer of Chow) at its peak. The plot is absolutely absolutely at the end 1000 times more ridiculous than any movie you can imagine. The dialogue is fantastic. No single part of the film gets cold and you can't laugh anymore. <br /> <br /> The plot seems simple but crazy to start laughing. He starts with Chow played by a junior magistrate (a corrupt one of course) captured in prison when he helps an innocent married woman who he loves at first sight to free her from a murder charge that he plots from the minister of evil whose son was actually the real convict . Chow escapes from prison and flees as a refugee. He intends to go to the capital to see the emperor and denounce the sentence. On his way, he manages to gather 2 adorable women, one from the circus, another a prostitute while in the meantime mastering the supreme ability to quarrel and the bad mouth from the thin Mama-san (which is his future in law). In the end, he managed to force the emperor to reopen the case by black mail to the emperor who met him in the brothel. The Emperor made him a high-level judge to judge the case against the minister of evil. He manages to set up some brilliant but hilarious plots to force the inmate to commit the crime, to have him executed while turning the evil minister into prison. <br /> <br /> The plots are really hilarious and ridiculously bright. Also, don't forget the huge dialogue that includes a brilliant storm between Chow and Mama-san, the quarrel between fat Mama-san and the skinny Mama-san to inspire Chow to learn the litigation skill later and even to quarrel between Chow and eunuch Lee hurt near the end. Besides that, some scenes are also brilliant. <br /> <br /> One thing that must be mentioned is that to truly understand the film and achieve 100% of all the elements correctly, this will be a must to master Cantonese really well. What could be the reason that the film Chow of early childhood receives a moderate response only from the Asian world. However, when Chow's film began to spread its influence around the world, hardcore fans like me discovered that his film is not as fun as it used to be in the old days.
