Gilmore's girls talk about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 years old. Now the daughter is 16 years old (in the first season) and lives like sisters. Share everything, trust each other completely. <br /> <br /> I like The Gilmore Girls but I'm not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and her daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both beautiful women, both fun and fascinating in their own way. There are some fun supporting characters, like Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai like each other, maybe they love each other too, but none of them really acts on it. They have their little moments. There are other secondary characters, many of them very funny, and with their touching moments won. <br /> <br /> What I like best is to see the relationship between the young mother and her daughter becoming an adult. The dialogue between them is fast, sharp, fun and sometimes moving. The band they have is beautiful. The Gilmore Girls makes you feel good, so try it.
