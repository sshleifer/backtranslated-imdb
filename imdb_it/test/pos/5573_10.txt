Not since Babylon 5 by J. Michael Straczynski, a television program has captured the wonderful art of applying a narrative arc to a TV show. This is easily the best thing on TV right now! The characters are nice and you can easily stick to them and take care of their well-being. The villagers are the kind you love to hate and let you wonder what they're up to. And Brian Hensen's puppet work is the most innovative out there. Congratulations to Rockne S. O'Bannon for a job well done!
