While some of the things in Haggard are silly and useless, the overall package is good. <br /> <br /> Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) trying to reconquer Ryan's former Glauren (Jenn Rivell). <br /> <br /> The story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it is not surprising and becomes an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it has a lateral story that does not hurt the main plot. <br /> <br /> And, for all Bam fans (and girls) there are more sequences of Bam skateboards, perhaps the weaker aspect of the film. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances, even Don Vito gets a great (but useless) shot. <br /> <br /> If you hope to see a play and escape the madness of Bam, then stay away from this movie, otherwise, enjoy the time you spend with it, if you can find it. There are some really funny scenes in this movie.
