As someone who usually despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching, I was in hysterics. Yes, he is sexist, rude and extremely rude, and I loved him. Since some comedies have only one or two comic scenes, this film was a laugh. I've never seen an original comedy like Ali G Indahouse. For a comedy starring Ali G, this would be worthy of an 8 out of 10. Absolutely Brilliant.
