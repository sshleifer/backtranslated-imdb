One of the main aspects of "Malenkaya Vera" (called "Little Vera" in English) is that it was the first Soviet Union film to present a sex scene, albeit a short one. The title is important: Vera is the Russian word for "faith", identifying that the punk Vera (Natalya Negoda) has little confidence in the Soviet system. And as the film shows, there is not much faith in it. The opening scene shows the squalid industrial city of Zhdanov, almost a hell on earth. When Vera Sergei's lover (Andrey Sokolov) moves in with his family, he leads to some unexpected events. <br /> <br /> As in many Russian films, people's names describe their characters. For example, there is Viktor (remember that "winner" means winner). All in all, this is a good look at the Soviet Union as it was collapsing - and we can see why it was collapsing. Really good.
