This film could be compared to "comfort food" for the soul. Anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a report could relate to this movie. So many parts are so funny and so many parts are so genuinely sincere. It is not perfect in its production or even in its dialogue, but the story is unique and is saying a lot for modern "romantic" comedies. Luke Wilson is bland, but Heather Graham does an exceptional job in my opinion. Give it a try - despite the trivial-looking DVD cover. Joline's character brings many problems to our self-service culture. He asks us if the commitment is really for the other person or for ourselves. Really, we are ourselves. Following promises (anywhere from marriage to a commission for a friend) is a great feeling. Plus, our word is nothing but a puff of shape-shifting smoke. Joline is like an alarm bell. We need to be aware of our words and our commitments, they mean more than we think. At the same time, we must not engage with someone who is incapable of doing the same.
