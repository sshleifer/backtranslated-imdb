The best fan boy movie I've ever seen except "Free Enterprise". <br /> <br /> In a way it reminded me of a film by Kevin Smith. <br /> <br /> If you do some kind of role-playing games, this movie will probably make you laugh often at its insatiable fun. Don't expect a big budget here, acting is also questionable at times, but it really adds fun to the atmosphere they create. The script is really fun with a lot of witty moments that are worth trying. <br /> <br /> The bard who is always killed made me roll. Even the sexually confused player made me smile a little. But in the end ... it was just a great movie that shows some of the best moments in the life of some geeks who really enjoy RPGs. <br /> <br /> If you're bored, and you've always taken part in the role playing, this will be fine for a distraction. A real unexpected surprise.
