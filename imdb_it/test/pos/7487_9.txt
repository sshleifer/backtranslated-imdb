OK, so it owes to Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion it has its own voice and identity mainly due to the style of video-musical direction, the narrative similar to a sketch and the great performances. Thomas Jane offers great results (the drug dealer show-down is extraordinary), including Aaron Eckhart. James LeGros has a short and effervescent appearance, great humor, "they got the Wong house". The Porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable, as is Mickey Rourke's cameo appearance - "take a peak". <br /> <br /> Big production of Hollywood popcorn B with strong performances by aspirants and renegades of level A (Rourke). <br /> <br /> Well, take a peak, it's worth it.
