I remember seeing the trailer for this movie and I knew absolutely that I had to watch this movie. It looked like something that would be my alley. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a fantastic film. It is not one that will leave you with a pleasant, pleasant ending, but with a sad and empty feeling. And when I say that it will leave you with an "empty" feeling, I don't mean this as a bad thing. I believe you have the purpose of filling that empty feeling with your thoughts on the characters and the general motivations of man and how they act as parts of society. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling is perfectly chosen as Leland. He is intelligent, yet stoic. I like the way he tells the movie with his diary. The supporting cast is also exceptional. Kevin Spacey is very good, as always, and Don Cheadle is incredible as a teacher and mentor to Leland. <br /> <br /> This has been a great story and is very intelligent and inspiring. I highly recommend it.
