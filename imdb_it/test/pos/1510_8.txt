A Cat in the Brain, or Nightmare Concert as it is more commonly known among the English-speaking public, begins as the director of the horrid Lucio Fulci (played by the same man Lucio Fulci) who goes to lunch after having filmed a very bloody scene and violent, but he orders steaks and has a horrible view on cannibalism. Grotesque visions, hallucinations and dreams continue and begin to influence his mental state, Fulci decides to seek help and contacts with Professor Egon Schwarz (Dvid L. Thompson) for psychiatric help. Schwarz claims that Fulci cannot separate fantasy from reality and agrees to help him, but Schwarz has another more sinister reason why a serial killer brutally kills prostitutes and Fulci thinks he could be responsible .... <br /> < br /> This Italian production was co-written and directed by Lucio Fulci, who also starred in the film as a horror film director, Lucio Fulci, who does not seem really very busy, however Un Gatto nel Cervello is bloody Nothing else and that's why I liked it. The screenplay by Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Tentori is nothing but a worn-out excuse to modify a lot of gory movies of other Italian films together. I suppose his purpose is good enough and to see that Fulci on the screen has a certain charm if you are a fan of his or are familiar with his films, the ending is very rushed almost as if they had run out of money since he only has one cop telling Fulci that they killed the murderer and that's it. Another thing that ends when the two policemen put the blank sheet on the dead assassin on the field and then leave leaving them there without other police presences, I mean, the police in Italy would leave a corpse in the middle of a field alone ? It moves at a good pace and if you like your blood, then you have to see this even if if you don't like blood then you will hate it with passion, it all depends on your disposition, so the choice is yours. <br /> <br /> The director Fulci has never been the most artistically skilled director and shows here how his film is bland, flat and seems to have been shot for TV, the film of the other films (7 in total) does not it matches the things Fulci shot and it is obvious that this has been put together by several films. If you are looking for blood, you have won the jackpot, people are dismembered with chainsaws, put through the meat grinder, faces are fused, there are some beheadings, there are throats, someone's body is crushed with a car under a machine, a tongue is torn, someone has his throat crushed while the wheelchair runs on it, there are a lot of stab wounds, someone has their guts removed with a hook, there is a rotten corpse complete with worms, someone has the hand cut off, someone has his head split in and their eye falls out, a bloody death with the piano wire running through someone's throat, there are a lot of cut limbs, gallons of blood splashed around and a scene of some cats that eat brains and there's even more. That being said, some of the special effects are a bit fake and look poor. <br /> <br /> With an alleged budget of around $ 100,000, this is a rather inexpensive aspect, with no visual style or artistic merit, but then again because you would like those when you can see a sequence of Nazi orgies and blood from wall to wall? The acting in this is terrible, including Fulci. <br /> <br /> A Cat in the Brain is an exceptional film if you are a blood hunter like me, but if you are looking for something with a little more substance or substance then this is not for you. This is the kind of film that divides people directly in the middle, or you will love what they do or hate.
