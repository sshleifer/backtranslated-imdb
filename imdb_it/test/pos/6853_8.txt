(spoiler?) <br /> <br /> I've heard some complaints about special effects. But this should detract from the film. The film is a suspense film. And he's very good at it. So, from that point of view, this film breaks. Franke digs. Enjoy the plastic content of your heart. So no complaints about this movie. Unless you look at the English dubbing, which is a total farce. Create the illusion that it is a movie B. <br /> <br /> One complaint I have is the music video on the DVD. He does not say who sings it. I'd like to know it. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 5/10
