The ambitious young nurse, Mrs. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik), is sent to work in an asylum in the middle of nowhere. Over the course of 3 days, she encounters strange events, even a patient in her bedroom who looks at her, yet she still remains. Mental patients all have a small rotating eye (especially from the judge), but my favorite was the old fool (Rhea MacAdams). The plot is fine, and the acting is surprisingly good, but after a while it will be a little too much. But, anyway, it's fun, weird, weird and original. <br /> <br /> Note: The thing inside the basement is barely horrible, so the title is a little banana.
