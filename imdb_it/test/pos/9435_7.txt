Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) were hired by the British government to protect a Swiss scientist Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately the evil Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) is working with the Nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor - and his invention. <br /> <br /> Moving Sherlock Holmes in the 1940s seemed a stupid idea but it works for a reason - Basil Rathbone. It's probably the BEST Sherlock Holmes ever put on the screen. He plays the character so well (and with precision) that it doesn't matter in which era he is solving the crimes. As for Nigel Bruce as Watson ... everyone has problems with it. Sounds Watson like a crazy old bumble ... NOT the Watson of books. You're seriously wondering why Holmes bears it. And yet, it grows on you (in a sense). Then there's Atwill dancing to Moriarty - the discussions and the battle of intelligence between him and Holmes are simply great! I never liked Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade - he's such an idiot. It makes Watson look like a genius. And Post Jr. is as good as Tobel (although his accent changes in a fun way!). <br /> <br /> This film is elaborately designed and lasts just over an hour. However, it has its slow points and I never understood the secret code section. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth catching if only for Rathbone and Atwill.
