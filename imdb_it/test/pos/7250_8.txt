Plunkett and Macleane are a fun, fast-paced and refreshing movie. Refreshing because, unlike many other vintage films, it does not try to give the audience a lesson in history or to preach pompously, indeed, historical accuracy is almost ignored. This film does not take itself too seriously and tries to entertain rather than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane are set in the 18th century, yet director Jake Scott offers a complete revival of the 90s. There is action, sex and oath in abundance, and in the inevitable scene of the ball the aristocracy dances in the disco. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are brilliant as ever, and even the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a passionate flirt, are also very funny. The film is visually spectacular in places, and is a mixture of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by Liv Tyler with a wobbly English accent. In short, if you're looking for a couple of hours of fun, this is the movie for you. It won't make you think, but it could very well make you smile.
