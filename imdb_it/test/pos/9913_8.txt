Kirk and the crew are visiting a federation mining colony on a remote planet rich in mineral resources. The Devil in the Dark is the Horta, a very unusual form of silicon that runs through solid rock. The Horta has killed the miners and, it is decided, must be destroyed. But how? <br /> <br /> It is difficult to continue this review without writing a spoiler, so I will simply focus on the technical aspects of the episode and its themes. The special effects are OK, but many scenes with the Horta seem a little absurd. Acting is fairly average for TOS. Some miners are a little uncomfortable. Nimoy has the most difficult role of all in Devil in the Dark, and he pulls it off well. <br /> <br /> Why is this still my favorite? <br /> <br /> Devil in the Dark is truly an anthropological and ecological game of morality masked by an adventure. More than many episodes of this great television series, it brings home the importance of keeping an open mind and at least a certain degree of empathy towards others. Moreover, it involves one of the most interesting, if not probable, twists of the original series. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
