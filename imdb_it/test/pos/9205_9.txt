I read the comments on Las Vegas and I agree with some of them, it's not TV for brain surgery, but again I got the impression that TV was mainly for escape, especially with what's going on in the today's world. Let's face it, a show on Las Vegas (which is not a reality-based program) is not based on a reality-based show because for me Vegas is pure fantasy! It's the kind of place where we can go and practically do what we want when we want (subject of course to funds!). <br /> <br /> So the fact that Las Vegas is cute, sexy and full of clicks with characters that reflect everything seems to be about money in my eyes. If you don't like it, don't look at it, the one for which we have a million channels! <br /> <br /> We are coming to the third episode here in the UK and I know that I will be doing a beeline to watch it again. I just hope it's not canceled, something that seems to happen a lot with most of the shows that come to the UK that are decent media! (Firefly and Jake 2.0 anyone? !!). <br /> <br /> It's harmless, fun-looking, and every time I look at it, I want to get back to reality :)
