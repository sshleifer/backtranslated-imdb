True, we have a 2008 movie with the themes "Brief Encounter" and "The Bridges of Madison County". It is basically the story of lost loves, redemption and triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> The performances of Richard Gere and in particular of Diane Lane are very good. Gere gives the kind of sober show here as a doctor who is looking for meaning after a patient dies on the operating table. Lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a handsome son, who separated from her wandering husband and also suffered the loss of her father in the same year. Scott Glenn steals the show in a scene meeting with Gere. He is the broken husband and tells his love to his dead wife, he will bring tears to your eyes. <br /> <br /> Fresh from his triumph as an acquiescent mother in "Doubt", Viola Davis appears as an understanding friend in the film and literally locks his hair in a rather benign performance.
