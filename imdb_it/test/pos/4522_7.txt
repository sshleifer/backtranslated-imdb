Chan is in New York and is involved in an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design. <br /> <br /> The war lasted more than a year from reaching America, but World War II was already underway around the world and so it colored everything since most people probably understood that the war was coming. Here the war is not mentioned but the fact that the film has to do with the production of airplanes is alluded to at least. The mystery itself is good enough, the notion of aerial sabotage lends itself nicely to a couple of rather tense moments. To be sure we talk about Charlie Chan, so we can be sure that he would live to fight another day, but there was no guarantee as to what condition he would be in, nor if anyone around him would survive. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. It is not one of the nest, and far from the worst. It's one of the really rare things, really enjoyable. Definitely worth a look or are you.
