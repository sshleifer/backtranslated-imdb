This solid slapstick comedy in black and white with a dark (but hopelessly forced) plot is a real pleasure for the crowd that will make you scream with laughter (as well as rolling your eyes in disbelief). <br /> <br /> He is the old psychopath on a train story but that does not have great importance as the thriller part of the film almost seems to be just a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson. His unfortunate soldier, almost incurably optimistic, invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a way that almost rivals Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> The thing about the film that attracted me most, however, is that wedged between the unlikely and the hilarious are the everyday joys portrayed with precision and the hassles of the train journey. They add a very positive sense of realism and recognition. <br /> <br /> This comedy thriller has certainly borrowed much of its "suspense" from Hitchcock and should, in my opinion, only be looked at for its comic value (which is really high). In addition to Gustafsson, the solid performance of Lars Amble as a deliciously cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended.
