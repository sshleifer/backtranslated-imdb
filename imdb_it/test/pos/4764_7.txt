I don't really like "cops" movies, but this is presumably a classic and when I found it cheap I bought it and stuck it on a shelf, only to finally be able to watch it yesterday, and I liked it ! Now you can have New York City, but as a setting for a film like this, it's perfect in the winter months. Roy Scheider is a member of an elite working group called The Seven Ups, which are 5 boys who fight crime under cover. In an opening scene, they retrieve a shoebox full of money from an antique store, distracting the scammers with a "bull shop in a porcelain shop" routine. But this is only the beginning. There seem to be two guys pretending to be cops who kidnap mobs and keep them for ransom. Richard Lynch seems to be one of these sleaze-bags, and it's as disturbing as ever. When one of the Seven Ups, who poses as a limousine driver at a funeral, blows up the cover, gets beaten and stuffed into the trunk of a car, which then leads to one of the most exciting car chases I've seen . Incredible though, how light traffic in New York is for chase scenes, but still it's rather surprising when Scheider follows the two kidnappers through what I imagine is the Bronx and then on a highway and then, eventually, Scheider's car abruptly stops in one of the most touching finals of a chase scene I've ever witnessed. However, since the policeman ends up dying, Scheider and his men are suspected because the police commissioner knows so little about their activities that he wonders if they are about to kidnap the mobsters, so obviously this kind of thinking needs to be cut off on the born and Scheider is unstoppable getting to the bottom of things. Overall a decent cop of action / drama, it's not really my thing but I liked this one. Look for Joe Spinell (Maniac) in a small role. 7 out of 10.
