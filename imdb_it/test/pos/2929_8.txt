This was another great episode of season 11 of South Park. <br /> <br /> Cartman pretends to have Tourette syndrome to be able to say what he wants without getting into trouble. He is able to swear to other children at school. Kyle tells the principal that Cartman is faking it. But she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning to have Cartman on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to be so dependent on being able to say what he wants, that he later starts accidentally saying embarrassing things. This was a funny episode about Cartman that simulates Tourette's syndrome. I recommend it to all South Park fans.
