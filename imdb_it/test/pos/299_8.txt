It's that movie that a lot of people say goodbye to as a classic: Apocalypse Now, now a review, re-up, Redux 22 years from its original version. <br /> <br /> The film is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, it's the main plot (if it has one) of being Captain Willard's journey on a navy boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to end a rebel colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and the situations he encounters, and he tells the story of the Colonel along the way. <br /> <br /> My initial feelings about the film are that sometimes it's not particularly compelling, especially at the beginning but at least a good deal of comedy is inserted, in the form of surf fanatic Col. Kilgore. As the film progresses, however, a good deal of tension builds up with Willard's reading through various accounts of Col. Kurtz until the end of the scene, when everything is approaching and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and keeps it there until the end. <br /> <br /> The usual aspects that everyone is looking for in a decent movie are all of a good standard. Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional, and I found performances by Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all worthy of a special mention. The score I found initially seemed out of place, but as the movie progressed ... I'm not entirely sure if it actually improved, or it adapted better, or if it just grew up with me, but in the end I really liked the film . <br /> <br /> This is the second time I've seen the version of Redux, (I've seen the original about four times) I'll say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed. I was expecting a "classic" film, with lots of war. The fact that Willard got the mission early in the film and didn't carry it through to the end bored me because all the interactions between characters on the way the film is seemingly useless. This is due to the fact that the plot is not completely defined (since the focus is more on the character and on the journey than on the plot), in most cases a second vision is needed to fully appreciate the film (as with everyone movies that are more character than plot based), like the second time, you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> With the four great films of Vietnam, Apocalypse Now wins the rest on the atmosphere, but the action and involvement of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, is missing and cannot be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favorite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great job, especially towards the end, where it becomes disconcerting, and must be recommended to anyone who appreciates a good character-based film and doesn't care about random violence.
