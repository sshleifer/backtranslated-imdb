Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most imaginative (and most amusing) of all silent film comedians. Why is it completely forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when the Fox warehouse was burned in the early 1930s. Hamilton was not as handsome or gracious as Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; nor was he dapper, like Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton didn't feel the sympathy of the public. <br /> <br /> However, his films were extremely popular at the time of their original version, and today remain hilarious. Oscar Levant once claimed to have asked Chaplin if there was another comedian he had ever envied, and Chaplin immediately appointed Lloyd Hamilton. The character most frequently played by Hamilton on the screen - a naff flat-capped, with annoying hand gestures and a duck-like walk - was later adapted by vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Teri Garr's father), and further adapted by Jackie Gleason as his' 50s television personality 'The Poor Soul'. <br /> <br /> 'The Movies', directed by the pseudonym of Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of Hamilton's most innovative short films, and is exhilarating. We see him for the first time as a country boy, who greets his family outside their home in search of a house on the way to the big city. Then he walks away from the cottage, and we see that he is in the big city, with the traffic booming all around! <br /> <br /> In the end, our hero ends up in a restaurant (uncredited, but it's the Caf√© Montmartre in downtown LA) where all the film actors eat between the takes. There is a funny gag when Hamilton's bumpkin character meets three costumed and trick actors like Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: this gag would have been more fun if the impostors looked more like the originals. In the end, our boy sits at a table, hoping to meet a celebrity. Sure enough, entering the restaurant and sitting at the next table is a great movie star ... no less than Lloyd Hamilton! There is a double exposure very well done - the join is almost invisible - when Lloyd Hamilton as himself greets Lloyd Hamilton as the country boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hamilton's period of maximum creativity was very short. He began his film career in crude slapstick films as a half of a double act (Ham and Bud, alongside Bud Duncan), and had a brief and dazzling celebrity period in shorts during the late period of silence. The sound films were not kind to Hamilton, and he was quickly pushed down the cast list in some rough talkies. Then he died young. Fortunately, "The Movies" is quite fun and a wonderful introduction to the style of this singular comedian. I will evaluate 7 out of 10.
