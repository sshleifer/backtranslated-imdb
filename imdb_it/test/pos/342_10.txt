I am a great follower of Indian films, particularly Malayalam and Tamil. <br /> <br /> Shame on India for not sending this film as their official Oscar entry. I saw this film and it clearly revealed to me the maturity that Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative that Bollywood is able to better understand. As for all of us Westerners, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good-looking glamor and promotion. <br /> <br /> Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a film like "Devdas" to the Oscars? It was a masochistic move. I think they're trying to punish the Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges dropped Lagaan last year. <br /> <br /> 'Devdas' is just a melodrama of Love, destiny and destiny. I would stay away from it. However, not sending a film like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a renewal of the Indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who have no intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many problems. They are very talented but are not shown correctly.
