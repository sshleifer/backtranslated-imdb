I agree with all the strengths mentioned in the other reviews, but there are some missing rhythms that firmly maintain the kind of dramatic crime or film noir and limit it to being a great drama beyond the limits of the "elements" that make up film noir - not to say that the great film noirs are not / cannot / should not be great dramas too, but this is not. <br /> <br /> Another note the music in the film is used sparingly, but I would say that it is used to accentuate the action more frequently than the elements of the wife. <br /> <br /> Great set up for this film, by the way, with an abrupt end without end that is either just the right or a disappointment depends. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow some details. <br /> <br /> The great change in history involves children who see their mother die, or should be the big moment. But children have never shown that they react in one way or another. Neither he cries, nor asks his father what happened, the boys are good actors and the reactions of the father are I suppose what matters, but this is a big misstep. This is the heart of the story and the boys were mostly white in their reaction. They really don't, in the next scene they seem like nothing happened. <br /> <br /> Similarly, there is a bond that forms between the characters of Belmondo and Ventura. Belmondo says he knows the partner who was killed - but this is never explained and has no dramatic impact on Belmondo or anyone else. Even the romantic subplot of Belmondo puts a strain on its credibility although it is convincingly interpreted. The character of Ventura simply lets Belmondo involve a total stranger in their escape plan for no reason. He doesn't comment or even seems to notice. Another gap. <br /> <br /> The end of the film, and I won't ruin it, the ending comes off the screen with a sharp voice over it to tell you what happened. I guess this tries to make it seem more true for life, but again like these other missteps they leave the drama off the screen. <br /> <br /> What is the point of not dealing with these problems? I don't know, except maybe the film's goals were limited to giving the audience what they wanted from a melodramatic crime - suggesting some deeper elements, then moving on to ignoring them. <br /> <br /> bad there is a lot to recommend this film, Ventura is very good, but a shame that it could have been a great drama and a crime story - like in IMDb's favorite movie of all time THE GODFATHER . This film had potential. It would be a good remake if it were done in the United States, other problems probably sank the film, but in the right director's hands it would be a good remake, although it is doubtful that Ventura's performance could be overcome. <br /> <br /> So it's worth seeing but frustrating as a whole
