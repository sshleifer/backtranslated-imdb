In a sentence, moral ambiguity. In the Soderbergh remake, there are good guys and bad guys. The character of Benicio del Toro is clearly the good boy, morally clean and incorruptible. His counterpart of the BBC original, Fazal, the peasant turned merchant, is realistically imperfect and in conflict about his fate. The two relentless cops are similarly different. In the American one, they conquer our hearts. In the original BBC, they are too zealous, almost obsessive. <br /> <br /> The best time for me in Soderbergh was when the university student rhetorically asked the drug Tsar: "What would you do if you were poor and black and rich whites came to your neighborhood for drugs? "That point was insinuated during the BBC show and crystallized in Jack Lithgow's final speech. Both are excellent, but the BBC dominates the remake. My conclusion after seeing both shows is that traders are innocent pawns who are only asking a question, and it is the question that causes so much suffering.
