I heard about this series in 2001 that a friend of mine recorded every week on the TV. I never bothered to look, even though I knew the series through the magazine that I occasionally looked at in bookstores. I recently purchased the series one on DVD and became addicted to this fascinating and original series. The characters seem initially unlikely but it's amazing how fast they grow and develop into a united force. When they start taking care of each other it becomes easy to take care of what happens to them (bearing in mind that it is only a TV series and they are fictitious). <br /> <br /> However it is not the PC world of Star Trek and so while each character shows a good trait each of them has their own flaws and demons they have to face. The stories of individual stories mixed with a multi-voice narrative arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. I absolutely love to observe that each of the characters interacts with each other. <br /> <br /> This strange new world to which we have been presented is brilliantly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut John Crichton and as he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy, strange alien creatures, different cultures , hunted by a character who wants him dead and treated as inferior by his companions, we can easily connect to what he must try. As he gets used to his surroundings, even the spectators and his compassionate, strong-willed and courageous character are a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> I've only seen seven episodes of the Farscape season and I'm looking forward to continuing through the two-four seasons and the mini-series. Maybe one day we can all enjoy a fifth season. Highly recommended vision and worth setting aside time to watch. Buy and have fun! 10/10.
