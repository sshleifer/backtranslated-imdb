Another fun Warner movie. I really enjoyed John Garfield in this, although I wonder why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story, but I really appreciated them here and this movie had a lot of nice comic touches along with good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole "swimming" scene that starts without worries, but ends up getting too close to disaster. <br /> <br /> A negative comment: Claude Rains has been grossly misguided. As a detective, the good actor seemed out of place here like a nun in a brothel.
