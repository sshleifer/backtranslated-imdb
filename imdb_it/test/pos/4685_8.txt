A few years ago I saw for the first time this remake of the classic of the sixties with the Mini Coopers and I remember that I liked it very much. Now, about two years later, it was shown on television and I just wanted to know if I would have liked it so much as when I saw it in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> The film is about a team of robbers who will do one last job in Venice, Italy. The plan is impeccable and perfect execution. They flee and will not have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is a problem that they have not taken into consideration: someone in their ranks does not like to share the loot, but wants to keep it all to himself, even when this means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one survive and are ready for revenge. A year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a clever and sneaky plan to steal gold and get their revenge on the traitor ... <br /> <br /> The story about itself is obviously not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has a lot of goodies to offer to make you forget. This is a typical action / action movie, but it is certainly one of the best of its kind. The action is very beautiful, the landscapes and Venice are real treats for the eyes, the story is OK and the special effects are amazing. Even acting is very good, something you won't see often in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and gave this film a well-deserved 7.5 / 10.
