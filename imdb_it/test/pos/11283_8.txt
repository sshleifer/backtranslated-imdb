There have been many attempts (well over a few in any case) over the past 30 years to create films with an "otherworldly" appearance. Assuming this is the director's desire to distance himself from other films, or simply to fly over the low-budget and shabby aspect, "Begotten" ranks first in this stack. <br /> <br /> Apart from the unparalleled "Eraserhead", however. <br /> <br /> Merhige's careful process of artificially degrading his film completely changes his structure (imagine what this glorious Technicolor standard film would have been like) - It can almost be imagined as an artifact of another unknown culture. Some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen, especially when they are dislocated. This is not the disorder of "Last House On The Left", more like the leave-your-cave-for-the-first-time-and-see-the-sun. <br /> <br /> Watch this Fever-Dream if you get the chance, and savor it. Remember, every day they make other more standard films. They can wait.
