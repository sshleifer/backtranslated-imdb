If you are looking for a kung-fu action movie, look elsewhere. While there are fighting scenes, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist, who struggles to find his way in Americanized Canton. Unlike most "kung-fu" comedies, action scenes are used to reinforce comedy instead of the opposite. <br /> <br /> Cheung Booi is a statement about the farcical nature of kung-fu films, where stars always seem to find a reason to fight. Instead of some great drama about honor and respect, slight misunderstandings cause the characters to shout at each other and start beating each other. <br /> <br /> My Young Auntie, as it is known in the West, is the story of Cheng Tai-nun, played by Kara Hui, a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to prevent her properties from falling into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother. After his death, he moved to Canton to live with his nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and his son Ah Tao, played by Hsiao Ho. <br /> <br /> The basis of irony is that even though Cheng is the same age as Ah Tao, his way is more like his great-great-aunt status. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely badly), plays the guitar and goes to costume parties, Cheng completely fails when he tries to adapt to his Canton lifestyle, complete with makeup, revealing clothes, high heels and dance scenes. <br /> <br /> What makes this film exceptional is its realization. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest director of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui won "Best Actress" at the first Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. Also, this is probably the best performance of Hsiao Ho. His chemistry with Hui is remarkable, and although he continued a legendary career in kung-fu comedies, often working alongside Sammo Hung, he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy. While the romantic tension and the intrigue are built in the second part of the film, its entire appearance changes. He does not easily make life without a cure in the world. Become the straight man and his cohorts Kramer, Elaine and George. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that suddenly the comic aspects of the film go out during the conclusion. The film moves from absolute farce to a dramatic plot with little, but a change in incidental music. But there is a certain symmetry in it. The film begins focused on the intrigue, centered more on the character of Lau Kar Leung, and ends in this way too. But the final scene returns to the film's comic roots, concluding both aspects of the film.
