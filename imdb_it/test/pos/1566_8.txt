Six people out of seven who have had time to comment on this film have very positive responses. The only negative review resides (or did) on the first page of the movie's location on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I found "What Alice Found" as one of the best films almost none of which I heard of that I saw this year. The evaluation of 6.4 is misleading and could be more a function of the difficult subject than the quality of the film. Who would think it's worth watching a movie about the alleged dismemberment of prostitution? Guess again. <br /> <br /> For me, "Alice" was a very compelling psychological thriller. I was practically on the edge of my seat all the time. It's a very credible story with a realistic script and it's very well done. In a fairer world, actress Judith Ivey would win prizes for matching you if it was good or bad. <br /> <br /> Ignore the evaluation and watch this fantastic movie. (And by the way, I wish there was a soundtrack album.)
