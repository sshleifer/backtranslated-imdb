This is not a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is the abbreviation for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means "Penal Batallion". These battalions were formed due to the growing demand for soldiers, as the Soviet Union was suffering heavy losses throughout the war. These battalions consisted of dishonest inmates and soldiers who had the opportunity to cancel their names by proving themselves in combat. They were looked down upon as scum and were easily spent during combat without much regret, or much honor, by the military. They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme losses. Those who refused to fight were executed on sight. Needless to say, their lives have been sucked. <br /> <br /> There were some very nice performances by the cast, especially Yuri Stepanov who played Antip, Aleksandr Bashirov who played Stirah and Roman Madyanov who played Major Kharchenko. However the series is not so compelling, partly because it is too long, it could be much shorter and more effective. <br /> <br /> Despite being a war, Shtrafbat has a very bland and practically no Gore violence. It relies solely on the actors to make it work and, after all, it's a TV series, so the producers didn't want to scare the spectators and sponsors. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the Soviet regime, and explains why so many men have chosen to fight the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally I would prefer to be a fascist and then a communist, given the circumstances presented in the film. One character explains that the Soviets stripped his farm and his family died of starvation. In anger he burned everything that arrested him for destroying Kolhoz's property and ended up in the battlefield as a criminal. Antip reminisced how his mother killed his youngest son to feed the rest of the family. Both men explained that they fought for their motherland rather than for the Soviets. <br /> <br /> The penal battalion had a Marine (Naval Infantry) who raped a girl, killing her partner in the prosess, threatened her other partner to keep her mouth shut for both tests, and then faked injury when it came to fighting. Furthermore, the girl committed suicide due to shame. I imagine that if enough Marines were watching this film they would have picked up banners and riots in the streets asking for a boycott or an official apology from the producers. <br /> <br /> To say the least, I would recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former Soviet Union or World War II. I don't think I've wasted over 500 minutes of my life.
