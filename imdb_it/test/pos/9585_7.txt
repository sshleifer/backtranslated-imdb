"All Abir-r-r-d" by Friz Freleng is one of the best cartoons of Sylvester and Tweety. Unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series that simply transplant the same tired gags into a new scenario, "All Abir-r-r-d" takes full advantage of its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are pets that are sent unattended across the country by train. With both a watchful officer and an evil bulldog to deal with, Sylvester has his work cut out. The Sylvester and Tweety comics have always benefited from some extra participants and "All Abir-r-r-d" is a good example of how these additional characters can help. Even if they are not particularly memorable creations, they throw other obstacles in the path of Sylvester and create a more interesting battle. These early Sylvester and Tweety press many of the right buttons and, while Tweety is often particularly irritating with his forced cuteness, there are some delightfully violent antics between Sylvester and the dog, culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax unfortunately disfigured by a last non Tweety quip.
