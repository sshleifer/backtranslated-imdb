I can't say this movie was hilarious, but I must have had a smile on my face all the time. I like this kind of darker comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in a bag" or "coldblooded" <br /> <br /> The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. For me, the ending was not a surprise, but the way that final was born was. Another thing that stands out is the way they managed to engage the public. The way Terry looks at us is fun, you can almost pretend to be his accomplice.
