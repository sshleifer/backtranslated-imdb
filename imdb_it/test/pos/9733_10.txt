First of all, I Hate Sci Fi Stuff, and although this film has some Sci Fi at times, that's fine, because at least it focuses on Andre Toulon. In the last 3, Andre seemed to have been mentioned, but the stories never focused on him, which drove me crazy. What drives me crazy is also the amount of 0 he got in the ranking of the votes. Give him some people. If you've seen this movie and enjoyed it, please vote. Please. What I love about this movie is that it's back to where it all started. When Andre first learned the secret of life. I would recommend renting this if you've already seen a Puppet Master movie and you liked it. But don't rent it if this is your first time watching one from the PM Collection, especially since you might think that all puppeteers are "boring" like this.
