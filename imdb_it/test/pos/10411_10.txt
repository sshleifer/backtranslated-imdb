One of the reasons they call the 80s, "The Awesome 80's" is quality television. Shows like Wonder Years, War of the Worlds (the series), V, Amazing Stories and many others have always left an impression on each of us "lucky" that over time he will always find a way to wake up. Moreover, here come the monsters! A completely unique series and a theme entirely dedicated to - monsters. Let it be good, bad and morbid. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of classic shows or if you have the charm of horror movies then this is absolutely for you. Provided you can find this rare gem. <br /> <br /> Even the new generations will be in awe with part of the episode with its grit, the indiscriminate use of gore effects or its story that tells of power and simplicity. I guarantee, because I am 23 years old. <br /> <br /> Make sure you don't miss this! <br /> <br /> Even if it is a show apparently forgotten by the modern world, it will always be with those who can always remember ...
