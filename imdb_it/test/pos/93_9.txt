A boy who adores Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens receives, to his horror, a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater by mail. I saw him recently in a class where few students were interested in hockey, but almost everyone knew Maurice Richard and the rivalry between Toronto and Montreal. Very funny, fun and precise.
