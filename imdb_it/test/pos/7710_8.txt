The detective story is not typical of the Matrix Universe. It is a film-noir private eye story, with a strong narrator and a very rich feeling. Rich in terms of visual appeal. The snow scenes, the grain, do nothing but amaze. <br /> <br /> But what about the story? It's interesting, even if it seems a little out of place. The agents hire a private detective to track down Trinity. He discovers he has tried the approach before, but with dangerous consequences for hired investigators. However, he tries to localize it and eventually succeeds, through Alice in Wonderland, with references and hackers and chat rooms. Then things start to be interesting ... <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a perfectly satisfying short film of animation. <br /> <br /> 8/10
