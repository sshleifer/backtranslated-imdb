When I first saw the Farscape Premiere episode, I had no idea what to expect. I was immensely impressed and satisfied by "Premiere". Subsequent re-watches, however, pointed out to me numerous defects that I initially missed. "Premiere" is not a great episode of Farscape, but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and for giving the basic secondary stories to many of the normal characters. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with John Crichton (Ben Browder), astronaut and scientist, preparing to launch into space in the Farscape Module, a small spaceship perfected by Crichton and his friend DK. Crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, Jack Crichton, and then begins his test flight in space. Of course, everything goes wrong and Crichton is "shot through a wormhole" and ends up in "a distant part of the galaxy". <br /> <br /> After exiting the wormhole, Crichton's module is pulled aboard a ship's living space. From here, the characters and the plot of the Farscape series are introduced in a fun way, even if hasty. <br /> <br /> Normal characters are introduced correctly during the first half of the episode. Sure, there's Crichton, played well by Ben Browder. It offers the public a nice character to identify with. He is lost and has no idea how to do much. In "Premiere", Crichton must choose between joining the prisoners or the Peacekeepers. He knows nothing about either side, but by helping Aeryn (a pilot caught in Peacekeeper) it becomes clear that he intends to help the Peacekeepers. He probably wouldn't end up siding with the prisoners if it wasn't for Crais, a Peacekeeper captain, stating that Crichton would be his brother's killer. This puts Crichton in an interesting situation: it is blocked by bizarre and violent prisoners who have fled to a distant galaxy on which they know nothing. The total lack of knowledge of Crichton in the world of Farsape makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during the first season of Farscape. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is just as compelling. There is Zhaan, a blue Delvian and a former prisoner. It is peaceful and reasonable, unlike fellow prisoner Ka D'Argo, a powerful and hard-headed warrior. Virginia Hey is completely covered in blue make-up, allowing her Zhaan character to look fresh and convincing. D'Argo's mega-trick, on the other hand, is under-par. He looks a bit silly with his giant tentacles and his strange nose, and there's something strange in his eyes. They seem to have some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup. Farscape would have made some improvements to its makeup in Season 1, but the costume in general would be, at least for me, a problem until Season 2. <br /> <br /> Rygel and Pilot's puppet / digital characters are, for to put it simply, excellent. Rygel is a small Dominion Hynerian floating on a kind of hovercraft. In "Premiere" a good dialogue is given but not much else. The pilot almost steals the show as the link between the living ship, Moya and Moya's passengers. Even in the first episode, Pilot gives the impression of being a true living alien; never once in the show seems to be a giant and expensive car. <br /> <br /> Even the Peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting. Peacekeepers are composed of a race called Sebaceans, which resembles humans. The main antagonist is presented in "Premiere" as Captian Crais, who believes that Crichton killed his brother. In fact, the death of Crais's brother was only an accident resulting from an accidental collision with Crichton's ship. Aeryn Sun, a pilot whom Crichton helps escape, tries to explain that death was an accident, but Crais claims to be "irreversible contaminated" and refused to change his mind. Crais's obsession with revenge, justified or not (it should be clear to Crais that Crichton is not responsible), is mysterious in "Premiere", but would be explained later in the season. Aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character. Being forced to leave the Peacekeepers, she changes her whole way of life, and it is in this regard in a similar (though less serious) situation like Crichton. <br /> <br /> The current episode, as mentioned above, feels a bit hasty and clumsy. It happens so much that you don't spend enough time on anything. Moreover, D'Argo (for now) seems foolish to run around in his mediocre costume trying to look threatening. Still, "Premiere" is solid entertainment. The special effects (as in the Starburst sequences) are impressive. Most of Moya's costumes and sets are original. Despite its flaws, "Premiere" is a must for Farscape fans. 3/4
