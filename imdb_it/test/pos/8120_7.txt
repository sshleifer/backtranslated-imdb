It was a fun movie to watch. Although the possibility of this happening in your street is small, there are still many recognizable situations that will ring a bell. The simplicity of the film and the humor work. I must admit that you don't have to see it in a theater; will do very well on a small TV. Tip: watch it with some close friends.
