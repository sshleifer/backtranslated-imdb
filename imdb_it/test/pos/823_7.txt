I like the shepherd! Of course, the acting wasn't good, but the fighting scenes were beautiful. Van Damme throws some nice kicks and so does Adkins. The story was average. A Texas policeman fights smugglers. This film has done everything a film should do, which is martial arts and action. Van Damme has never been a good actor. I think this film is better than van dammmes' last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar-winning performance, you won't get it here, but if you're looking for action and martial arts, then this movie is for you. Scott Adkins is a fantastic martial artist and unfortunately the public got tired of martial arts superstars but his films in this film are fantastic. Van Damme offers strong kicks and it's good to see him again in the martial arts as he has never seen in his last 4 or 5 movies. This film certainly deserves to be seen if you are a huge fan.
