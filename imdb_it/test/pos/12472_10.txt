Greystoke is without doubt the best tarzan film I've ever seen. Christopher Lambert plays a very credible man who tries to return to the world of humanity alongside the fantastic Ian Holm. John's struggle to leave the jungle and the monkeys that raised him is quite moving. Some memorable scenes, including those in which Lambert makes jungle noises to romantic interest, and the scene in which he witnesses the death of his monkey father. Tarzan's feelings for both worlds are well developed and really make you feel for him. <br /> <br /> An excellent and undervalued film.
