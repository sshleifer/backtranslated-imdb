Improvisation has been used in a revolutionary way in this film, but it only works as a novelty. No greater truth about the situation is obtained by asking the actors to improvise. Performances are not improved by improvisation, because actors now have double to worry about: not only if they are giving good results to the line, but if the line itself is useful. That's why performances in many of Robert Altman's films are often really indecent, because the actors are not very confident in saying the lines they invented, so I'm not sure they are good. <br /> <br /> And honestly, it's often not very good. Often dialogue does not follow from one line to another, nor does it adapt to the surrounding environment. <br /> <br /> It collapses with unpredictable and youthful energy - but honestly, I found it difficult to follow and concentrate on it. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, a fascinating raw piece of film, and 100% commendable for taking power over green light in the street. <br /> <br /> There are some generally great things inside. This joke, for example: <br /> <br /> I am a dancer. What kind of dancer, like a dancer? Oh no ... exotic. <br /> <br /> And the whole party is on stage, the following trip to the park, and the scene where the boys go to look at the statues. <br /> <br /> 2 / 5. I wouldn't say it's worth 2 hours of your time, though.
