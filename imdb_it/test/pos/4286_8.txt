Years ago, when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was stunned that most of the young people I had contact with didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and an experience. I experienced some déjà vu by reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Completely enjoying Separate Lies is definitely a matter of age and experience. <br /> <br /> In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy average married couple - he a successful lawyer - he is the perfect wife of a successful lawyer. They have a house in London and a house in the country. Everything is fine until the "bad guy" enters the guise of the son of the richest man in the village. This guy seems to be a cad from the word "Go". He is disdainful towards everyone and everything, including his own children. In the traditional form of good guys who end up last, the lawyer's wife engages in a relationship with the border. See that the lawyer is really a good guy, but with the marriage of marriage that kills an organized perfectionist. Even if he really loves her, he is boring his wife to death. The bad boy is much more exciting. <br /> <br /> All this is entangled in the death of a man in the village where all the facts indicate that the cad is the driver of the vehicle. <br /> <br /> It is easy to determine that this film has no happy ending, however, it leads to a very satisfying ending as the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and will probably be able to lead their personal lives more effectively. <br /> <br /> Three excellent actors play the main characters of this film, and that's where the performances make it all a pleasure to watch. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as a husband. His performance shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost contact with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman who has become so trapped in the role of perfect wife that she almost lost her knowledge of passion. That passion is reborn from the character cleverly played by Rupert Everett. <br /> <br /> If you have reached that point in life where you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone - even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunity - makes many bad decisions, then you will probably like to watch these excellent actors who create the lives of three similar people. This is a beautifully performed adult film directed at realistic adults.
