when i was a child this was the movie i was watching. I think it's a great movie for children to watch and parents shouldn't be afraid of violence or obscene images. rainbow brite is a cheerful girl and is trying to make winter go away. she discovers that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it to herself. I love this movie and I think adults can enjoy this movie too.
