As many other reviewers seem to agree, this adaptation of "After The Funeral" is really very good. Always one of my favorite Poirot stories I was worried that it might be "messed up". Well, it was a little bit but just a little bit and in the end the result was a lot of fun. David Suchet continues to be perfectly flawless as Poirot and (as others have pointed out) the other protagonist of this show is Monica Dolan who certainly could not be improved as Miss Gilchrist. I also loved Fiona Glasscott, who was perfect for Rosamund Shane's cut, but in reality the casting was absolutely flawless! <br /> <br /> A point is eliminated because the adapters cannot withstand too many revelations in the last fifteen minutes. The business with domestic wills and actions was a bit pointless even if I didn't care how they reinforced the Abernethie family structure (in the book the family tree is really quite complicated). The last moments in which the killer is revealed, however, are really incredibly well done and I found the end, when everyone leaves Enderby, very moving. This is really one of the best in the Poirot series so far.
