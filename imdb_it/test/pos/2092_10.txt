To be completely honest, I didn't expect much to get into 9 Souls even after reading a lot of praise about it, but to say that I was surprised would be an understatement, in short I was totally blown away. > <br /> The basic plot is as simple as they are, nine prison inmates who go from a drug dealer to the escape of many murderers from prison and go in search of a secret escort that is supposed to be counterfeit money hidden by a tenth inmate which broke and was dragged away by the guards shortly before their escape but it is the direction that the director Toshiaki Toyoda takes in this simple story so brilliant and original that perfectly blends drama, comedy and violence creating a truly unique film that deserves to be seen not only fans of Asian cinema but of cinema in general. <br /> <br /> Superbly performed, emotional, funny, violent and sometimes very surreal this is a film that has it all.
