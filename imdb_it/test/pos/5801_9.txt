This was fine. It was one of those we got, but we don't have enough evidence. Still plots. In the movie pairs I saw, I never had much of Stephanie Zimbalist. A professional TV actress, but it's nothing exceptional. Here in this he was definitely above average like the previous powered profiler (or was he fed on loan?). His character got along with the diverse group of policemen from the Special Investigation Unit to which he was assigned. There was not a foolish character in which you turned your eyes and despised only what was good. Also, it takes some time to know who the killer is ... but when I found out I wasn't so surprised. Oh good. Another thing that was good was the location of Los Angeles. Most likely if it had been done today, they would use Toronto or Vancouver, but they really did shoot in downtown Los Angeles. I like it a lot (even if I have a semi-direct L.A.) I also liked the film. I don't know if I would ever look at it again, but it wasn't bad. My vote: B-
