PUBLIC ENEMIES is a sort of return to the biographies of the 60s gangsters as PORTRAIT OF A MOBSTER, MAD DOG COLL and KING OF THE ROARING TWENTIES. Although made inexpensively, the film has a great deal of energy and the overall acting, in particular Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone, is quite good. Theresa Russell may seem too charming as Ma, but she has some very nice moments. There are two action scenes worth noting: a gunfight in a hotel and a machine gun in the middle of the road between the Barkers and the FBI. Both sequences are well done, and compared to other gangster junk like DILLINGER AND CAPONE, this film shines.
