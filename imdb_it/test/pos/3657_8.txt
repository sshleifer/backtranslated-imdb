Hari Om talks about an impossible love between a French tourist and the auto-rickshaw driver who agrees to take her on a date with his indifferent boyfriend. A sort of third world road movie, ranging from lust to crazy comedy, stands out for the stellar performance of Vijay Raaz, who became one of the most Indian actors after his appearance as event organizer in the Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding movie . <br /> <br /> In an interview, Raaz shows that he was not touched by his success, answering the questions carefully and thoughtfully. He discovered his love of acting and joined a large theater company while at university, but for one with so much formal education he is surprisingly inarticulate about his art. He speaks of honesty and purity as sources of his approach, and the seriousness of his desire to communicate something authentic to the public is clear. On the screen, Raaz transmits an emotional integrity and a dramatic security that elevate his characterization to an extraordinary level, and the director Bharatbala has chosen and directed him perfectly. It has a wonderfully expressive face that the camera has in itself; the close-ups of that face are irresistible like those of Camille Natta, who is as beautiful as the French Isa.
