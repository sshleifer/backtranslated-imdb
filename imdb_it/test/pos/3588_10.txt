This series has a lot to offer with beautiful shots of some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in decision-making, it would be difficult to expect less. I had the impression that some scenes from the first episode were repeated in the latter, which is of course only a small inconvenience. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough is fantastic as a storyteller and the comments are informative, leaving enough room for his imagination, and well spaced, so that viewers have plenty of time to reflect on the stunning images. If you have the opportunity, try not to look at a translated version of this series. <br /> <br /> A must for anyone interested in the complexities of our blue continents and easily the best documentary on this subject that I have ever seen.
