This film is definitely a case of style on substance, but the style is good and certainly more than unique in its kind to make "The Cell" a memorable and above-average film. <br /> <br /> "The Cell" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and makeup. Yes, it is a real pleasure for the eyes to see everything. The film has perfectly "dreamy" sequences that are certainly strange but also very beautiful and imaginative to watch. This film is a perfect mix of a type of arthouse film and a typical Hollywood thriller, accessible to both fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite unbelievable and doesn't always make sense. For this reason the film is not always pleasant and pleasant to look at but, as I said before, the style compensates for this. The style makes you keep watching until the end and offers the best moments of the film. <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as a serial killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underutilized as an actor and this film shows his talent once again. I'm not particularly happy with the casting of Jennifer Lopez. I know she can play in some of her films but she wasn't fit to play the main character in this movie. His character was not strong enough and was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. However, I felt that Vince Vaughn was also a mixture in this film. He didn't adapt well to the role and no, I'm not saying it because I'm used to seeing it only in comedies now. The rest of the supporting cast is good and still gives the film some credibility. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Howard Shore was also surprising and was a sort of "Se7en" like sometimes. It suited the film well and gave the atmosphere and atmosphere a bit of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It is a film far from perfect and the concept is far-fetched and not always managed in the right way. Still "The Cell" is a perfectly watchable film and maybe even a little to see, thanks to its style, originality and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
