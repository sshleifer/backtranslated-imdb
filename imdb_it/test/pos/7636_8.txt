It is true that this is not a realistic story, but romantic comedy is not a genre that I look to realism. What matters is that the characters are nice and, if necessary, sexy. Shalom is handsome and relaxed and Jake Weber is handsome in a cool way. They have enough chemistry to make the story in the area that counts, the sexual attraction credible. I'd like to see one of them in another movie. And yes, even the clown is nice.
