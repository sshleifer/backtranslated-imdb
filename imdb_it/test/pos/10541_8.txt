I know what you're saying, "Oh man, Pinochio isn't scary!" but this film goes beyond much more than a manic pinochio. Behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is strangely tied to her doll Pinnochio who seems to talk to her. The only strange thing is that no one else can hear the doll except her. In the end it is shocking that the revelation, as I did, will shock you. Watch it. Give it a go.
