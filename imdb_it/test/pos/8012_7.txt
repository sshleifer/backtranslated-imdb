me and a couple of university friends - alberto lopez, dave hall, celina alcock (we graduated from uea, norwich, uk in 1997) we are still reunited and we watch the b-movies once a month. <br /> <br /> We are consummate expert in the art of bad movies, and this film was quickly inserted into the top 10 of horrible / brilliant films. <br /> <br /> so if you just got beers and weeds, and you need a movie to laugh like a drain, DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX 2 is the movie for you! Marc Singer is perfectly aware of being in a turkey of a movie here, and he milks it for all he can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his acting in wood and in his muscular arrogance (is it a word ??) while he grunts "But I want my 20 thousand!" Pure Shlock Gold! If you liked it, see also: TRANCERS, THE RUNESTONE, DOLLMAN and anything by Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray ..... (but beware: some of their films are completely and completely worthless and you will be screaming for those missed hours of your life !!!?!).
