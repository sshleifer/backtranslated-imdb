News TV producer Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), a promising news presenter, in a seminar, and their mutual attraction brings them back to his room. Romance, however, is cut short, when it emerges that Tom is, in his own words, "not good at what I am doing as a success", and Jane realizes that she personifies everything she hates about where the news is going television. The blow comes when Tom reveals that he is about to join his Washington news office. <br /> <br /> Jane and Tom's initial attraction is therefore given a second chance, but Jane will be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she is attracted to - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is the colleague and confidant of Jane's very intelligent journalist. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career is stalled because he lacks the confidence and skills of the people - and the classic good looks - to be the success that is becoming his new, less qualified and less intelligent colleague Tom. He's also worried that his good friend Jane will fall in love with Tom, despite his best judgment, as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has his romantic feelings for her. <br /> <br /> This central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a TV news network office, where dilemmas and moral ethics are fought quickly and where appearances and the dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and important. <br /> <br /> Here is where most of the bite comes from with well-observed comments and scenes. One of the many moments is a scene where Tom meets the main network host, Bill Rorich (a cameo role for Jack Nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on their handshake. In a film full of long and short lines and dialogues, you realize a lot about the character of these two men from this quick two-handed shot. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the characters is among the most intelligent and witty that can be found anywhere on the film and with so much abundance. Brooks gets the best part of them, in line with his character, but even shorter conversations that are random and perhaps over-felt by one or more characters as they move into a crowded room should be heard. > <br /> Hunter is a tour-de-force in this role for which he was rightly (and not only) nominated for an Oscar, and for which he would probably have had if it were for a role in a film that did not " I feel part of what has become a closely related industry - and against a strong performance of another actress in a more traditional wellness, rom-com. <br /> <br /> Brooks is also excellent as the always frustrated and occasionally too smug for his sake, Aaron Altman. <br /> <br /> Hurt, while possessing the looks and providing the required personality to his character, does not always convince him that he is equally dimer- the character said he is or should be It shows a latent intelligence that allows it to make the most of its apparent limits, which may be plausible, but I don't think Hurt takes it off completely, except when he tells us that "it stinks" or "I don't understand", Hurt he realizes that he is a little smarter than that otherwise it is an effective performance, in a role in which his character is compromised by his intellectual limits, but Brooks and Hunter slightly overshadow Hurt's performance. It's the only negative thing I can say about the whole movie, and who is it that anyone else would have done better, or it would get better, when it's next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie. <Br /> <br /> Support is ably provided, among others, by Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, and there is also a role in part for Christian Clemenson of Boston Legal's later fame, and the more short of the bit-parts for Joan's brother, John Cusack, whose face is not even visible. <br /> <br /> James L Brooks has provided us with many great TV shows and movies, and this movie should rank there with the best of them. He may not have won any Oscar, despite seven nominations, but he has won many other awards and turned Holly Hunter into a star.
