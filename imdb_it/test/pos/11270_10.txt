Thank God for the Internet Movie Database !!! When I took this film for the first time I watched it every night before going to bed and every time I got something different. But no matter how I cut it, it came out scary. Black and white and all the contractions really scared me. You stare at the insecure screen at what you're looking at, and just when you think you understand it, it becomes clear and it's something completely different. The image is VERY disturbing, spasms and straight razors don't fit me well in any movie. Again every time I saw it, I was interpreting it in a slightly different way (there is no dialogue, you know), so I decided to check the IMdB for the plot summary. Boy throwing me for a ride, I had no idea he should have been God. Now I'll look at it with this in mind and see what happens ....
