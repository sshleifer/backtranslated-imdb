Many comments seem to treat this film like a baseball movie, but I feel this is secondary. It's about living in Japan, and it really succeeds. <br /> <br /> I spent a few years living in Japan, and I suppose the reason this film didn't go very well is that you have to live in Japan to get it. I was watching this with a very good friend who was never in Japan, and he noticed that many of the film's events were so ridiculous as to have destroyed the suspension of disbelief. My response was that those events were the absolute unmistakable truth about life in Japan! I think this movie deserves to be seen, especially if you've lived in Japan or if you're interested in this movie.
