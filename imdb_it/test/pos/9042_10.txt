This is easily the best film version of William Faulkner's fiction that I've ever seen, and I've seen some of the most important ones. Shot in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, it really captures the feeling of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County. Intruder in the Dust is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but even if it is a clich√© to say this, it would be the crown jewel in someone else's career. It's beautiful, but simplistic, of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, fifty feet from the ground (I read that in eighth grade, and it's exactly where it belongs). Two of Faulkner's most important characters play in important parts in the film, Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably the single most common character in all of Faulkner's fiction. He is a lawyer and works easily as a storyteller, because, unlike many of his other characters, Stevens is a man of logic, not an emotion (at least when he's older). Lucas Beauchamp could be the most important of all the black characters of Faulkner (he has an important role in one of the masterpieces of Faulkner, Go Down, Moses); unlike all the other black people in Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to bow to any white man. It has pride, and many in the white population find an execrable quality in a black man. One day, Lucas is found standing on a dead white man with a recently fired pistol in his possession. Most of Jefferson and the surrounding areas do not see the need for a trial, and everyone is pretty sure that Beauchamp will be lynched before the end of the evening, or at least the next day, since the murder and arrest on Sunday . On the other hand, Beauchamp declares his innocence and tries to convince Stevens to help him. Stevens refuses; the case seems open and closed. But his young nephew, Chick Mallison, because Lucas had helped him in the past, is ready to help him now. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, no Hollywood movie of this period deals with racism so explicitly this. Hollywood movies rarely haunt the black population, but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles. If you are an African American actor, you can also give up and accept that role as the mommy, the maid, the servant or the porter, because it is the only way you will work. In Intruder in the Dust, one finds one of the most memorable non-bearer roles that a black actor has ever had, Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchamp, as I described above, is not a stereotypical character and may have been difficult for the public to accept. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical and kind. The recent art house movie Far from Heaven is a great example. Beauchamp is a kind of jerk, and he is very stubborn. Although perhaps it is a little less here than it is in the novel, it is not a stereotype at all. He is a complex human being. Juano Hernandez plays Beauchamp extraordinarily well. I haven't seen the film in a while, but it also appears in Robert Aldrich's 1955 film, Kiss Me Deadly, as well as in the film adaptation of Faulkner's final novel, The Reivers. <br /> <br /> All the actors are fantastic in the film. I should also quickly praise Claude Jarman Jr., who has the great role of Chick Mallison. The novel takes place from his point of view, and is the conventional hero of the painting. Jarman is rather an actor; captures the character (which also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction, narrating, for example, events that took place a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The Town) perfectly. He will appear in another big role next year in the underrated John Ford Rio Grande movie. The only other Clarence Brown film I saw is National Velvet, a rather different picture than Intruder in the Dust. His work here is exceptional; I really have to believe him to capture Faulkner perfectly. Other famous adaptations by Faulkner are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, shot in 1958, which I really like though) or too cold (Tomorrow, shot in 1972, which I don't like, that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of Faulkner). The only other thing he does really well according to his original material is the great Douglas Sirk movie of 1958 on Pylon (actually another type of Faulkner's novel altogether), Tarnished Angels. 10/10.
