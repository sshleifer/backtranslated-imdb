The Auberge Espagnole is full of energy, and is honest, realistic and refreshing. Not a comedy or a drama, but more a slice of life films about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in Barcelona for a year. Beautifully photographed with a beautiful soundtrack. If you are older, this film should bring back lots of good memories. If you are young, learn from this example.
