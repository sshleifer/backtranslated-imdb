I commented once about this great Chucky, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it on a big balcony in a big theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first ever Chucky movie in a theater, and it was a special moment for me because I enjoyed Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COURTESY !!! And the blood was incredibly beautiful! The scene where the gay guy gets nailed by the truck is incredibly cheerful! It was a fantastic gore scene !!!!! And the ending was so bizarre and shocking that it made me s *% @ my pants. The idea of ​​having Chucky's seed was very, very bizarre and shocking! When I left the theater I loved it and couldn't believe it was real. The bizarre and different qualities of this episode of Child's Play for some reason made me mark as the Jason Goes series To Hell of the Child's Play. It only had that intensely shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of Jason Goes To Hell. A safe ***** from *****. Here's how I classify the series: 1,4,2,3. I loved it but not quite as good as Tom Holland's original Child's Play classic. I'm looking forward to Seed of Chucky! Take it!
