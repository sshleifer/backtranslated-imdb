I would like to tell you just a few things before considering watching this movie. If at some point or another you thought you had seen a good job with the camera, prepare to be amazed by this movie. For the record, this film was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something we saw much later in the Western world ... about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies a lot: happiness-love-war-despair-joy, but in the end you stay with something unique: the joy of seeing a masterpiece of cinema. The young directors of our time should study this type of film more and maybe they will be able to create something similar ... although I think that films like this are very difficult to find ... If you've seen "I am Cuba" , so you would like this film very much, but if it weren't, prepare yourself for a unique experience.The Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets, great actors and the joy of creating art ... and yes, I am able to create together more masterpieces from all over the western world.I'm not a big fan of Russia, actually I hate everything that is communist, but the making of the film in that part of the world, manages to create feelings so difficult to describe. <br / > <br /> Enjoy yourself. <br /> <br />
