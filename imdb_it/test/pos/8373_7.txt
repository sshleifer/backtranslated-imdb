The only reason it is worth noting The Duke Is Tops, one of the many "competition films" made during the segregation periods, is the film debut of a 21-year-old singer named Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her creator of producers Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) to be able to affirm himself in the big moment. Davis, however, has to pretend he took the money for his services in front of her, so he won't feel sorry for doing it. He then collaborated with Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medical exhibitions throughout the south. Meanwhile, in New York, his new producers bombed a big moment because they made the whole show rather than simply the special act. Davis discovers from the radio and offers his services as a producer and leader of the band to bring his line of other special acts, many of which make one of their few or only cinematographic appearances here, for his big time with Ethel next to he. Guess what happens? While the plot is the type you've seen in thousands of other musicals during this period, the fact that this was done for a certain audience makes this one of the most fascinating features I've seen during this Black History Month. Mrs. Horne's singing is on display here and it is interesting to see her so young before her professionalism takes full control later in her career. Among the other supporting actors there is an unconfirmed, according to IMDb, an appearance by Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favorite movie It's a Wonderful Life and sister of Amanda Randolph whom I just saw in the short film The Black Network, like the woman with Sciatica who complains of not being treated after taking the doctor's medicine before Duke explains that it is for the feet! And as a long-time resident in Louisiana, I'd like to take note of two players from here in this film: Joel Fluellen of Monroe as a tonic customer and Marie Bryant of New Orleans as the sexy dancer who appears next to the musical climax. So only for Lena Horne, The Duke is Tops worth seeing at least once.
