2:37 admirably manages to show us what Australian teenagers feel and don't say. These are the stories of real children and I think we would be naive to think differently. The only new thing 2:37 that really brings us is an Australian point of view. We often look at American children in need, but they often fail to connect the same problems to our teenagers. Performed with clever and clever cinematography, I still (after immediately recognizing the disappointing final song) find the musical direction without refinement. I congratulate the fabulous casting of this film. These are normal Australian boys who invite a lot of sympathy for this. Great all-round interpretations and Gary Sweet cannot be overcome, this film made me remember why sometimes high school sucked and, unless you are fussy, or you like to go away with heat and blur, go see 2 : 37.
