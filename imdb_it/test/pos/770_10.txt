After watching the Harry Potter films, I was a fan of the three actors Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; yet, we were waiting to see if they would make other projects besides playing the same character of the year or every two years of the J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles focus more on Daniel and Emma, ​​since they are the main protagonist and the only protagonist of the saga that leaves Rupert's dead end. No matter, every actor has a time to shine and Rupert's light strikes him once in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Driving lessons" is named Harold and Maude of this generation with Rupert Grint who plays the role of Ben Marshall, a young British boy who lives with his overbearing mother (Laura Linney) and a drunkard of a parish priest (father priest) for whom he wants a job in the summer but cannot find work while at the same time doing his driving tests (and failing) and writing poems for a girl who has no interest in him. <br /> <br /> Ben looks for an announcement in a church newspaper for which the work requires taking care of an elderly lady. He takes the job and realizes that he is looking for surprises like Evie (Julie Walters, Rupert's mother in the Harry Potter series) a jobless actress who is also a poet who gives Ben the run for his money. They bind and tell each other secrets together with Evie who behaves like a child and throws herself into cunning where she drags Ben on a trip to the countryside. From them not only Ben drives to Scotland, since Evie needs to act in a local library, but at the same time an old lady falls in love with the young man where Ben starts to become a man. <br /> <br /> There is mishap and at the same time rejoice with Ben and Evie and say that I was very happy with the movie when it came out in theaters and I was impressed by the acting of Rupert Grint, especially if he showed the rest of the world film that although it carries a bit of Ron Weasley in Ben Marshall, there is no way to stop the actor in his brilliant performance.
