Famous and mysterious recluse Raymar, who is a kind of lethal telekinetic lethal vampire, dies suddenly in bizarre circumstances. The beautiful student Julie Wells (a beautiful and nice performance by the adorable Meg Tilly) desperately wants to be accepted by the snobby clique of the Sisters (played with sublime perfection by Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and the always cuddly Elizabeth Daily), so she agrees to pass a night in a creepy mausoleum where Raymar's body was buried as part of an initiation rite. Of course, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it will be a long and heartbreaking night of pure tremendous terror for poor Julie. <br /> <br /> Director / co-writer Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us the funny joke "Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives") avoids the graphic gore in favor of creating a dark and disturbing atmosphere, but he can't pull off this particular feat because the first hour is too slow, talking and uneventful to be remotely scary or full of suspense. However, I still found this film of imperfect fear to be strangely attractive and fun. The great hairstyles, a stupid sequence of photomontages, false false temporal spasms (including the omnipresent hand on the shoulder gag!), A scene in a sparkling gaming room, children who happily smoke pot, and the hilarious stupid jargon ("nerdle") Brain "!?) gives this image a certain 80s-era charm. The beautiful and refined cinematography of Hal Trussell (I dug in particular the Steadicam flaps that glide gently), Bob's spooky and funky soundtrack Summers, and Tom Burman's beautifully macabre fake makeup are all up to par, and the ever-stolid Adam West of TV's "Batman" fame only takes up space in a secondary part, the mausoleum being an incredibly vast main position and shocking: the grand finale with a bunch of rotting phantom corpses coming out of their coffins and floating qualifies as a wonderfully macabre shocking macabre set. , this child is certainly not an unfairly unknown gem, but still offers a lot of fun and funny nonsense.
