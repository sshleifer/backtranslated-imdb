Like a very expensive episode of Buffy full of humor. Lots of thread and stunt kung fu. The Twins Effect goes on the list of classics must see HK movies. Vampires have a nice hopping ghost-type mix and the handsome European guy. If you have the chance to see it in the theater it's worth 30 minutes by car, otherwise buy the import DVD before someone spoils it by giving it a bad dub.
