I saw this series in 1999 on London TV and I was speechless. As another user commented - This is what I wanted to see when I first saw "Jurassic Park" - The life and death of Dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. The CGs are very realistic, and the diversity of the dinosaurs and habitats shown also makes it very educational. <br /> <br /> The series takes everything known about dinosaurs, adds many good ideas about "what could have been" to create what looks like a series of documentaries. What I missed was a small bar chart constantly in a corner of the screen, moving between "fiction" and "fact" along with storytelling and images, because you often wonder how educated you are to guess and how pure fantasy is . <br /> <br /> For some clues about facts and fiction, you have to see the "Making Of" of 50 minutes, which is not only very educational about the CG process and collecting and includes the knowledge of paleontologists in the series, but which is also a lot of fun (dinosaurs smoke cigarettes and complain about CG animators). I highly recommend watching this series before going to the Disney Dinosaur movie or watching any Jurassic Park movie again (like). It will surely make you much more critical of those films. The Disney Trailers looked particularly bad.
