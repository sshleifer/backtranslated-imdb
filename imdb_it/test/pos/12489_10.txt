The director loves the actress and shows. The actress lives the character, whom we love at first sight and to the sound. The character loves her jealous unattractive husband and he loves her. His childhood friend secretly loves his wife and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes love tragic and ironic. His wife is jealous of her childhood friend and thinks her attentions are for her husband's secret love. <br /> <br /> Then there is a murder and the lieutenant of the investigative police, who loves only his bi-racial son, and resents being taken by his company by the characters mentioned above, who have had some unpleasant contact with the deceased and they are all lying in one way or another, unraveling the mystery with some of the most precise and authentic procedural details ever captured in the film. /> <br /> And then there are the atmospheres of a post-war Paris, where coal is scarce, music is full of erotic nostalgia and melancholy memory, and innocence has been wiped out by the rain for a long time. /> <br /> All this in an environment of magicians whose tricks don't always work, dogs walking on their hind legs and expressing musical criticism, hungry journalists and exhausted policemen. <br /> <br /> And then there are many of the best actors of their generation who have been through some bad guys you are headed by, in the round, a man in love with his leading actress and who, with full justification, was a Picasso's respected friend. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie often and I love them all and this.
