And so the most loving skunk ever to beautify the big screen was born. While the plot has an abused cat who paints like a skunk and inadvertently attracts Pepe Le Pew (called Henry here), Pepe certainly steals the show. No doubt Chuck Jones realized that this love-seeking member of the genus Mephitis had that something special needed to be a star in its own right, and so he chose Pepe in "For Scent-imental Reasons" four years later, firmly establishing success of PLP presence on screens everywhere. <br /> <br /> So, while "Odor-Able Kitty" may be another owner of the place, I try to imagine seeing it for the first time in 1945. Someone might have guessed that this support the character would soon enter the row of Bugs, Daffy, Porky and the rest? That someone did it, Pepe remains one of the nicest characters to date. C'est love!
