this is about a homicide detective who fights against a couple of rich young men who have nothing better to do than plan a complicated murder and cover it up, they seem to outsmart the police forces seemingly to their liking. make fun of the detective by planting clues and leading them into a wild goose hunt. this has a decent plot with some twists at the end of the film, Sandra Bullock does a good job at this as a woman at the limit, she is not sure of herself and fights her inner demons, she can't seem to keep a man in her life , especially the partners, seem to continue to leave it for some reason. Overall this is not a bad movie, it makes you continue to guess the really shocking ending to the end.
