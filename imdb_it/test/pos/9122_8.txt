There have been robbery films before this, and indeed Rifiri has had an obvious influence on it - but The Red Circle is more than another voice in an overpopulated genre and with this film, director Jean-Pierre Melville he managed to create something that is chills on the surface and gives his audience something to think about. Being cool is an equally important feature of modern crime as guns and gangsters, and Melville does it with this film en masse; even the tone of the film is very relaxed and Melville lets most of the film bubble under the cool exterior. The story has a number of corners but the central character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His release coincides with the escape of the infamous assassin Vogel, who slips from under the nose of the Mattei police commissioner during a train journey. The first thing Corey does at the time of release is stealing money from his former boss Rico, and the second thing he does is recruit Vogel and a sniper to help him pull off a jewel shot. But Rico and the police are hot on the tail of the thieves ... <br /> <br /> The film is enclosed by four excellent central performances. Alain Delon is calm and calculating as the film's anti-hero, while Gian Maria Volontè seems formidable in the role of an escaped murderer. François Périer is also good as the owner of a questionable club, while the real prominent performance comes from André Bourvil in his role as police commissioner. The film lasts about two and a half hours and is not exactly a thrill. However, the director keeps things interesting by keeping the action focused on the important elements. The film features crime films like shootings, but they are kept to a minimum. The first two thirds of the film are actually being built up to the suspense robbery scene towards the end. Rififi was famous for his string of robberies - a complex scene in which nobody speaks a word. The robbery in this film is similar in that it is also without words, and I must say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; but Melville's skill in orientation and the calm and composed way he plays go on. The film is summed up in an exciting climax that completes everything very well. All in all, this may not appeal to all crime fans because the action is more than a little slow; but The Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
