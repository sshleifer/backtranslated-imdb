One of the best movies released in the 1980s, this reality-based film tells the story of a disturbed high school student who kills her girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a river bank and brags about it later with her friends . What is equally serious is their inability to FEEL something about it. <br /> <br /> Disturbing but incredibly compelling looks in aimless and apathetic children who have no respect for their parents or any kind of authority, who seem almost destined to live lives of rebellion and recklessness. This drama hits hard and it's impossible to forget. The young cast has a deserving job - even Keanu Reeves, in one of his first roles, is better than usual. Obviously, there's no reason why Layne's character (Crispin Glover) is crazy and crazy like him, but it's only Glover who is himself. The veteran Dennis Hopper has a particularly positive role as a loner who, despite his sordid past, is saddened by the attitudes of this group of children. I would like to underline the appalling performance of Daniel Roebuck in the role of the young murderer; he is an underrated actor and, apart from Hopper, his is probably the best interpretation of the film. <br /> <br /> I saw "River's Edge" for the first time a long time ago when cable TV movie channels first started showing; however, I didn't take it all; I saw it in its entirety for the first time a number of years later, and now I've seen it again for what is probably the definitive time. <br /> <br /> Some moments of great impact include Madeleine (Constance Forslund) collapse where she complains that perhaps she should leave her children just as their worthless father did. I also liked the scenes in which Matt (Reeves) confronts his disturbed younger brother (Joshua Miller) and when the teacher, Mr. Burkewaite (Jim Metzler), deplores the fact that the girl is dead and that none of his students seem to import. <br /> <br /> I will never forget this film, not as long as I live. It's too sad for that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
