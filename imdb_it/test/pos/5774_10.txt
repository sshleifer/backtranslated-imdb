Hi, I was wondering if anyone has a copy of the movie Broken Promise ?? I loved this movie growing up and looking at it every time it was on. It's been YEARS since I saw it and I'd like to have a copy. I checked all of the internet and couldn't find it. If someone has a copy to exchange or sell, please send me an email to NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thanks and good evening !! Christine --------- The "failed promise" was made at the age of eleven Melissa Michaelsen, whose parents abandoned her and her brothers. Taken from the county, Michaelsen had to watch helplessly as his brothers and sisters were split up and cultivated in different families. One of the children is even institutionalized. The juvenile court officer Chris Sarandon joins Michaelsen in his struggle to reunite his family under one roof. Broken Promise was originally offered as a "General Foods Golden Showcase" presentation. It was the first television broadcast on May 5, 1981.
