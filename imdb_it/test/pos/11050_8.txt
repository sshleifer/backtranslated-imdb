I read all the negative reviews for "Anna Christie". You know, the complaints about the static camera, the acting and the verbosity of the script. But when I saw it yesterday I found it extraordinarily interesting and pleasant. Yes, Clarence Brown's camera stands still for the most part, and I'm sure one of the microphones was hidden in the light of the ship. Yes, there are many dialogues and no spectacular action sequences. It is a first talkie with primitive technical aspects. But ... then there are Garbo, Marie Dressler, George F. Marion and Charles Bickford, all demonstrating that acting is timeless. I believe "Anna Christie" is still one of Garbo's most iconic performances. And it's a wonderful performance from the Divine, in a role that is really quite unusual for her. Yes, we saw Garbo tired and almost beaten, but never with bags under his eyes or with whiskey shots. Garbo has played so many (delicious) roles in costumes that seeing her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. It is not weighed down by heavy clothes or makeup. This performance looks pretty raw from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The plot, based on the comedy O'Neill, follows the weary former Swedish prostitute Anna, and her reunion with her bumbling sailor father. Anna has had enough trouble for a girl of twenty, while she tells drunk, sloppy Marthy (Dressler) in a bar. Find comfort in a life at sea, and romance with a coarse but kind-hearted fisherman (Charles Bickford). But his past threatens to ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Charles Bickford is neglected in the long series of men (mostly inferior) of Garbo. He is an actor who can really share the screen with her and not be swallowed up by her magical presence. The couple has a great chemistry together and seems to enjoy working with each other. Dressler can never be accused of underestimating, and once again the grand dame is up to its old tricks, but it is terrifying and convincing in its role, never annoying as in the terrible "Dinner At Eight". I've never heard of George F. Marion before, but he was as wonderful as Garbo's father. <br /> <br /> This is Pre-Code, and rather gritty and obscure by MGM standards. I liked it a lot, and although it could creak in some places, it's still wonderful.
