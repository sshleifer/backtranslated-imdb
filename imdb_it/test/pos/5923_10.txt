A great film about triumph over all the inexperienced trying to kill your spirit, reaching the impossible. I will not go on about this, besides saying that I enjoyed thinking about this film when I am faced with something particularly daunting, and I realize that if Lindberg could do what he did, I can certainly tackle the task before myself . Definitely a "feel good" film. <br /> <br /> Watch it. You will not be disappointed.
