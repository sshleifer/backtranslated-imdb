The German-born Turkish director Faith Akin captures in her film the infinite variety of different styles of music and songs in Istanbul, a city that is a bridge between East and West, a city that is uniquely located on both sides of the Bosphorus, in Europe and Asia. Kurdish dances represented by Aynur, who plays his own brand of Kurdish, passionate and melodic gospel music. We were introduced by instrumental Romans, to Orhan Gencebay, who has been called the music of Elvis Arabesque - the sounds of music are heard everywhere in cities like Faith Akin takes us to underground clubs, street artists and recording sessions. German bassist Alexander Hacke who comes to Istanbul to play and learn about Turkish music mentions Confucius: "To understand the place, you have to listen to the music it plays". Akin's beautiful documentary does just that: it gives us 90 minutes of music that helps us get over the bridges. For me, watching the film was particularly interesting because I recently visited Istanbul as part of my vacation and spent four days there. The city fascinated me with its images, colors, crowds, liveliness and visual beauty. Now, I can add the sounds of music to the ever-changing portrait of Istanbul.
