Or if you've seen the "Evil Dead" and / or "Bubba Ho-Tep" trilogy, then you should know that his films are a real farce. With "Man with the Screaming Brain", he does everything again. In this case, he plays the skinny American businessman William Cole visiting Bulgaria - when will we ever see that country? - when a woman kills him. Thus, the strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent, letting him act like Steve Martin in "All of Me". <br /> <br /> Yes, the whole movie is practically an excuse for pure nonsense. Much of the true humor comes from the brother of the director "Evil Dead" Sam Raimi, Ted, Pavel's almost cerebral assistant. The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the Skipper. <br /> <br /> So you understand that this is a totally stupid movie, and you won't be disappointed. I liked it, anyway.
