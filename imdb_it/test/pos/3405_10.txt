I was 13 when this mini-series (and its North and South sequel, Book II) were broadcast for the first time. I had already been fascinated by stories of personal interest in / around our American civil war, which is what interested me in watching this made-for-TV program. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. And now I'm 29 and I love him more. It is full of history, beautiful costumes, real-life characters woven into and out of the lives of imaginary characters, to all those you care deeply about. There is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, extended family, lust, battles, victory, defeat and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Although I had the complete set of tape episodes that I recorded when originally aired, I purchased the full set of Columbia House N & S and N & S II a few years ago when they became available. Once every few years I take a whole weekend and I watch all the bets back - and I'm sad when the last episode comes to an end, because I find myself wanting to keep watching the story of the lives of these characters. <br /> <br /> I cannot recommend this miniseries more effectively.
