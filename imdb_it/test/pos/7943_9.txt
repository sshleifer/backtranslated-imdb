At school they taught me how some shots were called and there were two constantly mentioned directors: Orson Welles and Sergei M. Eisenstein. I didn't care much then (I was a kid!) But now I know why, Eisenstein is a genius and it's a shame to see what was possible in 1938, where almost more than half a century we've been stuck countless blank movies! Some say that this film is not worthy of the genius of Eisenstein (so they have to watch it over and over again until they can say something bad) or worse still that it is just a little propagandamovie for the Russians. We say that it is so, is it really pure propaganda for patriotism, but is not "Saving the private Ryan" or "The longest day" like that? Could I summarize so many films in which America is rising upwards, so why not Russia, and besides every war is fought for its patriotism because otherwise they would have raised the flags? Aleksandr Nevsky is a must for all those who love cinematography since almost every shot is a sublime film. Maybe it's all supervised, but I wonder why this isn't included in IMDB's Top 250 where there are so many overrated Oscarcrap.
