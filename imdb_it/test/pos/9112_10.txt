I'm a HUGE fan of Tenacious D, and I think this isn't the funniest movie in the world, but the most fun. It's not a laugh a minute, but that's not what the D wanted it to be. I went to the movies seeing all the HBO shows, I memorized both albums and that made it even more enjoyable. Lots of jokes beyond Tenacious D albums and HBO shows. Since I already knew the new album, I knew 40 minutes of the film because it's a musical comedy. I would say that it has the best first 5 minutes of each movie and the last 5 minutes better than any movie. Hands down. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie now!
