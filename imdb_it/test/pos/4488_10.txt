There seem to be two types of people in the world: those who think that "Five Characters" is one of the best episodes of the series and those that are so fantastic that they know it was sucked in because they were so smart and already predicted the "blades" to fine (which apparently, in their small minds, is the only reason why the Twilight Zone exists: to invent twists and turns). <br /> <br /> There are many episodes of blades in the series and I am not one to evaluate all the episodes of TZ ten. But this is certainly one of those that deserve such an assessment. It is claustrophobic and colorful. The suspense is built and we cannot wait for the secret to be revealed at the end. But whatever that secret is, what these people are, it doesn't matter. Most of the beauty of the episode is to bring about it. It would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers really are in a strange place.
