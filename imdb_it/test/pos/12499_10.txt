I was tormented by nightmares involving Sesame Street and the Muppet show during my childhood. I loved the programs, but when I slept, I dreamed muppets not unlike those on TV ... but not really the ones on TV. <br /> <br /> They spoke meaningless and laughed and sang while eating each other and killing each other. They would take a bite of their beautiful felt flesh and break it, followed by arterial hemorrhage. NICE! But that was the past ... I LOVE THIS SHOW! I saw Peter Jackson's MEET THE FEEBLES years ago and wondered why there wasn't a similar job out there. Well, here the vision of the old Hobbit is sick, twisted and somehow socially powerful. <br /> <br /> If you like this show, and have not seen MEET THE FEEBLES, do it on Amazon or on a film of the source genre. You are in a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> By the way, Clarence would have totally kicked Triumph's dog ass.
