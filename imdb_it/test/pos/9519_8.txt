Wow .... it's been a long time since I last saw a hilarious movie like this !!!!! I've never been a big fan of French films, but since I fell in love with the beauty and acting skills of Catherine Deneuve I decided to see all of her films ... but I didn't think this would be as fantastic as it turned out to be. . Lucky me, I bought it even though I had doubts! This is really a "feel-good-time" movie with class and quality. There are some great social themes and moral dramas that are very close to today's modern way of life, which are shown to be very beautiful and realistic. I also loved the dance scene in the men's room! But my favorite is the rather shy attempt of Catherine Deneuve to sing ..... she takes it as it is, with much grace and modesty at the same time ... very tempting! I would also like to express my respect and my admiration for Line Renaud, who played a fantastic role (I didn't even know he played ... I only knew her for her music). So, don't wait any longer and go see the movie ... you'll be surprised in many ways.
