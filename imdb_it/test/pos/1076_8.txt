A very interesting documentary - certainly much more than Sideways, a pseudo-wino drama - in which the capitalist conspiracy reveals itself in all its greed. According to the documentary - and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on Parker - only two men dictate the nature of wines in the world: Robert Parker of Massachusetts and Michel Rolland, a French expert in the wine sector based in Bordeaux and also known as "producer of flying wine ". The director is intelligent enough to include interviews with local wine producers from different regions of France, from Sicily to Argentina and interviews with the biggest players in the industry such as the Mondavi family to discover the envelopes of the globalization of oenology and marketing. A must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after seeing this well-made documentary.
