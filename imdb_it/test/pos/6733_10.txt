I saw this film for the first time in the night program of one of my favorite TV channels ... I was caught from the first minute. Nothing is as it seems before, much suspense, great acting of Mr. van Dien, and I did not mind the "heat" in it a little ;-) ... and, best of all: you are in a fine surprise !!!
