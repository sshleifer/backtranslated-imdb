Black Snake Moan is amazing. He is excessively rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. Following Hustle & Flow, Brewer paints his portrait of the South American almost like a mythological land that one would expect to see in an epic fantasy or of ancient Greece. And yet, above us, his films flutter, they are still rooted; rooted in the darkest and deepest soil there is. <br /> <br /> As in traditional fairy tales, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan using extremes and exaggerations. Clear and marked character traits, if coupled with extreme acts like chaining a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor in the same way as those extreme visual techniques like some characters that have color in Pleasantville has reinforced the metaphor of that fairy tale film. But Brewer does not start his film with "Once upon a time"; in this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer presents us with a different fairy tale; a dark and gothic fable of sex, prostitution and, ultimately, redemption. These themes run through the veins of the film like blood and resonate and bloom in its dark and meditative setting. <br /> <br /> But despite these harsh extremes, Brewer treats his characters like humans, and creates extremely well executed, three-dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, particularly emphasized by relationships with Lazer's friend in the pharmacy , Angela and Rae's mother. <br /> <br /> Acting is, in the round, quite perfect. One has the feeling that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characterizations are so intense and so severe; it's even more difficult for actors to keep their heads and create realistic characters. And they succeed very well. Samuel L. Jackson in particular disappears completely in his character, which acts as a pole opposed to most of the characters he has played before. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft and others, he created for himself a typecast of the "ultimate bad ass". In Black Snake Moan Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and terrestrial character very different from anything he has done before. And frankly, it's just great. What is surprising, however, is the casting of Justin Timberlake and, more specifically, the fact that he is quite tolerable. Surely he doesn't have much time for the screen, but like the one Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, it actually makes Timberlake act and do what he's meant to do, and it doesn't prove to be absolutely unconvincing and irritating. > <br /> But what is really incredibly beautiful about the film is the atmosphere created by Brewer. Southern rural settings work to its advantage in creating a type of dark, dirty, dirty, crunchy, rough texture for the entire film, which is more suited to the thematic and metaphorical aspects of the film. And using all kinds of elements like the increasing sound of cicadas when Rae receives his itch, or a violent thunderstorm that increases and intensifies while Lazarus interprets his blues number "Black Snake Moan" for Rae, Brewer really manages to create almost a world fantasy, a mythology weakened in the rural environment of the South. And it works in an absolutely fantastic way to create the unique vision of Brewer. <br /> <br /> And you can't talk about a Craig Brewer movie without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow, he used a cheeky and dirty hip-hop music soundtrack to emphasize the atmosphere and vision. In this film, music works even better in smoothing and fully representing the unique atmosphere. It's a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, crudest, most gritty blues you've ever heard. And it just sounds absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> In all, it can be said that this film was a simple story of a God-fearing old black blues singer who redeemed a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania , there might not have been much to write about at home. But this film is not about the plot, nor the characters, as they are made in the film regardless. No, this film is about vision ?? and what a unique vision it is! It's about the atmosphere, the mythology, the setting. It's about anger, fear, redemption and, most importantly, blues. And it's all wrapped up in a unique, fun, stylized and impeccable ribbon. Brewer has secured a place on the list of the most promising and promising directors, and with such a solid following in a great debut film, Hustle & Flow, it will surely be on my radar for future projects. > <br /> It must also be said that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I've ever heard.
