Before Barton jumps on all my observations, we always keep in mind that opinions are like donkeys, we have them all ..... <br /> <br /> I loved Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, I loved the dialogue and thought that acting was sublime. Underestimated perfectly and undervalued. Unlike others, I have NOT found this to be entirely predictable. <br /> <br /> I found the role of Sigourney pleasantly fun and realistic, especially her scene in front of the bully in the trailer. <br /> <br /> I found it pleasant and did not expect to recommend this to everyone. This is why there are different flavors of ice cream, something to please everyone ...
