So well done. Photography, sound, music and performances were the best. It's also a fun plot that makes you smile with every scene - I loved it and I'm a 60-year-old heterosexual boy. Each character seemed to fit into a tee. It's the best performance I've ever seen from Mrs. Capshaw: she has participated in more films than I thought, but it was a wonderful result. I suppose it's an advantage to have Spielberg's money behind you, taking into account a big budget and all the best that money can buy technically. Two of the casts showed off their T.V. - it's easy to see why. Tom Selleck does his usual good job.
