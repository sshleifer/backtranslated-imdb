I am listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed: at the beginning there is a light breeze and the leaves on the trees sway gently; Out there, far away, the bells of water carriers sound incessantly; I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I am listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed; Then suddenly the birds fly away, flocks of birds, high up, with a hue and cry, while the nets are fished in the fishing areas and a woman's feet begin to delight in the water. I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. The Grand Bazaar is serene and fresh, a riot at the center of the market, the mosque's yards are full of pigeons. While the hammers slam and clank at the docks The spring winds carry the smell of sweat; I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I am listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed; Still stunned by the revelry of the past, a villa on the sea with squalid boat sheds is fast asleep. Rested between the din and the hum of the southern winds, I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, with my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. A beautiful girl walks on the pavement: words of four letters, whistles and songs, rude comments; Something gets out of hand. It's a rose, I guess. I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, my eyes closed. A bird whirls on your skirt; Is there sweat on your forehead? Or not? I know. Are your lips wet? Or not? I know. A silver moon rises over the pines: I can feel everything in the beating of your heart. I'm listening to Istanbul, intent, eyes closed. <br /> <br /> FOR YOU <br /> <br /> For you, my fellow humans, everything is for you, the nights are for you, the days are for you; Daylight is for you, moonlight is for you; Leaves in the moonlight; Wonder and wisdom in the leaves, Myriad green in the light of day, Yellow is for you and pink. The feel of the skin on the palm, its warmth, its softness, the comfort of lying down; For you all the greetings and the trees that sift in the port; Day names, Month names, Fresh paint on rowing boats is for you Mailman's feet, Potter's hands Sweat on the front, bullets fired on battle fronts; The graves are for you and the tombstones, the prisons and the handcuffs and the death sentences are for you Everything is for you. <br /> <br /> SEA NOSTALGIA <br /> <br /> The ships sail along my dreams, Above the roofs, ships in a feast of colors, and poor me, craving the sea year after year, I look and I cry. I remember my first vision of the world Through a shell of mussels that I opened: The greener water and the bluer sky And the most swaying of the lump-fishes ... My blood still flows salty Where the oysters cut my skin . What a mad rush to speed was ours On the high seas on the whitest foam! Foam has no malice, just as the lips of those who have adultery with men are not dishonor. <br /> <br /> The ships sail along our dreams over the roofs, the ships in a feast of color, and poor me, craving the sea out year after year. <br /> <br /> - Orhan Veli <br /> <br /> I could not have said anything better than what Orhal Veli Kanik said about Istanbul. Regarding this film, all I have is praise. A very pleasant and balanced introduction of a city and its music that connected Asia, Europe and Africa at a given time.
