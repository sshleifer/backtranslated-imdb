Following the corporate coup of 1941, Max and Dave, the Fleischer brothers were removed from their studio by Paramount Pictures Corporation. Former employees such as Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber were charged with the new operation, now renamed Famous Studios by Paramount. At the beginning, Famous's finished product was indiscernible compared to that of Fleischer's recent production. The existing series (Popeye, Superman) continued as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> Subject of the subject, JAPOTEURS is one of the first SUPERMAN shorts in the famous studio. <br /> <br /> AS was the custom, the SUPERMAN cartons were a great combination of refined music and fashion in the score. This is true both for the theme (overture) and for all the multi-mood music in the background (incidental). It was as if each short film had its own background music, since everything was kept fresh apparently by recording it again with each image. <br /> <br /> With regard to JAPOTEURS, we must remember that this was filmed during the first year the involvement of the United States and the characterization of the enemy were very stereotyped, short-range and completely evil. The dialogue and the personality of the wicked Japanese saboteurs were closely linked to the characters of the series of old pulp stories, with every word uttered in a sarcastic, totally insincere courtesy as the characters would show off their cool while making the most demonic of threats and acts outrageous towards the western world. <br /> <br /> JAPOTEURS is visually bright and uplifting, extraordinarily structured and uses some multi-plane or table-top animations to give its flight sequences a real depth. <br /> <br /> MAKE good use of the links between cartoons, the SUPERMAN Radio Show then listened to on the mutual transmission network; the comic has a close resemblance to the comic book page and uses the same talents as the voice actors Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander of the radio program. <br /> <br /> We classify it with a Â½ star rating. <br /> <br /> POOL SCHNITZ !!
