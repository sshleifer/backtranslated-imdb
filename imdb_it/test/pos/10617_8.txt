"The Piano Teacher" focuses on the character of Huppert; a middle-aged classical piano instructor with a stoic facade behind which a strongly convincing aberrant personality is hidden. Unsatisfactory as a story but intriguing as a character study, the film follows the character of Huppert through the end of his anguished relationship with a student who offers excellent performance in the process. Not for everyone, "The Piano Teacher" will play better with those in foreign films and character-based dramas that address obscure issues. (A-)
