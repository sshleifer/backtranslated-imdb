I would recommend it to anyone who is an admirer of the late John Cassavetes. And for those who never knew about Cassavetes. It's an excellent film. I really don't have the time to go into the details of why this is my opinion, but if you're looking for something brave, with many scenes to mull about, then this is for you. Cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as is the story itself. This "review" does not do the film justice. It is an experience that must be seen by itself. VERY CHARACTER. VERY GENUINE.
