A woman and her aunt go to Scotland to locate her challenger boyfriend. This is a very vilified film because of its denouement, but until that moment, it is interesting, well acted, disturbing, and with a beautiful scenery (by William Cameron Menzies, developed for the 3-D projection). Veronica Hurst is endearing and gentle, a sort of British Marilyn Monroe, still in love with Richard Carlson, who hides a family secret in her hostile castle; there are also bats in the bell tower! He moves slowly to the last extraordinary set-piece, when Hurst and his aunt (Katherine Emery, also the narrator), sneak out of the castle at night to venture into the maze and find what they are looking for in its center. As a child, I always remembered this sequence: there is nothing more frightening (or claustrophobic) than not finding the way out of a 10-foot hedge maze. Naturally, the two women separate, setting the stage for compelling suspense with horrible music. The end result is a bit disappointing, as Carlson's epilogue eventually makes sense for everything that happens, even to cause compassion. Worth seeing.
