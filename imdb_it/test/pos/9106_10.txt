This is the only thing I can think back to the year 2006 and say now that it has been rocked. He trembled hard, yet he also rocked tasty. Mr.MEATLOAF added a little touch to this dish in a movie even before the end credits turned. Now that he tells you something, this video is shaken even before STARTING! Now I don't want to give much or be a "spoiler" but this ROCKED movie! If you've listened to the new album and you've thought to yourself "this sounds like a pretty shoddy material, it's like I'm just playing badminton with Satan, what does he give?" Then this film will increase your appreciation for music and you'll be amazed by this whimsical satanic masterpiece. For those who wish it better they do not know what they want, because it would be better to stop D. This film is the D. period! So venture out if you have the courage to see the local theater if you want to have your socks shaken.
