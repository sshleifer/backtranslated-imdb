The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season is that it revolves mainly around the family. This is why some people call it "children's party". As we age, natural friction and progress remove the people and things that have given us our special memories. John Denver, in one of his sweetest roles, plays George Billings, a successful New York architect and a new widower who lost his wife about a year earlier. His life is centered on his 9-year-old daughter, Alex; both are still suffering from their loss. George is doing his best to make this Christmas special for his daughter. He enters his boss, Thomas Renfield (badly played by the wonderful Col. Flagg of M * A * S * H, Edward Winters), who sends George to Georgetown, CO to explore a possible real estate deal. George and Alex, who are looking for a vacation rather than a job, fly into the city, where they are immediately joined by a collection of generous but somewhat eccentric loving groups of characters whose main eccentricity is that everyone believes in Santa Claus. Georgetown is a community of illustrated books where we all want to live and love people for neighbors. George soon meets a love interest in Susan (Jane Kazmarek). If it weren't for the grinch (Renfield) it would be the ideal time. But the fact is that he is in town to find Renfield's development property, and there is a nice ranch near the town that is about to be foreclosed, and the dark edges of the film revolve around the impending foreclosure and reactions of the breeder and strangers. I will not ruin the finale for those who have never seen the film. It is a typical happy end to Christmas, but it is managed in a fairly subtle and credible way that shows the best of the human spirit without being too syrupy. All in all, this is a very nice way to spend a couple of hours of Christmas TV. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have a beautiful chemistry and Gennie James while Alex does a great job. I've always loved the work of Mary Wickes, a recognizable character actress, and all the other cast members do a good job with less fleshy parts. This is a normal Christmas dinner for my family; I consider it 4/5.
