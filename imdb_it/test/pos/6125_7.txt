Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with her son Crackers, her daughter Cotton and her mother Edie (Edie Massey). She is competing with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Stole, David Lochary) to be named the dirtiest person alive. The film shows their attempts to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT for everyone. It is a real assault on bad taste. Crackers have sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while her sister looks; the Marbles collect hitchhikers, impregnate them, keep them chained in the basement and sell the children to lesbian couples; Divine and family have a party that includes cannibalism etc. Etc. It is disgusting but, in a sense, not unwatchable. It is so over the top and is so skeptical about it that it is a little fascinating. As the director John Waters would say, the bad taste is well done. Plus, it's a little fun to watch - the acting is so miserable (especially from Massey) that you look at her in disbelief. A friend laughed aloud about how bad Massey was (improved in the next photos). <br /> <br /> This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even though he is over 30, he is still shocking. However, if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behavior, this is a must see. The only part that was really too much is what the Divine does at the end.
