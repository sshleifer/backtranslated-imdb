Selected during the Quinzaine des réalisateurs, this year 2002, Catherine Breillat is masterfully halved of her autobiographical film, where her leading actress, Anne Parillaud (La Femme NIKITA, Luc Besson), admirably embodies the director of "intimate scenes ". . <br /> <br /> This is a comedy of good manners of the actors. Making-Of? Film genre ? Pornography or Exhibitionism? Sex Is Comedy is a post-modern film, with the script based on a film within the film. As an implosive story of a minimalist love scene, the film is built with a constant solidarity of forms and spirit, in which Breillat continues to break and analyze taboos. Using visual codes and a certain sense of formula, Catherine Breillat implements her clinical analysis of sexuality as an isolated problem outside of society to communicate through the door of the heart. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Grégoire Colin (Good Work, Nénette et Boni, Claire Denis, Life of the dreams of angels, Eric Zonca) in the role of actor and Roxanne Mesquida (The fat girl, Catherine Breillat, Marie of the Bay of the Angels, Manuel Prada), the actress, are actors that you invent, she explains in an interview. Breillat even observes the man in front of him, a chaste man. Then Breillat films shame and sexual mutilation, but also great hope, a disturbing dimension of ecstasy, a nakedness of feelings, the halving of exhibitionism, the game of being one to be one. Finally, the director is required to guide the actors to give their feelings, their body and their soul. So disposed, faced with the problem of the order of "who I am", the actors of Breillat have put an inorganic vitality to merge in his work in progress. But for what is an incredible form of exorcism, for an actor, Breillat asks many questions. Bearing at the same time a great suffering, the actors seem to be those who seek this loving transport to be part of the eternity of their work. <br /> <br /> The Art of Breillat is a researcher, to know how to undertake in a dialogue that aims to overcome the limits of intimate scenes. Join in the make-up, erection prostheses and unions are not without remembering that the images and scenes of Jan Steen and Rembrandt could be in the anecdote and in the daily life of the characters on a set of shots. While moral categories disappear from the background of Sex Is Comedy, Breillat manages to reveal the loving imitation power of the actors in a landscape of formidable and dramatic humanity.
