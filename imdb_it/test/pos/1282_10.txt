Even with only $ 6,000 and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion, the next big and our first taste of Nolan does not contradict him. <br /> <br /> None of the problems that constantly afflict and discredit the image independent of the limited budget haunt Nolan and the crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver us and involve us in this story. In all honesty, I think that Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one with the most control. It is a wonderfully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by budget constraints. Dialogue and atmosphere are daring and intelligent. <br /> <br /> Nolan's distinctive method of telling the story for continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the plot to your side. With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a little to get a complete understanding of genius, but Nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype film. We can distinguish time from the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both creative and engaging. I am happy that Nolan has had so much success with it because his films become more than they could be with this method. The earnings of Prestige and Memento would not have been exciting at all if the film had been told in a conventional format. This idea was made with moderate success first, but Nolan really made his own. <br /> <br /> The script here is the best of Nolan. I had some doubts about his writing skills, I imagined that his brother Jonathon was the talent of writing, but he showed me that I was wrong with the sequel. It is a stimulating story that makes interesting observations about people and how they work. Cobb's assessments of burglary and how it can lead you to discover what makes loved ones actually seem plausible. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that the camera work is shaking at times, but it doesn't detract from the story or acting. <br /> <br /> Below is the first film of a man who will personify the 21st century film at its best.
