My interpretation of the ending. Bobby died at the hands of his stepfather. Mike had tried to get Bobby out. Only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine capable of flying. Bobby is dead ... Mike as a child survived by creating an alternate ending in his mind ... about how Bobby left ... Mike made a plane that blew Bobby. Children who are sexually abused and violently often create other worlds in their minds to survive. <br /> <br /> It was also nice to see my old living area. We called it San Jose Boulevard and lived right where these houses were shot. It was so strange to see that they were running inside the houses ... not in the studios ... It was my kitchen, my bedroom and my living room. And those hills ... we use them to walk like children ... looking down on our little valley .... seeing glimpses of the bay. It was a real nostalgic trip for me.
