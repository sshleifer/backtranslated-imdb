What a crazy movie! It lasts 12 (!) Hours and you don't understand who these people are and what they are doing! The main plot concerns a group of clueless actors trying to stage "Prometheus", but there are a lot of plots, like the disappearance of Thomas and a madman looking for Monsieur Warok ... what is the meaning of everything this ???
