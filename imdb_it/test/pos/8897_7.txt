Too bad that Asterix and his friend Obelix don't get the worldwide recognition that other cartoon characters get. <br /> <br /> This is another fun cartoon of Asterix full of fun. The animation is excellent and the vocal characterization good, even if the synchronization is a bit off. The music and the soundtrack fit well into the story and the inclusion of some modern musical numbers is a nice touch. <br /> <br /> Execution time seems short and while it is not the best Asterix story or the most developed comic, it is a nice clean fun. Modern animation (similar to Disney) will capture children, Asterix fans and newcomers ... Enjoy the adventure of Gaul!
