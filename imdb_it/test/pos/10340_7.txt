The plot of this film is as stupid as a lock of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a character who may have been upset by the ridiculousness of the story. He is bad and a wife who beats. He's a character so far removed from the roles of NYPD and LA Law that you might have. <br /> <br /> If you thought it had the look and acting qualities to play the role of the bad boy, she is your gift. <br /> <br /> But !!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black miniskirts and small black minidresses throughout the film. <br /> <br /> He has always had some of the best legs in film history. This makes the film remarkable for this admirer of legs. <br /> <br /> I would buy the DVD for this reason only if it was available.
