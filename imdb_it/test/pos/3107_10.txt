The Ghost Walks is a small and graceful mystery with a great turning point, a captivating dialogue and, above all, a pansy interpreted by the elite Johnny Arthur who does not diminish or denigrate his character. Mr. Arthur is very good in his role as Homer Erskine bringing great comic relief as secretary to Broadway producer Herman Wood, played by another great character actor Richard Carle. <br /> <br /> They enjoy each other superbly. <br /> <br /> Although the acceptable words of the sissy and cream puff time are used to describe the character of Homer, it is never petty spirit or meaning like denigration, and are not pronounced by the virile males of the film but by his employer, who fires and rehabilitates every other scene and shows an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee. <br /> <br /> There is a great scene in which Homer tells his boss that he has spent the best years of his life for him and has been anything but a mother to him. <br /> <br /> The mysterious corner of the film is a lot of fun, and the turn at the end could leave you in a daze. <br /> <br /> For a low budget low budget photo, this film has superb stage decoration and fantastic costumes. <br /> <br /> Direc for Frank Strayer his cast is cleverly manageable and this film is much more complex than his other mysterious attempts at mystery, but he had a fantastic script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry on. <br /> <br /> This film is a must for devotees of poverty films, the old mysteries of the dark house (actually they managed to work in the lines "It was a dark and stormy night) and has the advantage of be an early representation of a gay character in the film where nothing bad happens in the end. <br /> <br /> This film is available for download in the public domain film section of Internet Archive on archive.org.
