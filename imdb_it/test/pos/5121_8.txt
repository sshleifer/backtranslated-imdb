This film was not a great cinema, but certainly a good movie to watch with your family, especially children aged 10 to 15 years. There are good topics for discussion raised in this film, such as bullies, the environment and work to fix things. Jimmy Buffet's music was a plus, and the scenery was wonderful ... The young actors were excellent, and this is a film I would expect to see on Family Channel or Hallmark Channel. Except for a few words in the dialogue, a middle school could show this film to start discussions in the classroom. I hope it will be shown in Drive-in this summer so more people can see it. He followed Carl Hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in a cameo show.
