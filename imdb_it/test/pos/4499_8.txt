Based on the best-selling novel by Khaled Hosseini, The Kite Runner is a story of friendship, betrayal and a struggle for redemption. Set in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the days of the Taliban rule, all the elements are present for a great drama but, under the direction of Marc Forster (Finding Neverland), the film lacks the kind of burning emotional impact which makes it a memorable experience, even if it's fun, well acted and occasionally moving. <br /> <br /> Set in Kabul in 1978 but filmed in Kashgar, China due to the dangers in Afghanistan, the friendship that opens the film between two young people is very real, even if they are distant from each other in circumstances social and economic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) lives in an elegant environment with her rich and educated father Baba, played by the great Homayoun Ershadi, although her wealth seems a bit incongruous in one of the poorest countries in the world. Although Baba is a loving father, he confesses to Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), his friend and business partner, that Amir is too soft and that "something is missing with that boy". The family has a servant, Ali (Nabi Tanha), who fills his every need and whose son Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmoodzada) is Amir's best friend. <br /> <br /> The two are separated not only from the class but also from the ethnic group. Amir, a growing writer, is a member of the Pashtun majority while Hassan is a Hazara, a minority sect (10% of the population). Even if we do not learn much about their traditions or their social situation, they are bound by love for kite flying, a popular sport in Kabul and the reading of Afghan folk tales by Amir to Hassan who is illiterate. The annual kite competition for boys is a big event in their lives and the effects of CGI are breathtaking. The kite strings are covered with glass particles and the winner is the one whose kite cord can knock down other kites in the sky. Hassan is the kite hunter who has an extraordinary ability to locate fallen kites and take them to Amir as a trophy. After Amir wins the important race, however, there is a sad event that will shape the rest of his life. <br /> Bullies, led by the older Assef (Elham Ehsas) who later appears as a ruthless Taliban leader, Attacks Hassan because he is a Hazara and brutally rapes him (outside the camera) while Amir is too scared to try to prevent it. Unable to confront his perception of lack of courage (although one must ask what he could do to help Hassan), guilt becomes the driving force in his relationship with Hassan and their friendship becomes tense. In an accident, Amir throws pomegranates at Hassan as if begging him to counterattack and punish him for his passivity but Hassan does not take the bait, continuing to be loyal despite his friend's cowardice. When Amir asks his father to dismiss his servants and accuses Hassan of stealing his watch, Hassan admits the theft even though he is innocent. Eventually, circumstances force Ali and Hassan to leave shame. When the Russians invade Afghanistan, Baba and Amir also leave, fleeing to Pakistan and then to Fremont, California, where history resumes years later. <br /> <br /> Baba is forced to work in a service station and sell trinkets in an open-air market, while Amir (Abdul Salam Yusoufzai), apparently following the movements of life, studies to become a writer in college of the local community. After he falls in love and marries Soraya (Atossa Leoni), daughter of a Kabul general, Amir finally publishes his first novel, A Season of Ashes, and things seem very positive. When Amir receives a call from Rahim Khan asking him to visit him in Pakistan telling him "there is a way to be good again", the specter of guilt that has haunted him all his life invites Amir to return home. He returns to Pakistan and, with great risk, returns to an Afghanistan now controlled by the Taliban to confront the demons of his past and discover a surprising secret in the process. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner is a sensitive film that addresses the inner pain that comes from knowing that you were not faithful to your best instincts and allows the possibility of going beyond shame to a new level of responsibility. Moreover, it does not hide the pain caused to Afghanistan by wars and revolution, a pain that is perhaps represented by the suffering Hassan. Unfortunately, it reduces complex situations to the level of good boys and criminals and distorts what really happened, hurling the United States, which engaged in secret anti-government operations within the country, from any responsibility for the disastrous war it left over one million deaths and millions of disabled people. Although we are inspired by the exceptional child actors and moved by the freedom that represents flying with the kite, The Kite Runner renounces his power when he tries to replace the melodrama with the story.
