Well acted based on a novel by Arthur Miller. Something as simple as a pair of glasses becomes life that changes. Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) is a man who has chosen to be satisfied with his worldly life; the same job for twenty years and still lives with his mother. He is told by his boss to correct his vision with a pair of glasses. Newman's life changes drastically and digs him into hell. The glasses he chose make him look Jewish. He loses his job and becomes the object of heavy scrutiny from his Brooklyn neighborhood. Looking for a job, he meets the attractive and frank Gertrude (Laura Dern), who lives with the conflict because of her Jewish appearance. Soon the new life of the couple becomes a nightmare full of humiliations and attacks driven by bigotry. A very suitable cast that presents: Joseph Ziegler, Peter Oldring, Kay Hawtrey and musical fame, Meat Loaf.
