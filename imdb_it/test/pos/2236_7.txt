This was a pretty good film that was overall well done. Even the idea of ​​Mercy (which wouldn't hurt) was original. I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first films. The only things I've seen frowning are some of the trivial fight scenes (don't spoil either). I liked the first movie and I liked that too. 7/10
