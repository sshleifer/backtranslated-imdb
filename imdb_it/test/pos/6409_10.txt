This film is like a dirge. Until it reaches musical numbers that are like MIND F * CK, but more delicate, like a mental caress. FOREPLAY MIND. The depressing atmosphere given by the speed and desperation of the characters can be beautiful Kill-Yourself-Awesome until you get to the musical numbers. It's a great movie. Optimistic. Strange. Manic-depressive (bipolar). That's all! THIS FILM IS BIPOLAR. however see it. IT'S A MUSICAL !!! WITH DEPTH !!!! If you like existential waste like The Stranger, or Waiting for Godot, then you'll probably get a real kick from it. I had to get the DVD through Amazon.com for $ 12. OH and rock songs. well they play rock but they're not rock, we like calypso, jazz, Broadway, but for Grace Chung, and I can't find the soundtrack NOW! <but I want the songs to be fantastic, and the dances are so fun.
