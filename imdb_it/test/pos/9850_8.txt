If you have not heard of this film, it follows two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America, where they are convinced that they will find success and wealth. Life is tougher than expected in the United States, and this movie captures the frustration beautifully when things don't go right. Lives are captured so well that many moments seem written because they are so perfect. Whether it's work, school or time, the two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the directors and make some very inspiring comments about life in the United States. It is one of the few documentaries that I can remember that, in the end, I wanted it to go on for another two hours. It may be difficult to find this film because it has not got a large distribution, but check your "art house" or independent theater and give yourself this (side note, if you are reading this when it is already on video then it is definitely worth it a rent). Rating: 28/40
