I must admit that in the past I had the opportunity to see this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes from the beginning, I felt like many. I was expecting a monkey movie similar to the TV show, but instead I was given ... well, I didn't know what was given to me to be honest. <br /> <br /> However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind for the brilliance that it paints, I also found myself looking at it over and over again. It is the only film that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me awake, while I try to decipher its meanings. And just when I think I understand something in the film, his answer is destroyed when I look at the movie again. Brilliance indeed. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people who did not like this film want to watch a film with a mainly clear plot. They want everything explained and all the questions answered in the final. I'm sorry, if that's what you want, this isn't the movie for you. But if you like movies like The Matrix (and, better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the exciting and shocking experience that this movie will give you. <br /> <br /> Do you think the film is like a dream. In our dreams, things don't make sense, the things we expect to happen don't, places and people's things don't talk, act or work the same way they do it in reality. To complain about "Head" is like complaining about a dream you had and that you felt you couldn't understand. The mind is a complex system, and since a film called "Head" is equally complex, is it so difficult to relate the two? <br /> <br /> The music (and the musical numbers) really stands out, especially The two compositions by Peter Tork, which remain the best tracks in the film, "Can You Dig It?" and "Long title: Do I have to do it again?" <br /> <br /> This film demonstrates that The Monkees were much more than just four zanny guys in a "pre-fab" group (as their critics called them) on a TV show, but they are actually a lot smarter and more talented than the world would have given them credit. There are so many messages that can be derived from the film, both for The Monkees and for the entertainment industry in general, which stands as a masterpiece of cinema that was far ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> I feel that if this film was released as an independent piece at the time, it would have garnered the respect and admiration it deserved. <br /> <br /> And a final note: <br /> <br /> It could be compared to the Beatles movie "Magical Mystery Tour", since the Beatles movie seemed just as strange and bizarre. However, in my opinion, "Head" is far above anything that the Beatles put on celluloid.
