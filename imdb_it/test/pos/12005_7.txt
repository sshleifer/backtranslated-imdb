And I do. Peter Falk has created a role that will live forever on TV! And I'm grateful for that. This is not one of his best hours, though. Columbo goes to college and basically teaches how to solve a crime, yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they are smarter than he is. What all of us fans know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent. Without a great enemy, how can the hero in the wrinkled coat be? Anyway, it's better than NO Columbo, and I'll wait and watch the next one.
