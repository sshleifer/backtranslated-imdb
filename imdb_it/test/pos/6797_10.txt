Two of the big Hollywood stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney) are perfectly teamed to offer one of the most classic of all time. The story of a determined 12-year-old girl, whose adoration for horses will not allow her to move away from her goal of winning British citizens. Mickey Rooney is the recently orphaned tramp, who tries to bind himself until he can follow his dreams. <br /> <br /> A beautiful side story reveals that the girl's mother had her own ambitions as a child. Repeatedly nullifying his father's decisions in favor of their lively daughter, it is the mother who seems to know better. The scene in which the exhausted Taylor rushes to go to school is priceless: the father protests "because you let her go to school, she will come out of exhaustion before noon!" - Don't worry, she'd be back in half an hour; it was Saturday! The brilliant Technicolor, the sumptuous soundtrack and those beautiful faces, all tell a bittersweet story. Here's a good reason for the old saying: they don't do it anymore!
