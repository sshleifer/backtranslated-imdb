if you're going to see this movie, not getting into this movie with the expectation of this movie will be absolutely funny because you'll be disappointed. yes sure it is funny sometimes, but I would consider it a political thriller disguised as a comedy. the performances are very good especially from jeff goldblum as head of the electoral company. although it has limited time on the screen, it has a lasting impression. of course robin williams is excellent .laura linney is very good, what a surprise. she is one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood and one scene in particular shows this. this movie makes you think. and if a comedian were a presidential candidate and actually won? would the country be better or would the country shatter into a million pieces?
