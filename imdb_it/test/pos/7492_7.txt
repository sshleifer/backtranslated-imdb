When I saw this movie I had no idea what it was, and I had never heard of it before. But I must say that I was positively surprised. The first few minutes are almost the most fun of the whole movie. The store attendant from India is just too funny! However, the plot isn't really too much to talk about, but I think it's ok. Acting on the other hand is pretty good, and the only actor I recognized was Mickey Rourke, who wasn't really in the film until the end. And the ending is where I think the turn-off is, it's not bad, but it doesn't seem like it really ends. I feel like there's something more to it than that. A final battle somehow. I do not know. All in all, this was a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone in Tarantino's movies with a lot of violence and dark, sinister humor! I consider it 7/10.
