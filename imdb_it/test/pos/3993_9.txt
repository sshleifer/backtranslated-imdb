It is not surprising that this film was made by I'm at the time was it. I examined the beauty and tragedy of the Chosun Dynasty life in Seopyonje and I delightfully explored a famous Korean folk tale at Chunhyang, and these included his last two films. The most surprising thing is that Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 offer, is not presented in the pansori style of those two previous films. <br /> <br /> However, I'm an expert hand comes through. Let's explore together the life of a real person: a painter of the Chosun Dynasty of the late nineteenth century who rides on the margins of modernity but who is not a nobleman and who, due to this, causes a sensation in contemporary Korean society with its fame his public and artistic expressions of contempt for the old Korean noble class and its contempt for the aspiring Japanese ruling colonists alike. The painter Chang Seung Up, popularly known as Oh Won (beautifully played by Choi Min Sik, the famous star of Park Chan Wook's already legendary "OldBoy") becomes increasingly influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. The contemporary Korean public will support a hero like this despite the fact, or perhaps because of the fact, that he was so ostracized in his time. The sense of beauty and tragedy of contemporary history remains intact. I am a master at capturing the past idiosyncrasies of his country, and in this film he has almost surpassed himself. As expected in a movie by I'm, the cinematography is breathtaking, the editing is precise and the plot is central. <br /> <br /> Plots are set against Seung Up, family ties are tested and broken, scandalous behavior is assumed (and sometimes real), all to bring down the man who "painted the fire". But against all the complications of I'm detailed but sometimes complicated in Seung Up's life, Seung Up somehow manages to survive. Become legendary thanks to its ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after a single glance. Art dealers and agents besiege him and try to earn "Oh Won". In other words, the lines of people who wish to take advantage of the true Seung Up, an artistic star, begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cunning in rejecting both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the public, if not the cast. <br /> <br /> What does Seung Up think? It has powerful emotions and opinions about painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living beings and never really finished. He despises those who try to turn art into profit. And he doesn't care about politicians who use their strength to bring artistic beauty around them and thus exclude the artist as a traitor. But he also thinks that painting has a role in future upheavals. Horrible scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. The historic epic motif of I's signing, and his influence in the kingdom, remains at the forefront of this million-dollar epic. <br /> <br /> The protagonist causes more pain to himself and to those who take care of him when he refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a completely new meaning, which is not only political but social in nature. I deal with matters in a commendable and realistic way. <br /> <br /> He, Oh Won, becomes a figure of Jesus. People believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels that he needs his artistic support, but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want me to do it or be it. In the end, both the government and the people descend on Seung Up in a way taken directly from the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for (or escapes from) the sins of commoners, art critics, politicians, who haunt him. <br /> <br /> But he dies? As with most of I'm's movies, it remains a question. In this case, does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not address this question; simply presents a possible end for the real man of Chang Seung Up, or Oh Won. No death is depicted because death is not known. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to find defects in this film, but I have become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in its culture that, when it does, it is hardly surprising anymore. As usual for I'm movies, cinematography, editing and writing are all top notch. It is a well made film and imbued with I'm uncanny narrative skills. Of course, it might be better to do it through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. However, the film contains features of this admirable art form, and in the end, viewers feel like they have become aware of a great untold story. And they have, because that, in fact, is the gift of me.
