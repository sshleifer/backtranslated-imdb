Based on the manga (comic) of the famous artist Masamune Shirow, this animated film was a bit disappointing for me. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the animation is just "OK" while it could / should have been mindblowing. The film is adequate IMO, but it seems somehow flat and uninspired, if you understand what I mean. A wasted opportunity, considering that another Shirow work, "Ghost In The Shell", is considered a classic in many respects. He set new standards for Japanese animation and generated, among other things, a brilliant series called "GiTS: Stand Alone Complex". <br /> <br /> I consider this worthy of renting, unless you are a Shirow fan and want everything. Check out the original manga, which comes highly recommended.
