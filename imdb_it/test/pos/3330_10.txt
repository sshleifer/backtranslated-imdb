This animated short is a remake of one of the previous Tex Avery short films for Fred Quimby in M-G-M (Dog Gone Tired). A convicted person on the run (just known as Joe) who has just broken out of the "Alka Fizz Prison" tries to keep a step ahead of Droopy (known here as Sgt.McPoodle of the Mounties), but always manages to bump into him, in one way or another. This is without doubt one of the funniest and funniest short films that have made the rounds of the M-G-M animation studio. He manages to get most of the laughs from the shocked reactions that Joe has every time he meets McPoodle (including some equally unbalanced sound effects: car horn, screams, elephants, etc.). As with any Avery M-G-M, you can expect a frenetic, frantic and kinetic rhythm (along with some nice and surreal visual gags - that is, Joe trying to escape from McPoodle and actually running away from the film side). Put this in your DVD player and laugh at yourself silly.
