Good movie. <br /> <br /> I managed to collect it on DVD in a local store sale. Â£ 2.99 seems a good deal and it is. The thing is the film is called "To Kill For". It took some investigative work to find out his original name. <br /> <br /> In the UK it was rated as 18 and rightly so, although the standard of the films depends on the "ability to sell". Having seen Final Destination 3 last night, in my opinion, it should have been an 18. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fact that the delicious, Traci Lords is in it tends to make the classifier go up to 18. Really sin. <br /> <br /> Traci is a great actress and should have the chance to appear in bigger and bigger budget productions. His ability to transform what is branded as a B-Movies into a Fine performance is nothing short of amazing. <br /> <br /> Long Live Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
