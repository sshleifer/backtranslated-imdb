What a great film this was. Is it paradise? hell? or something in between? I disagree with many reviews of this film that say this is a representation of hell. It is not even clear if the opening scene starts the film or is a flashback from the end. Furthermore, it is not clear if the main character goes to hell, but maybe somewhere in the middle. The review I read on IMDb says this is hell, but I disagree wholeheartedly. Take into consideration that perhaps the good people who commit suicide cannot be condemned to hell ... this unique religious belief. This is really a thinker, and I recommend / recommend it to everyone who likes that kind of movie. It's worth it!
