The Beat was an exciting film about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980 in New York. This involves fighting with the other street band that they share directly with a high school course, trying to stay in school, as well as going to local shows that involve groups that look like the Dead Kennedy and have the name of Skulls for their name . Rex (played by David Jacobson) Reproduces an autistic boy who starts taking some time with all these types and starts showing them that poetry is really beautiful and, if applied to what these children do in life, can really make things work for the better! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Kara Glover) are brother and sister. Although I roll with this crowd of thugs, these guys are not the same kind of people in this group. They take care of Rex and take care of others and really show an enlightened side of themselves. While his sister is sleeping with the head of the band, he also falls in love with Rex, trying to show him that he is not a bitch. But in the end, the school's teachers finally come to him and want to put him in a mental institution, finally he feels that it's time to end his life, while Animals of Sound played without him. But they like to think that he is not dead, he is simply living his life to the fullest, riding sharks and being happy to live in the ocean. This film was one of those films in which I was glad to have seen it. While it was extremely fun, he also had a great message. Something along the lines that these guys had no direction, no future, no figure to look up at, but because a problem child came together they realized that there were more important things in life than fighting local black children , or being destructive to everyone Rex showed them the beauty of angry music. Rex showed them the beauty of Rats, Diseases and Murders. Rex showed them beauty in almost everything, while some of those things had no beauty, they were still able to see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people. Rex played an important role in this move, which changed everyone's heart from depression, to see that there is hope for them, and this is why he started showing them; The beat.
