How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this? I can't count them but it's certain that the filmmakers were trying to give me a hint. I have been reminded so often of other films, it has become a great distraction. One of the memorable lines borrowed comes from a 2003 film - Day After Tomorrow. A line alone is not so bad, but this film borrows so much from so many films that it becomes a bad risk. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie! Despite his falls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it look smart. While borrowing so much from other films, never overdo it. In fact, you'll probably find yourself crashing into the hatches and overcoming the storm. Why? ... Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I was never a fan of Kutcher and I almost gave up on him in The Guardian, but he emerged in a good way. Costner swims the film with Costner's best skills. I don't think Mrs. Robinson had anything to do with her success. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast played their parts well. In the end I had no problems with any of them. But some of these characters have been used too. <br /> <br /> From here on I can only choose the nit-pick, so I'll save you the wear. Enjoy the movie, the parts that work, work well enough to keep your head above water. Don't expect a smooth ride. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 but almost a 6.
