I must admit that when I saw the preview of "Inglorious Basterds" I gave myself high expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT DELUDE. <br /> <br /> Rarely when I watch a film with such high expectations, I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did this and more. Even more rarely I applaud at the end of a film, this one and all the others at the theater we did. <br /> <br /> I must say that I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction" ". I saw it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film. < br /> <br /> However, since then Quentin has not lived up to its billing, his style was becoming a bit predictable rather than familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never saw Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse.) This up to "Inglorious Basterds." Quentin did exactly what was needed for the war genre, a western spaghetti that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone died, Tarantino he is the author of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So let's take a look at the film I don't want to give away, the writing was apt, a nice transition between the use of not one, but of four different languages ​​in this film, not to mention this film was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, big scen and of rich and meaningful dialogue and sudden shocking action. <br /> <br /> The acting was superb !! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say it often, but honestly the man should have one for this film, he spoke all the languages ​​in this film, and he transmitted them with such extraordinary touch and intensity. He stole the show in a movie that everyone was extraordinarily impressive. <br /> <br /> I have no problem building this film, because this film is the best film I've ever seen throughout the year, and probably all next year. Frankly, the more I think about it, this movie could break my best films of all time, and it's Quentin's best film from "Pulp Fiction". Take it from me, watch this movie. I loved it does not do justice to this film. <br /> <br /> I saw it yesterday and am still amazed. Thanks Quentin from the bottom of my heart for making this movie. You're back on top again as a friend. I can't say enough for "Inglourious Basterds!"
