Being of Cephalonian descent, I was happily surprised when I watched the film. I heard the true story of my relatives who still live in Kefalonia, but when I watched the film and read the book, the fragments of the story were filled. It's all true, the Italians will sing, the oppression and earthquakes that shake the island so often. The 1953 earthquake killed my grandfather and both the book and the film describe the feeling of the era with great compassion. If you have not seen the film go and watch it and read the book, it is not just a love story, and yes, there were so many Italians in love with the women of Kefalonia, in fact, loads of boats of Cephalonian women were taken to L Italy after the war, it is a true representation of history.
