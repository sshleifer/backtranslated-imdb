John Leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller. Whenever this was on HBO I had to stop and watch it. John tells the story of how he grew up (probably some fact and fiction) and adds hilarious stories in the middle. If you like John's comedy, I should say that this is probably his comedy at its best.
