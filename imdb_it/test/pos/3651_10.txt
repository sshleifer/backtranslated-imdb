Sit down and let the director Bharatbala guide us on a visual and sensual journey of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you said you really liked a movie? This film has rhythm and keeps us moving in directions that can only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie, you'll surely want to visit it now. This film has dancers, a chase scene and the mobster involved. But it has much more. Thank you, Bharatbala, for bringing us to such a lively and wonderful fairy tale. I loved the ending. We women do not want illusions in life, we want reality. Post scriptum I was friends with Carolyn at the Sonoma Film Festival and met you briefly. Good luck with your distribution efforts and I'm talking about a storm.
