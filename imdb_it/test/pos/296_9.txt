I've seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and I never get tired of it just because it's perfect. And he also got the best film music ever and the best support roles ever written for a film. I mean, you just have to love Robert Duval, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie, but especially Duval. I can't believe that Kramer against Kramer won an Oscar instead of this incredible war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the most beautiful film in the world (The Godfather) and the best of Hollywood actors, you can only succeed. Now I just have to write something to get this preview, so don't read this except the last line. The rules of the film !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
