Wow, it's been a while since I saw something so mysterious in the way it is portrayed. <br /> <br /> A Detective Story uses old-fashioned black and white images to portray a private investigator who dresses in an old trench coat and fashionable hat. The theme of this animation is reminiscent of Sam Spayed, who was briefly mentioned by Ash. <br /> <br /> Sick of spying on domestic cheating wives because of his clients, Ash was offered the chance to track down a "computer" hacker he thought was a good opportunity for a sum of four digits that he didn't he could refuse and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> The finish was a bit bland, but still ok For those out there who love old fashion stories, this is the one for you.
