I remember my father was taking these episodes on video. My whole family loved them, and now that I have moved away from home and have the same life as myself, I am trying to share these fabulous creations of Jim Henson with my husband and stepson, but I begin to discover that not everyone is a fan of Henson. What a pity because it means that they will only have to bear me in search of this series. But even if they don't find these interesting, I highly recommend it to anyone who takes over the Narrator. You will be lost in a world of stories at a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people should take care of them if they were ever confronted with these situations.
