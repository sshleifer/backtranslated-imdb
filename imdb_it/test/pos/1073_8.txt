mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. in the world of wine there is a huge difference between the large cellar and the small one. it's not just about the size of your vineyard, but also about the amount of money and power you have. if you have enough money to put ads on the wine viewer and assume a so-called "wine except", then the size of your estate doesn't matter. even in today's business world wine must often be marketed in bulk and adapted to people's taste. what often means filtered wine of its origin. Mondovino shows the commercial side of wine in the mega producer Robert Mondavi, and Michael Rolland the wine expert who shapes wine to the taste of today's critics like Robert Parker who is also in the film. now these men are not bad or wrong because they did very well for wine. but they have power on a large scale. as we all know the power corrupts. Mondovino also shows small wine producers such as Aime Guilbert from Languedoc and Hubert de Montille from Volnay in Burgundy. these winemakers are not starving winemakers, but they know how all the great winemakers we are dealing with are where the grapes come from. the best example of this is explained not by a wine producer but by a Haitian man who works for Neal Rosenthal, the wine importer. In the area the grape grows the terroir that counts, that a guiding hand that knows this makes the real wine important.
