Matthau is a widowed hospital doctor who enjoys his unique status and free walking staff and nurses available on staff, while his colleague and friend Richard Benjamin watches him with amusement and amazement. Their leader is tough on the senile Chief of Staff Art Carney, who is in charge of re-election to that place. <br /> <br /> Matthau is happy to play on the pitch without commitment until he meets single mother Glenda Jackson who insists on being the only woman in her life while in her life. At the same time, he is subjected to pressure to respond to the amorous advances of a potential litigant in a negligent case, and to support the shaman and incompetent Carney in his attempt to be re-elected Chief of Staff. <br /> <br /> This is a romantic old-time top comedy adorned by four Grade-A actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a dry, caustic, and sarcastic script of the first order. Carney steals every scene he finds himself in and, in IMDb's language, he rolls us on the floor laughing out loud every time he appears on the screen. We are otherwise entertained by the on-off relationship of the two leads and various sub-charts. <br /> <br /> The ambition to be a great film is lacking, but it remains one of the best of its kind and is watchable for its comic value alone. It deserves more attention than it seems to have received and is worth the cost of the DVD or the videocassette.
