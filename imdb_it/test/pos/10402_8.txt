A documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal episodes connected by the legend of an ancient demon called "kagutaba". <br /> <br /> Judging from this, the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular the past few months, even one that will be released next week (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY)! However, unlike films like CLOVERFIELD, REC and BLAIR WITCH, in which most of these films are in chaos and complete chaos with all the grumpiness, this is basically shown in a traditional documentary style. It has TV shows and interviews and the fears are very subtle, well, excluding the last 20 minutes we enter the chaos effect and where the fear factor rises tremendously. <br /> <br /> And it works. The film is very compelling and makes you think. Yes, you heard me right: it makes you think. You have to pay attention to those unrelated details provided throughout the film and the reward is great when, during the film, these things start to intertwine with each other. The film is also very slow and, in this case, it's a good thing. We, like the public, can absorb the details shown on the screen, however subtle or shameless they may be. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a scary little movie. I am a person who is afraid of ghosts and the paranormal more than the killers who kill teenage victims so yes, the film has given me nightmares. There are some images here that are really scary to watch, including one closer to the end where it makes you go "What am I looking at ?!" Well, it is better to remain unanswered. There are a dozen recurring characters, who have given authentic performances in their roles. <br /> <br /> The only thing I don't like about the movie is the ending because many questions remain unanswered. The question "Is that so?" went on the head. He left a bitter taste in his mouth. However, the rest of the film is simply compelling and truly terrifying. Don't see it alone in the dark, because you would regret this choice. Also, I can see in a couple of years that Hollywood could do this movie again. It will be interesting.
