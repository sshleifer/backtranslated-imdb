Yes, this is one of the giants of the black action genre. Confused mixture of racist comedies and racist violence (sometimes reaching a disturbing tone, even for a fan of the genre) this film is not your Pozzo nel parco. Wonderful pieces of Rudy Ray Moore's comedy stand up that don't look funny, at least not for a white guy like me, but big in context. Much better than his dissimilar "The Human Tornado"
