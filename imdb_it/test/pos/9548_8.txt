I saw the film in Izmir as the closing film of the Izmir film festival. I knew nothing about it but right now I'm glad I didn't refuse to see Ding-a-ling-less! It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and believe me, I've seen millions of movies !! (I'm a film critic!) Intelligent scripts and dialogues ... Smart details ... What else can I say? An indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor ... You can't stop wondering what it is capable of at the moment. Less Ding-a-ling was shot five years ago and I'm sure the director Onur Tukel is now more mature. I heard that his next film will be a political satire and I can't wait to see him in his previous works as "House of Pancakes" ...
