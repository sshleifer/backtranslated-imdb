I would have given this movie an 8.5 or a 9. I thought it was simply hilarious, I don't know how you couldn't think that this movie was funny, but the only thing that disappointed me was that there was a little of too vulgar stuff because I personally think that when they fly away from bikes and things like that it is a lot more fun but I'm sure there are people who think that other things are very funny, so it's not my opinion, but still the great film goes to see it and after you You should definitely go and buy it even if you don't like this movie which is good because I'm sure there are many people who think that this movie shows how degrading our society is or whatever this is my personal opinion and you have yours. even the jackass box is definitely something worth downloading or buying or whatever you do to get your videos
