Duchess is a beautiful white cat who lives with her three kittens in the villa of the wealthy owner in Paris. When the evil butler feels that the wealthy old lady first leaves all that is in his will to the cats, the butler is angry, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and leaves them on the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start a long walk home. A wise street cat named Thomas O'Malley meets with them and offers to help them. When Edgar sees them coming home, he is furious and starts sending them to Timbucktu. But Thomas's friends arrive to help save the day. The rich lady decides to leave her home for every cat in the alleys of Paris. <br /> <br /> This is a fascinating film. The songs, including "Everyone wants to be a cat", are lively and cheerful. The vocal cast is excellent, with Eva Gabor (who later played Miss Bianca in the Disney films THE RESCUERS) as Duchess, Phil Harris (Baloo in THE JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, giving interesting personalities to their characters . Presumably Walt Disney, before he died in 1966, gave the green light to this film. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers around the world! 10/10.
