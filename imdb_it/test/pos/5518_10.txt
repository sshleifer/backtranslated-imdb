This film was different. He took a kind of typical thriller story and achieved a more interesting and in-depth look at an individual's struggle with faith. Obviously, it helped that the main performance, by Andrew McCarthy, was quite excellent. The other performances were also quite interesting, although not so consistent. The finish was a bit disappointing, but there were many good moments. Filmmakers tried something different here - they didn't just try the obvious thrill and fear. This is a dark film (not for everyone) but if you want to be entertained and not discussed, try this.
