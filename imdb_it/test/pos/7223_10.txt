ROMEO AND JULIET had been interpreted in many ways, but very few versions have captured the essence of the show. The ones that come to mind are the WEST SIDE STORIES and, believe it or not, TROMEO AND JULIET from Troma Film. At first glance, this is another simple splatterfest, and many would think that he is a bastard for the Shakespearean classic. However, the film has an honest look about it. Updated to please today's sick young people, of course, but not without merit. Yes, the frequent dismemberments, piercings, car accidents, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what is the damage when you have a love story as sweet as the foundation? Very bad like most of the acting in this film is (I mean, it's Troma, after all), the two protagonists have some genuine chemistry, much more than in the huge budget TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO monstrosities. There is a great deal of modernization, but much of the original text is intact, especially when Tromeo and Juliet are together. There is a fantastic scene in which Juliet pronounces the famous, "Separation is such a sweet pain", and Tromeo quickly follows, in the mid-90s, grunge fashion, "Yes, it's something that sucks." I think it's really a shame that this movie doesn't get the recognition or the wide version it deserves. I hope that the people who see this on the shelves of the video stores will not be turned off by the grossmess of the film, because a rather subversive exhalation would be lost.
