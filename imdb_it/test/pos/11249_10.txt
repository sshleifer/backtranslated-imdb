the keys for the VIP are BS. <br /> <br /> rob knight vs Justin in the second season. <br /> <br /> I went to school with Rob Cavaliere and Adriana Doria. you could remember her as the last girl she was "picking up". this happened when the "angry girlfriend" arrived, they stood outside and "left the club together". They were good friends to Father Bressani Chs in Woodbridge. <br /> <br /> whether they planned it or not, they asked him to do it, men should know that what they are seeing is not real and the boys here are shower bags. especially that episode. <br /> <br /> another line to fill the space.
