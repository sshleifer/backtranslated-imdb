Moreover, Schmoelloer adds the occasional touch of comic relief to bizarre events. <br /> <br /> Venter actor Chuck Connors is the best of the cast in this film.

A number of sequences of the film are quite memorable. <br /> <br /> For fans of horror and thriller, Tourist Trap is an unforgettable film to see. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 out of ****
