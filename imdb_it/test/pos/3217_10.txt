The idea of ​​the girl, who becomes pregnant at the age of 16, is not new to the dramatic genre. But it's rather new if you take a look at the genre of comedy. There is this basic plot of Lorelai and Rory, mother and daughter. Lorelai comes from a rich past, was 16 years pregnant and ran away from her parents' home at 17. But this series does not start from there, it starts when Rory is 16 and everything refers to the problems of a single mother, who has terrible problems with her parents and all those problems you have when you are 16. <br /> <br /> Ok, now again it seems quite normal, but there is this little thing called a joke. The Gilmore Girls speak incredibly fast and make 60 beats per minute. Even if you don't understand all the lines, since they contain hundreds of references to films, music, gossip, history, literature and politics. Sometimes you get confused, but it's really fun. And not only is it fast, it's smart and wonderfully sarcastic. Besides that, it's not just fun, it contains some dramatic parts and you can take some lessons at home too. Which is something wrong with every single TV series. <br /> <br /> So watch it! It will lighten your mood and help you make difficult decisions!
