This film did a great job of capturing the stereotypes of New York at its best. If you want a simple and pretty story, however, you won't find it here. The related tales are intertwined in a way that does a great job in capturing the tight-knit but contrasting anonymous lifestyle that is Manhattan. A perfect watch for those who love and can laugh at the life of New York in its most natural state.
