I opted to watch this movie for one reason and one reason ... Samuel L. Jackson. I happen to like him a lot. I had not seen previews or trailers for this neglected film, so I went without expectations. <br /> <br /> Jackson has not disappointed as Lazarus, a blues down the luck South, and has delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever, including playing and singing a series of excellent blues tunes. But the real surprise here was Christina Ricci, at best a foiled head in real life, who took the role of the sexually abused city bum Rae and made her a believable, almost likeable character. Watching the decidedly non-sexual relationship between Lazarus and Rae was simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake, the pop star has turned into an actor, should go back to causing "wardrobe malfunctions" and pawing around a pop stage. His performance, mostly forced, distracted, at best, from the real story here. <br /> <br /> This film is raw, gritty and sometimes quite "in the face". Not everyone will like it. Those that do, however, quickly move it to the top of their list of favorites.
