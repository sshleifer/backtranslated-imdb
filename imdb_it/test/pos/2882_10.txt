I will always think of Mr. Firth as Dorian Gray, if I live up to 100 years. <br /> <br /> Perfectly recited and directed, bringing the intuition, humor and humor of Oscar Wilde alive with absolute and absolute perfection unusual on television. <br /> <br /> More evidence that the BBC more than compensates for the talent that does not always have money. <br /> <br /> A must for all Wilde fans - and indeed for everyone else. Inspired and perfected, each of the actors seemed perfect for the role and every shot was well done. <br /> <br /> In the end I discovered that I loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the kind had ever inspired. Look at it, then try looking at another version. It's not the same, is it?
