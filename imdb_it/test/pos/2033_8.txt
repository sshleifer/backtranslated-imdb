I have to admit that I didn't expect much from this movie. I was surprised that I really enjoyed myself as much as I did. The script was not an Oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either. The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great supporting role and looked as adorable as ever. What made this film for me was music. If you don't like the glam metal or hair bands of the 80s, then you probably won't like this movie. It's about being a rock star. Some clich√©s were present, but they did not knock down the film at all. I would recommend it to anyone who loves rock and roll and remember to get up and scream !!! 8 out of 10 for exceptional acting and fantastic music. <br /> <br /> Jason
