This Norwegian film begins with a man jumping over the subway, apparently committing suicide. But the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus in a desert. He meets a man and is sent to a mysterious city, where he starts working in an aseptic modern office as an accountant. Colleagues seem kind, if supervised, soon meet a girl, yet the city seems quite strange, since food has no taste, alcohol does not make you drunk, and there are no children around. Is it a dream or is it in heaven or hell? While the movies sometimes look like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone (even at ninety minutes, the movie seems a bit long), it's quite inspiring. The best scenes are those in which exaggeration is minimal, such as when people engage in trivial conversations about interior decoration and meet again in discussing deeper issues. I always thought there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies, in the way they try to repress the fundamental impulses of human nature. And this film is the best when it criticizes this lifestyle devastatingly. Unfortunately, the film ends up being long, and the director doesn't seem to know how to end it, but most of it for the running time is really worth seeing.
