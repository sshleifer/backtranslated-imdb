I liked it better than House Party 2 and 3. The cast was fun and at the same time fun. Chris Stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous cameo as a repairer; look for his mother who plays the protagonist, John John's grandmother. And you can hear his rap the song of the title "Down to the Last Minute" at the end of the film while the credits come out. She is very funny and also a good actress. The young actors who play in it (the main trio), and who actually are part of the IMx band, have done a great job. Before this film I had not paid much attention to this r & b group. I'm a fan now. The number of music in the House Party scene is worth a look at the movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved it.
