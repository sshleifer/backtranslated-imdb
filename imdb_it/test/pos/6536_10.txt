wow that's all i could say i really loved the movie and one thing i could say to Aaron Carter is that i really think you should be in a lot more movies because you rock.I adore Aaron Carter so much it's hot so i say thank you so much for to have made this film fantastic. I really wish he could make many more films because he's a great dancer, actor and singer. I wish I could sing the best he could. and I've been a fan of him for how come and I'll never stop loving him. I rented the movie and had it for two days and I literally saw it as 10 times. laugh out loud you could call me crazy but this shows that I liked it a lot. if you want to talk, you can send me to dvlbab300@aol.com so send me an e-mail if you want. I LOVE YOU AARON CARTER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
