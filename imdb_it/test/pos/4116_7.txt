I thought it was a fantastic movie, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this film. The character of Yasmine Bleeth plays a woman who has lost her mind to the care of the character of Richard Greico. They end up getting married and everything looks perfect, except that Yasmine Bleeth wants a child more than anything else, yet she has trouble trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought acting was great in this movie, and that makes you think. Show how naive he can be when they fall in love. Yasmine Bleeth is a good actress in this, and I wonder why she never went further in her career. Richard Greico is very impressive as the deceitful husband and plays the evil part very well. I wonder why some actors do it and some don't. All in all a fantastic film that I would recommend.
