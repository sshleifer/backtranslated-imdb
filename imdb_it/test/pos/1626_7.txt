I haven't read a single Dan Brown book yet, but I've seen all of his film adaptations. I will not fall into the game to evaluate this with the previous one because the scope is not exactly the same: in reality, this is a thriller, a race against time full of puzzles. <br /> <br /> the plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I have never been a big fan of Hanks, but he has given good results. I noticed his denim shirt (the one full of blood) because I look for one like this in vain! The Italian researcher is a brilliant newcomer to me, but I really applauded the portrait of Ewan MacGregor: his inner faith and calm are truly impressive. <br /> <br /> I really like the debate between science and religion. The action that takes place in the Vatican seemed like a vacation to me. In the end, I'm not sure it helps to add new converts to Christianity. With all the presence of gold and man shown, everyone would wonder what charity means and why women are so discarded from ecclesiastical life while representing half or more of the believers.
