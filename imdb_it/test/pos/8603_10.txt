Black Rain is a superb film, but watch out for DVDs up to $ 300 each. I have the DVD, and it's terrible. Very small image, not anamorphic, which must be enlarged up to resolution. Acceptable sound This is a primitive DVD that * must * absolutely * be released again. <br /> <br /> BTW, I also own the laserdisc and the Black Rain VHS. The VHS is a huge step forward from the DVD! And the laserdisc has by far the best image of all subtitles in black, clear, large, simple but very good soundtrack. Buy the VHS and avoid the absurd prices that these scam artists require!
