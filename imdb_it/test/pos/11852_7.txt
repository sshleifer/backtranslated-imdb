[NOTICE: CONTAINS SPOILER] <br /> <br /> Written by Wally Wolodarsky, husband and wife (also direct) and Maya Forbes, this independent film is one of the most romantic comedies in recent memory. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr takes a break from playing thin weasels to be the good guy faced with the fact that his girlfriend wants to sleep with other people and he is allowed to do it too. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good at "Tully", plays boldly and vulnerably with great enthusiasm. Too bad he doesn't get the recognition he deserves. <br /> <br /> Also good support performances help immensely. Lauren Graham, who made memorable the "Bad Santa" memorabilia of last year, perfectly interprets her tired and cynical sister, Bryan Cranston (her father in "Malcolm in the Middle") gets some funny and vulgar moments, and Andy Richter plays a brilliant boy who falls in love with a single mother - Helen Slater in a credible role, even if familiar, like a mousy woman. <br /> <br /> What surprised me the most about "Seeing Other People" was fun. There are some genuine laughs here. The first attempt at Ed of nonsense sex has broad lines, and there is a m√©nage a trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from a man while the male fantasy is optimized. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is not unusual, but I liked that it was Alice (Nicholson) who thought about it, much to the displeasure of Ed (Mohr). Given the genre, you know that no matter how good his intentions are, Alice's plan is doomed. Let's see how the couple works through this strange situation. Initially, Alice and Ed are turned on by the idea, but then the human element sets it. <br /> <br /> I appreciated that Forbes and Wolodarsky didn't turn it into a cheap sex game. Yes, there is sex and nudity, but there are also real emotions at work here. The "other people" that Alice and Ed make friends do not want to be objects of casual sex; they also have feelings. In one case, too many feelings. <br /> <br /> Of course, some scenes play too many jokes, the Richter-Slater subplot is unnecessary and Alice does something really unusual. But this is forgivable because Mohr and Nicholson generate such great intimacy and honesty: take a look at the scenes in which Ed ruins Alice's underwear drawer or her reaction to her announcement on the conclusion of the experiment - that no matter how we can enjoy their little game, we root for this couple to succeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film received little, if any, advertising and a limited version. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often veer on little, turgid and surprising, would do well to learn from this clever and funny film.
