I have just revisited this bit of cinematic madness remembered with affection since my first days, and I must urge you to ask for alms or borrow it. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a duel between a virtuous Shaolin priest and our bad Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White kicks the Buddhist donkey and campaigns against Shaolin without hindrance with the help of his new ninja allies (a gold suit that fights with a gold ring, a black one that fights with a spear, and my favorite, one who fights with a pair of knives that can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet). The rest of the story concerns the training of disciples of Shaolin monks killed by the white abbot, one of whom is Alexander Lo Rei. While we are treated to the punitive training sequences that the two young avengers have to go through to learn the Shaolin Finger Jab technique needed to defeat Abbot White's invincible armor technique, let's see some of the ways our bad guy keeps fit. .. mostly using Taoist magic to extract blood from naked women. We all know how it will end, but it is the psychedelic journey we are here for. In conclusion, this is a good example of what Taiwan was doing when Hong Kong was getting sick of martial arts films, and this is making an increasingly outrageous martial arts film. This film is very well choreographed, has some nude scenes, some blood and enough balls for the wall to entertain even the most weary spectator. Visit your local Beewise today! <br /> <br />
