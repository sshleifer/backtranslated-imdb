Even if unrealistic things happen at the end (ie a cop shooting a gun in a crowded carousel where all innocent numbers can be killed), this was still an intense and pleasant thriller, one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. Robert Walker is excellent as the crazy fool, really convincing in giving a fascinating performance that is sometimes too disturbing. His co-star here, Farley Granger, is ok, but he can't compete with Walker, either in acting or in the characters they play. It is the typical Hitchcock film with some strange shooting angles, immoral themes, the innocent gets into trouble, etc. Unlike many of his other films, I thought this was a fast-moving story with a few boring points. Being a former tennis player, I enjoyed his filming of some excellent old network games that featured some good rallies. Hitchcock's daughter, in real life, Patricia has an interesting and unique secondary character here. He didn't just get the job because of his father; you can act Furthermore, the DVD has both the English and the American versions and there have been some differences in the story. This is a classic film that is still referred to in today's films, even in comedies like "Throw Momma Off The Train".
