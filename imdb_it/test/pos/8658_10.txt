Synopsis: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself alone on a bus, falling into a deserted land, in what appears to be the last leg of his journey. He doesn't know how he got there, but a welcome sign was erected for him. After having momentarily meditated on where he is, he is greeted by a man who takes him into his new life. Then enter a world different from the one from which it comes. <br /> <br /> As Andreas quickly introduces himself to his new job as an accountant, he feels that his surroundings are a bit too uniform for his tastes. While taking his first lunch break, he immediately realizes that everyone in the city is walking around in gray. On the same day, he sees a business partner dead on some fencing points, of what appears to be an act of suicide. The strange thing is that the people of the city pay no attention to this horrible act and walk as if it never happened. It is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitized and their ability to distinguish between anything human or inhuman is absent. <br /> <br /> To help Andreas settle in, he is invited to go out with his co-workers at a local nightclub. The club seems to be on the verge of becoming as exciting as a bingo night ... and while Andreas drinks his sorrows, he realizes that no matter how much he drinks, alcohol has no effect on him. While telling these observances to a stranger in the men's room, a man in a toilet begins to utter words that have always been in Andreas's mind. Realizing that this man is thinking what he is, he follows him to his home and notices where he lives for future reference. The plot evolves in a predictable way with Andreas who wants an escape route. Look for the man he followed once ... hoping he could take him back to being human ... but is it too late? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: this Norwegian film is something that everyone should see, as it contains the answer to the big question! What is the meaning of life? (well, pretty close). The film outlines the dark realities of what has now become the working man (or woman). Its sole purpose is to make people understand that life is too short to be materialistic. Try to show that the little clich√© things, like the sound of children playing, shouldn't be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing that sound, it's the time when you're one step away from becoming a robot. The ending of the film reaffirms what happens when it is too late to escape the banal routine you are used to now. You start adopting the saying 'if it's not broken, don't fix it' and it becomes too comfortable to risk change. <br /> <br /> Although this film should not be taken as a piece of realism ... its message is more than real. The lack of empathy transmitted in the film, and that of which Andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can become. The director, Jens Lien, has put together a film, which would have failed in the hands of any other director. This is a beautiful piece of cinematic genius, and I look forward to seeing what he does next. <br /> <br /> The main role, played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag, is perfectly fused. Representing the average Joe, Trond provides a good catalyst in making this image obscurely humorous. Even the secondary actors do a suitable job and, for some reason, I think Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this film, since most of the supporting cast required that their acting be emotionless. <br /> <br /> for this film it was beautifully composed. The recurring theme was always a pleasure to listen to, and provided a very dark but pleasing aspect to the film. <br /> <br /> Set for a UK release date for May 25, 2007, I will definitely be going to relive this experience on the big screen. This film made its way into my top 10 ... now it's quickly becoming my top 20! It has some shocking scenes, and it's darkly humorous for everything ... A MUST-SEE !!
