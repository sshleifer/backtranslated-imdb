"Americans Next Top Model" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9% of the time to watch it. I kept my eyes open all the time. (well, I blinked) It can be sad, funny or addictive (mostly compelling) "America's Next Top Model" made me want more and that's pretty much the point. It's also on that channel more. Sometimes it's on MTV and sometimes it's not. I hope he will become more fans and become a successful series! It's great for pretty much all ages, so everyone can have fun! :) <br /> <br /> Also, if you've watched the show before, haven't you noticed that Tyra has a different hair style every time in the evaluation room? He will do it short and curly a week, and then long and straight next.
