This was one of the best half-hour horror / suspense / fantasy shows of the eighties, no doubt. Assuming the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode, and it smelled down to production values ​​(ie sets), but damn it, I have to give it some credit for being brave with plots. I mean, the plot of each episode was sharp enough that even I, an inveterate horror movie, a shock-film and a 70-year-old fan, was a bit disgusted and scared. Great show, just great, regardless of what other reviewers have said here. My favorite episode was called "Bug House", yes, was that the title I think? However, it still gives me the thrill whenever I think about it until almost 20 years after it was presented for the first time. Other shows like "Tales From The Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" were much better as far as production values ​​are concerned, but in my opinion they have nothing to do with the plot lines compared to this little sick show! It has definitely paved the way for the even more classic phenomenon of graphic worship, "Tales From The Crypt".
