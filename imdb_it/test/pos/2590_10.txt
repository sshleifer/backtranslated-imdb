Strangely, short films like this get a 10. Why? They are fun. This is fun. Notice a lot about the bizarre humor. Dated and childish to the toon, they don't know what they're talking about. They learned that cartoons are not just for children. The art in this is probably the best non-Road Runner art of the Looney Tunes shorts of the 50s. It's hard to come across something better than art in "The Great Piggy Bank Robbery", though it never will. This probabley performs a 3rd or 2nd closure. Shot glasses like this could have generated unnecessary scams from LT like Tiny Toons Adventures to try to squeeze out all the old comedies over and over again, like the great movies like Scream that generated crap like I Know ... which was released just to squeeze all the old Scream horror, but like Scream, it's great on its own. Chuck Jones has had his flaws with his shorts once in a while, but he compensates for them. Take Hopper for example. Few people like Hopper, but they never ruined the LT reputation, but I'm sure this was his trick on things like that. Bottom line: This is not as good as "Duck! Rabbit! Duck!", But close. Capture it often on Cartoon Network.
