"Lonely among us" is certainly one of the best episodes of the first season. The plot, although a bit confusing, creates a lot of suspense, supported by the soundtrack driven by the gruesome creepy. This is a typical scenario of "invasion of foreign bodies" but in the end it does not turn out to be an evil purpose (the death of chief assistant engineer Singh to me was an accident). The two delegated species offer a fun frame (the best trick so far), finally adding a little black humor to the series (the final scene). Patrick Stewart obviously likes to get a little out of his Picard character and explore a new terrain, as Data does by introducing himself as Sherlock Holmes (another classic of all time). The special effects are also convincing and the director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first to try to compensate for Trois' lack of acting ability by improving his appearance. She looks beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress greatly improves her appearance. Picard's "flash scene" on the bridge gives him a slight air of Star Wars emperor "Return of the Jedi" (which is a personal impression but made me smile). <br /> <br /> There is also some game with corridor lighting (simulating the night aboard) and the first moving camera, pulling back from Picard when entering the transporter room to radiate into the cloud .. . Good job. The smart cut, which creates a continuous dialogue through different scenes (Troi's hypnosis report) summarizes the impression of a really well done TNG episode. The first, where even Wesley Crusher seemed almost tolerable ... <br /> <br /> The ending however is a bit confusing, just as if the producers were running out of time. "P for Picard" is a bit far-fetched and his return is too easy but this can be left aside with regards to the many strong moments that this episode has to offer ...
