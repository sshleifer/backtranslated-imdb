This game is very good for the n64. You can skate like Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska and maybe a little more skaters. The game has no Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is fantastic. The School II level is a great level with lots of skateboarding. In Career mode, collect SKATE, get money, get better scores and other things in 2 minutes. There is a skater, which is quite nice. I created a figure skater named Butt Mulligan, a black guy with an afro and a girl board. There is a park editor, some fantastic premade parks, free skateboarding, and there is a single session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score. You can watch replays, which is always nice. Each skater has 2 styles: A and B. The graphics are not good. Well, they're perfect for a n64 game. I would like to have a controller pack so I can save my data. Overall, this game is fantastic. I give him an 8/10 for n64. But with the GBA version, it's just as fun as the n64 version, but rather hard to control. I give him a 7/10 for GBA. So, go to a place that still sells n64 games and get a copy. There are also versions for PS1.
