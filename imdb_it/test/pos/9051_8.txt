This 60-minute film shows how fun cinema can be. It's all very funny, as it stages a play with no holds barred in the Star Trek genre. In "Hick Trek - The Moovie", a group of good guys has the mission to stop a group of renegade cats to destroy the entire Redneck Federation. <br /> <br /> Can Captain Jerk stop the evil Fluffy with the power of the RSS Bovine and is Cow Ray ?? He could have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! This cult classic (previously seen only in scifi conventions) is a favorite for parties. Lots of fun moments!
