This great film never appeared in my city, so I didn't actually have the opportunity to see it until the late 1980s when I took it on German television. I was expecting something catastrophic, and instead I found a great western well done with excellent localization work. The small tube can't really damage it and there is hardly a dull moment in this 4-hour movie, so I hope to see it again on the big screen. What a show it would be! Don't miss it if you have the chance. Unfortunately the harsh treatment of "Heaven's Gate" at its opening ruined Michael Cimino's career and moved from the passable ("Year of the Dragon") to the boringly boring ("The Sicilian") and the shrill silent ("Desperate Hours ").
