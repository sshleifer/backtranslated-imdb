"Walking with dinosaurs" is absolutely brilliant in every respect. Kenneth Branagh tells in a way that really makes you want to listen. The script of the documentary really sounds like researchers and writers have done their homework, is so perceptive and makes you passionate and never give up. Even the music is brilliant, very dramatic when it has to be. But the visual effects and the landscape are what make this documentary so well functioning. The scenery is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so real, thanks to the simply stunning effects. This is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but also children. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a must-look. Not only did I love it, but this is probably the best documentary I've ever seen. If anything, it could have been longer, apart from that it's perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
