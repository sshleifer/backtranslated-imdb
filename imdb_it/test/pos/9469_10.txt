I thought this movie was absolutely fun. I already knew it would be a fun movie, but it was more fun than I expected. Of course, there were some limping jokes, but they put me in crisis. I thought the actors would be pretty bad, but the actors were good at playing this comedy. I have to congratulate Amanda Bynes, she looked surprisingly like her brother and did a fantastic performance as a boy. As for the other actors, they too were fun. Of course there were times when you screamed at the screen "how can you not say that?", But it's all part of the fun. In the end the plot turned out to be pretty good. There is a happy ending, but what did you expect. <br /> <br /> Overall, simply exhilarating.
