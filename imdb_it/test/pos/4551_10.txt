The commercial success of Peter Segal in 1995 and the cult classic 'Tommy Boy' is an exhilarating film, an evergreen entertainer. Chris Farley is a talent we will never forget !!! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' is a simple story, told in the most fun and crazy way possible. Farley & Spade embark on a journey full of unstoppable laughter, even Rob Lowe's part is damn funny. As a child, I remember watching "Tommy Boy" again and again and again. It was one of my childhood favorites and will remain forever. Even today when it arrives on T.V. I keep it as a huge fan. I'm quite possessive about this movie. <br /> <br /> Segal's management is super. Chris Farley may have died in 1997, but at least for me he's alive. What an actor! Watch his work on 'Tommy Boy', he is so at ease. He has made fantastic performances later in films like "Berverly Hills Ninja" and "Almost Heroes", but his work here remains the best so far! I love you, Farley! Spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. He is an excellent actor in all respects! <br /> <br /> rules of 'Tommy Boy' .... 100 inches up from this author!
