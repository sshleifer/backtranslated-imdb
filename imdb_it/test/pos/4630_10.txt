I think this film should be one of the most moving and heartbreaking films of recent times. <br /> <br /> The film basically starts with a suicide in a school bathroom. You don't see who he is, then from there he goes to the beginning of the day, and we learn about 6 characters, and they are going through some pretty heavy things, however in the end one of them will commit suicide. /> <br /> I have been teaching Physical Education in schools for 8 years, and never in a film have I seen such an accurate portrait of what "really" happens in school life. <br /> <br /> The film is shot beautifully, and it looks incredible. <br /> <br /> The ending is so overwhelming, and therefore what one would not expect, is something that will haunt me for the days to come. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one to watch. <br /> <br /> I think the fact that the director / writer was in school only a few years ago is an important factor contributing to the raw honesty expressed in the film. <br /> <br /> If you want, the film is shot in two separate "modes". First there is the simple style of observation in which we know the characters in their school environment as they face their drama, but the most beautiful part of the film is in the interview sections, where we learn about the characters' stories and their deeper, darker thoughts. <br /> <br /> Keep asking yourself, who will be (who commits suicide) and while the drama takes place, keep changing your mind, until bam, hits you in the face in the last five minutes. I'm in seventh place in my writing, but I've just seen it in a media projection in Australia, and I'm still a little shocked. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best Australian films I've seen in recent years.
