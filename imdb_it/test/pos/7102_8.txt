I liked House of Dracula much more than Frankenstein's house. Carradine is much more passable and his acting is not so ridiculous and overboard as in HOF. Actors offer fairly solid performances. The subplots (for example the monster, the village mafia, the village idiot, the hump nurse, etc.) are mixed well, so that nobody becomes an odd splinter like in HOF. Better to run than the HOF sewn together. The hump nurse is as nice as the HOF hunchback. The doctor is very good. Furthermore, Lon Chaney adds a touch of class to his wolfman. It is worth looking twice. A universal horror classic with that typical of the 40s, a taste long lost. Particularly good is the doctor's performance before / after his blood has been contaminated by Dracula.
