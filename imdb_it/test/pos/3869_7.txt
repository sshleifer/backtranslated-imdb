Bart The Genius Although not the first episode of the Simpsons, Bart he Genius is more or less the first typical episode. There is no ingenuity or theme is just the typical episode of Simpson in the set-up. It always seems to me that it's an episode that grows about you. There are some elements that I don't care about, mostly the spotted animation that can be forgiven. But over time I really like this story of its uniqueness. <br /> <br /> For example, it would be very difficult for a live-action sitcom with a standard budget to do this episode due to the various different sets they show in this episode, the computer bays in Mrs. Melon's class the work and so on. My point is that, The Simpsons realizes one of the greatest strengths in animation. The absolute lack of visual limits compared to live action. <br /> <br /> In terms of writing, it is also very intelligent and fresh. The concept is quite unique, and in particular the problems faced. Instead of the old security system that the work was too difficult, it was simply the social isolation of Bart from his classmates that betrayed him (even if the scientific experiment that explodes can prove the contrary ... which I think is also a of the best visual gags in the series.) The ending seems a bit unoriginal, largely because the Bart who ran naked in his room to avoid Homer was already in his shorts, but still fun for Marge and Lisa, if not anything. <br /> <br /> After all, this is a very nice episode, with lots of interesting new points in the series, although not exactly perfect. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the now iconic name of Kwijybo has obviously been unleashed on the world.
