With the acting in this film, it is sometimes difficult NOT to imagine that the cast is who they are portraying. Unbridled passion and acting sometimes make this film very fun and engaging. I would never know anything about it except for HBO late at night. And the main reason why I prefer British films much better than American ones is that actors are not afraid to play what is necessary.
