As other people have written, I am a huge Mario fan and I love this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts off slightly boring, but believe me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your boyfriend! The levels are fun and exciting. They will hook you up until your mind becomes mash. I'm not kidding. This game is also orchestrated and is well done. <br /> <br /> To keep this spoiler free, I have to keep my mouth shut on the details. But please try this game! It will be worth it! <br /> <br /> Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's so beautiful!) Hardness: 10 Attention grabbers: 10 Average: 10
