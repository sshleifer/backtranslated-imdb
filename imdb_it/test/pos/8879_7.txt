Now, Throw Momma from the Train wasn't a great comedy, but it's a lot of fun and makes you laugh. The title may seem a bit strange, but the whole film is not literally about this, even if it is something equally sinister. <br /> <br /> Danny De Vito practically wants to kill his overbearing mother and a little forward, some random and fun events take place. The premise is pretty funny, and the things that Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito came in were great. Some scenes didn't seem to fit for me, but this wasn't a bad movie. <br /> <br /> For what it is, an extravagant comedy, it pulls it off well and should be seen once just to say you've seen it.
