I hope Robert Redford continues to make other films like this. Hillerman's books are wonderful and, as a child growing up in the southwest, his stories came home! Adam Beach is a very under rated and under used actor. Wake up Hollywood, not everyone thinks your Mel Gibsons are fantastic! Today, many viewers want to see films that make you think. I've seen the whole Redford / Hillerman series. They are considerate, scenic and have great textures. I hope that if enough people write to Robert Redford, he might decide to make a few more! Thanks Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for entertainment! If anyone has the chance to read the latest Tony Hillerman book, do it! It's great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop in every point of view and feel the setting of the Hillerman books. Extraordinary experience.
