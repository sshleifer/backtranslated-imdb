Billy Crystal is Larry, a writer who did not write and is suspected of murder in "Throw Momma from the Train", with Danny Devito and Anne Ramsey. The phrase "black comedy" was invented for this madness, which is a take-off of "Strangers on a Train" by Hitchcock. In fact, Owen (Devito) has the idea of ​​having Larry kill his mother in exchange for Owen who kills Larry's ex from watching that famous movie. "I saw the movie. Crossbreed," says Owen to Larry. Not that Larry knows what he's talking about until it seems like it's too late - just like "Foreigners". Larry, a writing teacher, claims that his ex-wife, played by Kate Mulgrew, stole his book and put his name on it. She became a great celebrity, appearing on "Oprah", where she refers to Larry as "a beast". Owen is in Larry's class. He lives with an abusive Neanderthal mother (Ramsey) and has visions of poisoning her, putting a pair of scissors in his head - you name it. Not long after seeing "Strangers on a Train" which is in Honolulu, chasing Larry's wife. While leaning against a railing of the boat trying to get an earring, Owen stands behind her and creeps in ... Soon the police are looking for Larry to question him, but it's from Owen where he's encouraged to live up to the end of a bargain he had no idea he had done it. You know, "crossovers". There are several scenes copied from "Foreigners", which are hilarious. I particularly appreciated Larry's confession to the sleeping lady Lift, Owen's mother, similar to when Guy thinks he is talking to Bruno's stepfather. <br /> <br /> Crystal and DeVito are full masters of comic dialogue and timing and will let you laugh, often out loud. Ramsey is repulsively funny - a performance totally "out there". Kim Griest and Rob Reiner also have roles: Griest is Crystal's girlfriend, and Reiner has a cameo. <br /> <br /> The ending is very clever and the whole movie will leave you speechless.
