This is easily one of the best films of the 50s. Otto Preminger has only directed four or five really good films and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and the soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein is dynamite. From the opening titles (of Saul Bass) to the addiction of addict Frank going cold, this is a compelling film! With Kim Novak (who gave a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (who gave a bad performance) and Darren McGavin in the role of reptile pusher and Arnold Stang in the role of Frank's partner. Beware of bad prints: this film is in the public domain, so some copies are quite difficult.
