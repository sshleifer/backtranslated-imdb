I watch the show every day and it's very funny. It provides technological news updates, video games almost all geeks. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a fanatic, players or anything else, you will enjoy this show. They definitely increased their game from the guy under the review of me (2006). It's the only place where I get my technical information. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments that refer to things in the game, in the movie, in the comic strip ... in the universe. If you know those universes you will understand the lines. In short, aots is a hilarious show that gives me and everyone all the news about anything and everything you care about. I'm looking at it right now as I write this, I'm "in" San Diego covering the air races of the red bulls. Sweet.
