I really liked the movie, I thought it was very funny and dramatic. But I just had a question about music is the film. I haven't been able to find any kind of soundtrack (if there is even one). And in particular, I was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the kids are coming down the river to New Orleans? I thought it was something along the lines of "My great escape", but I searched the internet for books, pretty much everything I could think of trying, and I can't find it anywhere. If anyone could help him it would be much appreciated. Thank you.
