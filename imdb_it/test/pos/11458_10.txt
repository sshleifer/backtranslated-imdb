This film was fantastic, I don't understand the lack of respect it gets. The first scene is similar to 87-88 and it was really scary, if you are a horror fan from the 80s you should have no problems with this movie it has everything that makes the 80s horror fantastic. I met some actors and they were fantastic. What is not nice about a disturbing old house, demons, crazy and horny young parties. The dialogue and the special fx have made this film a classic. This film also dealt with one of those classic horror voices that the black guy shouldn't die at the end. Although this film was great, there is one thing that is not yet clear to me. the end was on purpose or not that small side story that left me perplexed.
