Being from the eastern PA, right on the border with northern New Jersey, I still have the feeling that this was a documentary rather than a film. I have friends from New York and New Jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that "still" exists today in the low-income area outside the "Big City" lifestyle. If you haven't seen this movie and you've ever wondered what's really going to happen in the urban jungle, watch this movie. There are no big name actors, it's like pulling these kids out of the street and saying acting, which adds to the film's realism, however the performances are FANTASTIC! SEE THIS FILM!
