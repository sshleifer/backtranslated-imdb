Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great TV movie for all ages. The film focuses on "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on a trip to gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This TV movie was simply fantastic. The acting is number 1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about Goldrush. I recommend this TV movie to everyone without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
