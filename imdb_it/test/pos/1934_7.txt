One of Lionel Barrymore's latest DIRECTED films, "Ten Cents a Dance" features Barbara Stanwyck as the "Barbara" dancer in her sixth role. Stanwyck seems rather "simple-jane" in this, and opens with her being chewed by the director of the ballroom. Then comes the rich Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to wipe it out. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the thirties). Then he meets Eddie, who is very different from the Carlton. The writer, Jo Swerling, had worked on biggies (Its a Wonderful Life, Guys and Dolls, and Gone with the Wind), so I was surprised that the characters and the script were so common. The story starts to get more interesting halfway, and it's VERY similar to "The Bride Walks Out" from 1936, even with Stanwyck .... T.B.W.O. is much smarter, but also more docile, due to the Hays on-slaught code ...
