I'm a great Gone With The Wind but I was disappointed that both Gone With The Wind and Scarlett the mini series are so different from the books. Gone With The Wind left so many things in the movie that they were in the book and did the same with Scarlett. Both were good movies, but I really liked both books. There were so many characters left out by Scarlett, and the age of some characters didn't seem to match the book. Even the time lines do not coincide. Scarlett realizes that she is pregnant on the ship in Ireland in the book, but realizes it when she is vomiting while in Savahanna. Sally also turned out to be an ugly monkey as a woman in the book and the film chose Jean Smart to play it, which is obviously not a bad woman. Overall, Scarlett is a good movie, and helps anyone who has been disappointed with the way Gone With The Wind ended up, to see what would have happened if Margaret Mitchell had lived to write a sequel herself.
