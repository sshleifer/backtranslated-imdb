Is it a bad, vulgar, predictable, nasty, salacious soap opera? "The Best of Everything" is such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of "Valley of the Dolls". I mean, "Best" has it all. Someone gets pregnant out of wedlock (when is the last time you heard THIS sentence?), There is business everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy and even a tragic but not entirely unexpected death. <br /> <br /> Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delightful Stephen Boyd) are the fulcrum of what happens. Their chemistry is immediate and it is the glue that prevents this film from becoming too fragmented. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker, the gorgeous ex-model ex-graphic model, appears as Gregg Adams, an aspiring theater actress, a role that, according to any biography I've ever read about her, was apparently not too long. But Parker does a surprisingly believable job here, rather than keeping her in a couple of scenes in front of Louis Jourdan who plays David Savage. Jourdan probably took this role for the money and the special credit for the screen because he was clearly headed towards the old star / was street. <br /> <br /> Diane Baker looks good as naive, naive April Morrison, Martha Hyer as Barbara Lemont has a particularly juicy plot, and movie legend Joan Crawford chews her usual set design as Amanda Farrow, another role, like Jourdan's Savage, that Crawford probably took for salary. <br /> <br /> There is obviously dated dialogues and plot devices (this is 1959), and the predictability of the soap opera genre. But if you like a good soap like me, "The best of everything" will satisfy you more.
