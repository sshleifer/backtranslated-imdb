All interested in Texas must have this DVD. It's just a good movie about real Texas with great scenes. It took a lot of Texans to get it right. Hollywood would never have had it. There are so many subtle things that Tubb has included in the film and may not even have thought of, but it does make the show. <br /> <br /> The guests' cameos are by no means seen as cameos. Each star fits perfectly and does not distract from the film. Many of the guest commercials come together so perfectly that when the credits roll up, you'll go back into the movie to find the character. Strait's roll is dead, could not have been better in real life. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film is completely different from the first, it's a bit "hokey", but that's fine. Somehow the plot works. The "hokey" stuff is like a special after-school but it seems credible and natural. <br /> <br /> I've never heard anyone use the Sonny Pruitt line before, apart from the places I grew up with. This was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely a collection, right there with Pure Country, Sugarland Express, Jenn Bonner, Texasville, The Last Picture Show, Giant, and of course Hud. <br /> <br /> Gig'em Aggies '86
