Crimson starts with nice jazz music, so I liked it right away, but over time I started wondering if the music wasn't the best part. We have some thieves throwing a jewel and when one does something wrong the alarm goes off and the cops chase them and when the car turns around one of the thieves around a roadblock (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, whoever's here ) gets shot. Now, it seems he could die but with the help of a drunken doctor and his mad scientist-friend (and wife) he is saved, with a part of the brain of a nightclub owner called "The Sadist". The sadist is unlucky because the gentlemen who kidnapped him have lost the knife to take it off is the head, so to add insult to injury (or, in this case, to death), they take off their heads using a train, leaving the body to the authorities to find, oops. Once the brain transplant is complete, Naschy wants to devastate any woman approaching him, because he now has the mentality of his donor. Well, of course this is all quite unlikely and has medical equipment that appears to have been purchased by Radio Shack, and overall is pretty bad and shabby. But it looks good in the early 1970s and the music is beautiful. This isn't so much a horror movie, but more like a thriller with a lot of thugs fighting on turf and babes and other thug stuff, but it's strangely funny in ways I can't begin to describe. 7 out of 10.
