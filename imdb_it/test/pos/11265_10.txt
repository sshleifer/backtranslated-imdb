This performance leaves you wanting. We saw it in Offenbach, Germany, and it is breathtaking. We only got cheap tickets at the back, but we still had a view on everything that happened. If you ever have the chance to see this live, then GO! It's worth the trip and if I were you, I'll wait a good half hour after the show to "cool off". The performances are breathtaking and all around the tent there are interpreters dressed in colors who are there to distract, help, smile and generally make the whole tent alive. Music - live music !! - it's as good as the CD version: perfect! I bought a DVD later but the show that was filmed had less colorful costumes. It's the atmosphere in the tent that sweeps you from your feet. A great journey for old and young, and even a great film
