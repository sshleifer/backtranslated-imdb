First of all, by the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what Kittiwake-1 had written about this game and I was confused. This is a video game and not a real movie. I mean, I'd choose a good Deniro movie or video game every day myself. But, man, what are you talking about? Now that I've got him out of the way, let's move on, do we have to? The adaptation of the video game of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you can imagine, based on the film of the same name. What's more strange is that this was released three years after the release of the film. Whether it's due to slow development or simply laziness, nobody really knows. At least, I don't. <br /> <br /> The game allows the player to play like the four main characters of the movie: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi and Dark Cloud (whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for gameplay separate.) All four of these characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the film. However, the real attractions are the evasion moves that allow each character to avoid the attacks of an enemy in the most impossible and gravity-defying ways that were first shown in the film. <br /> <br /> The story is obviously based on the story told in the film. The story of the game is told using CG films and spoken in a subtitled Mandarin language (A nice touch, considering that I preferred the film's foreign language track compared to the dubbed one). The story goes on to expand on what might have happened to the other characters during the film and also (No real surprises since practically all video game adaptations have done this) alters what officially happened in the movie to make the game more active. I never thought Jade Fox would go so far as to go get some hired goon. <br /> <br /> The real bonus to the story is the ability to decide how the game ends. What if Jen had all the ingredients to treat the Li-Mu-Bi in her possession? What if Jen didn't give her the comb back? And if Li-Mu-Bi had not recovered the green destiny for the second time? Your actions will decide the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. This is really the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> However, for all its strengths, it also shows some flaws. Enemies often tend to become a nuisance after a while and the camera angle tends to be fixed at the most useless points. Not even the special features (which are unlocked after beating the game) are good enough to forgive even those difficulties that are imposed on the player. <br /> <br /> If you love the movie, you could enjoy the game. However, this game is the only way you can immerse yourself in a playable version of such a beautiful and surprising film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, you could have chosen a Deniro movie.
