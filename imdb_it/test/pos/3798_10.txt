He's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. He remembers the soul of the city of New York at the time, an extraordinarily strange man with a bizarre plan, hoisted from his firecracker and finally retired to the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, it's the life you see through magic glasses, see things as they are "really" ... I don't think it was ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone could Tivo it and put it out there. A kidnapping goes wrong: mixed in a rainstorm, flowing in and out or in shops, our hero throws a raincoat on his prey and throws it in his bike-powered ice cream buggy the door to his basement apartment in the village . He is amazed, surprised and incredibly disappointed when the casings come off: instead of a sensual lady, he captures a middle-aged suburban housewife who talks, talks and talks. The film is full of cartoons of commuter life, suburban life, city officials and all such tender attitudes. It pushes the limits of comedy, as magical reality could push a drama, just as Daffy Duck is able to draw on imaginative scenes to demonstrate his condition or desires, all at the limit of plausibility. Everything is humorous, nobody is bad.
