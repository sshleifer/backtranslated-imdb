I went to see this movie out of curiosity and to solve a topic. The film is now better known from the music suite that Sergei Prokofiev extracted from his music by way of the film, the Troika movement that also stood out in the pop arrangements. The general scheme of the plot is well known from the notes on the cover of various recordings. An employee accidentally generates a non-existent Lieutenant Kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar. The tsar is interested in this person, and rather than telling him that he does not exist, the courtiers and officers maintain the claim to be real. Kizhe is exiled in Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, a state funeral is celebrated, revealed as an embezzler and uprooted posthumously in ranks. <br /> <br /> I heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented Kizhe, involving ink stains and sneezing, but I had heard that the film was lost, so there was no way to find out what happens. Then the film arrived at London's Barbican as part of their Prokofiev festival. For the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words as he writes an order and turns Kuzhe into Kizhe. Since the tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there is no time to correct the error. <br /> <br /> Having waited for a historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is very funny and the audience, including myself, has been laughing constantly. Although most of it is filmed directly, set mainly in the building, there are some "make-up" shots where multiple images appear on the screen. For example, the Tsar's army is represented by a small group, repeated on the screen. Four identical guards perform a perfect drill in perfect unison. Two identical servants clean the floor. <br /> <br /> A small inconvenience was that it was very difficult to understand who everyone was. There were two women who could have been the tsar's daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else. And very few people have been named. But all in all, it's a funny movie and I'm surprised it doesn't show up anymore.
