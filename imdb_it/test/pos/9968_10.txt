I saw The Merchant of Venice in London last week. Great acting of Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compared to other films based on Shakespeare's play, this production has made the game so easy to understand and follow. Good for Michael Radford for directing such prominent actors. The costume and the scenery are fantastic and since it was shot on location in Venice, it gives the film an authentic flavor. I had read the drama more than thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the anti-Semitic behavior of the characters towards the Jews and on the cruelty of the Christians. I don't know if this film will be controversial, but in any case I'm sure it will get a few Oscar nominations.
