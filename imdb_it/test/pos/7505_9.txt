Being a retired medical / health camp "toiler in the vinyard" I never tire of seeing this movie. Paddy Chayefsky was a friend of my college teacher and visited him and us during several classes in 1958. His writing skills have stood the test of time and "the hospital" is as fresh as it was in 1971. I can watch it every week and still find something new. So many support cast members have gone on to bigger and better roles both on TV and in movies. George Scott has only made a few comedies, but his timing and patter are as good as Jackie Gleason and Steve Msrtin. Mental humor rather than physical / slapstick always wins in my book. And again a film for families with only 1 word of 4 letters throughout the film
