First of all, let me tell you that I find films like Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile, and most of Spielberg is utterly hideous and stomach-turned. Although the National Velvet on the surface would seem to be of the same kind and has moments that deserve to be heard, I liked it very much, laughing and screaming throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The premise of the plot a young girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the Grand National is certainly not plausible, but it is the only thing you have to accept because it works like a fairy tale or a allegory. The characters have depth and grow throughout history. Ann Revere offers an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever represented in an American film. His interaction with Donald Crisp's good heart is fun and sweet. While Liz Taylor tries a little too much to be even prettier than Margaret O'Brien (she succeeds), her passion and her love for her horse shine through her face. Mickey Rooney offers a wonderfully nuanced performance by the trainer. <br /> <br /> This is far from a perfect movie. Some situations and scenes are a bit trivial and dated (the antics of the boys, and Rooney's scenes on the track and in the pub, for example) but it doesn't matter. The plot remains true to the characters and leaves a little unspoken. We don't have unnatural moments that are overly dramatic and beloved - sometimes more is less. The final scene is a great example of this: emotional dialogue is left to the viewer to fill. <br /> <br /> Simple performance, rounded characters, concise dialogue, intelligent and coherent internal plot. We believe in the characters and we are moved by their story. Yes, they just don't make them that way anymore ...
