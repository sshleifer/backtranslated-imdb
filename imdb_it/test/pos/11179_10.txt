This was my second experience on the Monkey Island series, the seven years after they showed me the first game. What was my answer? "Oh, great, we're playing cartoon." I'm glad my brother silenced me and kept playing, because the jokes caught my eye once again, as did the wonderful voice of Guybrush's Army - not to mention all the other good facts (I still think that CMI's Elaine sounds better than EMI). Movies are good for illustrating something that happens, and the art of playing and movies is excellent. When we found the CD with the originals, Secret and LeChuck's Revenge, we were both ecstatic and spent hours working through revenge - a moment like that when we sat down and spent half a day there. However, CMI must be the Monkey Island game that I played the most, especially for the return of the sword fight and offshore combat. That moment when you meet Kenny and he tells you he went straight and then, "I'm running guns!" I had my brother and I in tears of laughter. And this is not the best part of the game, not by far.
