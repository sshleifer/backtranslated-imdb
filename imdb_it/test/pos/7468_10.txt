This film is exceptional! On this date of APR, 8 2007 was on request from the moment of the show. It had been a while since I saw it, but it features Thomas Jane in the first role I saw him in. At first you see a normal boy who seems a little tormented, with a wife who seems close to doing his way. The cut directors I just saw have an opening scene that is beautiful. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader, looking very fresh and warm. Trying to buy a late-night coffee without small bills becomes violent quickly, Paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal. Meeting up with his old street friend, Nick played by Aaron Eckhart, was nice at first, and even loaned his wife's car to do some business. Then find a silver briefcase, and the day changes for the strange and the violent. There is a cast of real characters that parade in the next set of scenes. But, Paulina's Dallas steals the show I think. Telling a story about Casey to the doctor who is there to get a personal interview in an adoption application is outrageous. As a rule I never thought that tall women were so sexy, but as in every rule there are exceptions. Paulina is like she has never seen it before in movies. Sexy and lethal, as in the only film with Tom Selleck, but with a malevolence never seen before. If you are looking for a movie to add to your collection, this is worth the price. Paulina in the nude alone is worth the price, but this story has everything you can hope for. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a fantastic mix. When I saw it for the first time, years ago, it occurred to me, and I know you will feel the same way.
