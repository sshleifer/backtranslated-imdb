Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much-needed parody by Mel Brooks. He is in charge of spoofing the legacy of Robin Hood and the pair of films that deal with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood. He is looking for some good men who will join him in his quest to bring down the evil Nottingham sheriff (Roger Rees) and win the proud hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis). Tracey Ullman is the co-star of Prince John's personal witch Latrine who has eyes on the Sheriff. Will Robin find his cheerful men? How far will it go to throw the prince's weight in his father's absence? Why does the sheriff hate Robin so much? To find out you have to look at ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS !! Discover the exhilarating cameo by Dom De Luise who plays the Duke of Jersey. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
