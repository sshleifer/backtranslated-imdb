It is rare for a film to include both the process of solving problems and an incredibly vast moral dilemma E is a fairly accurate historical film, but Fat Man and Little Boy solve this trick. <br /> <br /> history of the Manhattan Project - the effort of the Second World War to build the atomic bomb, told as the conflict between the two men who made it happen, General Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> Historical figures are a great study of opposites: military versus civil, practical versus idealistic, emotional versus scientific, brute force against problem resolution based on consensus, immediacy against long-term vision. A fictional character, played by John Cusack, is added as a sort of synthesis of the two historical figures, to show humanity that strangely escapes real people (and of course the obligatory love interest, played by Laura Dern). One who seeks a direct documentary could criticize errors in melodrama (and occasionally fluency with facts, but it is Hollywood for you), but the purpose of fiction is to synthesize and galvanize events into more universal truths, so I think this may be forgiven. <br /> <br /> One of the great images of the film is when Oppenheimer witnesses the first atomic explosion: it is made entirely through his reaction, and considering the extraordinary images inherent in an atomic explosion, it is a courageous and effective way to describe in an instant the ambivalent effect on humans to unleash such power (the kind of thing lost in the typical version of the Hollywood shooting history). The use of music is particularly excellent in the last third of the film. <br /> <br /> Fairly accessible and highly recommended both as a historical film and as a first-class drama.
