A rare exception to the rule that great literature makes disappointing films, John Huston's beautiful farewell to life and cinema is almost entirely faithful to the narrative and spirit of James Joyce's story, a tender meditation on love, death and the time expressed in the events of a twelfth night party in the middle class of Dublin around 1910. Although it may seem inconspicuous, the film prevails over its will to tell the story in silent, seemingly insignificant terms, rather than forcing a conventional film form of plot points and dramatic incidents on it. Only once did the wrong note sound, when the old Miss Julia (a singer and trained music teacher whose voice should have been broken by age, not shattered) sings so badly that the audience burst out laughing when I got it seen in the cinema. Fortunately, the atmosphere of silent and sweet melancholy is restored in a lot of time for the moment of revelation between the married couple Gabriel and Gretta Conroy in a hotel room while the snow begins to fall out. It's a sad story, I suppose, but the type that leaves you better, not blue. Particularly recommended as a movie for appointments - for people in love who are not afraid to face the sweetness and sadness of life.
