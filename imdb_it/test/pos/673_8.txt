I particularly liked Delly's review of this film and agree that Howard is not the only "damaged" character. Howard is rather "unprepared" by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer actually died or, if he is, that he murdered her. Howard doesn't know and neither do we. In terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there, she crashes. However, in reality it never hurts Helen Gordon, no matter how angry he is. Indeed, he reacts with horror to Helen's fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors ... then he resumes his reorganization and greets the healed Helen with the almost pathetic "I am very tired now. We will go home". Frankly, I don't think he's a psychopath. A sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath. <br /> <br /> The problem with Howard is that it has no real male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental condition denied him a place in the army. It is singularly rootless and isolated: no wife, no girl, no home (again, at least as far as we know). And it does the work of a woman: "Plans are my specialty". Helen's niece ruthlessly pulls out this pride in its entirety caustically exclaiming that she would like a man with a real job. Furthermore, although he is strongly attracted to Helen, he is unable or unwilling to do anything but scare her by making a strong sexual transition. He is extraordinarily powerless - he can't fight, he can't work, he can't make love. <br /> <br /> Helen is rightly terrified, however. He tries to connect to him but, finding that he doesn't respond normally (that is, outside the comfort zone provided by his pink memories of her husband Ned), he involuntarily presses all the buttons on Howard by lying to him in his escape attempt. <br /> <br /> Both characters, trapped at home, trapped by fear, neurosis, anger and memory, deserve sympathy. I know that the sudden ending disappointed some reviewers, but I thought it suited them well, as it offered a sort of release to the characters. Helen is freed, I believe, from the past. When Howard tries on her husband's army coat, Helen's disgusted reaction is highlighted. Surely he feels that the "sacredness" of Ned's possessions has been violated, but, hopefully, his need to keep everything "untouched" has been lost in the reality of his own struggle with danger. Maybe you can go on. <br /> <br /> Howard is also liberated - from his endless cycle of anger, wounds and violence. Whether he moves to therapy or in prison is questionable, but I hope he is the first. <br /> <br /> Great shows by Ryan and Lupino. I prefer "On Dangerous Ground", but that's good enough too.
