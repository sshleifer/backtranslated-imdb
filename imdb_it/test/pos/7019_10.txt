When the dirty dance was on TV in the middle of last year I was out, so I couldn't see it, my mother swore she saw it and recorded it on tape somewhere. Anyway, getting to the point where she couldn't find her video so for Christmas I bought her the DVD, well she didn't take a look. She sat around for a while then one evening I decided to take him upstairs to watch and I fell in love with her This is a great movie with so many lovely scenes! I love the plot and I enjoyed every moment! It's definitely not for everyone, but if you love a love story, then you'll want to look again at Dirty Dancing! Dirty dance - The way love is meant to be!
