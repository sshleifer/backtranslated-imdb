A stolen expedition of Vigoroso, the Mexican Viagra; a beautiful girl who is trying to rebuild her life and leave her husband, an Italian mafia boss; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old sweetheart. This is the plot of "The Shipment", a country comedy located in the small town of Paradise, Arizona. Despite its simple and classic history, the film (directed by Alex Wright) has its funny moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (in the role of Candy Porter), looking at a green Vigoroso pill, says: "What's this? A candy mint? "Or when the girl enters the sheriff's house and finds him completely naked. Or when the Vigoroso expedition ends up in Lake That, in the final sequence ... The cast offers some nice performances: from Matthew Modine as the sheriff of Paradise Valley, who still loves his old girlfriend; and by Elizabeth Berkley, whose character still loves her old boyfriend ... The supporting cast, including Nicholas Turturro, Paul Rodriguez (like the Mexican Jos√®) and G Michael Gray (what kind of teeth ...), makes work is also enjoyable. It is not an Oscar material, but not so bad. A fun unpretentious comedy.
