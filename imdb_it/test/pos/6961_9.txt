If there's one theme in this movie, it's that people can face difficulties having a good imagination. This family is poor, the father works in the cemetery and the mother works in a double shift, and Peter is constantly considered for a variety of reasons, and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl. It's just starting to get closer to the age of 10 or 11 when your perceptions start to change and you think your appearance starts to be important. The background of this story is the World's Fair of 1967 and the Centenary of Canada. The greatest moments of the film come during the various fantasy sequences in which we see how they face each other. Watch the flim, and if you've ever had a childhood friend you dreamed of, and then, for some reason, lost, you'll love this movie. Perhaps children will like this film, but only adults will really appreciate it, including references to the Bolsheviks and what parents will do for their children.
