It is a rare and beautiful spectacle, an allegory of death and the transfiguration that is neither preached nor sweetened. A work of mature and courageous intuition, Northfork avoids the distinction of the author by refusing to belong to a genre. Unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison, Wings of Desire by Wim Wenders (Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin), supports an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum that ranges from the mundane to the supernatural. This history of eminent terrestrial and celestial domains in the American West retains the fairytale literality that marked its German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels who leave behind with obsessive sentimentality. His heavenly transcendence, whether inspired by a painful faith or driven by a feverish dream, is never divided into cruelty and rot. This firm foundation is of great value to writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
