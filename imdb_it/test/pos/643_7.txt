This could be the most tense film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's so nerve-wracking, I wasn't able to watch it again after seeing it two years ago, but I will be since I got the DVD. There were a couple of scenes here that are almost too much to see ... so if you have problems and need to "run away" for an hour and a half, this movie will make you lose your head. <br /> <br /> Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job only in facial expressions, which she had to do since her character here is silent. He plays a pretty and healthy makeup artist for a deranged director. After the day's shooting is over and "Billie" is about to leave, she hears something. He peeks into the room where they were shooting and discovers that they are shooting a "sniffing movie" and killing someone. Billie's interception is discovered and runs for her life as the assassins go to look for her in this large warehouse-type building. <br /> <br /> There are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you down. The first one I described above. The second scene, the climatic one, lasts too long and is not as well done as the first. In fact, the film should have been trimmed a bit but, overall, since it is so good at keeping our attention, so it served the purpose of entertainment.
