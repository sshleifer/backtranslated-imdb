The Psychopath (1973) A journey into the past. I saw this film many years ago on an old black and white t-v. The conductor of a children's show Rabbey avenges the brutal abuse that his parents inflict on his kiddie fans. Mr. Rabbey (who seems to be always on the verge of losing him) eventually crashes and decides to hunt. Watch out for bad parents because Mr. Rabbey is looking for prey! What happens next is priceless. However, trying to find this movie will be quite complicated. <br /> <br /> What makes this film worthy of note is the fact that Joe "Maniac" Spinell made a short promo reel for a film based on this. In his unfinished film, he plays Mr. Robbie, a t.v. clown (who looks a bit plump Edward James Olmos) who avenges his little fans by raping children chasing their parents. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinell never found the funds to complete the project. The film would be titled Maniac II: "Mister Robbie". Rabbey or Robbie the similarities are too close for convenience. Rather violent for a P.G. movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
