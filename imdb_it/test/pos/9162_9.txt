From the first to the last scene, this film is made in a very realistic way, even too realistic that sometimes we can't see the details in the night scenes (it's dark like the real night), in the desert (the sun is as strong as in the desert real). <br /> <br /> Even the script and the actor's game are very realistic. The shots and episodes are modified to not show things and events "effectively", to "explain" them or, as many Hollywood movies do, to "entertain" the spectators. The editing here is to represent events as if they really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes set far away from the dying soldiers, even when the main character Major Bandura is shot and killed. <br /> <br /> This method reminds me of the masterpieces of Italian neo-realism. And the construction of the story here is based on the same principles of "Pais√†" or "The Bicycle Thief" - chronological series of "true to life" episodes and some pathetic moments, which at first sight seem sudden and illogical, but I have internal reasons. <br /> <br /> I think the inner reason for Major Bandura's suicidal death is religious emotion - Repentance for the death of innocent people (not only his accidental killing of the family in the village, but also the death of soldier under his command). He is not depicted as a faithful supporter, on the contrary he is depicted as a tactful and responsible officer. Exactly for this reason his last decisions (to return to the destroyed village and to turn his back on an armed boy, whose family killed) seems an act of repentance. <br /> <br /> The Russian Orthodox choir, which plays at the end ("Evening Sacrifice") is another context, in which the whole film can be seen from this point of view.
