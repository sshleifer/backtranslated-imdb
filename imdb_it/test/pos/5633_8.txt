I liked this because I can identify it. <br /> <br /> At one time in my life I was trying to make films, and I experienced many of the same problems that Mark Borchardt did in trying to make his film. And I also went through an extended period of arrested and self-absorbed development, in which I refused to grow up. But then, miraculously, I got married and had children. I realized that being a filmmaker in need was, in all likelihood, not feeding my family. So I found a decent job and did what I felt I had to do to make it happen. This is what a mature and responsible adult does. <br /> <br /> Mark has not yet faced this reality, and therefore, in this sense, he is a retarded teenager. For this reason, there is a lack of hope in him. Like Don Quixote, he seems so inept and self-deluded that he doesn't realize how bad he really is. The spectator feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. Mark has children, an ex-wife and accounts to pay, but the film portrays him considerate of pursuing only his "artistic vision". <br /> <br /> Despite this, Mark comes across the film as a nice individual, surrounded by a very interesting family and a group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many of the things needed to succeed in both life and career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, priority, financial influence, etc. Yet he trudges, like Ed Wood, apparently without any semblance of clue. <br /> <br /> I believe we should feel encouraged by the spectacle of the "never to say die" attitude of this noble individual, who fights against adversity. And friend, what's the odds! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are all children of great movies or TV people; no doubt, everyone will want to direct one day if they are not already. How much space is there for an independent like Mark? It's like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board, again and again. Come to think of it, it's close enough to what happens to one of Mark's actors, with the kitchen closet door, in one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. <br /> <br /> Despite these doubts and seemingly critical, I really enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it to anyone. Uncle Bill is fantastic. I have a friend who met both Mike and Mark and told me that, in real life, these guys are exactly like they appeared in the movie.
