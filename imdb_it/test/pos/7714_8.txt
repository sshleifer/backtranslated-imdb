I've seen three episodes of Animatrix, and this is my favorite of them all. The Second Renaissance provided a fragile history after the already fragile universe. The program was a stylistically impressive number, it seemed just a little silly. I imagine that what gives this is a special touch is the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe, director of the incredibly popular series (and for good reason) Cowboy Bebop. It has some of the best elements of Bebop: slick, science fiction, a senseless hero, a bit apathetic who works for hire, a bounty head (more or less), and a chase scene, all wrapped up in an excellent film packaging -noir. The lightness in the Tarantino style of Watanabe passes here at full throttle.
