I could not agree more than with the comment left by "coldshitaction" and how this film is a masterpiece. I've never seen a movie that had my adrenaline flowing through the movie, and that mostly happened when Bronson ran off like an M-60 and digs like a guy from a band, it's brilliant. Very probably the best action movie ever made (not exaggerated), it could really be the best action movie ever made. From the beginning, one should know that it is something sweet when the police let Bronson go and tell him, tell him, to clean up the slums. Once again, genius. And once again Bronson is an ugly ass. Paul Kersey is just as cool, maybe even cooler than John McClain or the Terminator, he's just a bad ass. And the beauty is that he is a good boy and he buys an ice cream for a child and helps an old couple before he kills a bag of foam. genius. Highly recommended, if you hate this movie you are crazy.
