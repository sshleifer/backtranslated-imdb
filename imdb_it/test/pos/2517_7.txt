Another decent offer from Vince Gilligan's pen. <br /> <br /> A pre-Malcolm in the middle Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a deranged guy who eventually hijacks Mulder off with the gun and drives him west at high speed. It has something to do with his sharp head (and possible fatal combustion - his wife has just experienced it), and the pressure seems to be alleviated only by heading for the left coast. Only Mulder could relate to this boy's situation, and indeed tie up with his kidnapper before the night race is completed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Scully seems to have solved the case with a possible remedy for Mr. Crump, and will meet them at the ocean. Check it to see if our Dynamic Duo can connect to the Pacific and somehow correct Mr. Crump's big problem.
