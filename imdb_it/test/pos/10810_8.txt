Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the French Revolution of 1789. This film is set five years later and the revolution has turned into something bad. While initially the revolution promised freedom, at this point the small committee that runs the country is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship. Danton and his friends were angry at how the country was no better in 1794 than it was before they got rid of their king, so they began to criticize the government. The film begins when the press that publishes critical booklets on the government is beaten and its activity is destroyed. So much for "freedom, equality and fraternity"! Thus, as a result of being silenced in this way, Danton and others begin to publicly criticize the government. In the end, Robespierre (the leader of the committee) and his cronies declared the accusations, held a demonstration and got rid of the dissent. Some have mentioned that the Polish director Wajda also intended a criticism of his own nation, which at the time was also dominated by soviets and very repressive. This makes sense in seeing the film explain - especially when the government destroys any dissent "in the name of the people". <br /> <br /> Acting is fine, the story is compelling and I have no criticism of the film. However, I really wish the ending had been handled differently. Especially because, in addition to history lovers and the French, they probably have no idea that this execution helped end the government. AFTER this purging of Danton in April 1794, Robespierre was executed in July 1794 because the country had just had enough - plus, those surviving French knew that they too would face the guillotine sooner or later if this sick system remained on the place. A sort of epilogue would have been nice, like showing the soldiers who came to Robespierre. He responded by trying to kill himself earlier, but he only managed to blow a part of his face - still alive, he was guillotined shortly after. This would have been a little dandy epilogue and could have been done in about five minutes. However, not showing a connection between Danton's death and the fall of the government is a strange thing to omit.
