I've just seen this move for the fifth or sixth time and I'm still in love with it. It still makes me cry, sing, worry and celebrate. <br /> <br /> I almost wrote Bonnie Hunt a letter to tell her how much I like it. The pain scene of David Duchovny is so flippinist !!! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite sentence is when Duchovny says "I miss Elizabeth, but I suffer for Grace". Oh God! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are the perfect thing in the Chicago area !! I know them, I swear! I'm related to them I'm sure. <br /> <br /> This film is in my rotation three times a year !!! I would watch it once a week, but I'm afraid I would have gotten used to it too much !!! I always want to make it a special day when I look at it !!
