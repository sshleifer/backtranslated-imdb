There are too many people in this forum who have obviously lost the subtle intelligence of this series. <br /> <br /> This show is exceptional because it is a hilarious parody of itself. The boys who proclaim themselves the studs are given a good chance to convince us of their seduction skills until they "hit the field" just to expose their complete lack of "game" on national TV? it's absolutely fun and the guys who are really skillful are extremely addictive to watch while effortlessly seducing the pretentious women who frequent these trendy nightclubs! <br /> <br /> Celebrates a unique charisma when it is deserved and makes a mockery of delirious douchebags when it is deserved. However, it's always fun because, unlike other dating shows, it perfectly captures the genuine embarrassment and excitement of a "pick-up". I highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor.
