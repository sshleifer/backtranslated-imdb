The GREAT NEWS is that this film is now AVAILABLE on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for all those who wish to own it and also on video. This is good news as it is one of my favorite movies! <Br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in the 80s and it is mandatory for the holidays. Living in the small market town called Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its traditions, re-enactments and traditions, we are also a welcoming community. Now we are also faced with major housing developments that threaten to destroy the Community and we understand why I love this film. First of all, and above all, there are ASHES of snow !!!! Then there is the beautiful legend of the Christmas tree and also the Christian epilogue in which the whole community spends the money to help the destitute peasant save his farm and remain in the community. The evil developers, only after the money has been sent in baskets, while the whole city is committed to protecting their money, which is very special. I love the way the whole community sends its message to Santa via the post office that is misunderstood by the hero. He and his daughter have a long journey to do after their wife and mother's death. (There is a likely candidate for this) - even a sleigh ride and the most moving thing is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken, mysteriously gave him a new one on Christmas morning and nobody designed it! There is a nice moment when Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. Great movie for everything about Christmas.
