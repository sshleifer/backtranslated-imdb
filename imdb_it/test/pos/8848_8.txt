In an age in which almost all the great horror films of the 60s and 70s were redone for the public, weaned from today's horror films that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter's 1982 opera THE THING, which in turn is a remake - of a childhood favorite of the 1951 drama / horror film by Howard Hawks, THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not initially a big box office success when it came out in mid-1982, it has since gathered a very large following. <br /> <br /> In reality, Carpenter's film is not a remake of Hawks's film rather than a reworking, as he returns to the original idea from the source material, the story of John W. Campbell "Who Go There There? ", In which an American scientific crew in Antarctica is threatened by an alien that changes its shape after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who had starred in Carpenter in the TV movie from director ELVIS in 1979 and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK in 1981, leads a cast of famous personalities, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart and Richard Masur, in this tension. full exploration of paranoia, such as the "thing" that changes form, which first arrives in their field in the form of a guide dog that a Norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. It is not long before everyone in the camp begins to distrust his fellow men. The end of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity similar to that of the other types of THE BIRDS and STRAW DOG. <br /> <br /> Almost universally, when the subject of THE THING, the emphasis is on the extremely sad special effects of make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter in the 1980 horror film THE FOG, and in the 1981 Joe Dante movie with werewolves THE HOWLING. These effects are really very spectacular and graphic and, even today, they can also be quite upsetting. But all this would make Carpenter's film nothing but a high-level splatter epic if the direction, the story and the acting were not up to par; and fortunately, each one of them are. When not focusing on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter creates suspense in the same way as Hitchcock influenced his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with Dean Cundey's camera, in particular through the corridors of the station, a significant Help . Acting enhances an already excellent film adaptation of Bill Lancaster; and we are also given a soundtrack by Ennio Morricone, whose work on the spaghetti westerns of the 1960s by director Sergio Leone is well known to everyone, including of course Carpenter himself. THE THING also has additional visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who has worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THIRD GENDER and JAWS 2. <br /> <br / > Carpenter's The film was not the success that could have been because Universal chose to release this graphic shock just two weeks after publishing the much more familiar ET by Steven Spielberg: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, the critics and the public at that time favored Spielberg excellent film on Carpenter just as beautiful but extremely different). Also, most of the box office business of horror in 1982 went to another film produced by Spielberg, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $ 15 million, THE THING suffered from lack of attention at the time. <br /> <br /> Over time, however, many have come to see Carpenter's film for what it is - an extremely ingenious yet extremely clever combination of science fiction and horror, made with a great deal of talent and a true understanding of psychological paranoia at the center of its history. Although it is still quite creepy, THE THING should be remembered for the skill with which the story is put together as it is for the alien designs and the effects of makeup; because it is the narrative ability and the suspense that make it so memorable ultimately.
