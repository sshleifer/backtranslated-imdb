Don't be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds "Mon oncle Antoine", because like the best of Canadian films, darkness lurks just below the surface. <br /> <br /> Set presumably in rural Quebec in the 1940s, history explores the developing consciousness of young Benoit as he learns to deal with both sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is surprising, especially given that a high percentage of criticism of Canadian cinema by the general public envelops aesthetics. In addition, the modest Benoit is a seductive protagonist for the public, looking at his corrupting community with fresh and innocent eyes. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading the critical essay by Jim Leach on the film in the best features of Canada for anyone trying to place the film in a historical context while also dissecting the form of the film. Surely check this out.
