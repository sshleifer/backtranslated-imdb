Cam Archer's lyric Bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope of adolescent desire with lush rendering (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt) that is more vibrant than narrative. Taken somewhere between documentary and dream, Bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of the first Todd Haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of Gus van Sant. With grit, glamor and heartbreak, it's a bit like the cinematic equivalent of Sonic Youth playing bubblegum pop.
