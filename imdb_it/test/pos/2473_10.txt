I can't believe I lost this. Made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make an indifferent episode of a TV soap, this is 90 minutes sustained, sharp like a knife movie. You will find the outline, the plot, etc. Elsewhere on this site. However, consider that everything was shot using a single 16mm freehand camera ... all the dialogue is improvised ... none of the "actors" had appeared before a camera before ... It looks like a recipe for disaster. Instead what we get are the hippies against the policemen who run in the California desert in what evolves into a "it's not fair ... I'm on that person's side". The only problem is that the director continues to make you change your mind and at the end of the 90 minutes we are still not sure who has one. Brilliant ... Fairly bright.
