There is no denying it. Science fiction on TV is difficult. There are so many problems that the genre brings. Like the need for a good budget, solid writing, decent acting. Perhaps the budget and the script are the departments in which I feel that many attempts have failed. So "Surface" succeeded? Not completely, but more than others. <br /> <br /> As I see it, a good science fiction show doesn't really need a lot of CGI to work, nor does it need a lot of money. What it needs is the ability to create a feeling greater than life. The feeling that there is more than it seems, something that makes me curious and willing to try to understand how it will end. Adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying "Aha!" is what makes or breaks a show like this. <br /> <br /> "Surface" has had a couple of flaws. First of all, the basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been, nor is the revealed story as exciting (or bold) as I had hoped in the beginning. Even the TV feeling is very present most of the time. From the incredible CGI (which varies from decent to bad) to the rather changeable quality of the acting department. It also sometimes seems a little too family-oriented as it takes the edge of sometimes and almost becomes a swan. But apart from these flaws, it's a fun show. Maybe not as spectacular as some of the other science fiction shows out there. But he keeps me interested in the whole season and also offers a couple of nice cliffhangers among the shows. The ending for me is not so attractive. I don't like shows that end without ending so to speak, leaving the story unresolved. In this case it is particularly unlucky since the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it is still undecided). <br /> <br /> For me, HBO is the benchmark for quality television. Their series have the best actors, the best production values ​​and above all the most solid writing. This is not HBO quality, but it is positive for what it is. Good enough to want another season without a doubt.
