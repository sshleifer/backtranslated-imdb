Filmmaker Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion and brotherhood and the devastating results of the loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT. <br /> <br /> BLINDSPOT's diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the public on a tortuous journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought that causes suspense from beginning to end. A thriller that leaves a lot in mind. <br /> <br /> What an amazing result for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan! Angela Sander
