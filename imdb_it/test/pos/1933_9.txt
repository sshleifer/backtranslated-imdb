1931 also presented "an American tragedy", the original tale of "with whom it will occupy, poor girl or rich girl". this was a really fun movie. Babs stanwyck was as beautiful as could be, dally sally blane. Monroe Owsley, has unmistakably played Babs' husband. I had never heard of him, but I thought he had a beautiful physical resemblance to Bing Crosby of "the great transmission" ('32), also a thin hairline and matted ears. Ricardo cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold. a true pioneer of cinema who comes back. the dilemma is resolved in the end, due to the tensions of the title and I believe that Annette Hanshaw recorded success, although the voiceover worked very well. I also liked the ballroom scenes. I'm sure they were authentic; the band, one of the best of the moment, was superb. good job, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
