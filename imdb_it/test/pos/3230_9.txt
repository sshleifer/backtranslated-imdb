Text taken from the 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide. <br /> <br /> fuckland The title is a play on words based on Falkland's misinterpretation of the main protagonist of the film, Fabian Stratas, a reference to the setting of the film and a little less than a subtle allusion to the agenda secret of his protagonist. <br /> <br /> Fabian is an Argentine citizen, an amateur magician who pretends to be a tourist who visits the Falklands shortly after being reopened to his people. His main plan is to win the last battle by seducing and imbuing local females, beginning with the delightful Camilla, giving life to an entire generation of Argentine half. Fuckland creates the illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish-eye perspective that gives the film a voyeuristic style and intimacy. (ARGENTINA)
