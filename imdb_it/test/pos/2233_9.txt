A formidable little film that plays Mary Astor as a prostitute who works as a paper company in difficulty, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, he comes up with a scheme for employees to buy the company with a committed shot (Robert Ames) as the "front" even if she is the brain. <br /> <br /> Of course it becomes a great success and you become his executive secretary, basically still managing everything and teaching him lessons. He loves drugs, but he never takes it off while having fun with a series of bimbos. It is pursued by a married but separate man, Ricardo Cortez, who is not free. But when a girl from society catches Ames, everything goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Astor is just as wonderful as the too-intelligent woman who makes almost a big mistake after losing her man. Ames is as good as the fool (but what does he see in him?), And Cortez is good but he doesn't have much to do. Kitty Kelly is a good helper, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is the girl of the company, and Edna Murphy is as fun as Daisy. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
