I waited 30 years to see this movie. I played the soundtrack album as a teenager until I was twenty. Recently, I found a dvdr at reasonable prices and saw it this morning. It was in widescreen, probably even a 70mm print, stereo, the colors were pretty good, fading very small, certainly not remastered but I'm very very happy with this clean copy. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. It's pretty good. I wouldn't say it's nice even though there are great scenes in it. Perhaps Premminger may not have been the right director for this, but I'll say it. For me the central piece of the film was the hurricane scene. Wonderfully staged by Premminger. One of the great meteorological scenes of all time. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would say that the acting scenes are better than the musical scenes, not that the musical sequences are bad. Not at all. Missing ... something though. Perhaps it was the fact that there are no close-ups and very few medium shots. It was almost like watching a movie of a theatrical production. Maybe that was the feeling Promemoria was looking for. In the end it may not have been the right choice, but so on. It is far from a ruined film. <br /> <br /> That said, not everyone loves the singers of the soundtrack. I have always. They are perfect for this movie. I love the singing voices. The actors who sink their lips are excellent for the most part. I just hope the songs were staged in a more imaginative way. The two issues of Sportin 'Life are good, but the intimate numbers don't even feel close. They feel ... far away. Nevertheless, the power of music cannot be denied. And in the end, this is what passes through strong and clear. Once again, maybe what Premminger was trying to do was to stay out of the reach of the incredible music he was working with. I think he had the right idea, but maybe he went too far in that direction. <br /> <br /> Acting is exceptional. The best compliments go to the great Brock Peters who plays and sings the part of Crown. He is the real petty. We just want you to leave poor Bess alone, and he doesn't. As proud, arrogant and evil as he is, the classic version of Sammy Davis Jr of Sportin 'Life is the slick devil and very charismatic in this. Probably the best Davis film. Poor Bess can't stand two bad men. I'm glad the Hermes Pan gave Davis a tap-like number to do. <br /> <br /> Dandridge and Poitier, who reportedly are not impressed by the fact that they are in the film, are really very nice together. I don't know about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than between Dandridge and Poitier. However, it worked well for Dorothy and Sidney. Even so, I think both should be proud of the work they have done on this film. Both were able to bring more than a tear to my eyes. Their characterizations are very 3D and credible. Sidney Poitier's Porgy, however, seems almost out of place in the catfish line. I could not help thinking that it was Mr. Braithwaite in "To Sir with Love", very polite, well-mannered and spoken, who had fallen in hard times. It probably wouldn't have been my first choice for Porgy, but hey was a big star back then, so why not? Dorothy's Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, in fact even more vulnerable this time. Carmen was probably the most gorgeous part for her to do. <br /> <br /> Really a very beautiful film, they are two sticks short of what I would call a classic. It simply doesn't make the last classic degree. Still, there's no reason why the Gershwin estate has decided to keep this beautiful film, even with all its flaws, hidden from the public like them. Premminger may have made some strange choices as a director, but the film has nothing to be ashamed of and embarrassed for anyone involved in it. It is what it is and there are much worse films than this that are embarrassing on DVDs and in theaters today. Porgy and Bess are not one of them.
