When the masterful version of "The Thing" by John Carpenter was published in the summer of 1982, it was struck down by critics and bombed at the box office. The public could not handle another "bad" alien, they wanted ET. Their long-term loss. <br /> <br /> I would kill to watch this great movie on the big screen. This is a film that was far ahead of time; now it has influenced a new generation of directors, showing traces of things like "Se7en", "Alien 3" and even "The X Files", which tore them off page by page without compliments. And the structure, which avoids the development of the character in favor of incredible SFXs, is common in today's hit movies. <br /> <br /> Carpenter shows the same skills he honed in "Halloween", using the camera to create a haunting and claustrophobic atmosphere. The performances are all beautiful, and the ending is fantastic - still unique today. <br /> <br /> A paranoid masterpiece.
