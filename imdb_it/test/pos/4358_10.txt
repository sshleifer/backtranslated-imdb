This film represents one of the most striking examples of compelling and artistic films I've seen. Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter's story, as well as his captivating personal character. At the end of the film, I was left with the wish that I had the opportunity to meet Dieter before his death. <br /> <br /> On a technical note, cinematography is intimate and surprisingly beautiful. The narration is intricate, with great awareness of the subject and his ability to relive and recall traumatic events. Few documentary filmmakers have such a strong ability to invest so much audience in the character. This movie is a must see !!!
