Tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his master of the old lady. Sylvester is in the same baggage car, even in a cage. <br /> <br /> Sylvester grabbed Tweety in no time, but a railwayman returns and slaps the "feline crafty" as he calls it, back in his cage. He puts Tweety "in a safer place", up high and tells the cat, "Now, remember: no tricks!" Sylvester puts his halo on and looks innocent. Yes, right. <br /> <br /> I found that the funniest things, however, were not Sylvester versus Tweety, but the "visceral dog" who is in another cage next to Sylvester. The cat makes fun of him and pays a huge price in an extremely fun way. Sylvester simply doesn't learn, but that's one of the reasons we love it! (I know a lot of IMDb reviewers don't like Tweety, but I like both main characters - they both suck me!) <br /> <br /> Also, the train and the scenery that goes by is beautifully illustrated here Really nice graphics.
