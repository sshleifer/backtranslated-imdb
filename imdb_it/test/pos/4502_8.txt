I haven't read the novel on which "The Kite Runner" is based. My wife and daughter, who did it, thought that the film was not very far from the book, and I am ready to believe it by word. But, by itself, the film is good - not exceptional but good. How accurately describes the chaos created by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincingly demonstrates the Taliban intolerant regime that followed? I would rate it C + on the first and B + on the second. The human story, the Afghan-American who has returned to his homeland to save his childhood companion's son, is well done, but it is above all on this that I was told that the book was much more convincing than the film. The most exciting part of the film, however, the kabul competitions in Kabul and, later, a mini-contest in California, cannot be matched by the book. I would bet on this.
