I'm a gay white homosexual 55 years old. Since I don't watch TV, I watch at least 250 movies a year, mostly on DVD. I keep notes on all the films I see and evaluate. Since December 2003, I've only seen five films as big as EIGHTEEN. So, I evaluated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent films. Mr. Bell is far too modest in his comments on the film. EIGHTEEN is a great film. And, moreover, he produced two "firsts" for me. <br /> <br /> I saw the film, the first time, and I was nailed everywhere and crying during the last half hour, something that only happened to me three times before. (Five minutes after the movie I knew it would be very nice.) When Jason started acting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The kiss. Well, this is one of the great kisses of Film, and that scene from the most moving and unforgettable of Filmdom. When Pip extinguished the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I applauded. I rejoiced. I love the happy end. I cried. <br /> <br /> Then I watched the TLA trailer and previews and thought, "Okay, is this $ 800,000 or so really great?" So, I immediately looked at EIGHTEEN, something that only happened three times before. And eighteen year old blew my stockings up again, even more. Then I saw the documentary "The Making of EIGHTEEN" and I was completely fascinated by the cast and Mr. Bell. <br /> <br /> So, I thought I'd review EIGHTEEN with the director's comment. I've never seen a movie three times in one night. After the third time, at 3:00 am, I knew I had just experienced a great movie; Eighteen is now the number 10 of my Top Twenty films of all time. And, in the very small universe of the great gay movie or gay subtext, there are Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> Thank you Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is brilliant and fully realized, with a magnificent cast, a moving and very thin soundtrack, an excellent cinematography, a funny, touching, absolutely appropriate and humble song. I can go on, but I won't go too far. <br /> <br /> This film should have received an Oscar nomination, certainly one for the best film. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. Mrs Gill's delightful and sensual voice was a surprising epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? Nuf said. It is the reason why within 200 mediocre / horrendous films (some in the 150 million dollars more) per year, to find that treasure, that exquisite, magical, unique and Enchanting, perfect "Faberge egg" enveloping an unforgettable heart. <br /> <br /> Finally (I promise), my second "first" - I never posted a comment on any film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Thanks again, Mr. Richard Bell! Breathtaking genius Give this man $ 100 million for his next movie! He made $ 700,000 in one of the 50 best movies of all time. If you had the money, you would give him $ 75,000 a year for living expenses and match the funds raised for his next film. Mr. Bell is already a great director at 31 years old. Can you imagine it at 45? <br /> <br /> Wise and witty, tender and brutal, balanced, moving, sober but angular, chilling and exciting, fascinating, haunting, unforgettable: EIGHTEENTH, THE MASTERPIECE.
