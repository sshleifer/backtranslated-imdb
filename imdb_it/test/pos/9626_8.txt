I saw Five Fingers at the Drive-In in ... what, 1973, '74? It was the first Kung-Fu movie I had ever seen and it really amused me. I recently bought it on DVD and watched it again. Also the second time I had a lot of fun. I think this is probably the most followed film by Kung-Fu. Rival schools, different styles, revenge, good guys and "black hat" bad boys. They also cast the Japanese styles (VERY bad) of Karate and Judo. I remember being amused by the dubbing dialogue, along the lines of "Hey You! You're a bad boy!" and "They should not get away with it! I will go to this bad crowd!" This time he wasn't so distracted, I guess I got used to it. If you have even the slightest appreciation of this kind, this is what you should see.
