As a young man when it came out, I completely connected to this. As an adult in today's sex-obsessed American culture, he does not have enough nudity to be called meek. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for fox jokes, vulgarity or fart and jokes of the American Pie type, the meatballs will be disappointed by the impunity and the guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray, and you like pure fun, you will probably like it and have a great time this movie. Similarly with Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack, etc. <br /> <br /> Just say, just look at it and stop intellectualizing it. They are Meatballs, for crying out loud! Why read a review? Have fun and have fun. And ignore the junk talk of others. Films, like so many other things in life, are subjective. To each his own. <br /> <br /> Always pay attention to the "experts" who diminish the taste of others.
