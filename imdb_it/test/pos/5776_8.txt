I saw this movie when it came out. Patty didn't want to be separated from her brothers. However, the Juvenile Justice system does not matter. When Patty examined the file, the judge sent her to a juvenile detention center. He claimed to have violated privacy rules by examining private files. He just wanted his family together. I couldn't blame her. The parents were not even suitable parents. One of the younger children had to have a bathroom. The father stopped and let them go. He rejected it and left the children stranded at the gas station. Patty had to take the authority to protect them, since she was the oldest. They were placed in foster homes. The good part is that the social worker brought them back into the family. The chief social worker kept telling him to jump out and not interfere. He was mad with power. He was the one who had put Patty in the youth structure. Because they did not follow the Father, who was released from the prison, for abandonment. Yet children are caught in the middle and made to feel insecure.
