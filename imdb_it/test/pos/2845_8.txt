Nurse Betty has that strange but winning combination of a repellent and defenseless plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I hated Fargo on first sight, then I realized that I was still thinking about it a few days later and I enjoyed myself somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after seeing her. Difficult to understand, difficult to explain. As others have said, it is quite forced in many ways, but it seems to be part of what makes it so surprising. <br /> <br /> Good work by Greg Kinnear, great work by Morgan Freeman (although I'm afraid it's being stereotyped as the evil of principle). Chris Rock was good but not exceptional. Rene Z. is so natural to be nervous - that is, unnerving to be "natural" to interpret someone who is not right in the head. I also liked Allison Janney's sort of "abrasive glitter" in a small part. <br /> <br /> Don't expect more than a "road movie", as you might suppose from some synopsis. (There is "road", but it is only barely relevant.) Rated 8/10.
