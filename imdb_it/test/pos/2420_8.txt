I read some reviews of the film and I had the impression that it was not as good as the previous versions of Karate Kid. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt that this fourth installment of the series was consistent with others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike previous versions, the karate student is a teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path rather than a male teenager. Maggi finds it a bit more challenging, but up to the situation. The twists and turns are credible and predictable. I found out that the bad guys are a bit one-dimensional, but this weakness is present in all the episodes in varying degrees. The work with the camera is impressive and occasionally goes through some beautiful scenarios. The Zen monastery is both austere and fascinating. Zen monks add humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the "Zen Bowling" scenes that are a fun counterpoint to the most serious Zen archery scene before. The quality level of the film is like a good TV series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band that plays "Listen to your heart". The film's lessons are valuable and useful to learn. They feel faithful to the spirit of karate and care not to overdo the glory of the fighting part. All in all, I liked it.
