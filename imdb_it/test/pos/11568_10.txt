After the success of "Muppet Babies", Warner Brothers recorded "Tiny Toons". But instead of creating Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and all the other Looney Toon guys, they created new animal characters that were children with their distinct personalities but personalities that reflected their predecessors. Contacts included Buster & Babs Bunny (no relationship, which became their catch or catch phrase), Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig, Dizzy Devil, Shirley 'the' Loon, Elmira, Montana Max, Furball, Sweety, mice and assorted Perfecto Prep animals, and the original Looney Toons signed itself. The "Tiny Toons" lived in Acme Acres and frequented Acme Looniversity, where the band of Looney Toon worked as teachers who served as mentors for younger generations, inside and outside of comedy. <br /> <br /> During the parade, various pot shots were taken at the Bush SR. administration, pop culture and coupled with other gags and parody. <br /> <br /> Buster & Babs, probably the main characters of the show, as mentioned above, were in some ways similar to Bugs Bunny, but they also had their own personality differences and comic styles, or tendency of Babs to impersonate anyone and everyone, while Buster, capable of being himself a great henchman, usually played the straight man (or straight rabbit) at Babs' antics. Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not daffi Daffy but Daffy egomaniaco), with an ego almost as big as Daffy and just as obsessive of dismantling Buster & Babs as Daffy had with Bugs falling apart, even though he usually fell quiet on his face in his attempts, yet he remained strangely captivating. Hampton was an even more timid version of Porky Pig, and he had the thankless job of playing Porky in Plucky's Daffy. Shirley, the blonde goose girl, was a girl from the valley of the new age who Plucky was supposed to get in and out of mockery or competition for his affections. Dizzy was the purple version of the Tasmanian devil. Furball was the silent Sylvester and Sweety was the pink Tweetie bird. There was also the purple female skunk who wanted to have a boyfriend and the miniature versions of Wile Coyote and Road Runner. Evil was defined in the form of Montana Max, a rich boy who was always out to make a dollar or make people's lives miserable. There was also Elmira, a deranged lover whom everyone feared. And then there was Godo Dodo, a strange a-ma-gig creature that had no clearly designated species except that it came from "Wacky Land" or something. <br /> <br /> Pop culture references including Batman (very often in reality), Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Dances with Wolves, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, fast food joints, the Ten Commandments, the Zones Twilight, Saturday Night Live and even the Simpsons, among others. <br /> <br /> Not only fun, but it has also managed to be warm and moving, something that is the "Animaniacs" successor never reached. Followed also by "Taz-Mania".
