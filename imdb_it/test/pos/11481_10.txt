There was a video in America called "Cartoon Scandals" which contained about an hour of forbidden cartoons. <br /> <br /> Most of them were from the World War II era. That's where I saw (and heard) this. <br /> <br /> The rooster during the opening news broadcast turns into a vulture with an Asian face that says "cock-a-doodle-doo, please". After that there are eight minutes of propaganda that take place like a newsreel. <br /> <br /> Visibly racist, but when you look at him as the piece of history that he is, he can (and should) be forgiven. <Br /> <br /> Slice the tiles to make sandwiches. <br /> <br /> Showing the ruins of Rome while it is called Moussolini 'Rovina # 1.' <br /> <br /> A minesweeper using a broom. <br /> <br /> A manned bomb with the pilot saying "RET ME OUT OF HERE". <br /> <br /> And of course the stereotypes. Each Japanese was drawn with big teeth, constantly bowing and saying "please" at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> The funniest piece? The air raid siren was composed of two archers who stabbed each other in the clink of pins. "oooo-OOOOOO" <br /> <br /> Hey AOL. Leave this out. Worth a note. My wife laughed at this. And she's 100% Japanese.
