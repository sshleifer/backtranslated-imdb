I love this movie, how fun. Rupert and Julie are fantastic with Rupert who is almost poker in front of Julie's animation, which worked well. Laura did a good job as an authoritarian mother. Julie is obviously wonderful as usual. While this movie will make you laugh most of the time, it also has a touching side as it reveals the secrets of the life of the main characters. Interesting that it was titled Driving Lessons, as this could make you believe that this is the main feature of the film, which is not directly even though it certainly could be seen as "Ben" finally sitting behind the wheel of his own life. Like most things that are fun in life, there is always the sad side and there are some moving moments in this movie. Very fun movie and worth watching.
