This is the best film ever, but this is my opinion. Some say it's cheese, but I think it's a really good movie. The chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is like no other I've ever seen, and that's what makes the movie so perfect. I always wonder what would have happened to this film if these two actors had never existed, because not only did one do it for me, they both did. If you've never seen this movie, when you do you will understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing seems made from the heart and looks so real for some reason, like magic, and the LOVE IT soundtrack. In addition to the 2 main actors, the soundtrack makes the film the beauty it is. As you can tell, I'm in love with this movie, and I know you will be too.
