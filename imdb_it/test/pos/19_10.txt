This is one of my three favorite movies of all time. My only quibble is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts showing the actors individually rather than together as a scene, but the interpretations were so great that they lose him. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely wonderful; brilliant. The script is great, giving a very beautiful image of life in the theater during the Second World War (and, therefore, as it was in the 1930s). Lots of big, thin touches, lots of wide and overexposed shots, all perfectly done. Scenes after scene take me away, and then there's the excruciating climax.
