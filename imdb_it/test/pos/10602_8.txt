When I first heard about this film, I was slightly interested. The plot seemed an opportunity for hilarity and Bam Margera as an actor and director seemed something that could be good. When I discovered the film starring Ryan Dunn, I was even more interested (I was a Homewrecker fan when he was on ... Yes, I'm so lame). However, I didn't have much confidence in the fact that it was good. When I sat down to watch it, I was afraid of wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But even just five minutes it became obvious that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought the comedy of this film was deliciously idiotic and definitely not suitable for all types of people. The acting was pretty good, much better than my expectations. I thought it was pretty easy to relate to the character of Ryan, who gave the film a credible center. This is crucial in an outrageous film like this (and it's probably why I wasn't a Borat fan). <br /> <br /> The film is not suitable for everyone for young people, DUH, and it will certainly create more than a good portion of clumsy turtles if looked at with their parents. But it's good for you and your friends during a movie night.
