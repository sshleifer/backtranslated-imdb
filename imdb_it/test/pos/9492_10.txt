Some do not like Led Zeppelin, but fortunately the number of people compared to the number of people who do not do so is unbalanced. I'm the proud converter of 2 or 3 Led Zeppelin fans and the only reason I managed to do it is because of this DVD. <br /> <br /> For one, as someone can hear "Stairway to Heaven" or "Immigrant Song" without falling in love with Zeppelin, it goes beyond me, but playing guitar and not Page ... is like being Christian and not bitterness to Jesus. My friend was like "Led Zeppelin sucks!" and I was like, "Oh yes, look at this!" After about 2 minutes of viewing Page pick through "White Summer / Black Mountain Side" was glued to the screen and since then has never said a bad thing about Zeppelin. <br /> <br /> In case you are not following the Running metaphor, I am calling this DVD the Led Zeppelin Bible. Kept high by the followers and used as a converter for unwashed pagans. <br /> course there are some things missing like "Beyond the hills and far", a good version of "Immigrant Song" and I really didn't need version 2 of "Whole Lotta Love", but what the hell I'll take them. <br /> <br /> Because there is nothing but "The Song Remains the Same" to even compare this to a 10 and even if there was more to compare even I would have given a 10 anyway.
