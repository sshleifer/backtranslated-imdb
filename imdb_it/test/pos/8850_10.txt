"The Thing" by John Carpenter is undoubtedly one of the best horror films ever made. Sadly as in most of Carpenter's films, it is also one of the most undervalued films that is cut short by critics shortly after its release for a reason that is almost pathetic. It seems that at the time people were overwhelmed by the idea of ​​the "good" alien. An idea born after the success of "I.T.". And the very thought that a movie dealing with aliens could deviate from that idea was considered a heresy. Human ignorance is really a scary thing, people need to judge films for what they are not for what they want them to be. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" itself is an interesting study on human paranoia as members of an American Antarctic base discovers the presence of an alien being (reported throughout the film only as a "thing") able to imitate any life form. Not knowing who could or might not be the creature, let's see how each character reacts to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic, only a slow and gradual descent into chaos as more and more people turn up ... not really human. <br /> <br /> Carpenter manages to elevate this film to something much more than your science fiction / horror media. There is no "what's behind you?" jumping moments here. Relying instead on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic desperation together with pleasantly balanced moments of visual terror, thanks also to the impressive creature effects of Rob Bottin, gives us an experience unmatched by many other horror films. <br /> <br /> Instead of throwing facts and plot elements onto our face, Carpenter offers us a much more gradual and delicate approach. Insinuating a sense of mystery, it offers the viewer sufficient freedom to interpret-eat what happened in certain scenes, giving a sufficient plot to those who do not like the interpretation in the movies. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of Ennio Morricone works to the end. It is a minimalist and depressing sound that fits perfectly into the overall tone of the film. Even though I always wondered how it would sound if Carpenter (he was known to compose all the OSTs of his films except this one) did it? The characters that are not so developed are still memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors, in particular Kurt Russel who plays the apathetic "down-out" R.J. MacReady. It is worth noting that his character is transformed through the film. From his selfless attitude "do not give a ...." at the beginning, to that of a unifier and leader of the group of men trying to fight "the thing". But even with that being said, there are no false heroisms here, there are no moments of "laughing in the face of death" and there is certainly no comic relief, the film retains its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. By the way, here again Carpenter maintains its tradition of creating a powerful ending. <br /> <br /> A quarter of a century after its release "The Thing" doesn't feel dated. And with the increasingly worrying use of computer-generated effects, it seems even stronger than before, because it shows the work of life and the dedication of human beings, not computers. Combined with its opening for analysis it gives the viewer many more reasons to watch it for a second, third or fourth or ... time. A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.
