The excellent plot of this film makes this movie one of the classic cult ninja movies of all time. The plot is that this woman's soul is possessed by a bad ninja spirit. I intend to be honest if I could get the ninja skill through possession that I would do. Moreover, to be in the 80s and so the fact that the ninja aspect was much larger in this decade is evident and despite all this, Ninja 3 The Domination manages to keep it original from the American Ninja molds that plague the 80s for so long. This girl is definitely Michael Dudikoff on steroids ... I mean the first American ninja was great, but we make real people who have nothing on Ninja 3
