I saw this movie on the big screen when I was a kid and I loved it - cheeziness and all that. Recently, I found a copy on the video and verified it again. Hurt, sure ... funny, for sure. Pack a funny punch again. It's a lot more fun than the boring version of Disney ("Alive"). The only thing "Alive" did better was the special effects. If you are a B-movies lover, I highly recommend "Survive", not to mention all the other films by Ren√© Cardona Jnr ... and the Mexican fight films made by his father (Rene Cardona Snr). "Survive" is long overdue for special DVD treatment. Are you listening, all kind people, in Anchor Bay ...?
