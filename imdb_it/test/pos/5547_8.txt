Time does extraordinary things. He is the last judge. Time has given "Married To The Mob" an extra dose of freshness. There are no dead moments or cheap shots. It's more of a delight now than ever. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a widow of the mafia that is as far from a caricature as anything she has ever done. A true original creation that touches or hints at the stereotype just to guide us, but her Angela is quite unique. The legendary Dean Stockwell presents us with a mafia boss who is as threateningly real as it is hilarious. And Matthew Modine? Why did I think then that he had no chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are wonderful together. This time, they reminded me of Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray of "Remember The Night". I am writing this comment now to entice you to visit or revisit this gem by Jonathan Demme.
