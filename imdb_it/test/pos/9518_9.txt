This is yet another gem of Daniele Thompson's pen - in fact in the same year (1999) he wrote and directed La Buche, the first of the three credits writer / director so far. Belle Maman is above all "French", whatever that obviously means is different things for different people. The premise is simple: at the altar where Mathilde Seigner is marrying, the groom, Vincent Lindon, takes his first look at his mother, Catherine Deneuve, and suffers what the French call a coup de foudre that we know as love at first sight . In theory the story is either 1) on the right then and there assuming that he called the marriage off or 2) just the beginning while going through the marriage and then living a lie until it is solved in one way or another. Thompson heads for the 2 but not without hitting us with the strange subplot as, for example, Deneuve's lesbian mother, the Line Renaud smoker (in real life, if anyone cares, Renaud has a long-term relationship with Stephane Audran , who co-stars here) and throws in a brilliant set-piece in a luxurious Men's Room at the wedding reception, which takes the form of a hilarious song-and-dance. The complain writer of being Thompson also makes the dramatic comedy as the brilliant climatic scene in which Vincent finally expresses his feelings for Deneuve during a family reunion while simultaneously demolishing the cane. This is one to savor. Again and again.
