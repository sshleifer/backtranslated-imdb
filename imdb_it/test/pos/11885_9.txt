My Young Auntie is unique in many ways. First this is the first action movie of Hui Ya-Hung (Kara Hui). Secondly he was doing the fight scenes after a surgery on her a few days before shooting. Third, this film is outside the box. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Wang Lung Wei trying to inherit his brother's legacy. His brother then has Kara to marry him so that Wang can't take the treasure. The story is good enough that it takes everything to the right place. <br /> <br /> The action comes, what can I say that hasn't already been said for films like this, or Disciples of the 36th Chambers, The Victim or even the magnificent butcher. The fighting scenes are what the movie sells, and this will have no problem doing so. Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei are engaged in a struggle that you have to see to believe. Because these two men do not fight each other anymore is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I don't want to ruin anything in reality, but you have to see My Young Auntie get the most out of the exaltation. My only complaint is that Yuen Tak was not used as wide as it was used in 3 Evil Masters, or even Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter) for the excellent must see movies. 9.2 / 10
