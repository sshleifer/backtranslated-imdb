People with an aversion to violence may find some difficult scenes, but The Thing is far from being simply a classic of horror. The fact that extraordinary special effects are opposed to modern CGI is only a small part of why this film, finally, is rightly considered a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in his camera and in editing, superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia supported in everything (with countless views), an excellent soundtrack, and open to readings and analogies multiple, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do justice to this movie. Absolutely essential vision.
