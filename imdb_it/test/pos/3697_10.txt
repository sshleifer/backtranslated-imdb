This movie is excellent The passion between Jade and Billy is memorable and the acting was great, that's why you don't leave a 16-year-old boy and a boy so alone together! It shows why a single mother shouldn't go out with a younger boy with a teenage daughter at home, because he seemed young enough to be Jessy's son. <br /> <br /> I dedicate ten out of ten, The acting was wonderful and the movement between the actors was correct. <br /> <br /> Also the age difference between Jenny and Rob was good, because they were similar in age. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun movie, but I think nobody under the age of 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes.
