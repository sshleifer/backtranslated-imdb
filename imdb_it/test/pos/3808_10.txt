This is a fun surreal road movie. It was written by Joseph Minion, who also wrote After Hours, the excellent surreal film by Martin Scorsese. The film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old boy named Gus, who drives a red Ford Mustang through some imaginary states with names like Tristana (A tribute to the film by Luis Bu√±uel, perhaps?), Essex and South Lyndon, in search of eight fantastic Motorama playing cards from various service stations of the Chimera Company. The film has a surreal aspect because many things are unusual, such as money, which is like a white card with numbers on it. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters are bad with Gus Travel. They tattoo him, punch him, but that doesn't stop the boy in his constant search. Even some weird actors like David Lynch, Jack Nance, Meat Loaf and Flea make appearances. Jack Nance plays the owner of a motel, which when he first meets Gus tells him "If you see squirrels, give them to me". This is a film in which a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes Gus $ 100; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder as he speaks rudely. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and surreal movies, you'll like this. A strange little gem of a movie.
