Two unfortunate but clever women decide to behave like HAVANA WIDOWS while sailing to Cuba to meet and blackmail rich gentlemen ... <br /> <br /> This was the kind of ephemeral comic frippie that the studios produced effortlessly during the 1930s. made and very funny, the audience of the Depression never seems to have enough of these popular and funny frames. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell are perfectly expressed as frantic women and they talk quickly at great lengths to make a little dishonest dough. Although Joan gets both top billing and romantic scenes, both girls are as talented and lookable as they are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The handsome Lyle Talbot plays Joan's persistent suitor, but he is given relatively little to do. Chubby, the cherub Guy Kibbee appears as the set target of the girls. Whether he woke up in the wrong bed or chased on the roof of a Cuban hacienda in his long robes, it's just as much fun. Behind him comes a host of leading actors: Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne, Dewey Robinson - all equally good at satisfying the toughest crowd. <br /> <br /> Movie stars will recognize an unaccredited James Murray as the suspect bank teller with counterfeit control. This very talented actor was pulled out of the darkness to star in THE CROWD (1928) by King Vidor, one of the most prestigious films of the silent era. Hopes were high for a great career, but his celebrity quickly faded with sound images. After a long series of small roles and unusual, broken and indigent parts, his life ended up in the waters of a New York river in 1936. He was only 35 years old. <br /> <br /> Although it was never the first rank, Joan Blondell (1906-1979) and Glenda Farrell (1904-1971) animated dozens of films at Warner Bros. during the 1930s, in particular the eight in which they appeared together. Whether playing gold prospectors or working girls, journalists or secretaries, these blond and brass ladies were almost always able to match any main character who was lucky enough to share an equal billing alongside them. With a joke or a glance, their characters have proven to be ready to face the world - and any man inside it. Never wickedly brazen as Paramount's Mae West, you always had the feeling that, as daring as it was, Blondell and Farrell used their hardness to defend vulnerable hearts ready to break the right boy. While many representations of seventy years ago may seem campy or artificial today, these two adorable women are still animated and impertinent.
