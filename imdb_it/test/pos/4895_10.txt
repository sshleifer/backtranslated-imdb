I must admit that when I heard about the Apocalypse movie it was a concern. <br /> <br /> I mean, they have a lot to live, don't they? When they did a theatrical show for the first time, they won the Perrier award and when they did radio they won a Sony award. When they ventured into our television, they won a Bafta award, a Royal Television Society Award and the Golden Rose of Montreux. <br /> <br /> When the first series was broadcast in January 1999 it was amazing! A real breath of fresh air in British comedy, and when the second series aired a year later it built on that base and sealed the cult status of shows around the world, our web statistics show that we received visitors from every single country on the planet! The "Local show for Local People" showed Gents talent for live performances and opened the doors for men to perform more live performances like "Art" in the west end. <br /> <br /> The favorite fans have always been the Christmas Special, minus a sketch show and more a tribute to the classic horror films but still wrapped in the delightful League style. <br /> <br /> And then of course there was the third "difficult" series, still a hit with the hardcore fans of course, but maybe a little ahead of time for a mainstream TV audience. <br /> <br /> As I say, a lot to live up to. <br /> <br /> So now we have the movie and ... Well, a movie is different isn't it? It will be seen by much larger numbers than radio or television programs and with the third series in mind I was worried. <br /> <br /> As you know, I was lucky enough to see the film yesterday at a screening in London and all my doubts were wiped out (literally) in the first few minutes! I'm not going to give the lines of plot as some reviewers did, nor am I going to tell you the sentences (although there is only one really) but I'll try to tell you what they managed to get with this movie! Leaving the cinema on Monday night, I could only imagine writing "Oh my God, it's brilliant, it's incredible, it's the best thing they've ever done, better than the first, second and specials put together!" Of course I owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! So why is it brilliant? This is a movie for everyone, the casual fan, the obsessive fan of casual fans and even for someone who is sitting in the wrong cinema! You don't have to have seen the series to enjoy this movie; works on so many levels. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of why I'm a fan of the League of Gentlemen! You can say that even the shooting was a real labor of love; attention to detail is incredible. The TV series sets were always detailed, but I'll have to watch the movie again just to look at the background! The story moves at a fast pace, the action that takes us from Royston Vasey to the real world where we meet the "Creators" who are obviously the same League! Along the way we manage to come across favorite characters from the show, but always within the central story, unlike the television sketch show. <br /> <br /> I was happy that the film was obscure in some places, a little scary and a bit strange ... only suitable for The League of Gentlemen. The Gents also managed to get revenge on the BBC's censorship, not so much by slipping into the word "mongoloid" that screams from the rooftops! Some might think that the Gents are a little lenient, but that is the joke and with this comes my only concern, the jokes I mention below could confuse some viewers and could be a little too clever ... but I shouldn't worried, there is always a joke of poo lurking around the corner and that speaks of jokes, they arrive dense and fast, and in a mixture of intelligent references, wig jokes, jokes, visual jokes and cock gags! I haven't laughed aloud in a cinema since ... well, I can't remember! Fans who have been 'with' the League from the start are rewarded with a lot of 'in' jokes, some working on two levels, a mainstream audience can laugh at a reference to a compact disc for a reason, while the fan of the Local the show will laugh for another reason! The cameos are brilliant! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the most bizarre double act you've ever seen, Simon got one of the biggest laughs just making a noise! I was a little worried about the appearance of the 1690 movie when I heard about it for the first time, but like a story in a story where I was really interested when ... but it would have been interesting! All I have to say is that it fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the movie! I am not a professional film reviewer, so I find it difficult to put into words how much I liked this film, but for now I will simply say that if the supposedly benchmark for British comedy films in recent years has been the excellent "Shaun of the Dead 'so I'm sorry but a new benchmark has just been set by inventiveness, hilarious and sometimes a bit scary ... The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Jason Kenny 2005
