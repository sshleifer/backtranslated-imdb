Sophisticated sex comedies are always difficult to achieve. Watch the films of Blake Edwards, who is unquestionably the master of the genre, and you'll find as many mistakes. Because, if a film of this nature never manages to work, it can never fall back on the sense of humor of the tried and true bathroom of a comedy for adolescents [eg. "American Pie"], or warms the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy [ie Julia Roberts' entire career]. He can only maintain a push to the end and hope that the public can appreciate the almost necessary irony of his resolution. <br /> <br /> Written by Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, "Seeing Other People" opens with engaged couple Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson] within seconds of the rear end of the car in front of them . As the frame freezes, we unexpectedly feel the thoughts and fears of both characters. From now on, we are pleased that the story that is about to unfold will enjoy a point of view of both sexes. <br /> <br /> Two months after their votes, Ed & Alice already look and behave like an old married couple. In a bathroom scene, their actions alone show us how comfortable they are and how long they have been together. So when the line is pushed to push the plot forward, presumably from the least probable of the two, it is as if the same relationship was requesting a change, even if it means that it is its own destruction. <br /> <br /> Once all the basic rules have been set [Ed cannot sleep with his mother or, after all, Salma Hayek], the two sides move away in their separate directions in the hope of finding meaningless sex to strengthen their relationship. At the beginning, everything seems to go as planned, while their daily meetings only help turn the passion between them. But predictably, as the deepest emotions of regret and jealousy begin to emerge, they soon find themselves growing and on the verge of breaking. All these actions lead to a resolution that you may or may not like, depending on your degree of cynicism. <br /> <br /> For a comedy like this, you need a solid cast with supportive characters as strong as the leads. And the director Wolodarsky does not disappoint. Here he chose two of my favorite actresses as sisters - Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham - and allows them to play at their strengths. For Nicholson, who always reminded me of a young Shirley MacLaine, he brings an air of naivety and vulnerability to Alice even when his actions seem less than that. And as for Graham, an actress who has shown that she can outperform an entire Howard Hawks ensemble, she steals every scene she finds herself in with an angular "no BS" character. <br /> <br /> As for the boys, Jay Mohr is useful here as Josh Charles. Byron Cranston must be applauded for having a British accent and letting everything take place. But the real pleasure here is Andy Richter and his secondary plot involving the single mother, Helen Slater. While his scenes seem almost to belong to another movie, they are by far the most fun and his poor delivery steals the show. <br /> <br /> For an independent production, "Seeing Other People" has a more personal and introspective feeling - something that would be evident absent from a great Hollywood movie of this type. Not to mention that this film also has some really fun moments - unlike, for example, most of the Hollywood comedies in general. <br /> <br /> Evaluation [on a 5-star system]: 3 1/2 stars
