What I saw of Wolfgang Petersen's films was pretty good. Knows how to direct the action, create suspense and get yourself interested. Eastwood tends to be large, sometimes excellent. This is true both for his acting and for his direction. Both do a solid job here. The concept is not bad, and the game of cat and mouse works well. Malkovich behaves quite well, and his and Eastwood are playing each other adds to the film. I suppose this won't introduce anything new, really ... but it doesn't really pretend, nor does it need to do it. They are two great actors, each with a basic role that they have shown at other points in their career that they manage to handle in an extraordinary way and with a magnificent director at the helm. Really, it's fun, well done, and simply offers. Editing and cinematography are good. It is also acting and writing characters. The film manages to be full of suspense and intense, and if you let yourself go, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are higher quality films. The pace is pretty much right. I recommend it to all fans of the main actors, the director and / or this type of film. 7/10
