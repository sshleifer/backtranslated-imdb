I was a fan of Amanda from All That, and she's still fun. Me too, it's so simple. If you like the Bynes, you'll like this movie. It's fun harmless and pretty funny in some parts. Sebastian's bizarre accent and mannerism are completely unrealistic, but they made me laugh so hard in some places that I almost choked on my popcorn. <br /> <br /> And everything the kids are taught to read Shakespeare (maybe) is a good thing for me. <br /> <br /> On a superficial note, Tatum Channing is rather * ahem * hot. It also does a good job with some of the most difficult scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Some of the side characters are VERY large, but they are large in "Twelfth Night" so it's nice.
