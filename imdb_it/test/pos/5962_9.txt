One of Starevich's first films made in France is perhaps his only political satire. The story of The Frogs Who Wanted A King reflects its title as a group of high "charlatans" who believe that democracy has gone flat, so they ask a king of Jupiter to rule their land. When he sends down a log, the frogs ask for another king, saying that the stock is just "political wood". This time Jupiter sends a hungry stork this time whose frog and lustful eyes devour the inhabitants of the city. While the original "trickster" is about to slip down from the stork's beak, he talks about his morality: "let it be pretty good". This film features some beautiful scenes of dozens of puppet frogs. Starewicz deceives the public into believing that they all move at the same time while keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs at about the same time. The somewhat musty dialogue and lighting problems in some places reduce the quality of repeated views, however its historical significance in Starewicz's life makes it important to observe. His feelings towards the government that immediately follow his escape from Russia are probably expressed in this film. Furthermore, the technical realization of animating so many characters at the same time in a stop motion movie is staggering.
