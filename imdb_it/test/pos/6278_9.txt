In 1952 Hollywood decided to redo the classic of Al Jolson's first speech. <br /> <br /> This time Cantor's son was played by Danny Thomas. Coming home from the army, he is expected to follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives and become a singer. However, the young Mr. Golding has some enthusiasm for the show. <br /> <br /> Right now, he meets Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. He does very well and his interpretation of his favorite song, Lover, is remarkable. The writers were smart not to connect the obvious Jewish boyfriend and the non-Jewish girlfriend relationship. If anything, this is overlooked. In his anger, to betray his commitment to becoming a singer, his father makes the traditional Jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family. This would not be done in circumstances of rupture of a commitment, it would do so if an inter-religious marriage were to take place among the Orthodox. <br /> <br /> Thomas really does a good job in reciting the singer's son. His way of singing is up to par, because the film ends on a positive note. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that technical consultants do not realize that women do not carry pocket books in the synagogue or at all during that time.
