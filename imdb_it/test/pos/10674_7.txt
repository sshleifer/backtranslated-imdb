"Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" (aka "Doppelganger") is a fun science-fiction Twilight Zone offering from Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (the team behind Space: 1999, UFOs, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and others). In the film, Roy Thinnes (of the TV show "Invaders") and Ian Hendry act as astronauts sent on a flight to a planet that shares an exact orbit of the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun; therefore previously hidden from view. A vague European space flight director (dominated by the late Patrick Wymark) gets accelerated flight and, after rigorous training, the astronauts are ready to leave. Thus began the best sequences of the film, the launch, the flight and the landing on the other earth. The miniature work of the dazzling rocket (by Derek Meddings) and a dreamlike and elegant space flight (which somehow resembles the best moments of "2001: A Space Odyssey") are highlights of the film. The "doppelganger" land landing is both exciting and disturbing. After this, the appearance of the film's Twilight Zone comes into play; with a plot raised almost entirely from the classic episode of TZ, "The Parallel". Apart from that, the film is still full of science fiction, with some intriguing things to "chew the world mirror" (for example, backwards writing and left-handed handshakes). Less successful are the scenes that portray a land of the mid-twenty-first century; where all men wear turtlenecks and Nehru jackets and all women wear miniskirts. Some of the relationships with women in the film are very "non-PC" even by today's standards. And (in the major failure of most science fiction of the 20th century) computers, phones and other hardware are all big, colorful and awkward (right from "The Prisoner" by Patrick McGoohan). No one has foreseen the digital microprocessor era! If one can accept these defects in foresight, the film is very interesting, with a solid lead performance by Thinnes as the tortured astronaut. And with a nice nihilistic ending from the 60s / early 70s! For retro science fiction fans (like me) this is a "journey" to take!
