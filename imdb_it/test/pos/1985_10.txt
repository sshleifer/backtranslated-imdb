So let's get started!))) <br /> <br /> The movie itself is as original as Cronenberg's films usually appear ... <br /> <br /> My intention to see it was certainly JJL to be one of my favorite actresses. She is adorable as usual, this beautiful girl! <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say it was my favorite movie. However it is quite interesting and fun to follow. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive, but it is not a sort of array of miscarry stars. ;) <br /> <br /> Recommend with confidence!))))
