I saw it on TCM recently and, through the IMDb, I discovered that there were seven "Crime Doctor" films with Warner Baxter as a psychiatrist-detective. Baxter is a bit long in teeth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier. Not noir, and a little campy today, the film also has a touch of the possible supernatural. The plot, the cinematography and the black and white characters are much more complex than those of the Moto and Charlie Chan series. There are subplots, unexpected twists and appearances from a number of B films, which we should all recognize immediately (no one has ever reached state A). It's a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a series of boxed DVDs of these films.
