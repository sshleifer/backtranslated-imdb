If we consider three films with a similar topic, which is this, which was realized in 1930, "The Covered Wagon", realized in 1923 and "Wagon Master" realized in 1950, the distance between "The Big Trail" and "The Covered Wagon 'is only 7 years old and the distance between' The Big Trail 'and' Wagon Master 'is 20. This is surprising because it shows how many movies have evolved in those 7 years, and how the changes would have been in the next 20 years lenses to come. "The Big Trail is technically close to" Wagon Master ", but differs from" The Covered Wagon ". The story is about pioneers from Missouri to the west of Oregon. Tyrone Power Sr. is the man who leads the caravan, he is a rude and bad guy. John Wayne is the good guy and the movie focuses too much on his good looks, not giving him the chance to be the Wayne we're used to. Marguerite Churchill is such a proud woman that you wonder why Wayne does not forget her. Raoul Walsh was a master at showing trailers and cattle that moved across the west, in 1955 he directed "The Tall Men", which has much in common with "The Big Trail".
