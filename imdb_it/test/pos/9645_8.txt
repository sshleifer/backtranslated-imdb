You can say this is the first offer of the director (who also wrote it), but you can also see the potential of this guy. This is obviously a low budget film in the spirit of Boondock Saints. Sure, Boondock Saints came out a few years later, so you might consider it a diamond that needs some polishing. The acting was good - if you are looking for DeNiro or Michael Madsen in a dramatic crime, remember that these are young boys, who play young boys trying to be criminals. They won't be "supercool" (tm) like some of the veterans. I would have liked to have seen Justin Pagel (Joe - the main character) continue to make more films - it was great in this. Nice movie - 3 out of 5 stars.
