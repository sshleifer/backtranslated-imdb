The film is not perfect in any way, but nevertheless it is very fun and fun to watch. I am the first to agree that Victor Fox is not so attractive and that his music and style are rather poor. I also agree that the film has some strange distractions and some scenes don't work well. So? If it makes you smile and you enjoy who cares? Does every film make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could be razed to the ground admitting to love this movie. Again, so what? He has lovely characters, he is well shot, the acting is mostly good, it never gets too sweet or dramatic, it's bizarre. See how many people love I Dream of Jeannie. It's perfect? Damn no! And while this is very different, I say check and you will be in a good mood after seeing it.
