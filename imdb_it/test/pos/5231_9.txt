The details in The Big Trail were so incredible that I felt the film was made at the moment it represents. I've never seen so real carts! They were large, loaded with accessories, and even felt like they were filled with details under the cloth covers that they would never have seen. Every speck of dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there. Modern computer technology could never recreate the scenes of numerous floats as they move across the earth or circle to repel the Indians. The wagons were all real individual vehicles, each with its own team of horses or oxen. <br /> <br /> The actors' clothing could not have seemed more genuine. With the exception of John Wayne's buckskin dress and Marguerite Churchill's beautiful dress, the clothes were very common, dirty or dirty in an authentic way. Many actors and actresses were born before electricity and internal plumbing were common, and they must have felt at ease with their surroundings. All Indians were real Indians rather than plain whites. <br /> <br /> The women of the old west had to be robust because there was a lot of work. In each scene that shows the work done by the people in the wagon, women are shown cutting wood, transporting logs, etc. This realism was so natural that it did not present itself as a statement about the role of women of the day rather than a fact of survival. <br /> <br /> The plot of revenge and romanticism is played well. Nothing is overrated or exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Something has been lost along the way in the 1930s in Hollywood. As much as you love the bogus scenario and the controlled environment of old movies, The Big Trail can really feel above all else. The more I see big budget films from the silent era, the more I like them. I can think of a few films from the 1930s that I saw equal to the magnitude of the best of the 1920s. If there were home-made movies at the time of the wagons, The Big Trail is what they would be.
