I rarely watch short films because they seem to be only on television until late at night and aren't advertised enough to let me know which movies are worth. Since The Room is an extra feature on The Hitcher DVD, it gave me the opportunity to watch a high quality short film with Rutger Hauer in excellent shape. <br /> <br /> Artistically shot in black and white, The Room explores a man's obsession with a room where he passed into the early stages of adulthood and expresses himself in a documentary / interview style. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man who expresses his feelings for a woman, but it is also juxtaposed to digressions and occasional deficiencies in fluency. This adds a great deal of realism and depth to Hauer's performance that is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him. <br /> <br /> The piano music that Harry (Hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background and improves the moving atmosphere of the film and intensifies the feelings of sadness expressed by Hauer. <br /> <br /> Hauer proves to be more than just a psychotic Hollywood villain with this role and shows his most sensitive side perfectly. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in the young Harry's flashback scenes with a silent role. Show how much he is affected by the music and his disappointment when he leaves. <br /> <br /> The ending is prophetic and leaves you in a reflective mood longer than many feature films. A great effort.
