This is the best, and I mean the ULTIMATE, ADVENTURE CLASSIC! The plot is good against evil. There has always been an abundance of films depicting gray areas, and not enough about the basic good against evil to explain the real cases of good against evil in the real world. Only recently the filmmakers tried to match the odds. In real life well over half of the situations are in black and white, but only a small part of the films makes it look like this. This film is the best example of a black and white look. It is best seen in black and white. The hero is in the worst situation. It is in the territory of a man who wants to kill him and among various enemies. The film gives the feeling of being hopelessly outnumbered and cannot rely on help. His enemy (the count) has numerous resources. The count's wife was forced to marry him, and she knows from her past history that sooner or later he will kill her as all his wives do. She and the hero become allies and fall in love in a place that could conquer anyone who looks (unless that person just wants to be an opposite urchin). Anyone who helps them is killed. They have no escape. The situation is hopeless. So will they survive in the end? You won't guess if you haven't read the spoiler. The film also has a lot of great atmosphere, adventure and intrigue, along with Lon Chaney as a villain, and Boris Karloff in his best role ever, as a good boy. Usually interpreted as a bad boy, Karloff was at his best when he presented himself with more complex roles like this. Chaney was rarely given a complex role, although he showed off his scenes in films like "Of Mice and Men". This is little more than a cameo for him. However, the tension never stops. There is suspense and danger in everything. Perfectly written, perfectly fused and perfectly direct. This is what a film should be: pure escape, pure adventure.
