Superb and fascinating. Justin Henry is beautiful as a prodigy and mischievous Howard Kaylan, lead singer for the top ten band, The Turtles. The real magic is the sequence titled with an award at the academy worthy of Royale Watkins. A performance that completely captures the mystic and at the same time Jimi Hendrix. Not many films, incredibly, can find the essence of a special moment in a life and in times. I'd like to see it available at any home video store without any problems. Uh..qual'affare? <br /> <br /> Thanks Eddie. A worthy addition to the history of sixties psychedelics. A sparkle defined in the eyes of the mind.
