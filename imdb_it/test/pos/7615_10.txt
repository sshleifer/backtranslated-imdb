I saw it when it came out and I've seen it several times since. I have the DVD. It is one of Drew Barrymore's best works and one that is worth seeing more than once. <br /> <br /> Not being popular in high school there was one of the things in the film I could identify with. I wasn't as tortured as Josie was (during his real high school days) or as Aldys, but I was never the go-to-the-major party either. The prom scenes are the three famous girls who fall victim to their own joke when Josie pushes away Aldys (the intended victim) is my favorite scene and I applauded when I first saw her. <br /> <br /> I can still see this movie today. it's excellent.
