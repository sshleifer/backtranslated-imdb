"Shadows" is often hailed as the film that was the forerunner of American independent cinema. Whether it's true or not, it's an undeniably important film, one whose influence can be traced back to today's Sundance forage. Here is a film that deals with controversial topics of the day (ie racism), and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative way. Also, he takes care of sex in a sincere way that Hollywood won't even discuss until "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> However, is the question still as powerful today as when it was originally published? The answer is yes. While many important films are hard to watch and dated these days, "Shadows" retains every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now. It addresses racism as a personal and not a political problem, so it is still relevant. It also functions as a large time capsule, capturing the 50s beat generation and the New York art scene in a way that probably no one else has. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, it is certainly uneven. Cassavetes has not yet gained full confidence as a director and uncertain editing reflects the film's low budget. However, the story of the film remains powerful. Furthermore, the acting, considering the inexperience of the cast and the improvisational nature, is phenomenal. All around, the actors create realistic characters, the ones that remain nice despite their often less than admirable actions. "Shadows" is an absolutely mandatory vision for movie fans. (9/10)
