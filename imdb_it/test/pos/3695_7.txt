Without going into the details of a good ... if a TV movie a bit provocative, there seems to be a consensus among users that there is no "anyone to blame here". <br /> <br /> I disagree. Yes, Beverly D'Angelo's young male lover, played by Rob Estes, can be young and horny (and good-looking) because he doesn't want to get what he wants from his mom, that doesn't mean he can get on the bed and have sex with the daughter. OK, you can use the excuse that you just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it. People must take responsibility for their actions. Not only did she "cross the line" by having sex with a very vulnerable teenager when she was supposedly "the responsible adult", she said, "Your mother should never know about this." How responsible was he then? Yes, it's a good movie, but he got what was coming from him. Don't deceive yourself that what happened was "no one has fault".
