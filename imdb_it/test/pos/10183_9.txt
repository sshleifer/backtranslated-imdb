Meticulously built and perfectly interpreted, To The Ends Of The Earth is a journey that is simply amazing from our reality and in another era. <br /> <br /> Based on the William Golding trilogy, these three 90-minute films tell the journey to both Australia and the experience of juvenile aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an old man of war in the early nineteenth century as it headed towards a Down Under government position. <br /> <br /> Between the crew and the confident migrants who share his passage is a stormy and overbearing captain (Jared Harris), a politically radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a tender first lieutenant who makes his way from bass (Jamie Sives) and, briefly, the first touch of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page) whose ship literally passes through the night. <br /> <br /> In addition to the surprising level of historical physical accuracy, director David Attwood and screenwriters Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson have a shrewd look and and for the good manners and rigid etiquette of an earlier time, creating a totally convincing microcosm of the Napoleonic era. <br /> <br /> The life on board is a brutal, monotonous turn of seasickness, squalor and danger after another and when Edmund becomes entangled in the loves, hopes and miseries of his traveling companions, he experiments a delirious vortex of the difficulties of life, of the inhumanity of man and his noblest feelings. <br /> <br /> Those who loved the Master and the Commander: The Far Side Of The World or the series of Patrick O'Brian novels on which it is based will love it? for everyone else, it's a completely new world to discover.
