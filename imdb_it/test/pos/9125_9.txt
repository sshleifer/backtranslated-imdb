"All men are guilty," says the police chief. "They are born innocent but do not last." Add this bit of nihilism to the charm of Jean-Pierre Melville with the idea of ​​the scam's honor code and you have Le Cercle Rouge. This code of honor among scammers, however, is not simply a cliché; it is a figment of the imagination even when the film's moralists - realist moralists from their point of view, romantic moralists from most of the others - began making films on the subject. Their theme is that it's not what you do, but how you do it. We often find ourselves with stories about experienced men with their sense of honor, stories in which destiny, fatalism and code manage things. <br /> <br /> For most of humanity, with the exception of writers and directors, this could seriously hamper the way you live your life, raise your children and be a good friend. This maniacal fatalism is something of a self-indulgent notion. Le Cercle Rouge is, in my opinion, a classic film for people who could secretly enjoy the adventure of losing the last bus at home. But where Melville's Le Samourai - Criterion Collection, in my opinion, is a story that dominates style, Le Cercle Rouge handles the great trick of combining style with a strong story and compelling actors. The point of the film, in my opinion, makes no sense ... but the film itself is a first-class experience. <br /> <br /> Melville's hopeless story of three scammers - Cory (Alain Delon), Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - is based on a little wisdom that is, perhaps , attributed to the Buddha: that all men who are destined to meet, ... together with their destiny cannot change. Perhaps, because some believe that Melville himself had the formulation if not the thought. However, at the beginning we know that this film will not end happily, it will depend on fate and coincidence to fix things for us and let us remember the nihilistic philosophies that we discovered and loved when we were in high school. Once Corey and Vogel meet and then gather in Jansen's unique talents, we set off on a one-way ride to steal an exclusive and heavily protected jewelry store on Place Vendome. The tension arises because not only do we know that the French police are following Vogel, but we also realize that certain determined criminals are looking for Corey. <br /> <br /> The great pleasure of the film, for me, came from admiring the work that Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their characters, and the intelligent ruthlessness that Andre Bouvril brought to his character, the Mattei police captain. Melville enthralled me as he developed these characters and their own situations; he built me ​​emotionally and then freed me when he brought me to appreciate their probable destiny and to show me see it happen. Melville sets his set pieces: the escape from the train, the escape from the woods, the latest shootings in the woods, the meetings with Mattei and a man who refuses to get informed - with intriguing possibilities. It builds tension in all these cases by taking its time; a rare feature in the cinema and an even rarer stretch now. And Melville takes the time to build Mattei as an individual. Mattei is a sad, expert man. He is a loner. He has a fixed routine when he returns to his apartment - he greets his three cats affectionately, draws his bathroom and while the tub fills up, he prepares food for them. I don't know who is destined to meet Mattei, but I hope he is someone who likes cats. <br /> <br /> Nihilism is always in fashion among some creative people and some critics. In most cases, I think it is a much more difficult task to put nihilism to one side and simply live one's life without harming too many people. (And this is even more difficult to show irresistibly in a film.) Le Cercle Rouge is a film that, for me, tells me little, but it is in its own way, I think, a film beautifully put together.
