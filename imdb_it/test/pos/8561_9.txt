I agree that this film has achieved its goals perfectly. I saw him on Showtime late at night as a teenager, and back in college. I thought it was funny. And there are boobs everywhere! It seems that at the end of the 70s and 80s there were a lot of this kind of films made, from R rated movies like "Porkys" to "Au Pair Girls" soft-core; it's a shame that they seem to have fallen by the wayside in terms of popularity. The thing that made HOTS fantastic is that, like the previous two films, it's really fun. HOTS is like a girl version of "Animal House", with girls forming a sort of sisterhood and falling in love with campus bedlam. In a side note, those who designed the clothes for the "Hooters" girls must surely have seen this film.
