It is hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a Norwegian immigrant was and would have been a chemist on the American public and how much of a national tragedy had been seen his sudden death in 1931. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who revolutionized and disseminated university football and put a small and obscure Catholic college on the map. I have heard clips from the famous speeches of Rockne and it is as disturbing as Pat O "Brien perfectly has the voice and inflection. In what turned out to be his career role, Pat O'Brien captures integrity and spirit Combat that was Rockne Rockne is assisted by Gale Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne who complained about her home as a training camp for Notre Dame, but she never threw anyone out of the house. <br /> <br /> The first "Rockne's impact on football was not a coach with Notre Dame. One fine day in the second half of a soccer game lost to the heavily favored Army, Rockne and team-mate Gus Dorais, played by Owen Davis, used "Throw it forward as an offensive weapon. Before football was just a game where you just had bigger guys for your team and you ran the defense. Rockne didn't invent the pass forward, but he made it popular and football. and of a game of strategy as well as skill. <br /> <br /> Rockne also knew how to work the media. Those well-publicized speeches of his were not just to inspire his players. They were well publicized and it was thanks to him that college football became an important sport in that golden age of sport in the roaring twenties. <br /> <br /> Reproduction of a small but fundamental role is Ronald Reagan. Like George Gipp, the first player that Rockne trained to achieve greatness, Reagan not only got a good performance, but forever after a name that was useful in his later political career. That death bed scene that Rockne had sworn was accurate became a Republican battle cry when many GOP losers came out to win one for Gipper. <br /> <br /> I still remember a photograph widely distributed in 1981 which was one of the first to recover President Ronald Reagan at the Notre Dame ceremony with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan has always credited O'Brien and Dick Powell to all the Warner Brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging for a young lotto player trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Notre Dame himself owes his prestige to Rockne. It is possible that Notre Dame is a dark little Catholic College without the reputation that football has brought to it. <br /> <br /> Although George Gipp and the famous Four Horsemen backfield certainly had their place in the sun it was Rockne who had the reputation. It is no coincidence that Warner Brothers was able to obtain Amos Alonzo Stagg, Glenn 'Pop' Warner, Howard Jones and William Spaulding, the contemporaries and coaches of Rockne with a great reputation in their right to appear in Knute Rockne, All American. He was there to honor the boy who was the number one in their profession. I think most football fans will appreciate Knute Rockne, All American. Even if you could become one after watching the movie.
