It is a pity that House Calls is no longer known. Perhaps because the romantic protagonists are middle-aged adolescents, with indifference and adolescents, rather than overworked? It could be. If you are over 35, you will probably have this comedy. If you are over 45, you will really have this comedy. If you're 25, wait until you're older to see it. <br /> <br /> The unlikely match between Matthau and Jackson works just because it's so unlikely. There is a wonderful line from Matthau that sums up what is happening between them: "I like old girls because you don't have to explain who Ronald Coleman is." (If this is not the exact line, it is close ...) <br /> <br /> The premise of a secondary hospital run by incompetents sounds true. Art Carney's portrait of a senile surgeon is absolutely brilliant. It is impossible not to laugh loud at his delivery. The subplots, if you can call them that, are also fun, like between Matthau and Jackson's teenage son. Everything strikes exactly the right tone. <br /> <br /> Ok, there's a bit where Matthau has to wear a slightly exaggerated women's clothing and an easy mark. But still - it's Walter Matthau in drag! It is funny!
