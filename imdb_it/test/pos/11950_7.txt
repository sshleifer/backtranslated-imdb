This is the next creation of Better Off Dead. In a competition, Better Off Dead would win hands down. But for the power of the stars, One Crazy Summer highlights Savage Steve's best script. Problems with One Crazy Summer (OCS): casting. Better Off Dead (BOD) has been chosen much better. Friendship: OCS shows Cusack giving hateful looks to Bill Murray's little brother. Set problems ?? Other outrageous friends in OCS, but more genuine friends in BOD. The plot was good. You expect some, but even the predictable parts go beyond what you think they could. So, even if this is the ugly half-sister of Better Off Dead, it's worth a look. See Demi Moore before plastic surgery, if for no other reason. John Cusack fans, you have to see it, just to say you have. If you don't like Bobcat Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I don't like him either, but you can't run away from him in this. At least he does a great job in the film paying homage to another monster in the film. Need help changing on the beach, but for the most part, there's not much to complain about. Overall, it's good and fun. But try not to compare it to BOD or you'll find it missing. *sigh*
