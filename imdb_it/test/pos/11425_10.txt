When I saw this film for the first time I couldn't believe my eyes. In front of me there was a fantastic and well-made parody of Valentino ... seeing Stan Laurel's bullfighting like this is like seeing a great fencer in action! It's a very good parody, full of ideas, with a smart and charming Stan ... old and as good as whiskey. (or alcohol after that)
