Perhaps the best film ever made by director Kevin Tenney (well, his Witchboard is not at the top of my horror list of all time), this is a strange and fascinating mix between Pin and Child's Play, both better than this, but not so better. Of course, the plot is invented and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good, Rosalind Allen is very pleasing to the eye (and so is Candance McKenzie - God bless her for the shower scene!), The child actress is very good in interpreting the disturbed daughter and Pinocchio's puppet they are scary enough to give you some shiver down your spine. It's not bad for a B movie.
