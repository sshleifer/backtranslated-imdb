This is an account of events that have been discussed several times in the press, and I had read two books - "A Voyage for Madmen" and "The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst" before seeing the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say that he exceeded all expectations in his story of the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe yacht race. These men decided to do something that had never been done before without support ships, wooden boats, without satellite phones, without GPS, and only their intelligence and ability to get them around the globe in one piece. Not to mention the months of solitude, the thundering southern ocean, the insignificant sleep and the boats that literally fell apart around them. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very well put together in my opinion, well cared for, well paced with superb narration. The archive material and the interviews are fascinating and give life to the story. The video of the interviews with Clare Crowhurst is particularly revealing and moving when it relates the events that led to her husband, Donald Crowhurst's departure from Teignmouth, the doubts and fears in his mind and his reaction when subsequent events took place. they are deployed. <br /> <br /> I was moved and even shed a tear or two when the credits began to spin, and I heard other people expressing similar feelings. <br /> <br /> The two books I mentioned above are useful for more details and background information that could not have been mounted in the 90 minutes and I would also recommend it to those. <br /> <br /> This is ultimately a true story of human courage and human frailty. To see for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human effort and the heroes of real life.
