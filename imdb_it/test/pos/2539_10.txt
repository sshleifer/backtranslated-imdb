The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film only adds to the intensity of the powerful message of the BAbenco director. The film is divided into two parts: the first of a reformatory in which a group of young people is abused and violated by the police and violent guardians. The second background is the city in which they are instead confined with their own actions and morality, which include mugging, exploitation and killing of different characters that enter their lives. <br /> <br /> The different sexual and sexual roles in the film allow for continuous changes in characters as they interact with other people. Particularly interesting is the character of Lalica, a transvestite who is a mother and lover of some children. His reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute, is both moving and tragic. <br /> <br /> There is no happy ending to this story and I advise you to watch it with caution because there are some very awkward scenes to look at especially in the twenty minute opening. But while watching it, it is important to remember that this is not just an imaginary story. The actors are not trained professionals, but boys selected from the streets of San Paolo. In reality they have lived this life that is represented so vividly on the screen and in the case of da Silva, who died at the hands of the police who is so brutally represented. A documentary? A fictional piece. It borders on both, but it is certainly a harrowing material and it is a film that leaves you breathless and thinks long after watching it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
