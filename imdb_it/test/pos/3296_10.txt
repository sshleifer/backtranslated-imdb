This distorted comedy is well interpreted and directed. Very funny and the quality of the production is exceptional. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted at so many festivals and has won awards. <br /> <br /> Everyone can identify with Calvin who has a bad day, a bad week, a bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and an omen that gives this film the right balance. The old adds the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love suicidal goldfish! <br /> <br /> This short will bring lots of laughs. And don't lose the credits while they're playing at the end!
