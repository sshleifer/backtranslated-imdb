I read Ashew's comment and thought they should look at a completely different picture! <br /> <br /> I just watched the movie this morning and was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> To respond to ashew's comments: <br /> <br /> Trail Street is a very well done western. <br /> <br /> And Randolph Scott worked on it a lot! <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes was more fun than I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The bad guys have had excellent skills as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Also: <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan as a ladder - good guy - he's usually so slimy. <br /> <br /> In all, a good western, very well recited and written. <br /> <br /> I liked the background story of Kansas and the winter wheat "which presumably helped him become a state also. <br /> <br /> I thought the girl who played Susan was adorable - I can't think why she hasn't become a bigger star!
