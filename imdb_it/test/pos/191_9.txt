The film by director Mikhail Kalatozov The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema. From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov, based on his work, Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering of those who stayed at home. Overwhelmed by countless war films that show us the lines of the front and the carnage, the theme itself becomes boring and avoidable. However, this Russian gem shows how the story of difficulties can be told in a different way; telling us, directly from the mouth of a soldier, how the war is hated by all, hoping that those who died do so for a cause that will allow peace and an end to the fighting, we see a new vision of the Second World War. We have young people who volunteer to make war for peace, to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than groups fighting a battle they don't believe. With so much hatred for our current situation in the Middle East and how people are dying for no reason, against their will, it's nice to see a movie that shows how disinterested and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those waiting for their return. <br /> <br /> Communist Russia shows how much everyone has been involved in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the front line, his father is the head doctor of a hospital that helps repair injured soldiers and his sister is helping him there, as well as his girlfriend Veronika, doing everything possible to not think of the fact that no letter came from his love. An entire city comes out to send the kids to celebrate. Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work to send representatives with gifts of gratitude. I don't know if this is all a glorified look in Russia at the beginning of World War II or not. There are no protests or bad moods of these kids who risk their lives for a country, it's all a praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this because if you agree with the war or not, protesting and wreaking havoc in your name does nothing but cheat what these men and women are sacrificing every day. <br /> <br /> acting is top notch, but some deserve to be chosen. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris's grandmother. She is the only member of the family she can trust and her sadness upon leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev, like patriarch Fjodor Ivanovic, brings what is perhaps the best interpretation. As said at the end, concerning the fathers who need to stifle the hidden tears, Merkuryev personifies those feelings. He puts on a hard outside, especially by beating his jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteer work a few hours before he has to leave. But when Boris leaves to go to the assembly station we see the real pain of the man, sitting in pain at the table. He loves his dear son and although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the film express it to the public. Aleksey Batalov is as effective as Boris, a happy and fortunate, and idealistic young man, doing what he believes is right, and Aleksandr Shvorin is as good as the bad Mark, staying home for his talented piano skills, or maybe just for to steal his cousin's love That love, played by Tatyana Samojlova, really draws the audience towards its pain, despair and the subtle glimmer of hope. The real star of the film, she has to go through many emotions on a journey where she loses her way, she needs to go back, hoping she did it soon enough for Boris to return. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realism of the plot, in addition to being afraid to use tragedy to push the theme through, I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is surprising, especially considering that the film was shot in full screen. It is one thing to create fantastic compositions in a widescreen landscape; it is completely different to do it in a square frame. From the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding catwalk along the water, a bridge in the background at the top, while our two lovers climb the screen and arrive in the distance. There are several cases where the camera is behind the barriers, but still allows you to see the action, creating a unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are used, as well as a careful block to allow shooting from above and exaggerated combinations of framed characters. <br /> <br /> The real achievements, however, are those of the long shot. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it is magnificent earlier as it roams those who say goodbye to their loved ones while searching for Boris, his goodbye that needs to be said. The planning of this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves and moves away from people, the camera focuses on pairs of kisses, people screaming at each other and more, all intentionally framed at specific times while the camera moves. Everyone needed to hit his mark with precision and this leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It's just part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful positioning and staging can show the public what they need in the simplest way possible. The composition and professionalism of the actors and crew can work wonders, adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do.
