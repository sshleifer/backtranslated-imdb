It is surprising that a production like this is realized these days, especially for television. Considering the strong sexual themes and explicit scenes of making love, not to mention lesbianism, this was given superb treatment and direction. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes are impeccable, the direction is elegant and the characters are nice. There is a good dose of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes. The protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not without happiness. Furthermore, this production avoids the mistake that most films / shows make when it comes to homosexuality / lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems that to allow people to feel comfortable watching gays and lesbians on TV and in movies, most shows fill it with clich√©s and make characters obsessed with being gay. Not so with this. In Tipping the Velvet, the main character is barely aware of what it means to be a lesbian! <br /> <br /> The BBC has made some wonderful productions in the past, and this adventurous piece of the period only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts.
