* Small spoilers * I just wanted to say that for anyone who loves to entertain baseball movies, this is definitely one of my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this in my mind. I would also like to praise the writers of this film for creating such a pleasant dialogue !! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very suitable for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character like a baseball player. His animosity towards playing abroad in Japan sets the tone for comic but meaningful interactions with his new team, the Dragons. He has to adapt to life in Japan ("Before I wash you, THEN take a bath!") In the end he sees his eyes with his trainer and sets his goals to have that last season of greatness, even if in a very different environment from what ever imagined! So for any baseball fan or anyone wanting to see a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball won't let you down!
