The science fiction premise is not unique (although it was rather back in time), but the focus is completely different compared to other artificial reality films. Especially during the first part it is an elaborate criminal picture, which uses the science fiction premise to tell an unusual criminal story in which the detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanished characters and useless witnesses who must not lie to be useless. Instead of an unreliable storyteller, we have an unreliable world. <br /> <br /> In the second part we follow the protagonist's struggle for sanity and it becomes more a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. Do you know that its very existence is nothing but electrical impulses, how does it behave with this knowledge? He knows that there is a world more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world in which nobody can understand him. The problem of thinking about knowing something essential about the world that no one else knows or wants to believe is very real that many of us can identify with. For me the film carries this desperation very well, with its squalid and artificial atmosphere that also supports the actual artificiality of the film world. <br /> <br /> In addition to "The Matrix" or "The Thirteenth Floor" he is not very interested in evoking a sense of wonder at his artificial reality plot, instead he concentrates a lot on the psychological aspects. Philosophy is just so interesting as some philosophical concepts are essential in the way they shape and alter the perception of the character's world. It's probably longer than it needs to be (which isn't a problem if you're as fascinated as I was) and the second part is pretty bad.
