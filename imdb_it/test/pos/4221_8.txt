This is the funniest sequel I've seen in a long time. It's a lot more fun than the other three and it's not a little scary. It has some very gory parts in the film, but not bad enough to make you sick. In this he has a doll companion, hence the name. If you enjoyed the first three, you'll like it, go see it!
