After seeing "La Pianiste" several years ago, I told myself that I would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing. Time went on, but I couldn't get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut out of her mind. The story of a respected piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory, fresh and collected on the surface, an expert on classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, hatred of oneself and self-destruction strong enough to ruin his request more than a vision. I read the book "The Piano Teacher" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial winner of the Nobel Prize for literature on which the film is based and, after reading it, I saw the film again. The second time, all the puzzle pieces have arrived in the right places. Not very often an extraordinary harrowing book is transferred to the screen with a brilliance like "The Pianists". Three actors gave exceptional performances. Franz Schubert's piano music, "imbued with a morbid humanity", is another brilliant star of the film. <br /> <br /> I have only one problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to the character of Erika comparing it with the novel. In the book, the furthest she went to reveal to Walter, the young conservatory student who was attracted to her, was in a letter. As soon as she realized what she was dealing with and showed her how much he had been rejected by it, she had stopped communicating with him. The Erika of the book would never pursue Walter to throw himself at him. She kept everything inside - she didn't like acting, she wasn't a huntress - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. He tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course Huppert was heartbreaking), but he took the mystery around her - Jelinek didn't write that scene, it looked and seemed false in an otherwise excellent film.
