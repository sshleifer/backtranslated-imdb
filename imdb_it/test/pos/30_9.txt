'The Dresser' is one of those films that are so perfect that you really have trouble finding something you don't like about them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser of the legendary Donald Wolfit), he shines with energy and true love for life behind the limelight. <br /> <br /> As "Sir", the overbearing actor and the main objective of the game, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether to complain about the lack of a storm during the "blow, twenty ..." a bit of "King Lear" or chat with his faithful stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, as good as ever) in the old days. Like Norman, his field apprentice, Tom Courtenay makes a fabulous performance, wriggling around the beck and call of "Lear", picking up a bottle to go to the pub or maliciously denigrating the former Fool, Mr Davenport-Scott (often mentioned , but never seen!). <br /> <br /> In an engaging support cast, there is Edward Fox in the role of Oxenby (a typical arrogant runner-up), Zena Walker as his Ladyship, Lockwood West as substitute Fool and many others. <br /> <br /> This film has a great energy, bringing with it a bit of grease from its origins on the stage, it's true, but being so well acted you don't realize it. Really well done.
