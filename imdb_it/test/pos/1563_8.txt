I just saw it on cable. I liked it. He kept my interest and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple was very good and good at being subtly scary. Cinematography isn't great, but the bleak video also adds a sense of realism, so it's a compromise, you know? Sometimes the girl struck the New England accent hard. The accent would come and go. Anyway, I thought the film was well done overall, however. The plot was strong and the dramatic tension was held because you felt that theirs was a subtle mystery in progress, even if things seemed trivial. Good low budget work. Another good SUNY buying director. Well done.
