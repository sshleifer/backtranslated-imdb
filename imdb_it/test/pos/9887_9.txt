Many films try to take universal themes and make a comedy; but few will live up to the situation as "Checking Out". The film is brilliant. The dialogue is well written and true to form. Acting is absolutely first. Peter Falk gave a truly exceptional performance - as an actor; as an actor He is able to bring the cast to greatness. Another great performance is given by Laura San Giacomo. She is such an intriguing actress. His performances take one by surprise. No matter what role she is asked to give - from wacko in Stephen King's "The Stand" to her television performances. However, "Checking Out" allows it to shine. It is a role he must interpret. The film is brilliantly directed by Jeff Hare. He was able to bring out the best of his cast and his direction - in every respect - made the film a wonderful treasure. Jeff Hare was able to make a difficult subject laughable and yet profound. It gives us a close and personal look at why indie films need to be made. The knowledge of the directors of his cast and screenplay is extended to the finished film. The results are exceptional. <br /> <br /> We hope it will be made available to a wide audience because it is one of those you will not want to miss. It has the potential to be the 2005 hit - like "My Big Fat Greek Wedding".
