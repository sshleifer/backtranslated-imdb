Extraordinary at best, intriguing for the worst, the revolutionary epic of Francis Ford Coppala "Apocalypse Now" is one of the most iconic and celebrated films of the 20th century and, in my opinion, the largest film representation focused on American involvement in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> What I like most about "Apocalypse Now" is that it is uniquely different from any other film of the same genre. Growing up as a movie buff and with a particular interest in war movies, I saw many movies, which tried to portray the "images" and "feelings" of Vietnam, but they failed. Films like "Hamburger Hill" and "We were soldiers" fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam through the representation of "heroic battles" that are, more often than not, contaminated by the zeal of Hollywood film production. /> <br /> In 'Apocalypse now' there are no battles, neither heroes nor villains, there is nothing in the film to suggest that it is intended to reflect images of Vietnam through the physical aspects of war. Rather, it is a film, which investigates and explores forcefully the human psyche when it is tormented by the absolute "horror" of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century. <br /> <br /> The brilliance of acting (in particular Martin Sheen's interpretation of the taciturn Captain Willard), together with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Philippines), which provides a crucial realism in the background of the film, renders Apocalypse Now an unforgettable epic. /> <br /> By evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a vortex of mediation, "Apocalypse now" is not for the carefree spectator. It is a masterpiece that requires multiple visualizations to be fully appreciated.
