Ok ... so I'm looking through the vast DVD collection of my father and mother (especially because they don't charge late fees ;-)) and I come across "A Thousand Acres". I was stunned that there was a movie here with Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer (with a small appearance by Jennifer Jason Leigh) that I had not seen. I don't think I've ever even heard of it before. Well, that's exactly the kind of dream I dream about since I have to admit that my parents raised two film buffs in me and my brother. With few exceptions (neither of us can even think of watching the Lord of the Rings films, but my father loves the Matrix trilogy - GO FIGURE), we have very similar tastes in the movies. <br /> <br /> Today was a particularly AUGURA day, in terms of time. It rained all day, so I went into this movie and soon I was enchanted. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the best "sleepers" of all time I've seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are GREAT in their roles, especially because they play very different types. The character of Jessica Lange is a follower liked by people who, despite being the eldest son of the family, rarely takes on a leading role. Rather, she bows to her father (Jason Robards) and her sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and is determined to teach her little sister Caroline (Leigh) how to follow the example. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very strong cancer survivor who is barely able to maintain anger in her unhappy contained life. This film is five years before White Oleander, mind you, so it was certainly inspiring to see her play such a strong and angry character. <br /> <br /> I should say that this film will probably appeal to women more. However, real movie fans who enjoy a movie for what it is, regardless of genre or target audience, will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what the people involved do and those they do who love them. I don't know how he lost the vision of this film before, but it certainly was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. TO ENJOY!!
