Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep and intense Hamlet ever made - no other version comes close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors who have interpreted it. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is fierce and still supportive: I particularly like the two doofus who play Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very reckless and sinister. Some might complain about the need for a strong Ophelia - it's not a strong person, that's the point, and Lalla Ward hits the appropriate nuances. Amazing. Simply fantastic - each of the more than two dozen times I've looked at it.
