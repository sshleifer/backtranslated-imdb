I really enjoyed this movie - not so much for the story (which was fine, but it was a bit slow in the points) but more for the incredibly beautiful scenery of Greece and the Greek islands! Susan Sarandon is absolutely engaging as the carefree love interest of John Cassavetes - a man "on the edge". But the scenario! Oh oh oh!
