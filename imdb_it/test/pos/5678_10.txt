I went out with my friends and saw this movie last weekend here in London. We didn't know what to expect, the poster gave away a little, and I won't say anything else to not ruin the plot, but we found it to be an excellent film with great acting, a convincing and disturbing plot to die for! Having done some research on the making of the film, I have to deliver it to those kids, directors, actors, writers, etc., for putting together a film with such limited resources. Post-production is also very well done. For all this, I give them a 10 out of 10, and I hope they will continue their excellent work. Keep it up, guys. You are strong!
