I loved this movie and I recommend it to everyone who loves espionage and who thought that Johnny English was an embarrassment. This is the film that JE should have been. But it's based on an old series of French films so it's not tied to Bond. <br /> <br /> The production is brilliant, you will almost believe that the film was shot in the 60s. It even has the same kind of pastel as the movies to color in those days. Jean Dujardin plays his part with the right amount of stupidity and naivety, not with the stupidity of amateur pants like Rowan Atkinson. And even if you don't like the movie, you'll want to see it for Berenice Bejo. Ooh La La! She's hot ...
