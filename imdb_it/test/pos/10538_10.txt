Comments from previous users are really hard. One wonders if they have ever seen this beautiful sweet film. As for being so unpleasant in front of the writer / director..this is simply rude! For those who grew up in the eighties, it is an artistic piece of nostalgia and a sweet story well acted and produced. Irish film production certainly has many angry and involved people, and the comment on the spleen made about this is proof of this .. As people we have a choice; give out and complain about people who actually go out there and do things or do something on their own .. I know which one is easier ... Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and see how a short film is made ... I will not be disappointed
