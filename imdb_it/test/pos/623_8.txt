Fantastic low-budget thriller with more twists than you can shake, and a lot of macabre humor along the way. <br /> <br /> The cast interprets it very well, although Richards' self-taught central director is a bit difficult to handle sometimes. The small two-scene cameo by Sir Alec Guinness, which exudes the threat of the Moscow crime tzar, is simply the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> It's worth repeating, but not in dark nights when you're all alone!
