I saw it in preview and it seems not to have been published in the United States, however it was one of the most entertaining little comedies. It's about the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small British town. The plot [of the film] gets a little out of hand in the third act, but the characters are very funny and memorable. <br /> <br /> Acting is exceptional across the board. Sure to be neglected in the crunch of blockbusters, this is a movie that is worth watching. I know I will try to capture this in theaters and / or buy the video.
