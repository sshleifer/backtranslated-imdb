I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to take your head off your ass when you don't find this hilarious movie! If this is not your "cup of tea", so to speak, then look at it for what it really is - a damn funny movie. Maybe they went on the road to make another drug movie / T & A, but in this case they really got to the point. It's especially fun for Ali G fans, because it offers everything we've learned to love and expect from him. So I say BIG UPS to Ali G, and if it's not your thing, don't complain - BATTY BOY!
