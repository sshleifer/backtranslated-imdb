In my opinion the Dad's army is the best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you watch only one episode of the show you cannot judge completely in that episode, (this includes the film) You must at least watch a series of this show, enter the characters, become familiar with the surroundings and the situations in which they find themselves. When you become familiar with the show, you will begin to like it. Now the film has some changes to the series which is slightly disappointing but still works. Watch a series or two of the show before watching it. You will not be disappointed. A good episode to watch is "No Spring for Frazer"
