Normally, films stay out of the realm of "domestic drama", and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to do in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and custody battles are bad and necessary parts. This is not the escape - the number one reason the average person turns to movies - this is a sad reality. <br /> <br /> Normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a larger story and affects how we understand it or relate to its characters. "Kramer vs. Kramer" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why it makes it so disturbing. This is a challenge both for this film and its audience: transforming something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us feel spiteful while the mirror is held on our face. Writer / director Robert Benton surely reaches both and impressively adapting this Avery Corman novel. <br /> <br /> The story, as you'd expect, is pretty simple: Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), a great publicist. he returns home and finds his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) who leaves him and their son Billy (Justin Henry) 7 years old. So Ted must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' lives and as soon as he does, Joanna brings him a custody suit on him. <br /> <br /> Creating a winning drama at the Oscars on something so generic and in particular dialogue, first of all, requires tremendous talent. You don't get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is at the peak in this role: his first Oscar win after three other noteworthy nominations. Create a complete character, one whose self-centered and irascible ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the only donor. Streep wins her first Oscar only in the second main role of her career as a woman who does not get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment to her decision to leave and a renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody. Streep does it effortlessly. The young man, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest candidate in the competitive category in the history of the Academy Awards, exceptionally interprets the embodiment of all 7-year-old children. <br /> <br /> Benton's writing and direction takes them to the level where we see the problems of this family more deeply than we do ourselves and then reconsider our thoughts on love and growth of the family. Previous Benton awards ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") did not indicate strong mastery of family drama, but man can highlight writing. Many scenes give us strong images that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they represent. The first morning when Joanna left and Ted make Billy's French toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent of this film in a scene that happens every morning in American kitchens. <br /> <br /> We rarely see a simple story like "Kramer vs Kramer" done better. There are no surprises at the end or twists that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talents and they are all safe, offering a new understanding of such a familiar topic.
