It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's a reaction of love or hate. You will probably love it or hate it. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because they obviously have some kind of impact. I'm in the five-star field because this film made a real number about me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was quite tuned when this was happening. Especially Afghanistan and I feel guilty about this. The music through the film was beautiful. I continued to get lost especially during some of the historical flashbacks. Personally, I thought the audio was great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches, music and radio was put together in such a way as to make you feel like you were at the camper with Jim, the main character, or in his head. Everything that was not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. Anyway, this is a fantastic DVD that made me cry.
