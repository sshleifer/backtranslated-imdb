Born from an idea by comic book pioneer Alex Raymond, "Flash Gordon" was the great father of all science fiction films. This serial is the first time that Flash is brought to the celluloid life. Despite being on a low budget, this is a great space work. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the Earth destined for apparent destruction, when Planet Mongo arrives darting into space on a collision course. The nonconformist scientist Dr. Zarkov is headed to the planet that is approaching in a self-built rocket, convinced he can do something to stop the fleeing celestial body. He gets some last-minute recruits in the form of the enterprising athlete Flash Gordon and the beautiful Dale Arden. Once they reach Mongo, their problems really start. The Merciless, the conqueror of his world, clashes with the emperor Ming, who has some ambitious plans for the Earth. <br /> <br /> The rest of the serial revolves around the desperate attempts to save the land of Flash; the different alien cultures he encounters; the allies he does; space ships fly; the battles he fights and the monsters he kills. <br /> <br /> Brightly conceived by Raymond, "Flash Gordon" presents classical archetypes of legendary myths and fables of antiquity. Echoes of famous stories, such as the sagas of Troy and Camelot and Sherwood Forrest are seen here. You have the beautiful and fascinating hero on a mission to save the kingdom (Flash); The evil king (Ming); The old sage (Zarkov); The beautiful damsel in distress (Dale); the seductive siren (Aura); loyal allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); Plus monsters, dragons and assorted animals. <br /> <br /> Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Ming is Prince John or Agamemnon. Dale is Helen of Troy or Gwenevere or Maid Marion. Zarkov is Merlin or Ulysses. (O Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan are the Merry Men or the Knights of the Round Table. <br /> <br /> You have an idea. <br /> <br /> You can't help but notice how many "Flash Gordon" ideas would later reappear in STAR WARS. The cloud city; The world of ice; The moon of the forest; The scrolling opening text (from the second serial); There are others, but get the juice. The whole sci-fi genre owes a great debt to this timeless classic. <br /> <br /> Buster Crabb is the perfect action hero, and I personally think he is better in this kind of role than any other current action star. He also played Buck Rogers and Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton is the embodiment of evil evil like Ming. Of course, today it seems a bit melodramatic, but it was what the public expected from the bad guys in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Jean Rogers is the love interest of our hero Dale Arden, and I had such a crush on her when I first saw him as a boy. I can readily understand why Flash has always run to its rescue. It is the quintessence of the good girl, to contrast the seductive manipulations of Aura, the quintessence of the bad girl. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast seemed perfectly chosen to emulate their comic-book counterparts, and despite the FX now silly was a lot of exciting action in this revolutionary serial. <br /> <br /> A fun fun and the beginning of the sci-fi genre in the cinema.
