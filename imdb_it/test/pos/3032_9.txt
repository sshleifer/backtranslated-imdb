Forget the plot of this movie. Forget the fact that it is wonderfully played by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget the fact that it is one of the few films starring Jennifer Lopez that I can handle. Although the story is made impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems to have been invented, the only important thing to remember when contemplating this film is that it contains some of the most astonishing and disturbing images that have ever been transmitted. It is as if Salvador Dali had decided to make a criminal drama. Not to be missed for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas on which to exhibit true works of visual art. I should give this movie a 9/10 for its incredible display.
