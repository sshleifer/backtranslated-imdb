"You were going up and you tripped on a skirt!" Gilligan tells Jim Leonard. This sums up the plot of this rising story of Leonard (a young Humphrey Bogart), when his dream is diverted from the bizarre heiress Carol, played by Dorothy Mackaill. Leonard worked on a new and improved engine, but now his love life and the automotive company both have their ups and downs in this 68-minute shortie. Bogart had not yet developed the calm and thoughtful style. Good performances of most support characters - his butler, his co-workers, a sister, intruders along the way. Some themes for adults, since it was done just before they were applied to the film's code, but it is still domesticated compared to what is on TV today. Directed by Thornton Freeland, Freeland directed the incredible "Flying Down to Rio" a year earlier.
