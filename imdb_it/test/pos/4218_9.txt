The film was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel. The third was dark, and semi-interesting, but it wasn't as funny or pleasant as this. It is full of comic lines about Martha Stuart, the anatomy of dolls, masturbation, and indeed has been done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images. The film was not scary or full of suspense and I'm sure it wasn't the director's intention. It was fun because of stupidity, Jennifer Tilly is above performance and sexy. The doll puppets were so well managed, the movement of the mouth, the lips, the tears in the eyes, the knife in the chest and the costumes. The dolls were wonderful and made the dead gruesome more enigmatic considering the fact that they were made from wonderful dolls. Chucky's new look was great and Tiffany was very pretty. Some scenes with Chucky embracing the human Tiffany even made my father smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly well- very attractive and the special effects were fantastic. The finish was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another good one is quite unlikely. It may not be as thrilling as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it's definitely more fun !!!!
