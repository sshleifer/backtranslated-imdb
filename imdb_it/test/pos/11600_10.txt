It seems that many Europeans and Americans see Indian films for the wrong reason; I see that some people complain that this movie has not had any dance sequence!

Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India, being widely known for his choice of subjects for the cinema and the strength of his screenplays. 'Chokher Bali' is a perfect example. A faithful adaptation of the Nobel Prize-winning novel by Tagore dedicated to the search for the sexual pleasure of a Bengali widow, the director gives a new dimension to the much acclaimed and controversial work.
