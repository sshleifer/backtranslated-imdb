My wife and I love this movie. Intelligent dialogue, great characters, intelligent construction of the plot. The rhythm of this film is non-stop. I couldn't even go to the kitchen for a snack. We've never seen Corey Feldman so funny. Taylor Nichols plays a good Fed ... my wife loves him on that "Married Man" HBO show. The ensemble cast was strong. The turning point finally made us rejoice. This is why we give this film a "standing O".
