Buddy Manucci (Roy Scheider, solid in a random starring role) heads a secret team of covert secret agents called Seven-Ups, whose tactics do not necessarily follow the exact ways of the law. They do their work in their own way, without anything being disclosed to the press, and this gives them the freedom to expand their means to reach criminals. Most investigators and policemen at work can hardly get depressed. Buddy has a childhood friend named Vito (Tony Lo Bianco) who exchanges information with him about types of mobs and timiders who work on the streets of New York. What Buddy does not know is that Vito is hatching a pattern using names from Buddy's "checklist" (he opened this book by taking notes provided by Vito, but doesn't know that his friend copied those same names written inside the his mind) to create mafia families in a series of mob kidnappings that got money thanks to two police officers posing, Moon (Richard Lynch's always bad guy) and Bo (Bill Hickman) working with him. When this pattern fails, with one of the Seven-Ups killed, Vito gets scary because he knows how Buddy can be when he's stubborn about someone ... especially when one of his is killed. <br /> <br /> An extremely underrated policeman has an exciting car ride through New York while Buddy follows the robber cop who tries to capture them after killing his companion. The film is not overly complex after the plot is set and we realize who is the ringleader in the mafia plot. Scheider has never been given the credit that he deserves to be a good leading actor. He has an emotional range and we see how to lose the policeman and the friend costs him the toll. The film is briskly animated by good action sequences and creates an interesting plot of betrayal among friends, when greed arrives before that childish friendship and how what looks like a simple crime against the families of evil movers can get the police killed.
