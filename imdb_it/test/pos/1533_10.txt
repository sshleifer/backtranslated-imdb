I am deeply grateful to have seen this film. The acting is surprising, the film itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth. <br /> <br /> This is an important film. It could be profoundly transforming. <br /> <br /> I'd pay quite a bit of money, never to see it again. Since * is * so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to look at. I admit that my taste in movies tends strongly to light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it for anything really important. Those of you who have more strength than me might find it easier to manage. <br /> <br /> But I strongly encourage people to see it at least once. Preferably with others, so you can talk to each other and have someone around to remind you that there's more in the world than in the movie.
