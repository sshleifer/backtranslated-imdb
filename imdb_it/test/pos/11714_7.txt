"Sharky's Machine" is clearly a vehicle of Burt Reynolds designed to allow the star room to spur on his talent and spray the car, the plot of the film, with colors from other films and other styles, offering a variety of states of soul within a nurtured story. <br /> <br /> Made in 1981 at 119 minutes (long for the time period), the film did well, with box office revenues of $ 37,800,000. He had a lot to do: actor and director of Burt Reynolds, a solid one-two hit; an adaptation of William Diel's novel, and the land of southern Georgia Georgia, at this time, a land of opportunity for Hollywood film production. <br /> <br /> Reynolds' Tom Sharky falls in love with Rachel Ward's Dominoe, the -with-a-heart-of-gold prostitute is echoed here as he was in "Hustle" when he starred opposite Catherine Deneuve , and that film also had a corrupt politician in the middle, but with a negative ending not the happiness of Hollywood in "Sharky's Machine". <br /> <br /> History is pure Detective / actioner procedure. Sharky, a narcotics detective, badly manages a bust of a drug dealer, causing the killing of some innocent bystanders, and he is demoted, literally transferred to the lower floor to deputy, to deal with perverts and other minor crimes that the "honest" cops consider latrine duty. His new excavations offer him the chance to meet many equally honest officers who are doing the dirty jobs that no one else wants. When some attention is turned towards a certain pimp, Sharky looks at some evidence and discovers that a particular prostitute Dominoe (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe is being protected by the police and political forces and Sharky puts on a 24-hour surveillance force to look at it. During the period in which he watches, he learns that the current governor-elect Hotchkins (Earl Holliman) is visiting Dominoe, as is a brilliant Italian gangster Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before the police succeeded in building a case with evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, a gunslinger (Henry Silva) shoots through the door of Domino's apartment apparently killing the beautiful Dominoe, but when Sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a Tiffany roommate (Aarika Wells) Sharky confronts Victor and tells him that he will have him arrested. Sharky is captured by some Ninja killers led by Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and tortured for information that leads to Dominoe, but Sharky overwhelms them and arrests the Governor and in a chased chase kills Billy after killing Victor. <br /> <Reynolds wants to expose the internal mechanism of an inveterate cop who falls in love, but the plot pattern of the detective story, flavored with noir elements, and Reynolds' ability in film development tend to affect the dynamics of relationships. <br /> <br /> We come to know something about some men and this leads us to think about why they are working towards their pensions in vice instead of fighting real crime - this element of the film seems unclear under the direction of Reynolds and performance. <br /> <br /> There is always uniqueness in a Reynolds film. He likes to hire the stars, both the actors of characters and the others and then allow them to improvise, sometimes with different results. <br /> <br /> With his crew in "Sharky's Machine" he gets some good moments, and sometimes a little exaggerated but always a sense of togetherness and good character. With Reynolds as an author it works. <br /> <br /> Reynolds, the actor / auteur always seems to be grinning at himself and at the spectator as if to say that it's all fake, but very funny. <br /> <br /> Big line: in the scene of Victor when Sharky launches the gauntlet "Are you walking on all people like you, and you want to know the worst part? Are you from another state." This seems to be the biggest insult the officer can throw at a criminal. <br /> <br /> Reynolds filmed the film in Atlanta during his career. He shot himself reading the telephone book and would certainly have targeted and demographically. /> <br /> The film marked the appearance of Rachel Ward named New Star of the Year in 1981 by the Golden Globe. <br /> <br /> Reynolds has always had presence and star power and has chosen to make movies near home, Georgia. <br /> <br /> I got my DVD from half.com for $ 7.99 and unfortunately contains no comments or make-of features, which is a shame. Perhaps the next generation will have them. <br /> <br /> The film is still a lot of fun and both Reynolds and Ward are very prestigious actors.
