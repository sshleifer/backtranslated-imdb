I have great memories of this movie ... <br /> <br /> I was only 12 when he was released and he scared the bejesus by me. I really miss my bejesus ... <br /> <br /> Zombies, cemeteries, mausoleums, how can you go wrong? He's like Phantasm's retarded cousin. <br /> <br /> This film was released 1 year before the PG-13 was established. <br /> <br /> I endorse that One Dark Night is the GORIEST PG movie (no more frightening, of course, that it was ever released. <br /> <br /> Can someone invent a more passionate choice? <br /> <br /> (FYI: I do not consider the most glorious Poltergeist ... .scarier, yes. But not gorier ...)
