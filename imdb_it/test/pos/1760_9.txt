Leslie Carbaga's excellent book on Fleishers tells the whole story of Fleischer's great move of the entire animation unit in Florida, and the subsequent expulsion by Paramount. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bug Goes to Town did not destroy the credit of the pioneers of animation with Paramount, although it is often said that way, and this was the preferred version of Paramount's story. According to Carbaga, the big studio, more than anything else, wanted to take the vises in the animation studio and alleviate the famous squabbles of the painting. Mr. Bug gave them the pretext to do just that. - The sad closure of an eccentric and innovative chapter of American animation. <br /> <br /> I also wanted to comment that the film actually debuted December 4, 1941, not December 7th. It may have been close enough to do the trick, however, in terms of the national mood that hurts the success of the film. But another part of the legend of this little problematic film is that she was killed having the misfortune of being in theaters at the same time that Dumbo (released October 23, 1941) was still doing very bubbly business for the holidays. I didn't do the box office research, but I'd say that Dumbo's competing presence in theaters would probably have an impact on Mr. Bug. In that period the cinema was always higher and the successful films could go strong in cinemas for months. - Something unimaginable in these typically short, fast-to-DVD days.
