I grew up in New York and this show happened when I was four. I had a half-day nursery and this was on WPIX Channel 11 in the afternoon. I just loved music and stories and I remember humming them around the house when I played. I just saw part of an episode on YouTube and for a moment I could remember how it felt to watch those shows like a little child. Obviously, I stopped watching when I arrived in first grade because he was active before school came out (no VCR or DVR then). I grew up, not realizing that the show was still active until 11th grade! <br /> <br /> I also had no idea that there are any DVDs and I would like my grandchildren to be young enough to enjoy this show, but now they have all moved on to the demographic, or I'd buy them all DVD sets. Today it was much better than many shows for children.
