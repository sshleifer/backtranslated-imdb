I gave this show a chance because of Jaleel White, not for his character Urkel, but mainly for the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog XD So anyway, as I said, I gave a chance, and I liked it a lot. I never cared about the character of Urkel, so I was pleased to see Mr. White in a role other than the ever so annoying nerd. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (formerly called Calvin, but the second episode arrived, everyone started calling him "J") was very funny and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was when J went out with the ex cowboys cheerleader with the snobby guy. ("Don't talk that way" about my mom! "" This is an adult talk, you're down there! ") The only thing I have is that the show had to have 3 main characters, but Mr. The character of White always seemed to have the utmost attention and the other two (who are married) always had the secondary stories ... It's not exactly a good thing when a story about those two who are pregnant can take the place of sitting for J. having baby sitters his girlfriend's dog ..... <br /> <br /> Besides that, I really wish this show could have lasted a little longer. Unfortunately, it seems that people were not interested in Jaleel White as something different from the terrible nerd of God-awful ass known as Urkel .... <br /> <br /> I hope they at least put it out as a set DVD box.
