Michael Kehoe has made a feat, especially considering that it's only his second start as a writer, producer and director. Generally the "first timers" lack vision and direction when directing a major production, but "Dominion" shows that Mr. Kehoe is going to Hollywood! Set in beautiful scenery, Dominion boasts experienced cast members (notably Thomerson and James) who communicate Kehoe's vast vision with exceptional clarity. Few movies can mix the slasher / horror genre with real action / adventure, but Dominion has done all this. This film certainly qualifies as one of the first quality films in both these categories. If you are looking for a hectic action with more than a bit of suspense, look no further. I look forward to Kehoe's future projects. Very well!!!
