Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this film. I saw the 87-minute version twice, in the 1950s. Perfectly more direct than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out of the ordinary piece, full of tracking strokes, beyond Andrejew's beautifully atmospheric sets. Beautifully illuminated also by the photographer Andr√© Thomas, Black Jack is nothing but the joy of a connoisseur. Strengthening this imaginative visual style, it is a script that allows a list of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre and full-blooded characterizations. George Sanders gives a refined performance, while an eccentric millionaire (who turns out to be a rival competitor) is admirably played by Agnes Moorehead. Realizing also his role, Patricia Roc. The film was made, in places in Spain, in 1949.
