"Distante" is a film of Turkish life that follows the banal activities of two male adult cousins; one a photographer and the other an unemployed sub-chief. There is no doubt that the author Nuri Bilge Ceylan is a work in progress with considerable talent. However, this small arty minimalist foreign drama is so full of empty filler and so devoid of stories or something engaging or provocative that it will probably appeal only to the most ardent film devotees and the mainstream public should look elsewhere. Personally, I quickly grew bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself advancing rapidly into empty spaces - and there are many - between dialogue, plot development and an epilogue. "Distant" is a bit esoteric very well done. (B-)
