when I saw for the first time that this film would be broadcast on TV, I was just a new debut on board this episode of a comedian who wore really bizarre clothes later in the day. however, I decided to watch it and was impressed. the shore brings a new breath of air on the screen. in this film, a university consultant is crawling and probably also needs his consultant. Carla Gugino, in an underrated role, plays Becca, a Midwestern "peasant" with a simple family and a travis movie boyfriend. when he goes to the uvla, he meets the crawling and he quickly transforms her into a bubbly blond California girl. she decides to crawl home for the Thanksgiving break. when Travis decides to propose, Becca needs a distraction. crawl so he decides to make everyone believe that he and Becca are already engaged. this leads to crawling the love story between becca's parents, making friends with his brother and even making the dancers dance at the local bar to get rid of some. I'm not going to reveal the end, but I liked it. however, do not rent it if you want a poignant performance; rent it if you want to laugh and enjoy a often lacking part of the humor of the 90s.
