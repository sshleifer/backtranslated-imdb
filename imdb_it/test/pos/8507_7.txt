I saw "NSNA" immediately after seeing all of Roger Moore's films and I must say that it seemed so nice to see Connery again. It shows forever that it is the one and only Bond. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not a true masterpiece, but it is really worth watching. The jokes are much better here, the effects are fun and interesting, Connery is Connery and Brandauer is really a good villain. But von Sydow is simply wasted and the score is often not good and there are some scenes that seem quite useless. <br /> <br /> 7/10 2.5 / 4 3+ (1+ - 6-)
