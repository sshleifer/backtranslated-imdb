I liked "Happy Ever After", but I was absolutely mesmerized by "Terry & June". With Aunt Lucy gone, the emphasis seemed to fall more heavily on the relationship between Terry and June, a middle-aged middle-aged English couple, and I liked it very much, losing very happily in each episode. <br /> <br /> The 80s were the era of alternative comedy, but they were also the decade of choice - and Terry and June certainly went well for the more traditional tastes. And mine - and I too was a big fan of "The Young Ones"! Every week, Terry found herself in a silly situation and June pulled herself in and usually ended up saving him. How the show dated now - it was a different world, but it's very funny to see the trends of the 80s in evidence - like the CB radio plot of 1982 (CB radio was legalized in England in November 1981), which saw Terry imprisoned in his car in the back of a truck! I recently watched the shows on DVD recently and I still think they're cool! Unloved by the enlightened elite - the lessons of small talk, but a great success with the masses! Wonderful!
