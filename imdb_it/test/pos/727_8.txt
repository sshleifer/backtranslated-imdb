A raw angular thriller that aimed at great philosophical heights that it could not reach. I always liked the movie immensely. He had great suspense elements, leaving me with that delicious spinal cold that I expect from thrillers, and he got it purely psychologically, without resorting to escalating blood and blood. The soundtrack and the setting added to the suspense perfectly. Sometimes it was a bit rough, especially acting and character development. It could have been a better film only if we had known more about the nightmares of the past that the characters saw when they closed their eyes, and why they felt this desperate need to seek the "answer" that is so integral to the plot. After all, they seemed to be looking for him, knowing or at least having an inkling of what might happen when they found him. I would recommend seeing this movie if you are ready to look beyond the grit to see the potential of a rough diamond.
