The war correspondent William Holden, who falls in love with a wonderful Eurasian doctor Jessica Jones set on the beautiful scenery of Hong Kong, is divided. Cinematography is magnificent as they meet on a hill overlooking Hong Kong. History deals with racial tensions, with society that frowns against mixed relations and matrimonial affairs. But what I like is the strong character of the heroine portrayed by Jessica Jones, who is a Eurasian doctor, who remains humble and resolute in her altruistic mission and remains faithful to her love. Nevertheless, she is fired in her hospital for competing with a married man, making high-ranking shoulders. One day William Holden is called to the Korean war that covers and then that damn day, he receives the news of his disappearance. The end, of course, is tragic, I cried when it went to their hill. It was a much loved and fatal love story. He defeats all adversity, the fact that he was fired from his job, how his wife did not grant him divorce, but their great love persevered - they experienced great love despite everything. I personally don't believe in extramarital affairs and I think he shouldn't have started something when he was tied to someone else and he shouldn't have let it happen, but nevertheless a truly magnificent film. I think the heroine overshadowed the hero. Jessica Jones is sensual and gave a magnificent performance even though I thought it was strange that they didn't hire a real Asian actress or someone with Asian blood. I agree with a review, Jessica Jones exudes sexuality when she lies on the ground and looks at William Holden talking calmly but her eyes say come and get me now. <br /> <br /> I find it a shame that the best films were made before I was born, it seems that many Hollywood movies are lacking in depth, great acting and depend entirely on stunts and heavy sex scenes. This is truly one of the greatest unfortunate love stories in movies.
