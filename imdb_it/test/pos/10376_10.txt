I was surprised that I liked this movie. But it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday 13. There were a number of cheese elements, but at the same time there were many interesting ones. The plot was good, predictable if you saw more than one or two horror movies, but full of jokes to make it useful. There are some memorable scenes that are worth watching. Some problems I had with the plot have to do with the continuity of the characters. For example, in the opening scene the scarecrows (which were human-headed, whose blood was drained to grow crops), seemed very real, but later in the movie they looked more like fake scarecrows with blue masks. There were more than many gaps in the plot, and the acting was mediocre, but at least it sounded like real people talk, unlike Hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake when you think about it. The climax of the last scene, when the main character says "I'm not a baker, I'm a Connell!" and the scarecrow's head is satisfying, since his friends were mostly killed by these creatures at that point.
