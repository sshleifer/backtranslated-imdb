"Bride of Chucky" is one of the best horror films released in the last ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90s. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Chucky's girlfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) manages to find her battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of the third part and brings him to life in his trailer. His neighbor, Jessie (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are tormented by his uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany upsets Chucky when he refuses to marry her, so he buys him a doll to play with. Chucky kills Tiffany and then transfers his soul to the doll that took him. In order to put them back into human bodies, they have to travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so. Jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter and leave for the trip, but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany. Along the way, several bizarre accidents force them to stay at a bed and breakfast. When more people are killed, they call their best friend (Gordon Woolvett) to clarify the situation. They convince him that none of them is a murderer, as the police started to solve the crimes. Find Ritter's body in a trunk in the back of the van. Thinking he was created, he confronts them with this. Chucky and Tiffany then turn to prove they did, which kills Woolvett. The group steals a camper and arrives at the cemetery. Jessie and Jade make sure that Chucky and Tiffany light up each other, giving them enough to escape. Chucky recovers Jade and forces her to take her amulet. Chucky and Tiffany restart their feud, which gives Jessie and Jade enough time to kill both while the police arrive and clear them of the crimes. <br /> <br /> The good news: I have to give maximum props for the FX department, as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls seem completely convincing. The scenes with them together are the highlights of the film, including a hilarious conversation in which Tiffany advises Chucky on how serial killers in the 1990s work. That being said, the amount of one-liners in this movie that are really fun is incredible. Chucky gets most of them, but Tiffany also tears some gems to pieces. It's actually more fun than what Hollywood calls comedies these days. Blood is abundant and incredibly realistic. Several deaths in this film are actually original and creative. Turning Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was an absolutely brilliant scene. Even the honeymoon couple was a beautiful scene of death. For adolescent love, the combination of Stabile and Heigl works great. They have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple. I also have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, I jumped during some scenes, and this shows that incredible work did Yu. He learned enough, it seems, to do the same thing with "Freddy against Jason". He knows how to stage set-ups and pay-offs, and here he shows some great skills that have an appearance and style influenced in Hong Kong. He could be the next great horror director if he continues to fill his resume with films like those two. Also the beautiful soundtrack, like "Freddy vs. Jason". <br /> <br /> The bad news: for fans of sensible films, this will be a great discovery. However, this film has a high cheese factor that could prevent the horror movie fan from having fun with this movie. The film knows that it is a poor movie and enjoys making sure that a serious fan turns off due to things like one-liners. It's not so bad in a film, but it must be seen in the mental frame that it is a poor movie, and that the exaltation of certain scenes is added to the film, not to take it away. Remove yourself from that mood and you may find yourself enjoying this movie. <br /> <br /> The Final Verdict: fans of good films and other "Child's Play" films will find great pleasure in this film. For serious horror fans, take a look, but keep in mind that it's not a serious movie and that presumption should be there and you might find yourself enjoying it. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic violence, Graphic language, Short nakedness on a doll, a shadowy puppet sex scene, drug use and numerous drug references.
