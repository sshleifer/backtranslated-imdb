Ok, let me tell you that, on the whole, I don't really like souls. I enjoyed a couple of the often quoted "classic" series, but I consider the medium as a whole exactly the same way I do American television: that is to say that a good 90-95% of it is a total tripe, with the rest falls everywhere from "watchable" to "decent". That being the case, it's no wonder I don't like self-deprecating anime parodies out there. I don't understand most jokes, and the medium itself reinforces a certain kind of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all - strong, hyperactive, intellectual and completely over the top. <br /> <br /> So when I started watching this series at the behest of a friend, I was in love with the disappointment after the first couple of episodes. I imagined that the characters had to represent cliché characters drawn from the outlines of shop stories, and that their actions should have been similarly satirical. I could see where it came from, but I didn't think it was all that clever - a lot of "extravagant and funny high school cheats and stories, we're just getting humored just now." Towards the third episode, my opinion has changed dramatically. <br /> <br /> It was at that point that the strengths of this series began to manifest themselves. The oddities of the order of non-chronological episodes, his sense of self-awareness and, above all, intelligent humor with (panting) a well executed straight man. <br /> <br /> In what I consider to be a rarity in every medium, this show presents witty and well thought interactions between diametrically opposed characters. The perpetual sense of vaguely irritated resignation of the Protagonist Kyon provides the perfect disadvantage for the actions of Haruhi's generic "anime" type exploits. It's a break from the formula, and it works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on this solid foundation, the series further succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail. As previously stated, the episodes emanate in chronological order. At first I thought it was a trick, but it works surprisingly well. The chronological sequence of events has a logical sense, but the ventilated order of the episodes follows more closely the traditional structure of the Aristotelian drama. The chosen order does not leave narrative gaps that cannot be filled by simple inferences (but while it is possible to guess what happened in a previous "previous" episode, one still feels forced to see exactly how those events take place) and a schedule superb prevents any texture holes or contradictions. I saw this series a second time immediately after completing it the first time, and I was surprised that even the seemingly irrelevant events were all related. <br /> <br /> The last point is indicative of the extreme attention to detail in each area of ​​the series. While the "anime" series character draws a little gratefulness, the background art is exquisite, realistically based on real photographic references. The quality of the animation is also excellent at important points. For example, there is a musical performance late in the series in which the characters are shown playing a song - this may seem trivial, but the unconscious effect of watching the animation (of cinema quality) that actually corresponds to the soundtrack it's incredible. <br /> <br /> In short, I love this series for some reason. By its very nature it is something I generally don't like, but its execution is so unique and well executed that I can't help it.
