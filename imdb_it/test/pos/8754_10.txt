The best thing that can be said about the movie "Traffic" is that it brought attention to the British miniseries "Traffik". As many people have noted, the current film suffers from truncating history to adapt to the short attention span of filmmakers and to the turnaround time of theater owners, who measure the success of a film thanks to the very expensive food sales. <br /> <br /> I first recorded this mini series in 1990, when it was shown on Public TV and I watched it many times. The entire series in documentary style has a strong element of tragedy and ruin, as the characters are moving towards their final destiny. The strongest of the three stories is that of the Pakistani family forced to enter the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the poppy harvest was burned by the army in a show of strength staged for the benefit of politicians Westerners. The family's difficulties are similar to those of the rickshaw family in "City of Joy". In the end the farmer finds work, but he compromises his pride and his honesty. <br /> <br /> The Pakistani part of the film has a particular relevance for today, with the fight against supporters of Al Quaeda, and gives some understanding of support for such movements among the disadvantaged poor of Pakistan and Afghanistan that rarely receives money in these countries. The film emphasizes that farmers barely see 25% of aid that should encourage the growth of other crops. <br /> <br /> With the American inability to see something other than black and white - good guys v. bad boys: it is interesting to see another point of view in which there is no black and white, only shades of gray. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler in advance. The only problem I had with the story was that, rather than continuing as they had done before, as in real life, being a work of fiction, they had to conclude with the "bad guys" to get what was coming from them. Apart from that, this was a nice piece of work of the kind we see too rarely. The cast was exceptional and the German and Pakistani locations contributed to giving the film a "different" touch (which made the Germans see it as something different from the bad guys in a WWII movie).
