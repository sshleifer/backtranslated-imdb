I was a guest at Eddie Monroe's screening on September 30th and was pleasantly surprised by the story, the great acting and the talented director. I found it hard to believe that all this talent could be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris (Eddie Monroe). The supporting cast was chock-full of colorful and funny characters. This film reminds me of one of those movies you will be back to watch in 20 years and you will discover that it has launched many celebrity actors. Very similar to "The Outsiders" featuring Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio and others. Look at Hollywood, there are new stars on the horizon and can be discovered on a small Long Island, an independent film called "Eddie Monroe". Good job!
