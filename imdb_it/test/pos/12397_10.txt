As an adult, I am grateful to have taken this movie by accident when I was a teenager. Over time, I was experiencing family problems. This particular film managed to capture what I saw from a closed world. How much peer pressure is too much? Actually I had to buy this film because it reached me at a different level than most movies that try to reach an audience. How far could an individual go for social acceptance? Who is the "bad" crowd? Teenagers struggle to find the answers to these questions, but in the end ... who is the "pack leader" if there is one? Is strong? The beauty? Perhaps the person that everyone seems to like? Could it be the moral character? As for the film, the cast worked together as if it were predestined. I just hope that more directors and producers will try to create a work that reaches us all as this film has reached me. I wish I could vote more than ten because this particular title deserves much more.
