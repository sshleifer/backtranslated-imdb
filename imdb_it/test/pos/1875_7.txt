It's been a long time since someone created a film like this. A so-called B. movie. Maybe it wasn't a great movie, but it's fun to watch, the classic Bruce Cambell, has its good, funny, disgusting, even artistic parts. <br /> <br /> ****** Spoiler Ahead ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---- --------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------- <br /> <br /> The part where his wife as a dummy-robot seller is going to die I don't know about you, but it made me feel so strange, so sad and disgusted in a good way. Compare this scene with the scene of the Fly 2 in which his dog dies like a monster. Makes you think oh my god. <br /> <br /> ---------------- ------------------- ------- ------------------- ------------------------ ------ - ------------------------- <br /> <br /> ******** No more Spoilers ***** **** <br /> <br /> If you are a Bruce Cambell fan, you would definitely like to have this movie in your collection. If you're generally interested in movies, you might want to. Just think that the goal of the film is to make you smile, suck (don't worry not so bad) and have fun with your friends. Attention, I said friends, not possible future girlfriend.
