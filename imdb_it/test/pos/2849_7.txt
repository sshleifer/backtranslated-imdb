Renee Zellweger absolutely shines like Nurse Betty, easily one of the most fascinating, entertaining and carefree comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> When the soap opera-obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnessed the murder of her insensitive husband by two goons (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), he snaps and thinks that the A Reason cast to Love are real. He decides to go to Los Angeles to find the famous heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character from the show). <br /> <br /> Like the two oddly matched Hitmen, the Caustic Rock and the Papal Freeman generate some chemical fun, and Greg Kinnear also enjoys his unconventional actor character. Renee Zellweger turns into an innocent, caramelized and sometimes terribly sweet performance like Nurse Betty. It exudes goodness, warmth and is irresistible. While the script sometimes looks like a sitcom, it is full of sometimes incredible characters and invented situations, Zellweger is so nice and absolutely disarming that everything comes together. <br /> <br /> With a few black comedy sketches to keep things interesting, a winning performance by Zellweger, a great supporting cast and a competent script, Nurse Betty is absolutely delightful. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
