A truly gruesome ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this film is not up to its promise. Apparently it is based on an old ghost story, and perhaps it is based a little too much on a simple premise. For most of the way, it's imaginative and genuinely compelling, but in the end it's almost as if Oshima had lost interest in it and brought it to a quick finish. <br /> <br /> The story is simple - a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so they can be together. But their failure of nerves and his ghost of return condemn them to madness. It is beautifully managed, with imaginative scenic scenes, and the passion of lovers is beautifully portrayed. But too often the film fails to keep its promise, almost as if Oshima lost his nerves in the same way as lovers. <br /> <br /> It is a film worth seeing only to see how Oshima combines his great skill as a director with some tricks of the exploitative film to attract the public, but unfortunately it is not a true classic in the movie film like Onibaba or Woman of the Dunes.
