There are times when you don't want those profound dramatic series. When you don't want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on. There are times when you just want to watch a simple series, with lots of action and interesting characters. For those moments, you have Cleopatra 2525. <br /> <br /> I was one of those who really appreciated Charlie's Angels. Critics said it was superficial and foolish. But the thing is, this is the point! People who couldn't relax and expected a serious movie hated it. It is exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It is superficial. He has stupid and unrealistic characters. And that's why I like it It's not like any other series. <br /> <br /> The first season was not very good. The character Cleo was irritating and a little too much. The story was a bit weak and you didn't know the characters very much. But hey, they only had 20 minutes in each episode. <br /> <br /> In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series a 40-minute duration. And it was here that I started to love him. The series has finally started to become a very qualitative series. Too bad they had to cancel the series. Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525 were actually very good. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters that only Xena creators could have created!
