Well ... it's time! Van Damme is back and kicked in this action thriller that is his best film in recent years. The plot is not too inventive, but the whole theme of the border patrol is interesting and the ex-marines, like the drug smugglers, are interesting. But what makes this movie fantastic is the fact that Van Damme has returned to martial arts again. His latest films have been more acting-oriented, but in "The Shepard", JCVD ​​is back to dropping the bad guys and seems to be in good shape. There are some impressive fighting scenes and Van Damme shows that he can still bring out the famous old 360-degree rotating heel. For a low-budget action movie, it has good sets and great stunts. Van Damme says some humorous jokes and shows that he is improving as an actor. I'm glad he came back to take care of Van Damage ... I was disappointed by the lack of fighting in his recent films. Scott Adkins is exceptional in his role and Van Damme and he have a 1-on-1 showdown at the end. Overall, it's one of Van Damme's best films and will entertain you. A must for JCVD ​​fans. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like "Bloodsport" or "Kickboxer". Nok Su Kow!
