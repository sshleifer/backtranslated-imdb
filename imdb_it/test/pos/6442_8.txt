For years I had a distant memory of watching this movie, I looked online to find it somewhere and I couldn't find it anywhere so I thought it was gone. <br /> <br /> UNTIL ... my great man showed me a box he sent in the Daily Mail and, even if Nah, there would be nothing decent, but to my surprise, among other gems was The Water Babies! I haven't been so excited for a long time! It's a great film with a light heart, the songs are not memorable probably if I were a child during the time it came out I would have been more stuck in my mind. Unfortunately it was just a film that I looked at my grans 10 years ago, when I was a little spud. And looking back now the animation is terrible! and the re-recorded voices that make for a richness in sound in the movies are totally turned off! But who cares when you are a child you never think about those things, even if the guy you drive is about 10 and it sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty. <br /> <br /> Great classic movie for kids!
