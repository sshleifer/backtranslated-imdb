The strengths of the film were clear at the beginning and in the central part of the film. It showed how a very violent and reactive authority could react to resistance. Shot as a documentary, the director captures what would have happened if the United States had enacted martial law. Volunteering for "punishment park", a police training camp where you are bullied and harassed, will offer you an out to this terrible scenario. Switch between judicial processes for those facing charges, those in the park who escape police attention, training of officers preparing to handle these prisoners, judges in their spare time, among many other things. It was a very strong and moving film. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I had was its realism. Officers are often seen holding guns as if they had seven years with a plastic toy (ie an elbow bent at 90 degrees when pointing a gun at someone's face, or the way a policeman makes it look like it's hard to kick someone when they "down, etc. etc.". It begins as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs. At the end of the film, the viewer is slowly remembered again and again by the prejudices of the director and producers. The antagonistic characters in the story begin as genuine and real human beings and then slowly progress towards "stereotyped and objectable forces of evil" to the end. The mistakes they make are stupid, the strength they demonstrate is unreal and unlike the way the police acts, the judges during this court hearing are shown making stupid and unreal mistakes, among many other things. <br /> <br /> The reality the film starts he collapsed when it became evident that this was just another blank check attempt to make the government look bad. And this comes from an anarchist. The scenes eventually began to take on an unreal, unreal and a thousand times too dramatic tone. However, for the previous part, it promises a very moving storyline.
