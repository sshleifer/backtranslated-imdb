This film is a mix of dark comedy and drama, of two guys who worked in a butcher shop and wanted to build themselves. When they finally realized that dream, they faced a new problem: there were no customers! One day, by chance, does a boy die in the refrigerator room and start a new type of butcher activity? Are they starting to sell human meat, telling customers that it's just chicken? and their activity begins to improve: human flesh sells well! Oh! Did I forget to say something ?? These guys aren't normal! There really is something missing in their brains! <br /> <br /> The film has beautiful scenes of dark humor, but it is, in my opinion, mostly a drama. One who shows us what's inside the head of a psychopath, what his motivations are for what he does. I must confess that I was a little surprised by the film's ending, because I never expected them to be able to do it without being discovered, but it's probably because I see too many Hollywood movies ?? What I mean is that in the cinema of Hollywood we always expect the punishment of the boys who do "bad things". Is there always a morality that protects the "good values", although we all know that in "real life" it does not happen this way too often? And I liked this film especially for this, because it fits into a kind of cinema that is true, frontal, without fake moralism, and that "sees" what's on the other side, behind the "conventional morality" ?? It happens only in independent cinema (especially in the European)! <br /> <br /> In addition, there are excellent performances by Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first one) in the roles of "disturbed boys" ?? <br /> <br /> The Danish film is very beautiful!
