At first, I honestly thought it would be a mischievous movie. But after seeing this, I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincing with the supporting cast (especially that character played by "Bullet tooth Tony" by Snatch. What a contrasting role between those two films!). Now, I'm not the one to say if an actor is good or not, but his act, in particular, was really nice. Although the plot has been transformed into a teenage love triangle (though a lot of fun) halfway through the film, I feel this shouldn't be taken for granted, what I think, the film really is: simply fun. So, if you happen to come across both DVD and theater, I'm sure you'll like it.
