I had the opportunity to capture this independent film and was impressed, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. The acting was very good for everyone. Amy Madigan played the part of a guilty mother who is tired but well-intentioned and determined to compensate for the condition of her younger daughter. Yet, in the process, he neglected his older sister, who is more interested in playing with the brother of the savant syndrome and living in a world of evasion. <br /> <br /> The men in the film are very powerful in their secondary roles. Christopher Lloyd, in a very subdued role, shows us why he has such versatility. He plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and to literary research, yet he is hungry for a meaningful relationship. He and Madigan connect very well in their scenes together, yet they both know that nothing can come from their friendship. Their wordless farewell is nothing short of brilliant, an acting class for aspiring artists. <br /> <br /> And in a small role, Fred Savage is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> You can understand why this movie was based on a comedy, it's probably very good on stage. On the screen, it's not particularly exciting, but it's still very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
