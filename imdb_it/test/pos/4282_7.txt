I gave a seven just because the acting is good. And of course I mean Wilkinson. The other two principles were "decent". But the characters themselves ... what the hell was so bad for the character played by Wilkinson (James Manning)? I didn't see him act like the martinet that Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an unbearable jerk I was praying he would encounter an extremely brutal and prolonged death. Who was I kidding? After all, Tom Wilkinson is not Paul Bettany. So what on the EARTH did the character of Emily Watson (Anne) play in him ???? She herself admitted that it was practically a piece of offal in her treatment of her. Because he also wanted to be in the same city as him, not to mention the same "room". <br /> <br /> I noticed some other reviews, one person said he "cried" eventually, witnessed James's tragedy. ??? WHAT tragedy? What, do you mean losing a fool who finds someone like Bill Bule AMUSING ??? !!! Give us a break
