What attracts a man to military service? What prepares a man to survive the brutal torture as a prisoner of war? What despair leads to the planning and execution of an escape in the jungles of Southeast Asia? How do you cope with the ghosts and memories you come home with? Herzog tries to answer these questions in his documentary by Dieter Dengler, a German emigrant and US Navy pilot shot down in Laos in 1966, who was taken prisoner, tortured and starved, but eventually escaped being haunted by the experience rest of his life. A personal and personal first hand account of man, his life and his experience told through the apparent integration of interviews, archival footage and new videos. You will never forget this story - or this man.
