Class Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look for a Jean-Pierre Melville film that I had to give him a watch as soon as possible. Since I discovered Melville and it seems that he is working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to confuse this as one of his films, but it was done in 1960 by Claude Sautet, before Melville came and claimed his thesis on French neo-noir. <br /> <br / Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two children, who wants to return to Paris because the police are approaching him. After a roaring and frantic opening with a big surprise, Abel eventually locks in with Eric Stark (Belmondo) who wants to enter the criminal world. Stark becomes Abel's driver and the eventual only friend in an underground world that transforms Abel after all he has done and lived. The film shows the duality of the two men, the old Abel at the end of his time after the tragedy struck him, and the young Eric started in the same way as Abel, falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with his man despite the world of which they are part. It never ends well for them, or their loved ones. His only thing is to see a criminal coming to his end, it's different when he has loved ones that he threatens to overthrow with him. <br /> <br /> Just like the Melville movie, the seemingly simple story gets more complicated as it gets along. As usual, like the one I hear in Melville's movies, he let me turn my head (in a good way) and die looking at him again to pick up what I missed the first time. Class Tous Risques is a precise goalkeeper.
