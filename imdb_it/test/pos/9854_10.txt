This documentary is not only one of the best documentaries I've seen, but also one of the most moving and silent films I've ever seen. Follows the lives of two young Sudanese, Peter and Santino, as they try to make their way into American culture. Peter and Santino are friends at the beginning, but gradually they move away more and more, while Peter goes to Kansas City, and Santino stays in Houston ("a land called Houston"). Santino's beauty is in his eyes. Take the people behind him, he supports an apartment full of other Sudanese, paying the rent, doing everything for the others. He is a silent sufferer. Peter takes care of himself, gets a school education while playing basketball and makes Christian friends. It seems that the director Megan Mylan didn't know what she was identifying with the beauty of this story. Peter and Santino are fantastic characters that move you. But the real strength of this film lies in its comments on American society. He is not judging. Show the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be for external people. I suggest you find this movie and look at America through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
