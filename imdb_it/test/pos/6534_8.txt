Although I am slightly older than the recommended age group, I really enjoyed this movie. It's a little break from reality and every little girl has to dream of becoming friends with a pop star. I know it was mine, to be sure! The first 10 minutes were really cheap and the bad girls said some things that were even slightly cheesy. Once you get past this, you can really start having fun. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane - it was really sweet and you could see how much they liked each other. The soundtrack is perfect and fits perfectly into the film. I also liked the family created for Jane, her sisters seemed adorable. Very well done film.
