Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert but, being shy and somehow reclusive, she does all her work from the confines of her apartment. Just as she is about to take a vacation in Mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disk with disturbing information about it. Angela agrees to meet her colleague, but dies mysteriously in a plane crash. Angela goes to Mexico but takes the record with her. While she is sunbathing on the beach, a terrifying-looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam) makes openings for her. He falls in love with them and the two end up on a boat for Cozumel. However, Jack works for the people who generated the secret information on the record and he's out for it. Even after Angela escapes from her clutches and returns to the United States, Jack makes things difficult. Change Angela's identity on every computer across the nation, causing her to lose her apartment building, her bank account, everything. Can Angela, a computer wizard, beat Jack in his own game? This very exciting film has many resources. First of all, Bullock and Northam are two very beautiful and interesting actors and their presence adds an immediate attraction. The script is very intelligent and confident in its knowledge of computer capabilities and their relevance in today's world. The costumes, sets, production and direction of the film are also wonderful. And, despite how it seems, there is a great deal of exciting action while Angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. If you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. Provides twists and turns with great frequency, making it possible for the "net" viewer a very nice evening of entertainment.
