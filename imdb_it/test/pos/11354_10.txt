In the 1960s Hong Kong, a man and a woman moved to adjacent apartments with their spouses on the same day. They soon suspect that their always absent spouses have a relationship with one another. A strange bond emerges between the man and the woman as they face their sadness by taking each other's girlfriend in turn, before a more complex bond emerges ... <br /> <br /> No summary can make it justice , for Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar-Wai "In the Mood for Love" is nothing short of a miracle. A story of sadness that manages to be moving and sometimes funny. A love story that never feels forced or fake. No doubt the director's method has a lot to do with it. <br /> <br /> Directed by a non-existent screenplay (even if the concept derives largely from a Japanese story) to encourage improvisation, the film is immediately set apart by the freshness of its performances. The whole film revolves around this and the rest is pure improvement. At the center of the film are two characters that will adapt to your heart and will remain there long after the launch of the credits: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply incredible and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth they show. The additional material is also top notch: the films are magnificent to see (partly projected by Christopher Doyle of "Hero") and the music is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is something that everyone must see, if only because it is by far the most sincere, mature and authentic "love story". Unmissable.
