This film is one of the best of 1986 with disturbing but intriguing shows by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were rather depressing for many people, not only for teenagers, but this film really captured the desperation and despair. Well directed with a great script (apparently based on a true story), I see no weakness in this. The opening blow was brilliant. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves was decent for a change and Miss Skye was right about the money. Hopper had three other great performances in the same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II and Hoosiers). I imagine this has a cult following and I wonder what this photo would look like if it had been republished. Super stuff!
