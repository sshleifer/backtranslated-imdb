This film has 4 parts and each one lasts about 170 minutes. It is based on the real life story of Joe Bonanno and is telling everything how he saw it. So in some events we can see that we have heard about it differently. The film makes you tie for the chair until the end, I think it is possible to watch all 4 in a row, and not to notice that I saw 2 in a row and 2 the next day in a row. Acting in a movie is OK in some fantastic scenes, but in general it could be the bather, but this film doesn't talk about acting or special effects and glamor, this real show and the story is the key to this film. So, the one who looks for the same spectacular Rambo / matrix / titanic film, you can skip this. The good thing in the film is to follow the main story so as not to have long and boring love scenes or any other interruption with something that is not important for Bonanno's criminal business.
