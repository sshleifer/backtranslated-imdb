Business against personal conviction. Profit and art. <br /> <br /> As with any documentary that pits big capitalist societies against the small producer, the spectator will always have to take the parts of one or the other based on their own convictions. This is as much a documentary about the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us, against the old traditional methods in which the character and the art of doing things count much more than getting the product sold. <br /> <br /> If you have to remember one thing about this film, it is that the masses can no longer decide for themselves, they simply follow the taste of one or a couple of critics who tend to equalize and standardize taste in the same the way MacDonald used to do for the quick bite (something that Parker himself admits in the film against the background of a Burger King sign). "Everything revolves around the image" against the content as another interviewee says. This is the simple way, the standardized way. Easier than taking the time for a good wine to mature, easier than forging your taste by trying and trying again. The taste of the controlled brand is simpler. <br /> <br /> There is a glimmer of hope when even some of our cousins ​​across the sea agree that some people are "leveling" the taste of wines to maximize profits and guarantee a maximum is sold to the "gray masses". Individuality and difference are sacrificed for the extra dollar. It's nice to see that not everything or everyone is surrendering to standardization, even across the ocean. <br /> <br /> As in many other areas of the world today, the domination of the few and the limited freedom of choice affect all of us ... let everyone decide and decide what to do. Too much standardization kills the mind and taste; the difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow the choice - and not only "more or less the same". Standardization sells easily and a lot, and brings everyone to the same level - the lower one. <br /> <br /> On this, I will open a nice bottle and wish you a "saint".
