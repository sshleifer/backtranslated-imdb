For all Homicide junkies, this movie was great! Every single character who has ever been on the show made an appearance in the film. He helped solve some (but not all) problems in the series. Unfortunately, unless you actually watched the series, most of the fun would be lost, as the film made strong references to every season of the show's existence. This would probably have been appropriate as a series finale rather than as a separate film, but we have to take what we can get. I hope they make more films and continue to present homicide characters on Law and Order.
