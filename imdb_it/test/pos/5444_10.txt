If taken as a whole for his ideas and his dissection of the current 2-party system and political process, I think this is a great film. Of course, the film was not the comedy I was expecting, but once I got past this film it really made me think. Much of what we see and hear about any election is such a joke. There is one particular scene of debate in this film that I think was a masterful criticism of our political debates and the way in which policies are "discussed" about them. I encourage anyone who thinks our process is okay to watch this movie. If you want something to laugh about, however, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not their usual selves. In this film they show us that the truth hurts, not that the truth is funny.
