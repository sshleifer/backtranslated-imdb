"Father Hood" is a small neglected gem of a "road movie". Beautiful performances by Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, two really fun "over-the-tops" by Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, <br /> and decidedly exceptional by Patrick Swayze. The film is aided by an unconventional storyline, but badly subdued by its framing flashback which translates into a formal, abrupt ending. "Father Hood" would have worked MUCH better without these "bookends". However, the film brings up important questions of "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. As long as the adoptive system rewards the institutions for NOT placing children, such abuses will exist. <br /> <br /> Collect this. Worth the "race".
