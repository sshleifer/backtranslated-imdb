It is very difficult to find new information on JFK Jr. and this beautiful film has had very little, but it was a pleasure to watch it. The casting was very good and the script, although a bit like a documentary, was also good. My only complaint was that it was not long enough. Perhaps a two-part film could have told us more about his "pre-George" days and his relationships with his mother, his sister and other relatives. Some of the material in the book, "American Son" by Richard Blow would have greatly improved the film. WTBS should be applauded for producing such a fun movie.
