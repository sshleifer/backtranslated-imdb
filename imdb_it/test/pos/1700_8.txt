I've never seen "American Werewolf in London" but this movie was a lot of fun. When I rented it I thought it was a horror movie, but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some aspects of horror. I thought that the transformation sequences were well done, but the effects were wise, the best scenes were those in which the effects and the lighting had built each other, beautiful. The transformations reminded me of many werewolf transformations in other films, but the werewolves themselves are very bestial and not very similar to dogs. Gore: I think there is too much in this film, which really takes us away from horror, when every shot has blood, taking violence seriously is difficult. <br /> <br /> J. Hurst (8th grade)
