I'm not the biggest western fan. But my two personal favorites are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. But I loved this movie! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everyone who played a part in this film was excellent! I also think he beat both films somehow. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb film that these two can't compare to in the long run. I think he beat Tombstone. Both had strengths. For example, they both have a well-known cast, very good plots and excellent filming. But Posse beat Tombstone in four ways, in my opinion. First, the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better at Posse. The idea was original to Posse, unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference, the action sequences! OMG! Posse was a western with really good action sequences. I mean really well! The action was quick. Like modern movie-based shooters. The action also had big budget explosions! Even the fist fights were pretty good. Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I suggest buying this excellent movie!
