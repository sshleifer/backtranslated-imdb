I feel that this film is different from many others in that it shows a family of girls who are interested in each other. They might have flaws, but the bitterness and the bad mood have no place with these girls. Try to find it on TV or in the usual movies. It is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine, wearing beautiful and feminine clothes and shoes. The contrast with clothing in today's stores, ie jeans and frayed and faded jackets, etc. The plot has an evil plot, but it is what makes it more realistic and interesting. I know it's animated, but it still gives you the feeling that families can stay together and come out into the open. I would recommend this movie for boys and girls.
