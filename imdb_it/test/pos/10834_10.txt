I noticed that people asked if anyone has this show. I have all 26 episodes broadcast in the United States and we will be willing to share them with anyone interested. All I need is for you to provide VHS tapes or blank DVDs that I have in both formats and pay for shipping. My email is creator67@pipinternet.net, just send me an e-mail and your request and I will send you a notification and we can make arrangements. The quality is very good and they are very fun to watch, especially if you haven't been able to see them since they were broadcast in the 60s. It was one of my favorite shows as a child and I have a very special place in my heart because it brings back many memories of my childhood and other shows like Ultraman and Astroboy. <br /> <br /> Peter
