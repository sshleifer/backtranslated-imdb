You really need to remember the Monkees and have a clear understanding of where and how they fit in the second half of the 1960s to fully appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no plot as such. Basically, it's a mixed mess of various unrelated sequences. But it is interesting and funny in its own particular way once it reaches its wavelength. In short, it was a classic, ingeniously conceived and well-made example of experimental cinema of the 1960s. It contains some good songs, some ultra-groove cinemas and many other useful ideas in terms of film technique. <br /> <br /> I give you 7 out of 10 for several reasons. First, it took a lot of courage to make a film so unorthodox in the commercial mainstream that both its stars and its producers were firmly established at the time. If a feature film fails at the box office, the consequences can be disastrous for all concerned. Secondly, it was, for the most part, a creative success. And, finally, as already mentioned, it is, without a doubt, a classic of the genre and, as such, is now historically important. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Head" arrived too late in Monkees' career. But, once again, he would not be allowed to do it before because it was essentially a very sharp and cynical satire of his own image. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the members of the group knew, all too well, that the entire Monkees juggernaut had just run its run when he started working on this project. In a sense, it had to be their swan song and they were determined to let everything take place. They were tired of being treated as mere pawns in the high-powered corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited in previous years. In short, they "wanted to go out" and were going to say some things before they left. <br /> <br /> The story, however, confirmed the band. That the critics are damned. The Monkees, has left some of the best, most refined and successful pop records of the decade. Yes, they had a great help. But at the end of the day, they were standing in front of the studio microphones, they faced the film and the cameras and THEY did the concerts. They were funny and just a little crazy. But, unlike some of their contemporaries, they have never been threatening. You could easily introduce a Monkey to your older aunt. <br /> <br /> "Head" probably takes a bit too much weight from the Beatles' "Hard Day's Night", but it's still worth taking a look at those who were around at the time or for the most young retropoles that have the ability to appreciate their meaning. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
