I saw this movie in the early 70s when I was about 10 years old. old on TV. It was after school, and as I watched, I was so attracted to the idea of ​​two astronauts going on missions to another unknown planet, which I asked my mother if I could get the recorder out. She left me. So I wrapped the microphone cable around the channel knob, then the microphone hung in front of the speaker. This film is the first one I've ever paid enough attention to and I'm interested enough in recording. (Only audio - at the moment there were no VCRs.) The plot will make you hang with every word .. every minute of this movie .. The ending will drive you crazy. After seeing the journey to the opposite side of the sun ... You will have flashbacks in your mind about it for a long time. I repeated the audio recording for many years ... and "I saw it" over and over again in my mind. Then - maybe 15 years later ... when video recorders were common, and they sold tapes in stores ... I always looked for it ... but I never found it. But when the Internet arrived one day, I searched and bought in a second. So ... after about 30 years after seeing it for the first time - I got to see it again. WOW! ~~ It was spectacular! Only for reference .. I must have seen it 50 times since then.
