Jim Henson always seemed to offer wonderful TV shows. This was unfortunately one of the shortest lived. It was captivating to hear every story with their delicious morality. Each episode was a new story, with new characters. John Hurt did a great job playing the Storyteller, and the sarcastic tone of Brian Henson as the dog has always been pleasant. <br /> <br /> The set designs and costumes were well made. Muppet's work, when requested, is the classic work of Jim Henson. You know it's a Muppet, but it's an appealing appearance rather than forgiving. You find yourself enchanted and forced. When each episode ends, you realize that you were quite amused. A fun that is coming true, not the kind that vanishes after a few moments. You sit and think about each episode, realizing that each story is timeless and has a strong history of morality. <br /> <br /> I still have to show it to my kids, but this is really a series that is more than family entertainment. I beg you to find it on DVD and tear it up. If you can't do it, then find out how.
