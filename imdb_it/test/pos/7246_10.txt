I gave it a 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to find because it wasn't ... but because it left a person taking care of the characters. The acting of the whole cast is superb, especially Joan Hickson, and it's a wonderful episode for her heart. <br /> <br /> Miss Marple is called by Jason Rafiel's dying request to investigate and resolve a murder that happened about seven or eight years earlier, and she has to find out who, why and when it goes on. Mr. Rafiel is the same Rafiel who was in A Caribbean Mystery and therefore there is a sense of connection here. <br /> <br /> Nemesis is definitely one for amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who is only happy with a lot of blood, guts and repetitive action sequences, then you won't like it. But if you are like me, someone who loves to know PEOPLE and discover what makes them beat, then Nemesis is the right one for you.
