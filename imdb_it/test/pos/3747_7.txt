I recently saw this movie at a 3D film festival in Hollywood. It was in polarized 3-D (the gray glasses were not red and blue). It was great fun watching this movie with an audience, the print was excellent and the 3-D perfect. The performances were exaggerated and this added to the fun, the surprise ending (which we should not share with other film-goers, at least according to the trailer of the film and the poster) made people laugh. By today's standards, this is probably more of a comedy than a horror, but with the added dimension of 3-D (complete with cobwebs and bats coming off the screen) this film was a fun horror joke from the 1950s.
