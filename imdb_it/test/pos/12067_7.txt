Like many comedies of situations, "The War at Home" is getting better with each episode. The characters are starting to become real and I believe them as a family. I agree with many that the first episodes were not so funny; I thought the show would be canceled for sure. But with the absence of "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Arrested Development", "War" provides the much-needed live-action comedy for FOX on Sundays. And compared to the rest of the sitcoms currently on the air "War" is an even better choice. <br /> <br /> His charm, at least for me, lies in his real situations. Teenagers have sex None of the parents like their children going. Parents fight and call each other. But rather than relying on being "bad" like many shows, in the end everything is beautiful, which is the number one rule of a good sitcom. <br /> <br /> A deduction from the show is the narration during / between scenes. The "Arrested Development / Family Guy" style of flashback works quite well but the narration may be too much. <br /> <br /> So anyone who needs something to watch on Sunday night should take a look at "The War at Home," especially considering what is on the other major networks at the time.
