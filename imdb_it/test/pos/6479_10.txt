You don't have to be a football fan of Notre Dame to enjoy this, because they are not ... but, as a football fan in general, it was fun to watch it. It makes me almost a devoted Irish fighter. If you can't get involved in the excitement of this movie, fan of the grid or not, it's better to check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very moving scenes. <br /> <br /> As a sports fan, I enjoyed watching the classic movie of the first college games. They had some pretty wild shows then with lots of side. They interspersed that video with Pat O'Brien shown as head coach Knute Rockne on the sidelines and some of the players, like George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). <br /> <br /> Reagan has a pretty good billing in this film, but its part is not that big. O'Brien is the only actor with a great role here. The rest - all cute characters - include Gale Page as Rockne's wife "Bonnie"; Donald Crisp, as the "Father John Callahan" of Notre Dame; Albert Bassermann as professor of chemistry "Father Nieuwland" and Reagan, as Gipp, perhaps the most talented and famous player of Notre Dame ever. <br /> <br /> What this film does well is to balance personal history with football. None of the corners is exaggerated. The characters in here all the people you can cheer for, since there are no bad guys. In my last look, it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield - Tarzan's son - who plays Rockne at the age of seven and see George Reeves, the TV Superman, as one of the players. <br /> <br /> There have been very few football films made in Hollywood, for some reason, and precious few good ones. This is one of them.
