Samuel Fuller knows the war and is one of the few directors in the history of American cinema who could accurately portray the horrible experiences in a form like the film. His pessimism and idealism, if this sounds a little strange to mix together, work for him as a narrator, and at the same time it is always out to tell the truth, however brutal (or put into melodramatic constructs) that can get. Verboten, however, takes care of the post-war experience, since in the opening scenes we come only to the big WAR boom - in bold for a point. The opening blow is like a big exclamation point that seems to continue in the rest of the scenes: a soldier dead on the ground, the camera opens, we see another soldier shot down in a war-torn terrain. Simple and direct language Then Fuller emphasizes the intensity with something interesting: the title song played on the opening titles like irony and sincerity, and then Beethoven's music on a clash between Americans and Nazis. Sergeant David Brent (James Best) gets hit, the battle continues, and then passes to him to be treated for his injuries. <br /> <br /> It could make us believe that it will be a rather conventional WW2 movie (a little in that they would usually not find Beethoven and, later, in a sense, Wagner inserted these images), but it is not this is the case. Rather, Fuller makes this kind of movie "Coming Home", although it is not at all in the sense that "this soldier comes home wounded and so on and so forth." Instead of actually going home, Brent stays in Germany, as he fell at breakneck speed for the woman, Helga (Susan Cummings, quite good at removing the German accent), and wants to work in a more restricted role in the military, so he she can marry her What she does not understand is that a) she wants him more for money, so she can get food for herself and her brother, however this becomes emotionally complex on the point of revelation to the slightly naive but sincere Brent b) c 'is a dungeon Hitler's youth sect called werewolves, who want to pick up where Hitler ended up - starting small, despite discussions within the group - attacking the government that is now rooted in Germany to give them, like describes Brent, a "blood transfusion". "With this, in addition to the filming of the Nuremberg trials, and (as told, I think, of Fuller himself) a quick history of Nazi war crimes piece by piece, we get a multi-faceted look in a society under the strict conditions of an immediate post environment. - while Rossellini handled it in his own way with Germany's Anno Zero, Fuller confronted it in layers: first there is the love story, or what is the tragic ruin of a man who can't see anything beyond that what he thinks should be reasonable, which is his wife and son on the road he can't leave, until the revelation that he was (partially) cheated Baker and Cummings, along with Harold Daye as Helga's young, confused brother, they perform with the maximum detail of the emotions, these are not very simple B-movie parts, although they could have been like this, then another layer is the political one, the struggle of a society to face being conquered, and a to a mentality made sensationalized, to be sure, by Fuller, compared to making the Nazi something totally devoid of gray area: they are bad, in particular when they cancel the reasons to reach their goals. <br /> <br /> And finally there is the style layer, which is strangely absorbent. This is probably one of Fuller's most talkative films, which is not a bad thing since it's one of his best written screenplays, since the characters don't speak simply or in too many platitudes (except for a small scene where two the characters speak of Hitler's youth as juvenile delinquents, which is actually, according to Fuller's autobiography, probably another layer to consider in the subtext and in the period of the films of the 1950s). And Fuller shoots this almost in a real European style, when he's not going for fighting scenes or battles, as editing isn't always very fast, and sometimes a cut won't happen for a whole minute or more. There is a strange tension that comes from this, especially when there is something that is said by a character who receives another with wild or suspicious eyes; Fuller could easily go for a great close-up, but there is a more sinister and cool quality of not getting away from two people in a conversation without a simple agreement. But when he asks for it, like the big brawl outside the American military office, or the Nuremberg footage combined with Franz's memories of werewolves, Fuller can be an incredible designer as always. <br /> <br /> Very difficult to find, but it's worth it if you're a fan of director's films or WWII movies set in Germany, or just a history buff, Verboten! it is an intellectual and a strong emotional experience, with a cast that is better than expected from a B-movie, and an attitude towards the "other" that is equally harmful and stimulating.
