However, closely the film is for comics, it doesn't matter. This film radically moves away from the boredom of "Interview with the Vampire" (although it does well) and slips into the wonderful action scenes. Very convincing and interesting story with a surprisingly good acting by everyone. Disadvantage: poor graphics. It matters? No.
