I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a bit off-beat, everyone in the making of this film gave birth to a pleasant film, good for lots of laughter. Writing and jokes are much more instructive than I expected. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors who do a good job, all of them. <br /> <br /> The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from "Ed" and the new ads for Apple computers. He was just entering his role as an actor in "Ed", and he was excellent here. It's natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who doesn't take punches. It's on "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central about once every two weeks, but it really shines on HBO's "Red, White and Screwed". I send him regularly to XM Radio's uncensored comic channel. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. It doesn't matter if his speeches and jokes here are dramatized or improvised. It is invaluable as it expresses its thoughts on the anguish of the middle class. One thing is about Black's delivery, his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. He really seems to have a conversation with you, and I think that makes him unconsciously more effective.
