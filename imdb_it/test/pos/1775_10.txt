I like the movie, it's the best pirate movie I've seen so far (forget silly Errol-Flynn-stuff and Pirates of the Caribbean). This film is wonderful and melancholy. I compare it with "Johnny Guitar" on the sea side (but 3 years earlier), two women fighting for a man, where crazy love could bring one. <br /> <br /> The female character (anti-) the heroine, Anne Providence, is superb, recites without compromise as a child, lost alone in her search for her own female identity in the world of a real man. He is a rather strange film hero, not a funny pirate, like most of his comrades of this genre, he doesn't always joke, fights for the poor and the good and only kills the stupid Spanish or British soldiers or - better - sneaky governors , but he is killing all the poor prisoners of war, after capturing a ship (looks good at the beginning of the film), he is primitive (he can't even read), he is desperate and she is an alcoholic, she loses all her friends as consequence of his obstinacy and is rubbing most of the film. This film shows a "hero" of the pirates a little (!) A bit like him (or in this case "she", but there was a female "Anne" buccaneer, Anne Boney) could have been in brutal reality . <br /> <br /> The film is quite short and the plot is told in a breathtaking way. Certainly, a movie from the 1950s has no exciting special effects for viewers of the present time (ships swim very clearly in a bathtub), but this real drama about love (which kills), trust, betrayal, revenge, hatred and sacrifice drive a mad person. Perhaps, it is supposed that Anna is also Judas Iskariot and Jesus of Nazareth in one person, betrayed by her friend (the French LaRochelle) like Jesus; after being disappointed by his friend, handing him over to a death penalty (as Judas); that having remorse over this (like Judas, who commits suicide according to the Gospel of Matthew); and in the end sacrificing for the salvation of the beloved enemy (like Jesus). But, even if you are not interested in this philosophical question of guilt and expiation, the film brings a lot of (economic) action such as fighting with swords and burning (plastic) ships for a very short hour and a half.
