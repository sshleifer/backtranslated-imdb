I am very impressed by the reviews I read of this film - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - of course by people who love and think seriously about movies. I could not add anything to the excellent review work that IMDb members have already done. If I may, I would like to correct a small but widespread misconception that appears in many of the reviews: Mr Baseball was American and behaved badly but he was NOT an ugly American. The original ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the homonymous 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr Baseball. Homer was an American archetype and an archetypal engineer - he went to Vietnam to work with people, respected and appreciated the people he met, used appropriate and sustainable technologies in collaboration with his guests, and liked and respected exactly because he exemplified the values Democrats and American Virtues. His ugliness was purely facial, only deep skin; his personality and his humanity were profound and genuine. <br /> <br /> Mr. Baseball exemplifies all the crude, ignorant, insecure arrogance we Europeans and Americans often inflict on other cultures; Homer Atkins, the ugly American, was the other side of our currency, which represented our humanity and decency. I believe that ugly Americans are still much more numerous than Mr Baseballs; they are still our last, best hope.
