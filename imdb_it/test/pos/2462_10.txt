The era of the Vietnam war is certainly long before my time, but it has always interested me, and I have seen many films about it. All the others I had seen had dealt strictly with the front line. When I read a description of "The War At Home", I found the concept intriguing. No Vietnam War movies I've ever heard of what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over. <br /> <br /> One night, flipping through the channels, the film was broadcast on The Sundance Channel. I put the remote control down and leaned over to look at it. I didn't move from my place during the whole two hours; it's one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there's no way to predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This film made me a big fan of Emilio Estevez. I really liked Billy the Kid in the "Young Guns" movies, but I never saw anything he did later. Emilio has proven to be very good at writing, directing and acting. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film is very well done. I have trouble thinking of a point where it drags on. <br /> <br /> What amazes me is that he didn't get an Oscar or any real recognition when it came out. It's a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their child is not what he was and probably never will be again as they remembered him again. Definitely worth seeing.
