For a long time I didn't know what time I liked this movie or not. This is surprising, because I usually know, but since the film was not going anywhere, I was a little confused. <br /> <br /> Two people move into a fairly common family environment. Finding their spouses constantly at work or on business trips, their attention, out of pure solitude, is around each other. After a platonic love story, the male lead starring Tony Leung Chiu reveals that he has a lover on the side. Su Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung, is injured, even though their romance has not been physically consumed. Chiu leaves the country, only to return years later, when everything has changed. <br /> <br /> For the cynic, the film is correct. Never touching actively or really the part of love, but only getting closer, the film says, admits, more than many others on the subject. It is also true, I think, that nothing good would have happened if they had gone ahead to have the relationship. At least that's the feeling I get. <br /> <br /> If we must believe it, however, when Garica Marquez writes that "... love is a state of grace, not the means for nothing but the alpha and omega, end in herself, "then this film falls miserably below this, like everyone else does. Or, if you are prone to totally incomplete minimalism, it hits the mark. What films in history have reached, approached or supported this phrase, if only for a short time? My heartfelt memory is that of the two. When Harry Met Sally effectively suggests this romantic perfection; and getting is all just to get there. It is interesting to note that in When Harry met Sally, this happened during the courtship, rather than in its attainment. Can anyone say something good about love after it has been joined by two people? Nicholas Spark's recent film, The Notebook, approaches this perhaps more than any other film; must we believe that once love has been achieved, radar flies must exist to perfection in some other dimension, or perhaps truer it becomes a latent vehicle for other purposes? <br /> <br /> In the film Mood for Love is an honest film, with a splendid and generous cinematography worthy of all the best Almodovar has to offer, but all he can say in the end is that "Life is sometimes like it. "Now it is not at all a difficult thing to say, especially if said well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when Kar Wai Wong tries to complete the film by linking, only for the second time , a broader historical theme that plays against the background of the relationship that has just taken place. This is a worthy effort, and the variation on the musical motif played during the film is quite brilliant, but the relatively free charge of the drama plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the public prone to olivism, leaving the viewer to divide the difference, a mistake in every movie. A director should know where he is going and how to get there. But in all honesty, it's just a wrong turn. However, as some know, an important imperfection is enough to ruin the barrel of perfect honey. <br /> <br /> The effort, however, is certainly worth it; trying to let a historical theme widen and complete the film and raise it beyond the micro-meaning of the couple, but without a true prefiguration, is the crucial error. In a word, and unfortunately, it is too little too late. It is also, I think, a challenge too great for the non-Asian viewer who is not familiar with the history of China to fully appreciate this radical blow.
