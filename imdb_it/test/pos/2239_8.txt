I was watching the 100 movies below according to IMDb users, seeing if there was something to review that I haven't found yet and I found this little gem on the screen. One of those occasions when you see a movie classified as one of the worst and you have to be one of the few who really likes it. Damn it, well, I guess I'll be ridiculed and spat out here, but for me this was a good movie when I saw it. It's been a while though, I remember he used to come on HBO late at night and I watched him two or three times and haven't seen him since and I'd like to see him again now knowing that Jolie was in there. The story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this company and some bounty hunters after them. I think it's basically all there, throw some scenes with Jack Palance and our movie. A few good deeds here and there, and also a little blood and violence. There is also a love story at stake as well as the female cyborg and the boy who trained her to fight will fall in love with each other. Sometimes the dialogue gets pretty bad and it's not by far a top-notch movie, but for a b-movie it's really good. I don't know if it was a theatrical version, also because it does not seem enough of quality, but it is one of the best directly in the videos if it were one of those.
