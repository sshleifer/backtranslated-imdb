This reel produced by MGM in 1936 showcases the talents of two of its young contracted stars, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In a sense, these short films were promotional trailers that presented new talents in front of or behind the camera. Felix Feist directed this, which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. The orchestra that has fun in a public park does not receive the attention it deserves every Sunday. Get in touch with two music lovers, Judy and Edna, who love listening to the band directed by one of their grandparents. Two of the city's elders who perceive that there is no audience for this type of entertainment have decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience. <br /> <br /> The two girls embark on a promotional tour alone doing what they know, calling and running errands and helping their neighbors in exchange for the promise that they will attend the park concert next Sunday. Well, that day comes, and to their surprise, almost nobody comes when the music starts. The two girls decide to take things by themselves and ask the conductor to play a song for them to sing. The result is clear, people throughout the park come together to listen to talented young talents, thus ensuring the existence of the orchestra. <br /> <br /> Of course, the only attraction of the short film is the inspired singing of the two stars that are wonderful in their interpretation. Mrs. Durbin's operatic voice goes well with Ms. Garland's natural voice creating a delightful duet. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it when shown on TCM!
