One of my favorite movies of all time, I've seen it three times already. He does a great job summarizing the Isrelai way of life, Israeli humor and seriousness, and many of the problems Israelis go through. Universal theme of wanting to be accepted and accepted for what you are. A good subtle humor, and it is the charisma of the characters, which makes this film magical, and says a lot about Isrlaei's culture, irony, contradictions and humor, with a great actor, Oshri Cohen. I highly recommend it to anyone, and it's a perfect movie for just about everyone, family films, movies for boyfriends / fianc√©s, and it also says in addition to Israeli culture, wanting to be accepted, above all, how important the family is, with all its diversity and imperfections. <br /> <br /> Great film.
