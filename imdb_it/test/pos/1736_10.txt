I really like Dr Who. <br /> <br /> Seriously, don't fire me as a "science fiction person" because they aren't normally. I understood why a friend drove me crazy when they started watching it. It's actually really fun, and most of the time, it's fast. My whole family looks at it more or less and this is a miracle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Ecclestion is pretty good, but David Tennant is brilliant. I think it's because he made the Doctor so manic and it's nice to have that bit of eccentricity in a TV personality. <br /> <br /> I don't know what it is, but it all works like clockwork. <br /> <br /> All I will say is just try it. An episode (probably the best if you don't choose the second half of a two-parter, though).
