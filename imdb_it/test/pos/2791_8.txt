I could see this film in my French lesson as part of the term "French culture". I thought about the way it was shot and the editing was really good, but above all it was fun, especially the guy who played Wendy's brother. Even the plot was very good and credible and at the same time adventurous. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: when William makes fun of the German boy who studies and when he behaves like flies! :) <br /> <br /> My French is not good but with subtitles I could understand what was happening. <br /> <br /> LOOK!
