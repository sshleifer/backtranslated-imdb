A really accurate and not very elegant look in modern life. It could be set in any city in the UK. <br /> <br /> I live in a residential complex in Glasgow and I can relate very well to this film. <br /> <br /> Sadly situations and characters are too realistic but not predictable. <br /> <br /> The actors are frighteningly credible, I felt like spying on my neighbors. It was an intimate dive into the life of fragile and hopeless people. I was very touched by some scenes. <br /> <br /> I loved the way this movie was shot. <br /> <br /> Overall this film is a must see.
