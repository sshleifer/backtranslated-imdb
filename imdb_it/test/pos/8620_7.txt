The accounts look real with a human factor added to the mix. A lot of sadness. I'm sure I'm not happy about him ... Another thing to add is that all the women on this show weren't really good stories about real women. But, I don't think it's about women, although it was JFK Jr.'s passion. What a pity. every loss of life is a real pity. <br /> <br /> It seemed like a good account of his life. I recommend it if you like biographies and melodrama!
