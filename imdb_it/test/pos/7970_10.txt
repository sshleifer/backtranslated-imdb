This film is very similar to the Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also has some similarities with Island of Fire with Jackie Chan and I also heard that there are other very similar action films, but this film has a much better action of the Death Warrant or even Island of Fire (it's true, the film by Jackie Chan). American action films rarely have such extraordinary action sequences, although there have been many negative reviews about this film, which easily beats most of the most successful action movies of the time. There were many martial arts scenes, David Bradley was as fast as Bruce Lee in this film and what else was nice, that the fight scenes were much longer than in most American martial arts movies. The scenes shot were similar to the films of John Woo, perhaps not so good, but still very exciting. There were also many impressive explosions and a great hunting scene. I've seen some other David Bradley films, but this, however, is the best in terms of action. OK, this movie has moments of sweetness, but which movie doesn't it have? The acting was decent, Charles Napier was incredible and his character was really tough. Adam Clark, who played Squid and Yuji Okumoto who played the villain, was also very good. Other actors also played well, even though acting is not important in this type of film. If you're a fan of action movies (I mean the real action movie fan, who can really appreciate the good action), then you have to watch this movie.
