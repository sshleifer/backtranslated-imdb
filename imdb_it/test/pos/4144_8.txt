I've always enjoyed listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in a plane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of, say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how great his legacy would have been if he had been singing for decades. Almost everyone who published was a success. <br /> <br /> So I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent work done by Gary Busey in playing him and imitating his sung voice. He made Buddy proud, as did the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played Holly's support group, "The Crickets". <br /> <br /> As for the music, there are some of Holly's most famous songs at the beginning of the film which is really great with a strong end to the end when Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa in their last ever concert. Busey sings not just like Holly, it's a dead bell for him in the looks department. Something was the absolute best performance of the actor, and you have no arguments to discuss. <br /> <br /> I am also glad that they concluded the film on a positive note with that concert in Iowa, instead of dwelling on his tragic accident. The ending could have been a real disaster, but he didn't allow it.
