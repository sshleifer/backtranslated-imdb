Paul Schrader and his brother Leonard wrote Mishima, and in doing so, clearly drew parallels between the life of Yukio Mishima and his work. The film is divided into four sections: beauty, art, action, and the fateful day that Mishima held a general hostage of the army and spoke to the garrison, only to have ridiculed him and his ideals Bushido of the code samurai. Mishima committed ritual seppuku on November 25th 1970 and designed it as an intertwining of beauty, art and action. Schrader modifies the scenes by recreating that day with three different scenarios from the Mishima novels: Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House and Runaway Horses. The seppuku moment is realized perfectly in relation to its shocking climax, pulling back the camera while zooming simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The black and white sequences are mixed with the colorful moments depicted in the Mishima novels. The black and white scenes represent memories of Mishima's childhood and youth. Schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from novels that often coincide with Mishima's real life, such as his stuttering, the development of his obsession with bodybuilding and the promotion of the samurai code. Each of the three themes of beauty, art and action is exemplified in the representations chosen by the respective novels. The color sequences recall the first Technicolor films, giving the film, perhaps, a surreal quality, considering the topic. <br /> <br /> Ken Ogata plays the real Mishima with unfailing determination, headed to the general's office on that fateful day and looks like the real Mishima. Schrader took enormous risks with this film focusing on the novels he did and thematically linking them to Mishima's personal life and his literary ambitions. The montage of the film among the three main sections of November 25, 1970, the growing segments in black and white and the colorful scenes of the novel clearly indicate the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty, art and action in Mishima's life. Sometimes, it is difficult to follow, and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated reader. *** of 4 stars.
