The new voices scare me! Kuzco must not pass a frickkin academy to become emperor again! It's always the same thing, isn't it? This is a show for children, right? Yzma turns Kuzco into something stupid, like an animal. Learn a lesson. EVERYTHING IS THE SAME !!!!! David Spade and John Goodman never came back ... * sniffle *! Nothing changes, because Disney won't do anything like that. Probably one of the most delayed shows ever! The first movie was so damn better! Malina is probably the only person I like. Kuzco is a whiner! Kronk is retarded! And the delayed ER of Yzma (even if it's just a word)! What I meant was ... How could you, Disney ... why?
