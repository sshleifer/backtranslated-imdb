This was one of the jokes of a film about this film and for once the publicists have not exaggerated. All six players present here are on the screen 99% of the time, so they must be good. <br /> <br /> It is always fascinating how certain plot premises can be worked on for both highballing comedy and a deadly serious situation. Mary Boland of the Ditzy and Charlie Ruggles of the tormented recite their usual characters who are planning to make the scooter up in California. To share expenses they advertise for someone to share the ride. They get Burns and Allen and a dog monster. That same premise was a serious and deadly thing several generations later in Kalifornia. Of course if you travel with Gracie Allen you know you are going absolutely crazy trying to understand his Monty Pythonesque reasoning around the world. And if that's not enough, you can run into W.C. Fields, a part-time sheriff and full-time hustler living in sin with Alison Skipworth. But in those days we didn't focus on these things. <br /> <br /> A true classic comedy of the thirties, not to be missed.
