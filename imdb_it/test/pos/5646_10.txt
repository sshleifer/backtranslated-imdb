My first Ichikawa in many years and the first of his war movies I saw, this was compelling and brutal from the beginning. In the very first scene, the nominal hero Tamura is told he cannot continue with his unit, to which he returned from the hospital. Apparently it has TB ?? but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him into consideration for the amount of war wounded they have. But his old unit won't even take it; his CO gives him a grenade and tells him that if he really feels hopeless about blowing himself up, it's the most honorable thing to do. <br /> <br /> The Phillipines, 1945, and the situation seems really hopeless, for PFC Tamura and all the others. Nobi is an odyssey through hell, or rather hell ?? stripped forests, dead rocky plains and dead and dying Japanese soldiers who hope only for the end, through peace or death. Ichikawa's film is photographed in a splendid B & W effect that serves to highlight both the desolation of Tamura and those he meets on his journey to his destiny, and to show how small and naked they all are in the immensity of mountains and forests? ". This little human affair will end soon, it seems the earth is saying, but I will survive and I barely notice it. <br /> <br /> Tamura goes back to the hospital, but is (not surprisingly) rejected there and spends the rest of the film trying to stay alive, stay human and get out of danger. He can't do very well on any account, slowly starving and finally committing some fairly repellent acts. Eventually he joins two other desperate men who lost, or survived their units, and resorted to cannibalism and in his weakened state in front of other armed men, he found that the only way to live is to break with everything he believes in. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is as brutal, uncompromising and intense as any war film I've ever seen, there are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and do not intertwine in the memory like the scene with the man on the mountain that practice mind begs Tamura to eat his meat, the recurring bit black-comedian with Tamura who exchanges his tattered shoes for the best skins of a fallen comrade ?? the degradations that humans will survive to survive ??? the truth that this is a war, all wars, all humanity as long as we continue like this. A masterpiece that I probably won't watch for a long, long time. Watched through the beautiful Criterion Collection DVD.
