When someone refers to the realm of independent cinema in the United States, it often follows that it means that the director or the people behind the project have had much more creative freedom and have done what they wanted. This, today, is not always true unless someone is a solid "author" and creative freedom still comes with the warning that one must find distribution with one of the independent divisions of the principal studies or be caught in some way for some kind of a low-level contract in a film festival of value. But Putney Swope, the film by Robert Downey Sr on a hard-hitting African American accidentally promoted to head the advertising guru in a production company, * is * independent cinema, the kind of work that got along with the Mi like or Romero's Night by The Living Dead and Cassavetes Faces at the same time they don't get a real typical studio distribution, but cause waves, butt and names in the world of cinema. For all its moments that are rough and raw, it is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It is also a funny film, very and terribly funny. Sometimes the sense of humor is so ridiculous that it's almost impossible not to laugh, from the mere appearance of President Mimeo with his wife to the lines of dialogue of advertisements that Swope's team puts together like "I can't eat an air conditioner" in a true "soul". It is as smart as the target audience, which is anyone who has two brain cells to put together, able to see that this work is not offensive or * too shocking because it is meant to shake the cage, and it does quite well in the first five minutes. Once past, Downey Sr continues to make the blitz to become a director with nothing to lose: his protagonist is part of Fidel Castro, Isaac Hayes around 1972 (and yes it is 1969 in the film) and is part of the executive in a fire sequence to make Mr. Spacely look kind of Jetsons. And don't forget those secondary characters, dear God. <br /> <br /> There are so many memorable lines and moments that it's hard to keep track. From perhaps the most hilarious failed assassination attempt in every movie to the announcement for the "Face-Off" face cream that includes the lines that would give South Park a run for its dirty money, just steps away from a guy by Jack The Hill films that play the Muslim who continues to give Swope his lips and that boy with the nun who curses a storm and impresses Swope in a swift stroke. It is a rather straightforward message on media and advertising, but there are also many strong moments in which racism is struck in America, sometimes without having to do more than one gesture and sometimes with something HUGE like having black panther types go in this way and that around Swope's advertising regime. And for a low budget production (I mean super low, hence the comparison with Night of the Living Dead and Faces) Downey had really good actors, all not union members, and it's hard to imagine that some of them might have had their the first time here on the camera. <br /> <br /> It must be said that Downey's style does not make him perfect: he is rude and sometimes too crazy and dated for his own good, and I'm sure I didn't have a bit of background humor of a couple of announcements since I came from a generation after these announcements were broadcast (even though the "Miss Redneck Jersey" was not lost to me at all). In general, however, this is one of the most beautiful periods of his time, a stinging satire and a characteristic with a predominantly black cast that is all too know of what comes from an excess of power, regardless of skin color. It is, as some might say, "good s ***".
