People say this movie is a "typical horror movie for kids" ... well, it's a horror movie with a teenage girl ... what do you expect! It's a good movie, I counted 3 real screams in the audience while the movie was on and it was a very scary movie. I wasn't bored in the movie at any point and I was even on the edge of my seat at some point. The only thing that was a little ugly was that he was a little slow entering the real storyline, but this led to explaining why she was where she was and why it happened. The acting was good, the scenery was good and the plot was good too, I hope to see a 'When A Stranger Calls 2' in a few months! Nice film!
