Instead of going to the site and making a realistic film about drug addiction in the windy city, contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go the other way and make his film as artificial as possible, flying like this in front of the fashion set of men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who were taking their pictures all over the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the film is based, went on disc to despise him. What, he wonders, was up to Preminger, and why did he make the film this way? <br /> <br /> The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo cartoon. Louie, the drug dealer, is dressed to look like the kind of gangster that Mad magazine artists used to draw. Arnold Stang, the wonderful comedian he was, seems out of place in a serious photo like this, and his appearance, complemented by an exaggerated and oversized baseball cap, arouses laughter. Robert Strauss, another actor known for humorous roles, is equally out of place, since his large, heavily meowed face and Runyonesque style seem more appropriate for a Jerry Lewis film. Against all this, the stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to keep the viewer off. Sinatra is nervous and addicted to everything, suggesting a man uncomfortable with himself, so completely appropriate for the role of an addict. Miss Novak, similar to a plant and sublimely impassive, is understanding and looks like a product of the artistically squalid slums she liked in the film. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hard-working like Zosch, lame and lame. It is never convincing, but neither is the film. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to anyone interested in a realistic representation of the lives of addicts in America. The Caligari sets make it incredible. Perhaps Preminger was aiming for a dream effect, as the cardboard backgrounds give the acts the surreal feeling of a nightmare operetta, perhaps returning to the beginnings of Preminger in Vienna.
