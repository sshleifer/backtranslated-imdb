To date, there is no film that has seen more than once of The Chipmunk Adventure, nor has any film brought me more happiness. This is by no means the biggest movie or the biggest animated film, but for an 8-year-old girl in 1988 it was the most beautiful, fun and exciting movie ever! Today I am equally equally impressed by the musical numbers, each of which is an extraordinary song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic pop tradition of the 80s (think Pat Benetar at helium, unique in the world). <br /> <br /> The controversy awoke to the brazenly suggestive tone of Chipette's song "Gettin 'Lucky With You", which to me seemed much more innocent at the time. However, observing him as a rational adult, I can completely understand the concern; you have three young girls in skremy harem outfits who passionately proclaim "being lucky is what it is". The Chipettes were definitely sexed for this movie. <br /> <br /> But this controversial topic does not even come close to the shadow of the fantastic animated adventure of the Chipmunks feature, I encourage parents and childless adults to control this film. Especially if you were a child of the eighties / early nineties like me. :-)
