There are times when I'm convinced that Mikado is Sullivan's and Gilbert's best work ever, but it's only until I listen to Iolanthe. However, the Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the Sabaudes. (Yes, I put the composer first, nobody says Hammerstein and Rodgers, or Hart and Rodgers, or Boito and Verdi, or What's-His-Face and Strauss. You don't even hear the names of the librettists for Offenbach, Suppe or Balfe Gilbert was only the biggest name (and the biggest ego) at that time, so they put his name first.It's time for the silly practice to be put to rest. <br /> <br /> However, the Mikado It is a compliment to Operetta S & G. It has some of Sullivan's most imaginative numbers, combined with some of Gilbert's most intelligent texts, has an interesting book and a lively dialogue, has a wonderful degree of madness and leaves the door wide open for elaborate and extravagant costumes br /> <br /> This particular production, shot in a live performance in 1990, turns its imagination towards a surprising simplicity, set in a British seaside resort towards the end of the Art Nouveau period, completely throws the japonerie of the original Il result is the costume and the setting in a captivating white, gray and black medley, accented by occasional red fragments (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). It takes a while to get used to, but it's really bubbly. Of course, when the choir tells you that they are gentlemen of Japan, you would be right to exclaim: "Oh, pooh, Bah!" (Did I just say that?) It is very gratifying that this beautiful production is now on DVD. However, a warning: the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity, so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and always slightly blurred. The tendency to superimpose images is unfortunately annoying. Why do people who are doing a really voluminous production want to have it run off with artistic stuff like that? But it's the performance that matters most. We can skip the overture, since, although one is executed, Sullivan never wrote one. (True, perhaps this is how he wrote no one for any of the Savoys, but Mikado's opening cannot even be dated to Sullivan's life and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others.) As for the rest of the operetta, it's top notch and extremely fun. <br /> <br /> The Ko-Ko here is the reputable Eric Idle, to whom he attributes the credit. There is a tradition of bringing a great name to the role. It was a US television production years ago, in which Ko-Ko was played by Groucho Marx with mixed results. Idle's performance is deliciously eccentric ... she does it "Taken from a county jail", assisted by a tennis racket. His "I've got a little list" is made like a speech on the microphone - obviously he has the usual updated lyrics, which are much more fun than the usual run of these things, and his delivery is decidedly hysterical. It goes on like this. <br /> <br /> In this operetta, it is important to have a good Katisha; It's not funny if you're not shouted at it in style. This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer, in its way almost like a Big Idle. He blows with the best of them in a splendid and splendid alto ... wonderful, above all, for a soprano. And his costume ... !!! (Not to mention his recital with Franz Liszt, apparently, accompanying.) Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I find it difficult to move in a chubby non-Nanki-Pooish way, but the voice is undeniably a solid addition to the vocal palette. There is a nice touch during "A Wand'ring Minstrel", where the choir reacts with disgust to the mention of "his fantasy on the knee" - recalls Mikado's decree on flirting. However, Bottone is a good singing actor and if his appearance doesn't put the best face on Nanki-Poo, his performance does. <br /> <br /> Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are appropriately cute and stupid. She and Bottone make beautiful duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his character as something bland and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is as wonderful as a plush shirt out of the water ... a role later put to death in American sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers forced to provide for little children - that sort of thing). The Mikado (Richard Angas) is wonderful, with an imperious voice in absolute contrast to his ridiculous lyrics. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend getting this as your only Mikado. You also get good traditional production, so you can see what Gilbert meant (more or less) in terms of staging. That being said, I will watch it twice while looking at a traditional bit once. Overall this is a terrific offer, a vocal and visual delight, with a delicious over-acting. It's a DVD to cherish, with dervish-like waitresses, tap dancing bellhops, and everything else. Look at the bellboys with the signs.
