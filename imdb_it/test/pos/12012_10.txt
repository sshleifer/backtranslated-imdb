This film accurately portrays the life of struggle for the typical East German. Watched by the secret police, friends and colleagues, most of the Orientals simply existed. <br /> <br /> The Strelzyk and the Wetzel were two families who decided not to have any more. <br /> <br /> Despite the extreme danger of escaping to the West, they feel that the rewards far outweigh the risks. John Hurt and Beau Bridges, depicting their family heads, took the idea of ​​flying over the heavily fortified border of East Germany. <br /> <br /> There are moments of tension as they collect and jimmy-rig the materials needed for the flight. They work their daily work and build the balloon at night, right under the nose of the authorities, one of which is Strelzyk's neighbor (Klaus Loewitsch). <br /> <br /> The first attempt, which involves only the Strelzyks, ends in failure when the ball stops a few meters from the border. The crashed balloon is discovered by border guards and begins a relentless search for conspirators who are determined to try again. With the sale of carefully monitored materials, Peter and Guenter still manage to obtain pieces of fabric with which to build a second balloon to free their nail. The film also features a moving and effective soundtrack from the late Jerry Goldsmith.
