Fado is a sad, almost bluesy style of Portuguese Gypsy music that is heard repeatedly through the film. As explained by one of the main characters (Igor), it also means destiny. <br /> <br /> It is indeed the destiny that unites the two main characters Paco and Alex and triggers the resulting problems. <br /> <br /> Overall I liked it quite a bit. It starts as a dramatic film of "on the down and outs" and develops into a thriller / road suspense movie. <br /> <br /> There are two things that I found unrealistic that prevented me from giving it a higher rating (I gave it an 8). The first is the main point of why Alex gave away the stuff. Was she so desperate for the money she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then gave away things for a stranger? His explanation was not convincing. How did they get past the gate, where were the cops?
