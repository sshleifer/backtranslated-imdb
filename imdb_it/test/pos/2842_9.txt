A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: who are the madmen? <br /> <br /> The answer becomes less clear as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, is incredibly effective as Betty. In fact, it's so effective that I almost wanted it to be a little crazier because its created reality was so believable. <br /> <br /> This is the first time that Mrs Zellweger is called to bring a movie and she is more than equal to the task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock ?? although as foul as usual ?? it's quite subdued like Wesley. He is able to sublimate his manic energy and only occasionally emerges and always when it is most needed. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting allusions: the first time you see Betty is dressed almost exactly like Dorothy Gale from the `Wizard of Oz '?? then later in the film, she is compared to Dorothy when she says she was never out of Kansas. At one point the song for which Doris Day is best known, "Que Sera Sera" is on the soundtrack and then later Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes it as if it had an entire history of Doris Day. " > <br /> This is an extremely eccentric film with good performances from everyone, including the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> It has a surprising ending that, contrary to what it seems, is actually quite predictable . <br /> <br /> If for no other reason you see this film just to listen to the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.
