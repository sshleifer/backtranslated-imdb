I was lucky enough to see a test screening of "El Padrino" a couple of months ago in Santa Monica. I was amazed. You don't see any movies like this anymore. In the wake of Scosese, Chapa deftly recounts the tragic story of Kilo while maneuvering the difficult streets of Los Angeles to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord of excobaric proportions. The characters are complex and conflicting. Emotions are real. The action is fast and furious. The stunts are expansive. And Tilly is HOT. She hasn't looked so beautiful since her "Legate" days. I would recommend it to anyone. It's a fantastic tribute to the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s. And all the opponents out there ?? look at it again; obviously you had your eyes closed the first time. Congratulations to all those involved in the film. I count the days until the release of the sequel. Does anyone have an appointment?
