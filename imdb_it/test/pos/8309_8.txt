THE CONTEXT is everything when you go to evaluate a film. When classifying this film, the time at which it was made must be considered. We didn't really know WHAT the interior of the EARTH was in those days, so you can't think too much about the film for the plot (based on a much older book). For the time, this was the maximum of special effects and the quality of production was exceptional. I saw this movie in a masterfully restored HD master. For the moment, make-up and effects make kids look like plaid suits like monsters. This is pure cinematic cheese complete with rubber clothes, thrilling models and costumes. AWESOME. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!
