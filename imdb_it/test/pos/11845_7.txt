"Seeing Other People" is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are engaged and plan to get married soon. They live together but they both have doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes she has had so few sexual relationships in the past, she could marry Ed because she never tried anything else. So they agree to start joking with other people for a while to test their relationship. <br /> <br /> The film balances a preliminary question - focusing too much on "What if?" aspects of life, can it indeed do the opposite and only make you feel more constrained? When Ed starts having sex with a university student, he starts to get addicted and almost forgets Alice - when he realizes this, he scares him. <br /> <br /> I had heard nothing about this film beforehand, but I liked it. It's not extremely well done and it definitely has an intentionally low-budget indie touch - but it's much better than the more romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today. <br /> <br /> Check it if you get an opportunity.
