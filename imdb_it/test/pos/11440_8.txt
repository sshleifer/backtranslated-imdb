My wife and I endorse all the positive comments below, made by other members of IMDB. While this is not a box office success, it has a charm all its own. Genuine and touching. <br /> <br /> We saw it on video at the end of a long day. We were very tired and in bed. Normally in a situation like this my wife goes to sleep in a few minutes, that is, unless it is an exceptional film and this kept us both entertained to the last. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the youngest spectators in their teens and twenties would not want this, but for the rest of us it's a real gem! Watch it!
