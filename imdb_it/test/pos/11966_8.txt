I wonder if I could go through an entire musical comedy from Russia or East Germany or from other countries that for decades have almost always projected propaganda films, anti-fascist films, anti-war films (as this documentary emphasizes) that only reflected the dark and exhausting times under Stalin and life behind the iron curtain. It is therefore fascinating to see the other side of the coin, the types of clowns and rebels with music by their side to try to please the masses most of the time blocked in the socialist path of life. A film actually looked quite impressive, called Jolly Fellows by the pioneer of the very small group of music directors, Grigori Aleksandrov. From the clip (s) that I saw of that film, I bet it was one of the few works to really come out of itself and to enter a sort of crazy, maniacal and laughing mode. But as this film shows, if you're a filmmaker trying to entertain, it's better with a "message". <br /> <br /> Through interviews, some almost occasional dramatizations (such as Russia / Germany / etc. association of images) at the censorship table, and clips, you get the complete picture of how it was - both behind the scenes that on screen - just to make entertainment pure for the masses. Some of the films (well, most of them, apparently only 14 screened in over 40 years in the countries mentioned) have brought about a nice change, but for what purpose? One also enters the culture of all this, how it differs enormously from the American way of "if it works, make it when it is hot". But at the same time, perhaps because of this repression, some interesting, funny and (from what I've seen) films have been made. They could be quite typical of what was being asked of the masses, under Stalin's affectionate but demanding terms, like life with tractors. A story becomes even more juicy, since we are shown how it was in the 1960s, the last wave of musical comedies, when rock and roll and pop music finally hit their radio waves. <br /> <br /> In short, good stuff ... but only if interested, really. I was shown the film in a documentary course and half of the class fell asleep. So, on the one hand, you are warned, on the other hand, if you look for it, it can be a truly rewarding journey into the history of European cinema.
