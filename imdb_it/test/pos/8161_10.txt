Without doubt the most impressive recent gay movie I've ever seen. C. Jay Cox hit the nail on his head with this. The way he handled issues related to faith, family and sexuality has been done very well. The casting was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a fantastic job of bringing out the character of Christian and Steve Sandvoss will leave you speechless as Aaron. Both have brought incredible realism to the roles and impacts these problems have on young gay men. As a homosexual raised in a very religious environment (although he was not a Mormon), identifying with Aaron's character was phenomenal for me. I highly recommend this film to anyone, faithful or not, who is interested in how young homosexuals are confronted with family and friends in an often hostile world. By the way, the music in this movie breaks! Another excellent work by C. Jay Cox.
