He was probably watching this TV movie that interested me in the debate if "Anna" was the daughter of Tsar Nicholas, Anastasia. Since I saw it, I made a habit of watching various documentaries and I even bought a book. Despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released, sometimes I still think she was. This is the power of Amy Irving's acting in this 2-parter that is quite liberal with historical facts, but full of tear-down dramas and totally convincing performances by Irving. <br /> <br /> I was not consciously aware of Irving before this, although I must have seen it without realizing it in "Carrie" (another favorite movie). In "Anasasia", I never felt for a moment that "it's just a movie". For me this woman was Anastasia, and when the first part ended with her in the train carriage meeting members of the royal family, I knew that when hell or high water I had to see the second part. I just wanted to see how she would prove she was who she claimed to be, and as the story progressed I felt an intense hatred for the character of Rex Harrison, even though I admire him as an actor. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie listed again in the TV guide, I convinced my mother that we had to watch it, and later thanked me for doing it, being almost eager to have been watching part 2. Then I bought the video and I can absolutely recommend it. "Anastasia" is one of those rare TV movies that you simply have to watch for the pure pleasure of watching the most beautiful acting I've ever seen on TV, and it doesn't matter if you believe in the legend or not.
