Maverick director Seijun Suzuki finally managed to film his dream project, "Princess Raccoon", and in a sense he was lucky not to try it in the 1960s. Special effects and computer graphics have made this type of production easier to achieve than the old matte film technology. <br /> <br /> A certain familiarity with Japanese history and theater traditions will help you enjoy this film. Although Shakespeare's familiarity with "The Tempest" could help with Peter Greenaway's dense "Prospero's Books". These two films actually have a little in common though, "Princess Raccoon" is much more colorful and easier to look for someone without the background to fully appreciate it. <br /> <br /> While design, acting and art direction are good for most of the film, it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the last third of the film. Most of the interesting sets have already been introduced and the camera seems to take a step back for a gaming experience of a filmed scene. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a unique cinematic experience and I recommend it to anyone interested in alternative forms of film performance. It is not meant for children, even if nothing happens that upsets them. If the last third was better, I would have given him nine stars.
