I saw it for the first time in UK TV, with a good musical accompaniment. The lift scene is classy, ​​especially when it does the thing that goes down in the phone booth, and then fiddles with the floor indicator. The jump across the crossbar is really impressive and there's so much more. In addition to all that was mentioned before, there is the struggle with the man who is bullying the dog - it just seems so simple. The only drawback is the plot: it is confused with Dead Eye Dan, which then escapes but does not reappear, even when some other gangsters are involved later. The scene where it looks like he's shooting the fat inspector is fun, but it would have been better if Dead Eye had pulled the trigger.
