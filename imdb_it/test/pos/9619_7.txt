Having recently seen Grindhouse, I was browsing US Video in search of some films that could have been played in real grindhouse cinemas in downtown areas during the 1970s. The Hong Kong action movie Five Fingers of Death looked like a movie. Sound effects similar to cartoons and quick jump cuts seemed initially a bit annoying, but after a while I was so involved in the story and the characters that I didn't care. Parts of the score sounded like the television theme "Ironside" which was later used in the Kill Bill films by Quentin Tarantino. Some scenes involving the hero's boyfriend seem to be on the verge of parody, but they were so brief that they didn't ruin the film. The most interesting parts involve the tournament and some revenge segments after that. Worth seeing for kung fu fans!
