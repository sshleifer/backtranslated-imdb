it doesn't matter if Drew or Leelee are total girls, but there are a lot of girls that are so beautiful and hot, but they seem to be so nerd. This film is not an Oscar movie, but has at least a good point of view on how life is for young people or "real" people. It made us laugh and learn to accept others for what they really are. this film represents the real world and what really matters.
