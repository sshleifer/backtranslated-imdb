"Körkarlen" by Victor Sjöström immerses the viewer in the deepest depths of life for most of his playing time, with dark scenes of alcohol degradation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages involve the mythical image of Death itself . Here Death is embodied as a ghostly horse-drawn carriage, driven by a miserable sinner who was the last to die the previous New Year. For a year the wretch must collect the souls of the new parties, and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the driver's soul is finally released when the last person to die on December 31st becomes the new driver. <br /> <br /> The scenes involving this carriage (the film was known as "The Phantom Carriage" or "The Phantom Chariot" in English-speaking countries) are disturbing and mesmerizing, using a double-exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today. The most surprising thing is that the carriage travels to the bottom of the ocean to gather the soul of a drowned person. As fascinating as these scenes are, most of the film deals with the descending spiral of David Holm, played by the director himself in a sober portrait of a man who gave up the chance to live a decent life. In flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he seems to be a perfectly normal boy. Abruptly, without explanation or explanation, we see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Normally this leap from First to After may seem like a lack of narration, but in this case the directors trust us to fill our familiar and sordid details. It has been suggested that Holm was led astray by his convivial friend Georges, the drinking buddy who first tells the story of the Phantom Chariot, but whatever the cause of his fall, Holm appears to be a lost cause, a drunk from petty spirit that takes perverse pleasure of inflicting pain on his family and refusing to reform. <br /> <br /> While David Holm is our central figure, the true catalyst of history is a young Salvation Army nurse who has a sympathetic interest in his case and firmly believes in him despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself is dying - indirectly because of her treatment on Holm's behalf - she asks to see him, and then inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will lead to her recovery. <br /> <br /> A Sometimes this film resembles Dickens' Scrooge story in his use of spectral visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life, to endure his misbehavior and reforms. I also remembered Sjöström's 1917 drama "Terje Vigen", in which a man returns from prison to find his empty house and his missing family (a sequence echoed here). The director also reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore, found earlier in his "Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru" (a.k.a "The Outlaw and His Wife", 1918) that no man can overcome his destiny. This time, however, one could argue that David Holm actually manages to evade his seemingly inevitable fate, because he has a second unexpected chance to make amends. <br /> <br /> Spectators who expect a dip in the supernatural will appreciate the sequences with the title Phantom Carriage, but may not be prepared for the painful examination of this film of the alcoholic fall of a man in need. But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate "Körkarlen" in its entirety. It represents the best serious cinema of its time and is certainly one of Sjöström's most successful works.
