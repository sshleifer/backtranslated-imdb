Another hand-held horror film means another divisive film that fans should still look for and consider. <br /> <br /> Imagine a cross between The Blair Witch Project and The Grudge and you're close to the total content of this movie. It's another horror movie, but this time most of it is assembled together in preparation for a doc video that was never completed by a missing supernatural investigator. <br /> <br /> I have certainly been afraid to watch this movie (Does anyone do something terrible better than our Asian friends?) but the gruesome moments, the truly gruesome moments, were unfortunately a little less and beyond what I was hoping for. I also heard that I was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent "revelations" appeared, so I certainly can't recommend this as [* Rec]. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it would be negligent of me not to recommend absolutely any film that develops on ectoplasmic worms for a long time, contains at least two subtly ghostly ghost moments and made sure I should turn the lights back on for a while 'when the sun was setting. <br /> <br /> Find out if you've enjoyed some of the other hand held versions lately. And the finish is hair-raising doozy. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: The Last Broadcast, Pulse, Angel Heart.
