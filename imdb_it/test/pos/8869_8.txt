"Throw Momma From the Train" is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer on the brink of collapse; Danny DeVito plays a man in one of Crystal's writing classes. Crystal's ex-wife is a * witch * to put it right, and Crystal hates her. DeVito, on hearing this, offers Crystal a deal one night: DeVito will kill Crystal's wife, if Crystal kills a mother's DeVito buzz. The crystal, of course, refuses, but later, corruption deep in his heart makes him say yes. And as things are going, let's see what happens when you try to throw someone's mom from a moving train. <br /> <br /> This story is an interesting study of the characters; a story of wickedness, greed, revenge, ego, trust, doing what is right, but above all corruption. We see the white collar writer of Crystal becoming increasingly stressed with the events that clash around him, and because of DeVito's constant catchphrase, he says "yes". But we know that in the depths of his subconscious he meant "yes", and he is glad that he told DeVito. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit obscure on Hitchcock's immortal film "Strangers on a train," and plays a tribute to the film at the beginning, when there is a theater that plays "Foreigners on a train ". We see DeVito watching the film and a light bulb on his head opens. He has an idea. Throw your mother away from the train! <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal offers another convincing and strangely comic performance of a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse. He was so upset by everything that surrounds him that his inner emotions come out and he agrees to launch DeVito's mother from the train. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito has directed this film excellently. Use the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and disease. Everything is demented, but not to an extreme like in some other dark comedies. It has the right touch of darkness that has shone in "The War of the Roses". <br /> <br /> Not only "Throw Momma From the Train" is a simple story of corruption and morality, but it is also an interesting study of the character. Definitely worth seeing on TV. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
