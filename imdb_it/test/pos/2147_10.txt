I saw Heaven's Gate in its opening week almost twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great expectation of seeing Cimino's sequel to his 1978 masterpiece "The Deerhunter". Reviews have arrived and critics have destroyed the film vehemently. An influential film critic from New York led the way and most critics followed suit and 3hr. 40-min. the film was extracted from the distribution. United Artists brought Cimino to shorten the film by about an hour and was republished many months later to equally horrific reviews and dismal business. The film at that time cost about 40 million dollars (now considered a low budget), making it one of the most expensive in history and Cimino had free rein on the project with continuous repetitions despite being only his third film. "The Deerhunter" had also received a negative reaction based on a perceived political ideology, which was not popular. I quote all this to present a possible prejudice against Cimino. At the time I thought the film was very good and when I saw the shorter version it was still very good only less. The film appeared again in a museum in the early 1990s. They had to show the long version but could not find an existing print. However, seeing the film years later, I now thought that Heaven's Gate was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version started to appear in some selected cities, I got to see it recently and it was worth the wait. Heaven's Gate begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we have some of the flaws in their characters at the beginning. Despite the mandate that Joseph Cotton gives in his speech to the graduate class to use their education to illuminate and improve their country, many of the graduates behave as if they are part of an elite club. The film leaps forward 20 years in Johnson County, Wyoming. A cattle company called "the Association of Shareholders" has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming to be cattle thieves. Kristofferson takes sides with the immigrants while John Hurt is part of the Association. Although Hurt is totally against this crazy action, he is too ineffective to do something about it. A massacre takes place but immigrants are right to defend themselves. A US cavalry comes to the rescue of the Association to presumably arrest them after much of the damage has been done when in fact they have sanctioned mass murder. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his married Harvard days, bored, on a yacht, living but dead inside. <br /> <br /> This is a very complex film that is brilliant in every department like themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, set design and acting. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston and Cotton are all excellent portraits of very complex characters. Some of the main complaints I've read about this film are ugly to look at, inconsistent, too long, that the characters don't make sense and that words are often unintelligible. In his defense, Heaven's Gate looks like photographs from that period, just as "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" did. Some scenes are smoky and seem to suggest the industrial revolution or, sometimes, horses, carts, people pass by everywhere to create a sense of reality. (The critic who called it one of the ugliest films ever made loves to use thumbs in batches.) But in spite of everything, the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable. The film makes a lot of sense if you pay attention to it. Everything is not written for the viewer and we need to look closely at the motivations of the characters or their themes. As for its length, it is a well structured piece, sometimes moving, poetic, exhilarating or devastating with practically one big scene after another. Sometimes some words are unintelligible, especially in some scenes animated by the activity. But you can understand a film as cinematic as this through the use of film language, the looks between the characters or their actions. One day soon this film should be re-released at full length so that people and critics can give it a second chance. Don't let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles - who was appreciated throughout his life and is unable to make the kind of film he is capable of doing.
