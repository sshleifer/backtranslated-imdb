I've never given a movie ten to ten before, but this is the closest I've ever seen (I gave a 9). There are very few films that I really love, but this is one of them. With his gritty realism, his fantastic location on the spot, and a fantastic soundtrack, he literally upset my young mind when I first saw him in 1979. At that point I didn't know any prisons, violence, tensions racial or the struggle to survive & live free. I doubt anyone who is an adult, or what is growing in the world today, could be influenced by this film in the same way that I was all those years ago, but I will say this: "if you have not seen this film, I envy you" ; this is because you have the chance to see this great movie for the first time. For each of us they are different, but here are the rarest films of all: the ones we really love ...
