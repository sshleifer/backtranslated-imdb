Billy Hughes is a dumb young woman who works to put on make-up on an economic horror film shot in Moscow by an American director. One night Billy is locked up in the movie studio. Later that night he feels that someone might be in the building and goes to take a look. At that moment he comes across a woman brutally murdered while being filmed. After escaping from the clutches of the assassins, Billy informs the authorities, only to be flushed when men prove it was an act. Billy knows what he saw and soon his life is again in turmoil from underground figures who believe she has something important. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this sleepy-hearted sleeper passed me, but I thought it was a much older film. There is one thing though, it must be one of the most strident and intense thrillers I've seen in a while. He's just a great suspense builder and mostly everything snaps into place! The first half of the feature is surprisingly compelling with tense sequences that hold your heart in your throat and envelop you in a disturbing atmosphere of alienation. Emphasize this is a wicked black humorous strip. Defects appear in history, as they lose that furious hold that holds so early and the silly humor (or rather the comic putter relief) between the characters of Fay Ripley and Evan Richard is a story of love and being too strong. In the long run, he probably could have done without. Despite some moments of anger, this aspect did not prevent my enjoyment. For me, the soft finish with which they decided to go didn't seem right. <br /> <br /> The interesting and mysterious premise was mysterious to the core and contained some disturbing assets. So the multi-faceted was the context and its thrill, there was something new in the way all this ended and the nervous jolts and unbearable tensions intertwined in a series of sudden twists and turns. In fact, they made a superb use of the new idea of ​​this disability and of hindering the situation, putting it on stage in a foreign place where they did not speak too many English and therefore we are also involved in confusion. The delicate Marina Zudina gives a harrowing portrait of the American dumb girl Billy. The way he was able to show erratic emotions through his eyes and his actions gave him a rough and believable look. The director Anthony Waller shoots the film in an elegant, accurate and careful way, without losing the dirty look that emerges from his rigid environment and an airy and persistent soundtrack that constantly grips you. The only real name for making an appearance was a small cameo by Alec Guinness. The cast's performances all went well, especially the fingernails of Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as Russian murderers. <br /> <br /> This compelling feature that is mostly made up of unknowns, is much better than your dark average thriller. Highly recommended.
