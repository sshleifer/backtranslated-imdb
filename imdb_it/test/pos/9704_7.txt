Like the first, the JACKASS team is back to try to kill themselves in any way they see fit. Or, you're adapting to yourself with a tractor tire and rolling down a slope. Or to be deliberately destroyed by a bull. Or something even worse. <br /> <br /> The first one was crazy, and that's how you can describe it. It was also a very difficult film to laugh at. But this is completely crazy. He also has even more dangerous stunts, and even more difficult laughter. So, I think seeing the stupid idiots who get killed will be the funniest thing this week. <br /> <br /> So, before BORAT comes out, I'll make my A ** laugh.
