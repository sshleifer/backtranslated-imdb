I saw this movie in a branch of the Duane Reed pharmacy in New York on vacation, and it seemed a bit silly fun. And sure enough, the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words - but it turned out to be an extremely fun action film for children, and also for their parents. <br /> <br /> Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett), 10 years old, has his head in the clouds most of the time, much to the dismay of his father (Larry Miller). As a member of his school orchestra, Ricky and classmates fly to a show ... and once again Ricky's mind "takes off" and suspects that a criminal plot is happening. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly aided by best friend Sashi, who is a fan of spicy salsa (what a strange plot device he was) and others try to get to solving the mystery. Oh yes, and Ricky's skills, 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience, prove useful when he is called to save the day in the thrilling climax of the movie! It was great to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscos acting in a family movie. And watching the DVD interviews everyone seems to have had a lot of fun participating. <br /> <br /> I really liked Junior Pilot; fascinating and good-natured shows, fun and real storyline; sense of fun and pure nonsense. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a fun family movie, you could do a lot worse than buying it.
