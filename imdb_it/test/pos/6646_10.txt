Bergman's Skammen is one of the most realistic war depictions ever set in the movies. This is not an action movie in any way, although the pace is faster and there is more action than in most other Bergman films. Nor is it a romanticization of war or patriotism, unlike most war films. Indeed, the gritty realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalty has a very contemporary appearance. <br /> <br /> Skammen is a darkened film, which should be watched at night, so it is magic to make it work. Many of the effects are transmitted indirectly, but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity with an incredibly huge contemporary film, such as Saving Private Ryan. Obviously, the action in Skammen is on a much smaller scale, but it's still impressive. <br /> <br /> While the cinematic style seems contemporary, the setting of the film seems timeless and without place. The war-torn countryside and even the intact provincial town could be anywhere, anytime. And this film doesn't talk so much about specific historical events, with specific names and dates, but universal human reactions to adversity and chaos. <br /> <br /> Acting in Skammen, although typically impressive by Ullman and Sydow, is not of primary importance in this film, unlike most of Bergman's other films. For most of the film they are spectators, as much as we are. Bergman imposed the war on them, and through them on the public, and their reaction is perhaps what could be our reaction. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/10
