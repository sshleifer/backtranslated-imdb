John Huston has made many extraordinary and memorable films. Those most often and easily recalled were released long before his death in 1987. It was that year, however, that he reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game, as evidenced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novel The Dead. "<br /> <br /> A long time ago, a very wise man named Doc asked me," Does not "The Dead" seem much more vivid and brilliant than any other story in Dublin? " I tend to think that it is. The story and the film both contain some comments and criticisms of Joyce's society, but for the most part, they depict a warm and loving portrayal of an Irish Joyce, who often lashed out and would leave soon. <br /> <br /> Huston's management of the protagonist Gabriel Conroy, who realizes the world as he sees it, is nothing but an illusion, it is simply remarkable. To say that the film has no plot is to lose the point. As with all Joyce Dubliners, the plot - although certainly present - is not the goal. The plot is only a tool for transporting the protagonist's epiphany. In addition to an apparent lack in action, there is a dialogue quite frankly in Joyce's story about which the director must lean. Huston's ability to translate what Joyce puts into words in images is probably the film's greatest triumph. Feelings, thoughts ... Gabriele's discomfort during the dance ... all these intangible elements come to life and reach the viewer in the Huston representation. <br /> <br /> Stating that Huston has softened the writer's criticism of the company again misses the mark. While "The Dead" can be painted with a cheerful tone, the complacency and fiction of the characters in the film are nothing more than a commentary on society on a smaller scale: we are the old spinster; the embarrassing drunk; the tenor with a sore throat; the wife with the sad, rain soaked with secret; even the self-imposed middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> But "The Dead" belies its title. It is not a dark story. Nor is it really that dark. Forget for a moment the snow that falls on the living and the dead and the intrinsic symbolism in it; he forgets the chaos of a life that Gabriel wakes up at the end of the film: it is only with the destruction of the illusions that Gabriel has of himself and his world that he can really go on. This is the central point of the film. This is the central point of our lives.
