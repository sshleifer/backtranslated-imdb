There is a good idea of ​​the price of a silk robe. The child in the office shows the deal he got for $ 22 (close up of the tag). Later, Mary Astor finds the tag in the boss's bedroom (proof that the baby has slept with him). Still later, Mary Astor is going to have a relationship with Ricardo Cortez, look at the HER silk negligee price tag ($ 14) and remembers how disgusted she was for the baby, as well as the fact that she spent $ 8 less of the most obvious woman I've ever met. It seems an obvious moral turning point, but it was well done. The film would be stronger if the character of Robert Ames was played by a more powerful actor (it's too low for a salesman who made himself and spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera), and if Ricardo Cortez had been given more to do than smile ironically. Both male protagonists are bland and forgettable, and are hampered by the masculine pancake make-up so popular in the era of this film. However, the character of Mary Astor is interesting, engaging and credible. Behind the closed doors it is worth seeing.
