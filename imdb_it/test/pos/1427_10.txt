Clifton Webb in the role of "Mr. Scoutmaster" is one of the great classics of comedy and recalls an innocence, now diminished in the world. I can't understand why networks like American Movie Classics and the like don't show this movie, even though I've requested it several times. <br /> <br /> This film should be shown to children now for their portrayal of loyalty, respect, dedication and determination to get the best possible on an individual basis. There is little self-esteem spoken of in current daily lives, but this film, among many, many others, would be a wonderful learning tool for today's younger generations to see what can be achieved by common sense and decency and pride of yourself and your results to improve yourself. Sad that this type of film does not appeal to the modern public. Yesterday's baby boomer generation has certainly fascinated us. OLD LESSONS ARE UNIVERSAL AND TIMELESS.
