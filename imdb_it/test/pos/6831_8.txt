A nice enough kidnapping goat set in New Orleans, but my main downfall is that it encompasses too many political intrigues and double-agents, and not enough of young sexy actors, vibrant color scenes, original film style and biting humor. These aspects combine to give a fresh and daring cinema, which makes a lot of recent things an unbearably boring look. We hope SÃ©bastian Gutierrez will continue with such talent - it seems like a talent to watch out for. The unidentified mixture of little scammers in the film is overshadowed by the investigative partnership of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, the humor of whose scenes is very necessary to make the film what it is. The couple pulls out their obligatory southern drawblers just like the Yanks, and it is a pleasure to hear these two supporters of British cinema moving away from each other with lethal weapon-style style ... too bad that the only scenes that they have the opportunity to steal they are exclusively theirs. However, with a little less politics and authoritarianism (!), The film would be almost perfect, so I'll give him a healthy 8/10 and I hope some people remember him a little better than the box office.
