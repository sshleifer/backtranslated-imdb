This is the first American movie I saw this year and I think it will be the biggest because of the feeling. As a teenage singer in America, Aaron isn't as pop as before, most of the Americans I met said his song is fake and he didn't even know how to do rap. But beware, everyone, he is a child, how many people can understand it. Being a pop fan is difficult, and being a pop star is harder. I think this time Aaron (JD) showed something real for us. And I think people should learn to understand each other. On the other hand, I really like the music of the film. I remember that the first song appeared in the film is "Saturday Night" and also includes a real Aaron live show, and the second is "One Better", so think that if you like this movie, maybe you will also be a fan of pop. In the end, I hope you'll have fun ^^ A voice from a Chinese boy.
