Even if Voskhozhdeniye was your favorite movie, it would be possible to watch it at most every ten years. It's too emotionally tiring. Considered to be Shepitko's best film, THE ASCENT is the story of partisans operating in the Belarusian forest in the heart of the winter occupied by the German Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> While attacking the public with the sheer physicality of the war experience, in particular the privations of cold and snow, the real struggle for survival against both nature and the fascists, there is always a subtle and barely understood subtext of moral judgment and the question of whether a man can be moral or immoral in one context but in another. <br /> <br /> A partisan group hidden in the woods is attacked by a German patrol and loses food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish teacher, have the task of going to a small village for food. They find the village burned to the ground with nothing edible and nothing but charred woods and foundations in which in a den there is a hidden children's mirror. The overwhelming feeling is that anyone brings the brutality of war to a land and a people becomes truly cursed. I thought of the war that the Americans and the English brought to Iraq and how to bring the horrors of war to the people is the act of a degenerate nation. <br /> <br /> The two move to a larger neighboring village where, under compulsion, they get a lamb from their chief collaborator. The Germans arrive and the two partisans flee under fire. Sotnikov is hit in the foot and holds the German while Rybak escapes with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that, prepared not to be taken alive, he takes off his boot to put a bullet in his head. Just then Rybak returns and drags Sotnikov out of the line of fire. <br /> <br /> Rybak drags Sotnikov through the forest, bloodied meter by meter, all done in a long shoot. Every meter is an agony, yet it continues to drag it through the deep snow, the ridges, the depressions, the stumps of black bushes that break when they break under the weight of men. There are several similarities with Tarkowsky's cinematic vocabulary here - the long attempts to document a process, the effect of repetition use and the resulting emotional stress, which increases the duration of the shot. In the background, unnoticed because of the action, there is a question: Has Rybak committed an immoral act by returning to Sotnikov? If under the moral standards of Marxism-Leninism or simply the common imperative of the group's survival, was it not his duty to bring the food back to his hungry gang and leave Sotnikov to cover his escape? Sacrificing a man to make the group survive? Which leads to the question: can we expect an immoral man under a philosophical system to be moral under a different moral system? The partisans come as if another war curse in a farmhouse containing a woman with three small children. He is embittered by the scourge of war and barely clings to his three children. They are just rested when other Germans arrive. They head to the loft to hide. <br /> <br /> Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a German opens his head to take a look and no one answers, he threatens to shoot through the loft and Rybak's nerves break and are captured. Now who has the moral responsibility here? Sotnikov for cough or Rybek for cracking? The two partisans and their mother are hooked and taken to a nearby city that passes menacingly under a wrought-iron arch at the entrance. They find the boss and a child already in custody. They are interrogated by a Belarusian turncoat played by Tarkowsky's favorite Anatoli Solonitsyn. Sotnikov keeps his head during interrogation and torture and wonders just what the interrogation pre-interrogation profession was? He doesn't answer, but from his ease standing behind a desk the likely answer was "school teacher". Rybak on the other hand begs for his life and even offers to join the police. The defect of the character, previously unobserved, which took a "wrong" moral decision, the ambiguity (sentimentalism) of which he disguised the judgment, now becomes obvious, disturbing and very ugly. <br /> <br /> The five sit in a dark cell. All are scheduled to die the next day. From here the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. Rembrandt's original lights and compositions are used as other representations of Christ. He decides that he can save everyone if he takes on the guilt of everyone. He must be kept alive until morning so he can save everyone. He asks his mother for forgiveness and the leader knows what is happening and does not feel so desperate to die unnecessarily as before. <br /> <br /> Morning arrives. The Germans don't care if Sotnikov assumes all the sins of his companions or not. They will all hang. They climb up a steep road that is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bench is occupied by the place of execution which is the gateway to the city. Five strings hang from it. The bench has only three, so Sotnikov stands on a tree trunk that Rybak kicks from beneath him. They are all hanging. <br /> <br /> While Rybak comes down the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him Judas, a useless allusion, the only misstep of Shepitko. Rybak repeatedly imagines being hit in the back trying to escape, dying honorable death and unsuccessfully trying to hang himself in the cemetery, but starts with the Germans like the whipped dog he is. However, if Rybak was morally right to go back and save Sotnikov's life, was he wrong to try to save his life?
