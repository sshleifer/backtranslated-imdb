There are many, many old movies that deserve to be transferred to DVD format. This is definitely one of them. A triumph of Anthony Quinn! Dozens of films portray the victims of Nazi atrocities before and during the war, but, I don't think any of them has deepened the psyche of the victim and the predator as well as this one. Anthony Quinn was really a man for all seasons. He had the ability to portray the most humble creatures without human faces to a creature of extreme animal rights and to make it credible to the public who watched without second thoughts of what they had just witnessed! Really one of our greatest artists. He is missing.
