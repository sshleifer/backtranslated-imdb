Almost 25 years have passed since I saw this movie. I consider this film an all-time classic in a dramatic category. Anthony Queen offers one of the most wonderful performances ever. In a few minutes it takes you from laughter to tears. This film represents a splendid image of how humanity has changed since World War II. As much of that generation and the next loss he has lost his innocence. It took me a long time to find this movie by its name "the twenty-fifth hour". This type of film is not money but it is certainly a treasure for some. I am very surprised that this film is not used for media in a broader way to allow more people to enjoy this image.
