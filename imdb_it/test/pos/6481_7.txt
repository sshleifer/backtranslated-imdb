I saw the film about 13 years ago while living in Airlie Beach, Qld Australia. I found it on the shelves of a small shop at the back that most didn't bother to browse. <br /> <br /> I found it to my liking and watched it with the intention of owning it and being a day in my collection. I don't have it yet, but one day. <br /> <br /> I like the concept with poetry and fantasy. The semi-deserted street scenes with a crowded team city in the far background added to the visual effect. <br /> <br /> I have repeatedly mentioned this film to people who love this genre, with nothing but praise. It has remained etched in my mind for a long time to come. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film, but only to those who are in this type. <br /> <br /> This comment and that of LA, CA can help you when you choose to watch this movie. Comments can be negative, but I found them positive if you look beyond the derogatory connotation.
