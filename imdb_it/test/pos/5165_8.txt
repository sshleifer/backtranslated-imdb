I've already seen spin-offs of cartoons like The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes and many of them are fantastic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see how the Rugrats would look in their pre-teens / teenagers and contained things that usually happened at that time in life like going to a concert, going to school and being rooted. <br /> <br /> The current TV series is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica is not punished as much as she did in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie are punished in this series. <br /> <br /> I also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the Rugrats looked in the original series. They actually talk to adults in this show because they are 10 years older. <br /> <br /> This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show can appreciate this.
