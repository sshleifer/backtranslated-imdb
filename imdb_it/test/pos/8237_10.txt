It is known that Irene Dunne could sing a little more than a little. And I think his talent as a comedian can only be understood after he has fought with a sonata by Haydn or a song by Debussy and been successful. His instrument is his voice and his manipulation is pure musicality. You could face any part. The only thing he couldn't do was not make it. This film is a perfect example. In it, it acts as a channel for Ruth Gordon (because the game is the thing), is feminine, fascinating, strong-willed and shy, generous, protective and combative but never pretentious. He manages to remain credible as Alexander Knox is in another difficult role he assumes with ease. The viewer comes to believe in what he is seeing and caring for it. It is refreshing to see a movie that is both fun and intellectually stimulating while pushing all the right patriotic buttons. I sincerely hope that Dunne's entire work will come on DVD one day because it is really difficult to keep such a secret from the few initiates.
