The lush and cold landscape of Big Sky Country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains juxtaposed in desolate plains, is poetically put to use in this fairy tale / slide show of Lynch on the death and melancholy of the young and talented Polish Brothers (who previously he treated the fans of the indie film in the bizarre and fascinating "Twin Falls Idaho" - a film about a young woman who falls in love with two brothers who are Siamese twins.A small orphan is dying and a city is about to flood in the name of progress ( in the shape of a damned hydroelectric power station.) With its strangely pleasant music, minimalist dialogue and character development and fantastic sequences involving truly unique angels, the Polish brothers focus on what every good film artist knows of a movies, moving images ... images, scenes ... paintings of profound beauty captured on celluloid.It is better to be seen late at night in so that haunting images can linger in your mind and wash you while you fall asleep in sleep. The fact that all this was done with a budget of less than two million dollars makes Hollywood go crazy with their inflated films and empty films and points to something grandiose that will come from the Polish brothers in the future.
