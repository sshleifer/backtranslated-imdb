There are a number of reviews that comment on the cast of this movie. Suffice it to say that Alex Cord plays an important role alongside Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. What worries me is that many of you may not be aware of (at least) two existing versions of this film. In the American version, Clay McCord gets amnesty from Governor Lem Carter and then leaves the redeemed city. I agree that the ending is less than satisfactory. However, in the original Italian cut, Clay McCord leaves the city (without weapons while guns were turned to the Governor) and is blocked by the bounty hunters who slowly depopulated the banished city of Escondido. The Bounty Killers are excited to smash the $ 10,000 reward but are disappointed to find McCord's amnesty deal in the corpse pocket. As they move away, one hears: "If this amnesty continues, I will begin to hunt buffalo!" . This alone takes A Minute To Pray ... A Second To Die and places it in an equal playing field with films like Keoma and The Big Gundown. As the end credits say in the Italian "FINE" cut.
