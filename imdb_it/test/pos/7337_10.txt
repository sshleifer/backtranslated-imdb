This film was beautiful and touching. He touched a place inside me and I'm not sure why. I'm a happily married woman and I've never had lesbian tendencies, but mine, this movie has almost done something I want. The choreography, the plot, the dialogue ... the film was a work of art. <br /> <br /> The synopsis without spoiler is that of a woman gymnast dissatisfied with her life and looking for ... something, anything. She's with a man who doesn't want a baby, but he does. He's not bad with her, but he doesn't treat her like a woman should be treated ... I guess you don't really appreciate her. In all these years she has remained fit and decides to go back to the gym. Meet another woman during her acrobatic training and develop an intimate and beautiful relationship. During the film she has another friend with whom she trained during her younger years, and remained close friends. <br /> <br /> The relationship that takes place is ... I don't know exactly the word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate but sexy ... something that could only exist between two women. The kind of relationship that could really bring meaning back into your life. Someone who makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, even confused. <br /> <br /> The relationship with his dear friend is beautiful in an equally different way. They have an intimate and intimate relationship. Her friend showed me what a real friend really is. Someone who understands is easy, REAL, funny, someone who is there for you, whatever. Someone who is supportive, and you can find out and tell your deepest secrets. Someone who shares your past but doesn't share your secrets. <br /> <br /> The story is simple in the fact that it was not excessive, but it was in no way in any way. Leave a lot of sensual images to capture his moments. The dance and the choreography were wonderful. I could watch it again and again. The way the artist captured the feelings and emotions of the protagonist was. The dance and the images were very dazzling and mesmerizing to watch. What a beautiful story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have the chance, rent this and watch it !!
