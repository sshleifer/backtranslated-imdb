In the "goofs" section of this film there is a comment on the fact that there is an error in the continuity in which we see Auguste's car parked in a different place from that seen in a previous photo in the same scene. This is not correct One of the views comes from Auguste's apartment, the other from Valentiné's apartment across the street. The purpose of this segment is to show how Valentiné and Auguste - which can be made for each other - almost cross each other (as happens many other times) but never do it until the circumstances put them together on the ferry to end of the film. (And here is the implication that Joseph manipulated things so that Auguste is on that ferry, after inspecting Valentiné's ticket to see which sail was booked.)
