I recently went to a slumber party with five other girls my age (eleven). All of us, thinking that it would be a harmless little film like Jaws, decided to rent it together with Rat Race. (We watched Rat Race after When a Stranger Calls to ease our fear.) We put the movie at 11:00 at night and stretched out together in our sleeping bags hidden behind the covers for most of it. I screamed five times, which is unusual for me, because it scares me in the movies but I'm never afraid enough to really scream. <br /> <br /> We were all terrified even leaving the bedroom, as we were all positive at the Stalker (Jenkins as we called him for some reason) he would have caught us. I played a mediocre trick; one was dozing everyone after the Rat Race was over. I hid under my sleeping bag and said softly and slowly, "DID YOU CHECK THE CHILD?" Everyone SCREAMED like crazy and they were so scared. All in all, I would rate this movie as 9. The only thing I didn't like was that 1. There were too many alarms when Jill thinks the Stalker is there and 2. The kids never woke up throughout the story until when Jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the closet, when all they did was cry like children. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves thrillers. But one thing: I AM THEREFORE NOT BABYSITTING PAST 9:00 PM EVER AGAIN1!
