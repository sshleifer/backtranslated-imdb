First of all, before starting my review, I read all the reviews of "The Muppet Movie" here and I can't believe anyone could give a negative review to a movie like this. (Luckily there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone might dislike "Star Wars" because of the whole science fiction genre, but not like a movie starring some of the most adorable puppets in the history of humanity is almost sad <br /> <br /> Okay, now I'll leave my soapbox and review this movie. <br /> <br /> "The Muppet Movie" came out when I was seven. All my friends wanted to see it as their birthday movie, so I think I saw it about four times in the first month in theaters. <br /> <br /> As a child, many things attracted me to this and all other Muppet movies and TV shows. The singing was probably the main one. Most of the songs on "The Muppet Movie" are classic. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'm Going to Go Back There Someday", they are fun and challenging. <br /> <br /> As an adult I see "The Muppet Movie" in a completely different light way. Yes, the things that excited me as a child are still there, but it's the little jokes and those that are simply hilarious. <br /> <br /> I mean, when you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick man. <br /> <br /> Kermit is a frog and falls in love with a sweet pig wearing purple gloves and could do two piece karate. Fozzie is a standing comic bear. The gonzo is an "anyone" who is infatuated with chickens. Then you have two old men who suck, a dog playing the piano, a rock band with a manic drummer, a Swedish chef you can't understand and a number of other characters who are simply eccentric. <br /> <br /> Yet for these and other reasons, Henson has entertained millions of children and adults, giving us something special to look at and remember. <br /> <br /> 'The Muppet Movie' will remain forever in my heart for many reasons, but I think the biggest is because it is a film, unlike many recent films for children, which I feel comfortable in the children look Also, I never get bored with the jokes that are reduced to the level of my children. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic film that will surely be remembered forever.
