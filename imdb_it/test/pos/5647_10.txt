Kon Ichikawa experienced the Second World War and saw what effects he had on his people in Japan. But also the novelist Shohei Ooka, whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawa's film, Fires on the Plain. It is a film about men in this war, or perhaps more universally in wars in general, which lose their humanity. The soldiers trudging through these fields and the Philippian jungles in this story are almost completely hopeless, if not just that. It makes Stone's platoon look like a picnic: at least they had certain things, like food, after all. <br /> <br /> They have little or no reserves or supplies or ammunition, no back-up, no sense of anything going in this fight in which they were pushed. They cannot even receive adequate hospital care, unless they can no longer walk or have lost limbs (for example, if you have tuberculosis, you are on the right track). But it is precisely through the prism of a soldier, a private Tamura, that we get a full sense of the futility of war, both in its dark scenes of nothingness, boredom and decadence, and in those flashes of intense and brutal violence. > <br /> In the film Tamura just wants to receive medical assistance. This is right at the beginning, and his was told by his superior officer - already with his staring eyes and an expression that has been drained by years of battle - that he will die if he doesn't find a hospital. He doesn't, actually, but ends up with some soldiers: at first with a platoon that seems to have some action together, but he's really driven by a power-hungry brute who just wants Tamura's salt supply, and then later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been ambushed while crossing a street at night. <br /> <br /> The plot is not completely straight, but it doesn't need to be. The path of Tamura in Fires on the Plain is told in vignettes, little stories like when you come across an apparently deserted enemy village. Two of the common people return to get supplies and Tamura sneaks up on them. It is a heartbreaking scene, since so far with Tamura we have not seen him do anything absolutely * wrong *, but he does it in this scene, not so much for evil but for fear and despair (even this, without ruining it, as he gets a stock of salt). Small scenes are formed in such a brilliant and devastating way, as a simple task to find a pair of walkable shoes, which seem to be missing. Or when Tamura, later in the film, discovers that his teeth are falling apart and fall out of the lack of total hygiene. So much for food, so it's fine. <br /> <br /> It must also be said that this is an obsessively made film by Ichikawa, shot in a completely black and white vision of the fields and woods, the cinematography that fills everything we see in black-blacks and incandescent white. Ichikawa also makes sure he gets everything authentic from his actors, not simply emotionally, but with their emaciated appearance and their desperation. It is as if Ichikawa had all survived the film and characters who had survived the wild state; by the way, by the way, I also mean cannibalism. The shock of this is twofold; the first is the way a soldier jokes at the beginning of eating other soldiers at Tamaura, who asks him if it was true and only in response by obtaining a "do not ask" a word of caution, and the second with the representation of cannibalism alone, from the mad hungry man on the hill who takes his guts out of his knees and says with a straight face to our hero that "You can eat me when I die". <br /> <br /> This makes it particularly brutal when it comes to the director taking up the short "action" scenes. These are, I would say, more brutal than 'Private Ryan' in their depictions of violence in battle, the carnage that is completely random. A scene that I would aim at, and that contains only a shot that is heartbreaking to watch, is when from a high angle we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly along, a hail of gunfire arrives that kills only four or five, but it happens simply so fast, and the soldiers continue to walk along the same pace. This is not the only blow of horrible carnage that is shown - when it needs to be bloody it is there, but splashed on the screen like something completely macabre - but it guides the point completely. <br /> <br /> All the acting is puzzling (Funakoshi in particular, which seems to be the most in peace and most horrified by what he sees most subtly in his eyes most of the time), all the major sets piece provide something else to the gruesome experience, and all of this equates to the final question with an anti-war movie: how can, or why, people fight in wars like these? It is almost too depressing to put into words, and so Ichikawa pushes our nose right into the manure, the dirt and the blood and asks us to take it inside, so maybe, one day, it will never happen again. Or one can hope for it, at the end of a film as bleak and grandiose as this.
