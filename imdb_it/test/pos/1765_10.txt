In this short film of about 34 seconds produced by Thomas Edison, we see Annabelle Moore interpreting Loie Fuller, choreographed "Serpentine Dance" in two different fantastic and flowing dresses. <br /> <br /> Moore was one of the greatest stars of the late Victorian era. He has participated in numerous Edison Company short films, including this one, which was among the first Kinectoscope films shown in London in 1894. Loie Fuller had actually patented the Serpentine Dance, which Moore performed here in bathrobes (as well as entire frames) that they are often hand-dyed in the film, which foreshadows one of the most common symbolic devices of the era of silence. Presumably, Moore's films were popular enough to have to be redone frequently (including reassembly). The version available to us now may be a later version / remake. Moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party in a New York City restaurant. She later starred in the "Gibson Bathing Girl" of the Ziegfeld Follies in 1907. She appeared there until 1912. <br /> <br /> The short is noteworthy for her shot of the movement, which, especially during the "second half" becomes almost abstract. It looks a bit like a painting by Morris Louis, although this is almost 60 years before Louis's work. <br /> <br /> You should be able to find this short film on DVD about a series of different anthologies of ancient films.
