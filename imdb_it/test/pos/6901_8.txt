When people complain about how they "don't make them like them", then they direct them to this horror of fantastically entertaining and singular-looking comedies by screenwriter and director Glenn McQuaid. <br /> <br /> It is a tale of graverobbers (played by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) that end up digging more than just immobile corpses. After the initial shock of this, they soon realize that they can actually turn the situation to their advantage. And that's exactly what they are trying to do. Mind you, it seems that things did not work as expected by poor young Arthur (Monaghan) who is actually telling his story to a priest (Ron Perlman) before being taken to the gallows. <br /> <br /> Looking at the details of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have taken the heart of his first short film and expanded it with this effort, which is not bad. Fessenden returns and is doing well, Monaghan is one of those guys who can still please you while he runs into the nefarious deal of kidnapping from death and other favorite genres like Perlman and Angus Scrimm on the scene of this very funny movie for fans . <br /> <br /> It also boasts a unique and favorable design and appearance, sometimes passing from the Comic EC style panels in live action (to the Creepshow) and always somehow feeling quite authentic in its Hammer Horror atmosphere . Maybe everything is covered by so much dry ice, but this is not the point. Whatever was done to capture everything on the film, it works. Works well. <br /> <br /> It may not have any real fear but this film has a great vein of black humor and certainly absorbs every minute of its execution time in macabre material that should please all those who have the patience for the horror is a little quieter and it seems that it could have been done in Hammer's time. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: The Flesh And The Fiends, The Doctor And The Devils.
