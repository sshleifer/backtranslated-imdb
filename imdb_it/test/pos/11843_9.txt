Joe (Wes) and Jim (Adam) accompany us with beauty, isolation (both psychological and physical) and the total terror of "killing most birds" in the southwest of Navaho. Characterizations, settings and plot continue to build ... although sometimes personal accesses let us want "more" ... with some interesting alternatives about "who did it?" Flashbacks (such as Peter Fonda ... nice to see it) provide clues, but they don't go where you might think. Comic book assistants (such as the preacher) are mild and appropriate. Where "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" begin to drag ... "Thief" engages the clutch and the four wheels around the next corner, never sure what's going on. Disagree with Joe Leaphorn's crazy comment to Jim Chee to "slow down" for the holes. Wrong ... there are no holes in the plot, only traces to follow. Towards the next episode! Excellent photography (as always), catchy characters and much more to explore!
