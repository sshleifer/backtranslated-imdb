I saw this movie when it was a participation in the Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy movie! The representation of a completely dysfunctional family taken to another extreme level, could have left me depressed to the extreme, had it not been for very funny sight gags and dialogues along the way that lightened the general tone of the film. The relatively "uplifting" ending gave hope to those affected by the initial tragedy. However, I didn't leave the theater to go to a fun party. The film stayed with me for several days. <br /> <br /> Reported memories of "Ordinary People", but with humor mixed with tragedy. I thought the acting was excellent, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsh. The way each character dealt with the tragedy was sometimes sad, counterproductive, but sometimes funny. Intelligent dialogues and situations.
