This is a movie I saw when I was a girl and I never forgot. It is certainly not the best film that has ever been made, but there is something very special about it that I cannot understand. I love it. I am the kind of person who likes everything to explain to me and for this reason alone this movie makes me crazy. <br /> <br /> Exactly what / who is that mysterious witch and what is her relationship with Tom? WHY AND HOW Did he become a Water Baby ... why did he grow up on earth? These are questions like these that are just eating me! I thought that if I had read the book I would have had answers, but I just read an article about the fact that the book from which this story is "based" is very different. So I guess I'll never know what the writer was thinking! <br /> <br /> I love this movie and I've seen it recently with my two-year-old niece. She loves it too, even if she insists on calling it "Baby Water" for reasons unknown to me. He loves the part where he jumps into the water and then declares "I'm all clean". (You have to understand that my niece is the cleanest of 2 years in the world!) We watched that scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more films like this. (But what happens with the gay seahorse !!)
