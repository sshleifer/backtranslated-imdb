You don't have to be too critical about the director's second feature. <br /> <br /> I really like working with Madiba's camera. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things. <br /> <br /> However, why did a 14-year-old boy take such beautiful pictures? Remember that you have not received any education of any kind. I don't think English is the common language in the ghettos of Cape Town. Worse still, Madiba seems even smaller than her supposed age of 14. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you go beyond the peculiarities mentioned above, you can watch the movie and enjoy it again thanks to the good shooting work.
