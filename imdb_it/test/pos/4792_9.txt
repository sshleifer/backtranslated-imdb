Nerazzurri story of a trampled priest, Nazarin shows the economy that Luis Bunuel was able to get in telling a deeply humanistic fable with a minimum of fuss. As it came out of its Mexican film production era, it was an invaluable talent to possess, with little money and extremely tight schedules. Nazarin, however, overcomes many of Bunuel's previous Mexican films in terms of acting (Francisco Rabal is excellent), fiction and theme. <br /> <br /> The theme, interestingly, is something that has been explored again in Viridiana, made three years later in Spain. It concerns the individual's struggle for humanity and altruism in a society that rejects any notion of virtue. Father Nazarin, however, is portrayed more sympathetically than Sly Viridian. While the latter seems to choose charity because it wants to atone for its (perceived) sins, the whole existence of Nazarin and the reason for it seems to be to help others, whether they (or we) like it or not. The last scenes of the film, in which he questions his behavior and, in a fraction of a second, has to choose between the life he has led or the conventional life that is expected of a priest, are so exciting because they concern his integrity moral and we are never quite sure if it will remain intact or not. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film and I will invite anyone interested in classic cinema to look for it. It is one of Bunuel's most moving films and contains many of his obsessions: frustrated desire, crazy love, religious hypocrisy and so on. In my opinion, Nazarin is second only to "The exterminating angel", in terms of Mexican films, and it is certainly near the top of Bunuel's total film production list.
