I really enjoyed this movie. You can't buy it, rent it or find it ... but it's a custodian. <br /> <br /> Wonderful chemistry between Braccho and Walken ... and Ferrar .... <br /> <br /> Action and extraordinary reactions without pause .... I liked it. <br /> <br /> I've seen my pirated copy maybe 6 times in the last decade ... each time showing it to someone who has never heard of it. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it. <br /> <br /> So many movies are on TV again and again, without the irony and style of this little movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't know it was made for TV. .. my copy is a track that I pirated years ago ... I hope it lasts.
