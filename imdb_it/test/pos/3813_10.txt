Obviously previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this is done quite well. <br /> <br /> He is very cute and intelligent. This story reminded me of the types of girls I was in love with as a child. <br /> <br /> Also, I want to take a look at some of Nadia's other films, many YouTube comments on how sexy she is in this video. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say that this Brad is trying to rob him. <br /> <br /> He is simply jumping in and adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate. "I like what he does and he does it well," said nuff!
