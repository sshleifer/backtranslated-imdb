The film begins with an irritable old Broadway producer (exceptionally well played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) led by a man who hopes to sell him a story for an upcoming opera. However, there is a bad storm and their car gets stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for a place to spend the night. Fortunately, there is a villa nearby even though it seems rather strange that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize that this was the home of a man he knew (and scorned). However, while this seems like a bad and invented script, it is not .... since this is part of an elaborate cunning of the writer to make the plot act in a group of actors at home. However, halfway between the ploy, the producer and his stinging assistant understand that the mystery of the homicide taking place is false and he thinks the whole thing is pretty funny. What no one realizes, however, is that an escaped maniac is free and is about to enter this little fictional plot - creating wonderful twists. So when there seems to be a real murder, the actors are really terrified while Carle and her assistant are convinced it's all a joke. While I explained part of the plot, there are many other aspects of the film that you will have to understand on your own - and it is definitely for you to entertain and guess. <br /> <br /> Considering that this is a public domain B-movie, I certainly don't have very high hopes for this little movie. However, it thrilled me when the film turned out to be a much better than average film - with a very interesting and innovative twist in the plot of the old cliche on a dark and stormy night spent in a villa. Moreover, while the film's plot was very good, the dialogue was even better, with a lot of brilliant spirit and a pleasant and light rhythm. Full of pleasant surprises and worth it.
