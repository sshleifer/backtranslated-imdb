I liked to see Squire Trelane make a circle around the crew in this episode, even if after a while the whole thing seemed a little too long. Of course, the histrionics were a little funny for a while, and the ending was a good way to wrap the whole thing. I think the problem was that I liked to see Trelane when it was full of bravado and fun, the fun seemed to vanish when Trelane became vindictive and evil. It's about a mood killer - passing from the unpleasant but affable guest to the guy who sentenced Kirk to death! But despite this, the episode was pleasant and worth my time. For the die-hard Trekkies, this is a must-see, for others it's just a nice run of the mill one.
