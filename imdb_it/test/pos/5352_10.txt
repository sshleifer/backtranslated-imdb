Having just returned from my third vision of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought of it. I noticed that many Englishmen loved him, while those in America did not understand him. This is not a shock at all, because America does not understand what "English" is. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are very English. In fact, bourgeois English, with a pinch of eccentricity, fits in well. The film looks a lot like our two heroes; simple and unpretentious. It has a beautiful and gentle texture, so children do not get lost, yet there is enough meat to keep even adults amused. There is some allusion to the light (which seems to have offended the evangelical - oh noes, drama!) But there is nothing more rude than a fund for a brief moment. When people are offended by a plasticine anus, you know the world is messed up ... <br /> <br /> A brief note to those (all Americans so far I've seen) who think Chicken Run is a Best Movie: Chicken Run was created to accommodate your sense of humor, and I think it suffered because of it. The curse of Were Rabbit is witty, English and intelligent. Thomas The Tank Engine's film was ruined because it was made to please the Americans and I'm glad Nick Park didn't let it happen to another big British institution. <br /> <br /> To summarize: you can keep your chicken Run, your Shreks, your Madagasgas - that sort of raw, coarse, slapstick comedy is not comparable to the wit and grace that is Wallace and Gromit in Curse of the werewolf rabbit. English at the center, and for a long time Wallace and Gromit remain so.
