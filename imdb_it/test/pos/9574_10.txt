This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. However, I laughed louder in many films. This is because the genius of Best In Show is not found in slapstick or one-liner, but in a sophisticated and layered verbal spirit. The impromptu dialogue is so fast that you end up laughing not for every single joke, but only until several jokes are built on each other, each disarming your senses until the jokes don't culminate and you can't help to release . <br /> <br /> It is a well-made film, but what makes it extraordinary is the acting. I was impressed by my first vision, but when I saw it after learning that practically all the scenes are improvised, I was amazed. It was really nice to see the comedians work on each other, build jokes out of nowhere and completely immerse themselves in their characters. I guess the golden days of Second City were like that.
