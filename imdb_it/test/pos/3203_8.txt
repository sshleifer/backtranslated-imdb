The Killing Yard is a great movie, although not uniform at times. Morris Chestnut makes a phenomenal effort as a prisoner mentally injured and tried in court, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense lawyer is nothing but genius. The excitement and harsh reality portrayed in the "flashback" scenes of this film have the ability to put viewers directly in the middle of the events represented. I wasn't even born when the Attica uprising took place, however, through thorough research, I found that "The Killing Yard" makes the story of all its just equals. I highly recommend this film for viewing by any educational group or activist as a much-needed learning tool.
