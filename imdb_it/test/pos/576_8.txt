I give them 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic. It is also directed by the legendary stone hunter Robert W Morgan who also plays the part of Jarvis in the film. Listening to the recent blogtalkradio show called AARF show (Robert Morgan is a co-presenter), he says that it has become a cult classic and fits well with film and similar conventions, but there are plans to make a sequel to this movie . I think he said that two of the original stars have signed and he hopes to have some more. Robert is a good man and I hope he does well. He has dedicated over 50 years of tireless work as a researcher Sassquatch (which is also one of my interests) and author. Check out his paranormal show and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II in the near future.
