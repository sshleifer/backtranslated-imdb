Fun movie that gives you romance, psychodrama on the stage, workplace, sexual harassment, adultery and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long-time employee of a bitch who feels the need to be one because she is with older boys. Hope Lange is the ambitious entry level employee, determined to reach the top using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives are the subplot. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe for the movie is great, but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairdresser that "he'll do you some makeup!" The amount of Brylcream in Stephen Boyd's hair sometimes distracts. His character's relationship with the character of Lange has never been fully developed, which I found disappointing. Overall, the film is fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
