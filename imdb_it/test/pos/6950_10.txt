This is an incredibly compelling story, told with great simplicity and grace. The story itself is the subject of the film, although the scenery is beautiful. Acting is undervalued, even superbly, because the characters themselves come in all their eccentric simplicity. <br /> <br /> This artwork will probably not be appreciated by those who see films "accidentally", without the due attention. It takes work to be brought into history, but once you're involved, the capture is complete!
