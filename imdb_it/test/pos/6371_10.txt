I loved the complete savages! Why did they delete it anyway? They should have done a second season and so on ... God! They always cancel the good shows ... and leave all the boring things. Nothing interesting on TV because Complete Savages has disappeared. This show was a great idea. A single firefighter father with five crazy children and a lazy dog ​​... Each of them has his madness in that house. TJ is always the child ... always the smallest ... Kyle makes a jump! Break everything it touches! He's always in punishment, he always does the wrong things ... But anyway, he's so funny with all the things he does. Sam is the smart one. He is always shy and stupid when it comes to girls ... He ends up going out with Angela. Chris is the sporty guy who doesn't have much to do with school, study and things like that. It's always fun And finally ... Jack! The rock of the show. The oldest of all, the macho, "the rock star" ... But still, crazy like everyone else. Nick is ... helpless with these guys. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy ... He's the man! He's like a 30-year-old child. It's like doing the same stupid things that kids are doing. I always wondered why he became a fireman ... And the dog is the image of the whole Savage family. The fact is ... this show has had everything to become something really big. He had everything, man! But of course ... they deleted it ...
