I went to this thinking another gross film with humor. I say from my first sentence that I don't like that humor and this movie has had moments but I love it. Justin Long has never done such a comedy, where he is sarcastic and intelligent and I loved it. Lewis Black .... quite told. The ending that I really loved because it had to be taken seriously, I mean how else would you end it? Yes, it's another loser story, but not in your typical format and the film was not their ups and downs, they were the people who came together for a common goal, to go to college where they were accepted. The cast was fantastic and yes, I laughed out loud when I didn't think about it and the laughter lasted longer, then I thought. The parents and the sister played their roles well but their characters were inserted when necessary. The film was not focused on them but at the same time they showed up when expected and didn't expect them to. They played the story very well, and I loved the familiar faces of Anthony Heald (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long), Ross Patterson (The New Guy) and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added something to the film that made it even more enjoyable, as did B's Friends. I recommend this film to anyone who has hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really wants something with humor and a real plot! ~!
