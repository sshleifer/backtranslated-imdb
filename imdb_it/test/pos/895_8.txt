Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There she is welcomed by a couple and by other couples who swing. They are all in this huge tourist hotel with a giant swimming pool. One evening they have a pool party complete with "real" native dancers. It is very politically correct and very kitsch. Later, Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be in one of those drive-through-stay-in-the-car safaris (although the photography is beautiful). During the film, Emanuelle is persecuting every man she meets. Photography is very well done in this film. There are scenes with waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. The film deserves to be seen only for the soundtrack of Nico Fidenco.
