Lucio Fulci has made a lot of great films over the course of his career and the way in which many of them have been protagonists of a bucket laden with blood has led him to achieve the title of 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Do not Torture an in Duckling was done before Fulci became famous among the gurus, and it is not so bloody; it's definitely a brave and unpleasant little thriller and, for my money, the best movie Fulci has ever made! Do not Torture a Duckling is really a cut above a lot of the Yellow genre in terms of production values ​​and, unlike many of Fulci's subsequent films, everything about this Yellow is great. The plot focuses on a small rustic community where corpses have started to appear. Murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. Shortly after the police convicted an innocent man for crimes, a journalist named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders alone. Martelli soon encountered various suspects, including a sexy young woman named Patricia, a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoyed making wax effigies and pins inside. <br /> <br /> Even if this film may not have a lot of cold blood, it has two of Fulci's ugliest sequences to remedy. The worst thing is that a woman is brutally massacred by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rocks during the descent is likely to turn the stomachs. Do not Torture a Duckling presents an absolutely exceptional Italian cast. Barbara Bouchet (one of my favorite favorites) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia, and manages to flex her acting muscles more than she did in many subsequent films. Tomas Millian is excellent as usual, while the rest of the cast is well done by Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel. The cinematography on show is amazing and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression of putting a lot of attention and commitment into every scene. The story unfolds slowly, and it is always interesting since Fulci never allows the film to stray too far from the central plot. There is not much mystery about the identity of the murderer; but Fulci can almost make us guess until the end and Do not Torture a Duckling reaches its climax. Overall, it's a shame that Fulci hasn't produced more films like this. Do not Torture a Duckling is his best job out and I insist that all the fans of Yellow see it!
