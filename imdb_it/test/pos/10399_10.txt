Beyond The Clouds is a beautifully beautiful and elegiac work of art. The general softness of the light in which this film is immersed makes you want to touch the screen. The autumnal mood evoked could only be achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience. Or, to put it another way, an old man. I don't know of other films that capture and use the softness of light and the seasonal mood with a quality as fascinating as Beyond The Clouds. Almost all the people in this film are beautiful, unless your idea of ​​a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond child, that is. The dialogue does not really matter, not that there is much anyway, and as for the plots, forget it. Some films exist only as visual experiences, this is one of them. Don't worry if you want a "simple entertainment", this is not for you. <br /> <br /> I could get excited about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but I won't. If you are interested in cinematography, photography, film direction, etc., watch this film.
