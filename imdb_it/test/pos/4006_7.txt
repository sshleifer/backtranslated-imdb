I can't hate on the show. When the old (and better) tech TV had to hit the bricks, the canal was reformatted and new shows entered. "Attack of the Show" is the replacement for Screen Savers, with 3 roommates in the beginning. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran was also a co-host, but mostly he performed mainly pre-recorded pieces. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and eventually there was a competition to see who would be the third guest, but that didn't work for some reason. <br /> <br /> In the end (I just learned this from this board a lot more IMDb) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran went ahead because (hey, this is what I read) the two got married. This was a big secret for me! Now there is a new co-host, the non-hot (my opinion) Olivia Munn. He hides something in those tops he wears, while Sarah Lane has a perfect body and is not afraid to show it. <br /> <br /> AHEM! Sorry. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Show" takes care of everything young people want to know. It's music, movies, comics, internet and television. That's the beauty of the show. If you don't want to worry about scouring the net or wasting time looking at MTV, you can get everything you want on AOTS. Some segments and bits that they do are fun. They have regular guests and contributors in the industry, as well as guests ranging from petty internet stars to real big names. <br /> <br /> Although the hosts are not as geeky as I would like them to be, I still found "Attack of the Show" to be fun, even with his latest lineup.
