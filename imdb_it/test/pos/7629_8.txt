The Last Dinosaur was one of those seventh-year movies from the late 1970s that was pretty exciting for the time, particularly for fans of Japanese Tokusatsu movies. Initially planned for a theatrical distribution (around when the Dino King Kong was released in the previous December) it was suddenly pulled and turned into a movie of ABC's Friday week. Rankin Bass, who was no stranger to Japanese co-productions, was the gun behind this production, co-produced with Tsuburaya Productions of Japan - the people who brought Ultraman in various forms. Performed mainly by an American cast including the late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and the late Steven Keats, he told the story of a prehistoric bag of time in what used to be a volcanic caldera overheated somewhere in the icy arctic circle containing dinosaurs. It looks a lot like the films The Land Unknown (1956) and The Land That Time Forgot (1975) in a sentimental way. Of course, the dinosaurs were boys in suits (A Triceratops with the knees in front!) But they were shot in such a way, the music and the soundtrack were so well made, and the cast did a good job that didn't matter much to many We grew up on Godzilla. The film has a lot of class, from the opening soundtrack of Nancy Wilson "The Last Dinosaur" to the general feeling of the film - the locations in the hot springs of northern Japan were excellent and lush - and the undeniable feeling of Kaiju Eiga to it . There are some incredible pieces: the "bone yard" of the T-Rex and a shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see the T-Rex eating a giant fish from a stream. The FX of Tsuburaya have done their job with style and, apart from some opaque shots, they do their job well. This film is considered the best film of the '70s "kaiju" from Japan, even in the five Godzilla films made during that decade. Rankin Bass has made many other co-productions with Tsuburaya supplying the creatures or the miniatures - The Bermuda Depths (1978) and The Ivory Ape (1980) - but neither has lived up to the epic aspect of this film.
