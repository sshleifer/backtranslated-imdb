Dallas plays Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. It is directed by Stuart Heisler, the photograph is by Ernest Haller and the pen assignments were assigned to John Twist. Produced by Warner Brothers, Dallas is vividly filmed in Technicolor from Iverson & Warner ranches in California. Very much a film with the tongue firmly in the mouth, the film is a return to the past of a western that exists without pretensions or deep meanings. <br /> <br /> The plot sees Cooper's Civil War renegade, Blayde "Reb" Hollister, fake his own death in order to kill his reputation and free himself from the pursuit of his slain brothers in Dallas family. In essence, a routine plot, Twist's story is revived along the way by many hilarious and exciting diversions. There are role reversals, dandy fashions, horse races, shootings, a love triangle, vigorous dialogues and little twists to keep the piece purely from painting with numbers. <br /> <br /> Cooper also seems to have fun, which further improves the wellness factor on offer. It is true that he is not really asked to do anything more than be a laconic guy on a mission. But when called for the duties of action, he delivers the goods his fans expected during his successful career. The bad guys entertain (in particular Bryant Marlow, the vile and tired of Steve Cochran) because everyone has his little sins to prevent him from ignoring the bland. The two women of the piece look beautiful and hold well in the midst of machismo, while the high production value allows Haller to really treat the eyes with the lush Technicolor and involves the shooting work around the locations. <br /> <br /> has the ideals to be a list A Oater makes Dallas, something it fails to reach. But it is not for lack of attempts and the end result is one of pure entertainment, which, in reality, should be enjoyed on a cold day of winters when the viewer needs to catch me. 7/10
