If you haven't seen it yet, you really should, on DVD. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it! It's incredibly realistic and believable. True, a lot is speculated, and I would have liked to know more about what was speculative and what were proven facts (there are not many), but it handles everything pretty well with a "Cruel Mother Nature" theme. It will remind you of the nature programs you saw on Animal Planet and Discovery Channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. They act naturally; they eat, kill, couple, play and fight for survival. In fact, you'll find yourself rooting for some of them and others. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the effects are excellent. Sometimes they will seem a bit too similar to the CGI ones, but then you will see them at a different angle which will make them more realistic. In some cases, you will truly believe that you have seen a dinosaur. My favorites were the Coelophysis, the birds of prey, the diplodocus, the iguana, the allosaurus and the biped arctic. I was still disappointed by the T-Rex, which at times seemed a bit too computer-generated. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should definitely see this production. It's educational, well done and a lot of fun. For what it is, it's an A!
