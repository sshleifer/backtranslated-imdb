This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarves, tea and English pubs, the culture of American weapons, divorce and marriage; however, he manages to be sensitive to the problems surrounding each one. Kathy Bates is "Incredible" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of an impressive range, she brings her remarkable comic talent to merge this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedians like Dan Akroid in the role of Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the plot is as intriguing as it is to entertain. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, a homosexual singer murdered by a killer crossed in Chicago. His valet lover Dirk Simpson, played by extraordinary Rupert Everett, has to overcome Victor's brothers, including Lynn Redgrave, who wants to turn their home into a tribute museum, and collaborates with Bates and his dwarf daughter-in-law, Maudy Beasley to find the killer among the homeless in Chicago. <br /> <br /> The entire cast sings at various points in the chase, and is excellent, esp. the talent of Price and Bates. This implausible plot, both funny and bizarre, is one of the most out of center films. Cameos of Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow and Sally Jesse Raphael should tell you how bizarre this movie is. Strange, funny and off-center but with a good perspective on people with all kinds of differences.
