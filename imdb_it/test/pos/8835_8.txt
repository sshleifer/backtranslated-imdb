The history of TV for film adaptations is full of aberrations that prove almost conclusively that tradition should never be started in the first place. There are, however, some examples that manage to do it, right. At first, Rising Damp would seem to be the ultimate sitcom for the big screen treatment, as this hilarious series was based on the tiny boundaries of a Nordic studio. Even the writer, Eric Chappell, was not paid enough to spend time creating a completely original script, so he picked up a series of TV episodes and put them together to form the body of the film. This in itself did not necessarily mean that the script would fail. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same thing with their script for Dad's Army and it worked great. Although, the episodes of Dad's first army, with their steady rhythm and arched plot, lent themselves much better to film adaptation. The Rising Damp episodes, however, were high energy deals from the first scene to the breathless climax. As a result, when a story is finished and another part has begun, the scenes within the film become disconnected. Another pitfall for the film version of a TV series are the inevitable comparisons that are made. In this regard the film pales in comparison to the brilliant Rising Damp series. Despite all this, Rising Damp the Movie manages to be fun and sometimes funny. Perhaps it is not surprising that the best moments occur during sequences written specifically for the film. This includes a rugby match in which Rossiter makes a brilliantly timed crater. In fact, while all the casts manage their roles to perfection (excluding a standard substitute substitute for the deceased and a really great Beckinsale), it is Leonard Rossiter in the role of Rigsby who shines the most. In fact, Rising Damp should have been realized as a film only because Rossiter could have been admitted to an Oscar, such is the magnificence of his acting talent. Criminally, he was not even named. Ultimately, the film fails to match the dizzying heights of the TV series, managing to hold the comparison as a comedy in its own right with some wonderfully reproduced moments. Recommended view. <br /> <br /> One last thing: the opening and closing music is by far the worst in the history of cinema.
