This is a really great movie! Makes you think about your parents. As we all have fragile relationships that we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as importantly, we should remember to open and show them our true self, not just who we think they want us to be. Surely you see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they publish my comment, how strange. Online comments usually need to be brief and I'm asked to write more! Well, I went to watch the movie with my parents, I thought that afterwards they wanted to talk about their parents, but my father kept wanting to talk about himself and things in his life he felt screwed, which was unusual, my Father is not a reticent man, but he surprised me that he wanted to talk about the mistakes he thinks he made. Mike and Kitty came to the film to do a Q&A and there was a hilarious moment later when my dad was talking to Mike while my mom was talking to Kitty! Actually, ignore my last sentences to fill this comment and just remember "Birch Street, 51", go see it!
