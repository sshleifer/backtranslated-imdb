Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was very excited to see this film on the Vancouver International Film Festival list. This film has some great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a "not so well known" London. <br /> <br /> The film is set completely in "dark" colors, which I personally don't like so much. Furthermore, the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes became a bit flat. In addition to this, there are some great comments from Londoners and excellent shots. FINISTERRE does not glorify London by showing all the great attractions of the city, but it gives an insight into what London really is. From the East End to the vibrant center with its music scene as well as the "small special retreats" for Londoners. <br /> <br /> All in all: <br /> <br /> + Great Soundtrack + Nice shots + great insights <br /> <br /> - Storytelling - Watch to watch sometimes - Very dark image <br /> <br /> Worth watching! I give him a 7/10
