Who will love my children has changed my heart, made me cry all the way, the most I cried was when the family had to say goodbye to the child, I shouted more with that, and every time a child was adopted , I cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother, it was sad for them to lose their mother, I was sorry for the child with epilepsy, I was happy that he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. For me that boy I thought was the special one because he was going to a house. I feel that I am special because I am in a world with Aspergers Syndrome and, sometimes, when I feel down, sometimes I like to cry. I really enjoyed this film, 10 out of 10. A true story, very good. Another film that will bring tears to your eyes I think it should be Tuesday's With Morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
