Although I'm not crazy about musicals, COVER GIRL is a pleasure for classic film lovers and especially for Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly fans. The film could be dated by today's standards and the story and the songs may not be anything special, but the musical numbers are beautifully staged and there is an exceptional cast for the film. Furthermore, the film is a worthy presentation for Rita Hayworth fans ... it's simply breathtaking in glorious Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Despite Jerome Kern's collaboration with the film, his music is not as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), however the songs serve the film well. The dance is nothing short of excellent, especially for the number of Gene Kelly and my favorite musical number, "Alter-Ego Dance". The funny Phil Silvers almost steals the movie as Kelly's companion. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden and Edward Brophy perform well in their dramatic supporting roles. And Rita plays a sweet, charming girl here; a role that is very different from his femme fatale in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a delightful movie that is worth watching even if you're not big on musicals. Yet the film's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite vintage songwriters, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter, wrote songs for this film. However, it is the glorious Technicolor cinematography and imaginative dance that are the true delicacies of the film's production. <br /> <br /> While watching Rita Hayworth do her thing, I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful or graceful red dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powell's masterpiece THE RED SHOES (1948) . Watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.
