Doctor Who is fantastic. It is everyone's cup of tea ". It must be. The boys will love the monsters and the action and the adventure and the girls will like the emotions and the feelings that they run. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was extraordinary like Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is also so witty and funny and he is so nice to look at. <br /> <br /> But now Billie if n "she's gone and Rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on-off boyfriend Mickey and her mother and father (he died when Rose was small, but this Pete Tyler is from the Parallel universe.) It will be very strange with Martha to be the new companion, as I've always seen only with Rose (In addition to the bride on the run with Catherine Tate). <br /> <br /> Freema is better to be good !!! <br /> <br /> But nobody can beat Rose !!!
