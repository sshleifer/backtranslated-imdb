Betty is a substitute for the lead role in a production of Verdi's Macbeth. When a car mysteriously arrives in command, Betty is pushed into the spotlight. The opening night is a resounding success and Betty decides to leave the after-party to celebrate in private with her boyfriend. But when the boy leaves the room, Betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown black masked masked figure. The unknown assailant ties Betty to a column, torments her and puts needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain if Betty closes them. The boy returns to the room and is stunned to see Betty in such a difficult situation. He is even more shocked when the killer grabs him and sticks a knife through his lower jaw with such force, the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth. And Betty was forced to look at all this. Thus begins the terrifying trial of Betty with a murderer not only intent on harming her, but also forcing her to watch as she mutilates her friends. <br /> <br /> The work is classified as Yellow, but for me it differs from the model in some ways. Less emphasis is placed on the mysterious elements of history rather than on something like the Darkness of Silver or the bird with crystal plumage. The killer masked with the black glove can be omnipresent, but the hints and red herring normally associated with a good Yellow are absent. Instead, Opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and makes the public feel uncomfortable. The focus is on the gruesome scenes of death, Betty's fear and the murderer's obsession with Betty. <br /> <br /> Opera presents what I think are some of the most artistic death scenes in Argento. When the killer grabs Betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you're sure Betty has it. But does the sadistic killer just want to force Betty to watch while he brutally stabs her lover in the neck ?? the knife that emerged in his mouth. It is a well designed and designed scene. And those needles in the eyes ?? brilliant. Or take the dressmaker's death. At the beginning his death seems an ordinary and trivial murder. But when the seamstress accidentally swallows the assassin's medallion, what started out as another death scene turns it into a spell while the killer uses a pair of scissors to open her throat to get her chain. Finally, is there the most famous death scene in Opera that surprises me every time I see it? Mira is hit in the eye while peeking through a keyhole. That scene shows a lot of what I like about Argento. It has style to burn. Although implausible, it is creative, memorable, and an explosion to watch. <br /> <br /> Silver was certainly not the first Italian director to focus on eye mutilation, but in Opera he traumatized his eyes a new level. The needles that keep the eyes open, a bullet in the eyes and the crows that peck an eye are all part of the vision of Argento (pun intended). And these scenes have the effect that I believe that Argento was going to. The first time I saw the killer putting those needles in Betty's eyes, I couldn't stop blinking. It actually had a physical effect on me. What are the eyes that make them so the target of abuse in Italian films? <br /> <br /> To be honest (and not sound like a fan), there are problems with Opera that prevent me from classifying it as the best in Silver. One of my problems is with the air duct system that runs through Betty's apartment building. While I do not doubt that there are air duct systems in old apartment buildings that connect the apartments, the Opera ducts are HUGE. I'm not an expert, but I sincerely doubt that any building like this one had a gigantic air duct. It doesn't seem practical at all. And don't you think someone would do something about them a long time ago to keep criminals and nosy neighbors away from the other apartments? It's convenient for the plot, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I suppose my main problem with the film comes with the ending. What happens to that ending? It seems totally out of place, attacked and like a bad second thoughts. I'm not sure what else to say except it's horrible.
