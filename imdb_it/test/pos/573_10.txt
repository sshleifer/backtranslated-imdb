I absolutely loved this movie. For me, the best reason to see it is how strong the contrast is to legal dramas like "Boston Legal" or "Ally McBeal" or even "Law Law". This is reality. The law is not BS, won in some conclusive discussions or through some ridiculous defense that is torn from your butt, like the "Chewbacca defense" in South Park. and the work of the lawyers GOOD - not the shyster stereotype, which uses all its abilities to correct it. It will do more to restore your faith in the humanity of any film by Frank Capra or TO KILL A BABY MOTHER. And above all, I cried. During the movie, during the featurette included at the end of the DVD - it's incredible. Wonderful movie; wonderfully done. Thank God, the filmmakers did it.
