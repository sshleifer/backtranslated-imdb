I grew up in New York City and every afternoon ABC showed the 4:30 movie - Saratoga Trunk was one of the first movies I remember seeing as a child. I loved this movie and stayed with me for years. I recently looked at it again and always thought it was great - maybe I'm just a romantic - but I thought it was well done. I don't want to say that this film was good only for the main actors - I didn't really know who they were when I saw this film for the first time - I guess I just played quality as a child. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I particularly loved seeing old New Orleans during the time of this film. If you have the chance to visit New Orleans, you should watch the films showing the city at that time - when you see some of the old houses in the French Quarter (not just Bourbon Street) or uptown, you can really imagine life as it was 100 Years ago. <br /> <br /> I love old movies - this is a good film for me !!
