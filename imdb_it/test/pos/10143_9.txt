The Man Who Knew Too Much {1956} is a remake of a film that Alfred Hitchcock made in England in 1934 of the same name. In my opinion, his last effort is far superior. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and does not have the tingling suspense of the original with Peter Lorre. In both films the plot is essentially the same, except that the original is set in Switzerland and the remake in Marrakech. It tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on vacation with their young son and meeting with a suspicious man, who is very curious about their past. It happens to be an agent who is looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader. Then he is stabbed in a Marrakeck market because he is discovered to be a spy, and he continues to fall into Stewart's arms. Dying, he tells him the whole story of the murder story. Stewart and Day discover that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and kidnapped their son. The film contains excellent performances by Stewart and Day, in a drastic dramatic role, as worried and frightened parents. This film showed that Doris Day could act in suspenseful plays and carefree musicals. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is top notch. The film keeps you at the edge of your seat every minute. The scene in Albert Hall is a classic. The original is so slow and sad. I don't know how people can compare the two. Watch the remake and you'll have fun. I give the film a 9 of 10.
