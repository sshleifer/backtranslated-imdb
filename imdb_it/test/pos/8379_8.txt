Hong Kong, 1920s. A young man of poor origins dreams of being a hero and spends most of his time training and learning kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's wishes. Help a service girl escape from a ruthless businessman, whose followers then come after them, and terrify the young uncle's noodle restaurant. The uncle turns out to be an old assassin of the reformed triad, who now helps the young man become skilled in martial arts. It is a true Karate Kid style with "wash the wok" instead of "waxing, melting". The villain of kung fu is the son of a ruthless businessman, who has a style of scorpion that seems interesting even if it is quite silly and certainly completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But the story, which develops over time, has an epic touch, good characterization, great kung fu and is generally very funny. The young hero is very nice and provides a good protagonist to cheer for. The romantic dimension remains undeveloped, which is a bit disappointing. Otherwise a good movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10.
