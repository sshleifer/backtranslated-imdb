I was surprised when I watched this film, how much it had "chained me". No, the actors didn't behave like the typical "Hollywood" actors, but it's not always so bad, as this film shows. Quite different from the Disney standard, it's a refreshing turn anyway! They also give you a taste of what was probably like being without being "educational". A film that everyone should see and enjoy. Many people like to discuss "accuracy" in any film of this type, but only the basic idea has a lot to offer. Slight complaint; East and west Germany, seen on any map, would have west Germany on the left side, east on the right. The film sometimes takes you back slightly, because about half of the scenes have West Germany on the right side of the screen and other times on the left side. Even during the same events, they move back and forth. Perhaps, just a little more coherence would have avoided this slight distraction. Go see it!
