I saw it last night and it was fantastic. I can understand why some ppl have bad feelings towards a rugby fan and Maori culture point of view, but other than that I have no idea what's so bad about it. The film is fantastic. He has a lot of heart. Very stimulating and encouraging for all ages. Great family movie! They did a good job considering it was a cheap movie. I love movies based on true stories / events. I grew up playing rugby all my life, it's a great game but I was never really taken because (please forgive me if I offend someone, nothing personal is just what I saw it) I thought, their workouts didn't they are so ruthless or hard, the players are not so disciplined and they don't seem as serious as the other sportsmen and they all seem to be muscles and flowers facing each other, etc. But after watching Forever, I was like, wow! I was proud! He did good things for rugby (well, he changed my vision of rugby) and also the new Zealnd Haka. I actually cried. I'm not even a New Zealander and I was proud of their culture. I didn't even know what the song meant to the film. The film is NOT about rugby or rugby techniques, it does not even concern the New Zealand All Blacks or the Haka or others ... ...... Mother of pearl !!!!! hahaha SHUX! <br /> <br /> So to you all beautiful negative ppl, you miss the point! I'm sure if they had the means, it would have been better, the haka is there because it was part of the culture, tradition or whatever you want to call. <br /> <br /> So any new member on this site like me, please don't be put off by those negative comments. Watch it for you! Must see the movie! There is a lot to learn from this film, of all ages. It surely makes you want to be a better person and to be humble! This film reminded me of a lot of things I already know and grew up with, but I got lost on the way! I love! Good ppls reading and all the best! <br /> <br /> Muawha!
