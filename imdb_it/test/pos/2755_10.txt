In my opinion, Flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego. He was disrespectful to his dance partner, he tried to undermine everyone and he was not aware of the spirit of Riverdance. He's fine he left the show. Colin Dunne, the new male protagonist, is superb, and when he and Jean Butler dance together, the magic happens! The music of Eileen Ivers is amazing (like the percussion by Noel Eccles), and "Fire Dance" by Maria Pages is worth the price of admission! When Pages and Ivers get together, towards the end of the show for a musical duet, well, it's a real treasure. I agree, the editing is not free, but no technical gap can put an end to this extraordinary tour de force. This is the one to get. There has never been anything like Riverdance! This is the real one!
