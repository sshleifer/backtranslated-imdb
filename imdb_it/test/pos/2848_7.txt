* spoiler * * spoiler * * spoiler * I found the movie funny. It was strange and I enjoy it, I laughed a lot, so the end result is that I recommend the film. However, I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say. the plot is very simple. Betty (Renee Zellweger), a tough house wife watching her husband being killed and while she forgot all she had seen, followed her "true love" for a character in the soap series, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear ). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95-minute movie. And here comes the big question. What's the movie about? The reference to "The Wizard of Oz" is obvious. Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas, but while Dorothy arrives at the end of that film to the conclusion that "there is no place like home", Betty does not reach any conclusion and at the end of the film we have to wonder what she learned from the his experience and the answer is simply nothing. It doesn't seem to concern you at all. <br /> <br /> Than is the film about the difference between reality and fantasy? it could be, but the scenes that deal with this topic are short and no longer serve as a joke and not as a serious plot that can bring the film to other places (and among other things "The Truman Show" has addressed this subject in a much better way. <br /> <br /> The movie may be about the obsession Betty is obsessed with the soap series and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty.LaBute shows two sides of the obsession and seems to forget that the obsession, in any form is dangerous, and should be condemned. Seems to have sympathy for Betty's obsession because he sees it as harmless. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film we have scenes that in itself may have been a subject for an entire film, but we are left to think about it without having an impact on the characters. <br /> <br /> The ending is simply a trick that has nothing to do with what we have seen before. pity because the film could have been sharper if he concentrated on one or two subjects. As it is, it is a lot but in reality they do not say anything. <br /> <br /> What remains is the feeling of having seen a little movie, funny and strange that could have been much more.
