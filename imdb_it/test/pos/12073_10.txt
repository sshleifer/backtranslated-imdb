I have nothing but praise for this film and the cast, especially Ann Margaret. But more importantly, I praise my in-laws who were (are) the adoptive parents of Warren and Frank in real life. I met most of the "kids" at Warren's wedding in 1989. This is an incredible story and it's even more incredible for me to know the family and what everyone has experienced. It's also nice for me to see how my in-laws were portrayed in the film. It was pretty accurate. My wife even likes to see some small details like a toaster that she remembered from her childhood. Yes, it's a difficult movie to watch, but so surprising and heartfelt. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this story to me is the way many of the children have gone through my in-laws and, as a result of marrying their daughter and having Warren as a brother-in-law, how many people I met in my. In the last 20 years this story has been part of my life because of what my mother-in-law shared with me. That and knowing Warren. For what it's worth, Warren lives in California with his family. He married his high school girlfriend, with whom he reconnected to his 20-year high school meeting. <br /> <br /> There was a show in the 1980s entitled "That's Incredible". They had a family meeting that also got to meet the cast of the show. <br /> <br /> For everyone's interest, the DVD is available in the UK and Australia. It's a difficult video to find here in the United States and I haven't been able to find a DVD yet.
