A documentary MUST SEE .----- This film has had so many things to consider while watching it. It was a great documentary of a test of a 15-year-old black boy named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the dead woman's husband about the description of the man who killed his wife. The husband seemed to want to change some things to join what the police said he was wearing. The police have little to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer, Patrick McGuinness, is meticulous in getting information to help his client. He tells viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigations and beatings against his young client to convince him to confess. The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was questioned. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored. He questions a cop on the desk and asks what he heard Brenton say to one of the investigators and he challenges their own words. McGuinness investigates Ann Finnell in every place where the police should have gone and the things they should have done but they didn't. The film shows the butlers as a loving Christian family that has faith in the innocence of the child and in the faith that God will free Brenton. They visit him in prison and pray with him there to encourage him. There are group prayer scenes for Brenton, the lawyers, the judge and all those involved in this case. I am a white man and I was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat blacks in others. It was very disappointing to see the black and white police stay together when they think they have their man. The police have hard work and I think most of them are honorable not like those in this movie. I think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the justice system including judges, police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it.
