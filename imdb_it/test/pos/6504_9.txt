Wonderfully fun and impressive feature on the pioneers of turntablism. DJ Shadow and Q-Bert are fantastic in this fantastic documentary. Discover almost all the major DJs who credit their arrival to zero thanks to Herbie Hancock's classic post-bop "Rockit" and the repertoire of some of the most complex and amazing turntable programs of all time.
