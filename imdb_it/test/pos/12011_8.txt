I think this film has become an important testimony to the most terrifying aspect of the East German regime - the imprisonment of its people by what the regime has called its anti-fascist protection wall. It is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed. I would still like to comment on the current position of this escape. It did not happen in or around Berlin, as supposed by some respondents and has nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall. The hot air balloon was flown over the iron curtain that not only divided Germany, but divided the whole of Europe at that time. The balloon took off from PÃ¶ssneck, 170 miles southwest of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and flew 14 miles to Naila, Bavaria, and to freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall in the same year. While the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema, it had to remain a monument to those who lost their lives trying to escape East Berlin, other parts of the GDR or other Soviet-controlled states.
