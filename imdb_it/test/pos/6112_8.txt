I was first introduced to the John Waters films by seeing "Female trouble" on IFC. I was disgusted but for some reason sick I liked it. So, I took the DVD of pink flamingos in John Waters' boxed set. The film is about Babs Johnson "The Filthiest Person Alive" who lives in a trailer park in Maryland with his mother obsessed with the obesity of an egg and his deranged "Crackers". In the movie you will see sick things like sex with chickens, drag queens, people who eat feces, torture and any other kind of casual humiliation. The film has a soundtrack by 60s rock'n'roll artists. The only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring. I found "female problems" a little more fun. Nominal NC-17 for explicit sex, violence and disturbing images. To enjoy.
