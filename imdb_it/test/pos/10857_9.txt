For every fan of stories that are always of age, this 3-hour adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel is pure fun. Cinematic beckons to the kinetic style of Baz Luhrman, as well as to all those primitive and appropriate period pieces <br /> <br /> always present on the BBC (where you are likely to have seen almost <br /> /> every prominent member of this cast). It's rather obscene and above <br /> <br /> the top in commercials, but that's exactly what the novel required. The cast <br /> <br /> is attractive and, in the cases of Anna Chancellor and Hugh <br /> <br /> Bonneville, perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling, like our heroine <br /> <br /> Nan, you simply have to overlook the fact that she's too cute to ever be mistaken for a boy and run away with him. It is a fantasy, after all. <br /> <br /> Some fans of the novel may be emitted by various changes in the character <br /> <br /> (in particular that of the character of Jodhi May, Florence), but <br /> <br /> the changes are all for the benefit of teleplay and <br /> <br /> provide high quality entertainment value.
