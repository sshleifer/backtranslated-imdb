Total genius or madness? It depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to it at the level of a self-conscious "film parody", and honestly I hope it was the intention as I don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing the scenery and is really getting into the spirit of things! Should this film mark Rudd's departure from his main background in the comedy genre? A kind of crazy attempt to reinvent it as a hard-boiled action star? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> With the kind of trinket, the almost embarrassing presence, the low-cost FX and exaggerated action pieces, all this has evoked for me the old television program "Sledge Hammer"! FUNNY!!! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course, I might have completely interpreted the wrong movie. If it was actually an attempt at a "straight" action movie, then it was definitely a fun failure !! <br /> <br /> Watch with lots of alcohol and some friends !!! ;-)
