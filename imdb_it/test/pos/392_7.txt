Dylan and Bobby are childhood friends and are in love with the way kids sometimes do. But Dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those things aside as a boy. Bobby knows he doesn't care about girls and misses what he's had with Dylan. <br /> <br /> Said as part of the 80s pop video, partly home movie, partly video memory this movie tells a confusing and sad story, but too often true, that will hit home with many who see it. <br /> <br /> This film brings back many memories and has found a real deal with me, but I would like the director to have gone a little further and left him on a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose, even when we are young, but there is always tomorrow, especially when we are young.
