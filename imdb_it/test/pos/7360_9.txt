I turned it on (from the cable) on a whim and was treated with some surprise ... although very predictable this film turned out to be a lot of fun ... no big stars but well directed and just fun. With all the excessive shit that's out there it's very nice to have an unexpected surprise from time to time ... and this little movie fits the bill. 9/10
