I think there was too much action in the end? Don't you think so too? There was romance, an adventure that just like he told me to put 9 in this film, but the place of action was too long. I liked Reeve a little. I didn't understand why he had to die. I thought that one of the girls also died, but my luck! No one else I liked is not dead! And you? What did you like? I've actually seen the movie twice. And then I bought that too. It was worth it! Who did you like most (person)? The book was really, really, really fantastic. And also the actresses and actors. Everything was perfect ....... What was the name of the song at the end? Someone will answer my questions ... PLEASE, please, please?
