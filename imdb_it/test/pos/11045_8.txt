The simultaneous viewing of both of these films is not a bad idea to get an idea of ​​film production and acting for camera styles. I nod to Garbo (but not by much) regarding his naturalness. Robeson is majestic. But his performance is destined for a large theater in the proscenium. Something else that struck me was the film themes of empowerment for women and minorities. There had not yet been films from Hollywood that allowed the voices of marginal characters like Anna and Brutus to be brought to the fore. These were very progressive films for their time. It's quite possible that O'Neill saw the writing on the wall before everyone else talked about America's future.
