Did I avoid this movie as a boy because I thought it would be boring ?? no fights or shootings, cops, thieves, cowboys or Indians. It was definitely not an interesting movie to love. So I didn't see the TRC until I was twenty and I found it one of the most beautiful and eye-catching films I've seen. All the actors deliver the characterizations perfectly and every emotion is drawn by the spectator scene by scene. Filming and directing are deceptively simple, but I feel so natural and they completely attract me into history. My two favorite scenes are Bobbie's birthday party and the scene on the station platform towards the end, directed and edited to perfection. The quality and phrasing of Jenny Agutter's voice when she calls: "Dad! My dad!" it takes emotion from the observer. Tears are wetting my eyes as I think about it. <br /> <br /> This adaptation is not just a film, it's a precious piece of art, besides being the perfect example of what it should be all the directors striving to achieve the creation of an emotional experience.
