This film is good, but not the best of Schaffner. My favorite is Papillon and Patton, but this is a sad and very beautiful film. Kris Kristoffersen is good at this film and really makes the difference. I will miss Schaffner and this is his last film. <br /> <br /> A good film by a great director! 7.5 / 10
