Rainy day with little to do. We were browsing the channels of the cinema network and we found this only at the beginning, so we gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> The more we looked, the more we immersed ourselves in history. It is the old story of the working class loser trying to make it in a sport that at the time (I believe in 1913) was usually played by the rich bourgeoisie but this film was just as interesting as Seabiscuit and this is also based on a real story. <br /> <br /> Acting is credible and casting is brilliant. IS . . . . We are NOT golfers, so please don't miss this just because it's golf. Every single sport would serve the plot, because it concerns people. Golf works well for this story due to the distinction of class and snobbery that seem to involve some gambling players. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. . . . It's a good movie. It is well done and it is not always fun to see those who think they are better than others who are put down.
