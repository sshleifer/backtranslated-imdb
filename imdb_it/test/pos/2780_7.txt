I foresee many students who sign up for the exchange of students in Barcelona and are disappointed when they don't have much fun. <br /> <br /> The film was fun. Obviously it's always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou. <br /> <br /> However, I have a very strong problem with part of the film. The lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women love being physically dominated (which I consider problematic) and they show him a sort of move that captures the ass that is guaranteed to have a woman. Xavier then tries to grab the target from a shy married friend - who starts off by saying "no no" "I'm married, I'm married" but then somehow succumbs to the head ?? Suddenly she complains "yes yes" and they are going to the stalls of the Parc Guell. I found this really really offensive. It is also very stereotyped. How many times have we seen scenes where the woman says "no", but obviously she doesn't say it seriously? No means no. The sinking butts / physical domination will fail to do it well. He totally supported the stereotyped myths of rape. <br /> <br /> I wasn't even sure how to read the next scene in which she gloats for the lesbian on how it worked and how next time she would ask for "suck, bitch" (or something). Did he really think of forcing himself on a woman with no respect for his feelings, was it the way to go? <br /> <br /> This section really ruined my film.
