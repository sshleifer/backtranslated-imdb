Well, this is the best comedy movie I've ever seen ... My two favorite actors did a good job. Salman khan and Aamir khan rocked. I hope to see Andaz Apna Apna part 2 as soon as I heard that they will also return with part 2. I asked those who have not yet looked at it. please buy DVDs and watch it you will not get bored. I'm watching this movie 1 times a week. The other was also good in this film. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others The music is also good and also has good songs. there is a sense that it will kill you with laughter Salman khan has played a very beautiful role and also Aamir. <br /> <br /> so you have to watch the movie excellent work from actors and director ..
