Excellent interpretation of Mary KAy Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekah Johnson. A wonderful story that envelops you in the film, emotional but carefree. I own this movie, and everyone I shared it with, I love it. Great for mixed companies, over 18 people. <br /> <br /> Pleasant production, not an economic budget, well organized and keeps your interest. Use the most recent ideas of the dome, for flashbacks and, at some point, keep the viewer at the edge of their own place. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the life of the person from whom the spectator comes, they will buy it in one or more points of view in this film. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a sequel!
