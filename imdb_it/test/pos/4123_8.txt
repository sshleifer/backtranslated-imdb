This film biography of the first rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The highlights of the film are the plays by Busey, where he plays the guitar and sings Holly's songs. It brings so much energy to the performances that Holly's filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's contagious sneer illuminates the screen, creating an absolutely credible and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for Best Actor has been well deserved. <br /> <br /> The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, celebrities and New York and her untimely death in a plane crash. One thing that I found interesting, if true, was Buddy's ambition: he had big plans to go beyond recording and performance. From a young age he was already establishing himself as a shrewd businessman and wanted to take things to a higher level. We will never know if in the end he would have catapulted his first success into a commercial brand like The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The lyrics of many of Holly's songs are rather adolescent; read the text of "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" and you will see what I mean. Perhaps to a large extent this explains its popularity with the teenage public, but its instrumentation and theatrical performances certainly explain its influence on the groups to follow - both The Rolling Stones and The Beatles have recognized its importance. <br /> <br /> Clearly some freedoms were taken for dramatic effect. For example, I doubt that Holly ever punched a Nashville producer or that the audience at the Apollo theater in New York was so immediately responsive that they danced wildly in the corridors. If you are interested in getting closer to the truth, watch the documentary "The Real Buddy Holly Story" (1985) produced and hosted by Paul McCartney, very relaxed and attractive. This contains interviews with Holly's family, friends and groupmates (Holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in "The Buddy Holly Story"). Members of other bands like Keith Richards and Don Everly also offer opinions and stories and there are footage of old Holly performances. McCartney's production can stand alone, but it is an excellent complement to "The Buddy Holly Story" and perhaps should be requested for anyone who looks at fictional history.
