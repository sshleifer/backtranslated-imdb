Everyone knows that Lindburgh succeeded in the first transatlantic flight. So how can there be suspense or intrigue in this film? Well, there is. Don't ask me how, but it's there. Partly because of the story director's expert story, but above all thanks to Jimmy Stewart's engaging performance, we are drawn to the story as if it were taking place right before our eyes for the first time. Despite the fact that half of the film is shot in a cramped dashboard, it is as dynamic as any action that breaks out there. So if you're worried about seeing this movie because you think you already know the story, give it a chance. I think you will be hit.
