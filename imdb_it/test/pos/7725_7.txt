This is a good film with good performances by Paz Vega and Leonardo Sbaraglia. Obviously Vicente Aranda is a legend in Spanish cinema and certainly one of the great directors of Spanish cinema, but I don't think this is one of his biggest films, even if it's fine. The script plays with the introduction of Merime√© as a character, it's a nice touch but it's incredible. The music is composed by Jose Nieto, Spanish National Cinema Award. I mean that this film is very good in all technical aspects. There are very good actors in supporting roles like Antonio Dechent, Maria Botto and others. I give 7 out of 10 because I think this could be a better film, but since it's not boring at all.
