"East Side Story" is a musical comedy documentary in Stalinist Russia and later in Eastern European satellite comedies, with many clips taken from films and comments from survivors. Although some Stalinist films seem ridiculous (The Bright Road (?) Is a noteworthy exception), the films of the '60s seem really very beautiful. "My wife wants to sing", "The White Mouse" and "Midnight Revue" seem particularly amusing. The producers had to struggle with the censors, who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, humorous in retrospect, since the people the censors were trying to appease were just the people that supported making the movies start with! Since the musical comedies were quite rare behind the iron curtain - there were only about forty performed in forty years - they had a disproportionate effect on their audience, which achieved important successes in some films. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the sound of the films of the sixties was much better. The directors often had to settle for antiquated equipment and strict energy regulations - they had to film in seven minutes of shooting or not - and dangerous officiates. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong influence on "Hot Summer". Subsequent films may not be as good as "Singin 'in the Rain", but they certainly seem to come out of "Bye Bye Birdy"
