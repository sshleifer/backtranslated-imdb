Swift's socialism and pacifism come against all odds in this well-made remake. (Did you know that there is no hyphen after "good"?). Meet warrior miniatures, socialist giants, philosophers (literally) "head in the cloud" and pacifist horses who rule on Yahoos - almost Neanderthalan humanoids. (Is it where yahoo comes from?) We also meet the vile Dr. Bates, the devoted Mary Gulliver, the sweet and devoted son Thomas, and the full cast of a horrible 19th century madhouse. The suspension of disbelief comes easily, and our 7 and 12 year old girls liked us as much as my husband and me. (Sorry for the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)
