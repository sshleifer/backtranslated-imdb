Forget Jimmy Stewart to relive your life and opt for this comedy of errors instead. I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this movie and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, "Meet John Doe", are not revered with the same level of love as ... well, you know what it's called. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall-like rag that has lied to his pompous publisher for years about the folk setting for his recipes. You are an ace b.s. artist until the day when Morgan's sailor is taken out of the ocean after 18 days of storage and 6 weeks of recovery in a Navy hospital. Released the last year of the Second World War, the film is dusty with subtle patriotic gestures and nostalgia for the holidays, but it never sinks sentimentality. Stanwyck is sexy and impertinent as always and meets his game in the hunky Morgan with which he is love at first sight. Unfortunately, he has to get married to Gardiner's friend who has been looking for his hand on his farm in CT for years, only to deceive his boss. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall adds a great deal of Hungarian mischief and two-way support humor as the true source of Babs and Una O'Connor's culinary talent is as exhilarating as the hateful Irish housekeeper of Gardiner.
