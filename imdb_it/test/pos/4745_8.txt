a compact criminal drama with a good deal of action. The exclusive shots of New York add to this little difficult film. Technically well done with good direction and acting. Needless to say, the wild pursuit that seems to start in the center, extends across the upper west side, Washington Heights, through the George Washington Bridge and into NJ must be one of the best films ever. All around a good movie that for me improves with time.8 out of 10 ... easy
