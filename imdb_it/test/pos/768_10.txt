beautiful. I love the movie. I want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are grandiose, spectacular. the film was excellent. Even Julie Walters was perfect. I think Rupert is the only red-haired boy I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. I think the film was great and it was nice to see Rupert in another thing, but Harry Potter. and he's a great actor, so he deserves this and more. it only has a golden globe, but it probably deserves an Oscar Academy award. there are some actors who don't play very well but still have an Oscar. it does not matter. but it's perfect, bright and beautiful
