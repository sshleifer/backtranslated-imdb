With "Anatomy" the German film producers tried to do something completely new. Usually there are only dramatic films or comedies - in the horror genre it is (or was) totally new at that time. <br /> <br /> The story is also new and shocking. Franka Potente plays her brilliant role and I bet you won't find out who the murderer is. It is possible, but difficult. A truly fantastic film with many talented actors.
