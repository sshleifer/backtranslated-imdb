Although the story is light, the film flows so beautifully and its appearance is so peaceful and poetic that it could almost bring the whole film. <br /> <br /> The film is composed of four interconnected stories, all concerning different aspects of the attraction between man and / or woman and how often it is ethereal. Their true desire always seems to be something they cannot cling to, it will flow like a handful of sand. <br /> <br /> I thought that the most intriguing story was the last one in which the woman was more unattainable, the more the man wants her. Parallel to his deep love for God, which is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to his heart. <br /> <br /> A very beautiful film. 7/10
