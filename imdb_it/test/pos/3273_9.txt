spoiler-- <br /> <br /> In 1993, African American director / actor Mario Van Peebles followed the popular urban action film New Jack City with "Posse". The film was co-scripted and directed by Van Peebles, who also plays the main character, Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Plot: The film begins at the end of the 20th century, when the United States became involved in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the US judicial system could send convicts to military service, Jessie Lee finds herself enlisted enlisted, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba. Some of his compatriots include Little J (Stephen Baldwin) , Weezie (Charles Lane) who speaks quickly and Obobo (Tiny Lister) impressive but simple. They find a chest of gold hidden in a reconnaissance race and decide to keep it. However, the ambitious and bigoted Colonel Graham (Zane) discovers the gold, and is apparently willing to kill Jessie Lee and company for this. A shootout between Graham and Jessie Lee forces leaves the blind colonel in one eye, and his forces retreat. Jessie Lee's crew managed to smuggle (and gold) into New Orleans, but it turns out that Graham is not far behind. Jessie Lee and her allies are forced to flee westward to a city called Freemanville. Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the civil war. Jessie Lee's father, "King David", was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the city. However, as shown by the intermittent flashbacks, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white crowd, in a parallel of the Ku Klux Klan terrorist campaigns that started around the same time. Jessie Lee and the company eventually find their way to Freemanville, only to discover that the citizens are not really happy to see it, especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) from a nearby white town makes it clear that he wants Jessie Lee and the his associates ?? dead or alive. Carver (Blair Underwood) is the sheriff and de facto mayor of Freemanville and his agenda may not coincide with having Jessie Lee around. <br /> <br /> Analysis The action sequences are all very credible, and Mario Van Peebles turns into a good performance like the thoughtful hero. In the aftermath of the success of New Jack City, it was almost taken for granted that Van Peebles would direct a sequel, or at least a similar follow-up to urban action. Instead, Van Peebles looked like 100 years in the past, creating a mostly black western (actually "updating" the black-themed westerns of the 70s), and continuing the legacy of largely forgotten 19th century cowboy films . Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently funded and originally released through Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. Presumably, the executive directors of the major studios backed away when Van Peebles launched "Posse" on them. Some of the most "curious" castings at the time involve rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc in the role of Father Time and Angel, respectively. In some interviews, Mario Van Peebles said that he often likes to cast against the type; in the following years, the tendency to launch rap singers into non-musical films would almost become commonplace. The sharp spectators will notice numerous cameos of various entertainment personalities: veterans of the black action film such as Isaac Hayes ("Truck Turner"), Pam Grier ("Foxy Brown") and Larry Cook ("The ghostly who sat next to the port "), as well as stand-up legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention TV producer Stephen J. Cannell (who hired young Van Peebles to star in" Sonny Spoon "years earlier). The film was distributed with Woody Strode ("Spartacus") in a key role.
