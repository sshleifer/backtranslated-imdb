Love Jones skillfully interprets young African-American men and women in a clear, positive, realistic sense. I feel that all the actors and actresses have been magnificent and have really done a great job at capturing the atmosphere. Nia Long and Larenz Tate have worked well together and I hope to see more work from them. In fact all the actors / actresses did a great job, it would have been nice to see another romantic comedy from them. This film can be compared to any well-written romantic comedy. If you haven't already seen this movie, I strongly suggest you do it, it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love.
