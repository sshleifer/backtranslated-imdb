I received free tickets through the Times to see this little Irish film known as "Inside I'm Dancing" ... I knew nothing, so I had no preconceptions before entering. <br /> <br /> The film is about two boys who are confined to their wheelchairs and live in a house. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, since Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying. Eventually they leave the house to live alone in an apartment in Carrigmore. They immediately employ the help of an attractive girl (Romola Garai) to take care of them. The two friends eventually fall in love with the same woman. Here is the story in a nutshell, but there are lots of laughs and tears along the way ... in fact ... being unprepared as I was ... I found the tears flowing too often! Indeed! I don't think I cried so much watching a movie from The Elephant Man !!! This film is a GREAT escape on emotions ... both in fun things and in sad things. The acting is absolutely perfect! James McAvoy is my advice for greatness ... he's a great Irish actor and I think he has a great future ahead of him. Even Steven Robertson, who plays Michael, was superb ... and it wasn't until today that I discovered he didn't suffer from Cerabal Paralysis and it was just a superb acting! Brenda Fricker is also in this film and plays the part of the house manager very well. The other big part must be Romola Garai, it was as wonderful as the love interest, and I think we'll see more of her on the big screen in the near future! <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this movie work, it's not just the synergies between the two protagonists, but the script ... which is just so witty that it literally is on fire! I still can't help but repeat a few lines in my head. <br /> <br /> Photography is good, though very shabby, but then it is capturing a certain type of area of ​​Ireland. The music is also fantastic in this film, as is the choice in Songs ... the use of the Johnny Cash cover of the Nine Inch Nails track "Hurt" is inspired !! <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this film in one word ... it would be "emotional". This movie is very very funny ... and then at the end of a coin it is very very sad! I still can't believe that two days after seeing the movie, looking back, they both laugh and almost cry! This film is fantastic ... and I hope it goes far! Even if I can't see it, since the advertising budget is probably very small! <br /> <br /> So go see it! I urge you ... you won't regret it ...
