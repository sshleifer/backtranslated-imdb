My favorite movie this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing were fluid, visually beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> Set in Barcelona, ​​the film follows a year in the life of six foreign graduate and other assorted students. Cultures and languages ​​collide, but hearts and lives intertwine. The main role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he played the part perfectly. The characters were well developed and their interaction was honest and accurate. There were two particularly noteworthy scenes, the climax was really inspired. The film is sentimental, and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderfully fun. <br /> <br /> I almost didn't see it, but I only showed Audrey Tautou. His role, although ranked second or third, was minor and was surpassed by many other characters. I wish other films like this were made. The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club came to mind. Don't start this movie late if you're planning on going to bed by 1/2 street.
