I saw it for the first time when it was shown for the first time, so I'm not too objective about it. He really managed to scare me, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of everything I felt from a videotaped suspense story (the same thing that helped Dark Shadows himself). And the casting was so right. I barely know Shane Briant from anything else, so it might not be so correct to define "well-cast" HIM, but for me, he's Dorian Gray. And as for the other male actors, the one who adapted so well to his part was Nigel Davenport (who is so good at "bigger than life" characters) like Sir Henry. And John Karlen, a sort of "repertoire player" by Dan Curtis, due to Dark Shadows. As a poster points out, this version manages to include entanglements with men, in a fairly subtle way. The scene in which Dorian recites a list of men's names for the character of John Karlen, as a way to blackmail him, and the look on Karlen's face, were very well made. (If that scene had been made at that time, it would probably have been done in a TOO OBVIOUS way, and it would be bad by comparison.) I saw it when "Dorian Gray" was barely a name for me, let alone more , so even more than the famous 1945 version (which is rightly famous), this is the version for me.
