I saw him at the GenCon show in Indy. I had some time to kill and I decided to try it. He played about 1000 people in a packed ballroom. <br /> <br /> Wow, what a race! The script was tight. The time of action. The perfect rhythm. Exposition of the excellent character. One thing I really appreciated is that you knew it wasn't a big budget movie. Yet it soon became obvious that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as possible, despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film was addressed to a certain audience - players / table players - the creators make no effort to hide it. But other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. To go to the jugular scene after scene and not worry if the watching mother is "taking it", they had the biggest laughs over and over again. But there is enough universality that even the mother would laugh, even if she is not on every line. I think that too many times I see films that try so much to lower the level to the lowest common denominator so that most people like them, but the film ends up suffering for it. <br /> <br /> But not this shot. In fact, this film was so solid that the audience had approached his finger from the headlines. And, while viewers around me * really * wanted to enjoy the movie, they weren't crazy - players can be among the most niche critics out there. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy to have seen it in a big crowd. At least 10 times the audience was having so much fun to burst into applause for a joke or a scene during the movie. How often does it happen to projections? It should not be surprising that there was a huge standing ovation when the closing credits were closed. <br /> <br /> For my part, I can't wait for it to be released. In the end, one of the producers stated that they were shooting for a simultaneous TV / DVD version. That date cannot come soon enough.
