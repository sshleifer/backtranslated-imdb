Friend, I thought this movie was crazy. Perfect for sitting alone and looking like 3AM with just you and a bottle. For as long as you are watching are you thinking about WTF? What will happen next ... man, take the girl already. Okay ..... they are collecting mushrooms ... this is weird ... but a bit creepy cold. Damn it all this movie has a mischievous erotic and mischievous and cold undertone ... it's a thin dance that just keeps you attracted ... you're just waiting for someone to be beaten. But dammit ... WTF!? You take it and then some. For the morally infuriated stomach it is nice to run to the bathroom to get the material out. Every film that can elicit reactions of this kind deserves a prize.
