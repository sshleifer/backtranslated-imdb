The film Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 of the smart comedy movies ever made in Bollywood and maybe even in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out I was 8 and I felt it was a flop but I never understood until now because it was a flop ... but let me tell you something ... this movie would had more money selling home tapes and DVDs and showing on TV movie channels than any hit movie in theaters. This film has been shown countless times in film channels and I think even now public love and television producers continue to repeat the film over and over again. Personally I have seen the whole movie more than 80 -100 times and still love it ..... <br /> <br /> The performance of both Aamir khan and Amar and Prem Salman khan is an amazing feeling but particularly liked the performance of Aamir khan as a street boy ... his dialogues in the film are hilarious ... the story is simple and here's how it goes ..... <br /> <br /> Amar e Prem are poor, lazy cracks and come from a poor family of tailors and Amars's father is a barber. Then both get the news that a daughter of a millionaire from London is coming to India to find a suitable match ... both Amar and Prem think this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich ..... so both go to courting Raveena Tandon .. (the daughter of the millionaires) ... in their journey both hate each other and each of them tries to deceive the other to marry Raveena ..... the comic scenes in between are so hilarious that you need a glass of water to stop the pain in the stomach laughing ....... and then there is Raveenas Uncle (the brother of the millionaire who looks alike) Teja who wants revenge from Raveenas's father ..... from when he is broke and Raveenas is a millionaire dad ...... his plans include kidnapping Raveena to blackmail Raveenas' father for whom he hires 2 butlers ..... <br /> but later we will understand that there is a turning point in the film (watch the film to know) ....... then there is Shak you Kapoor in the role of the criminalist Gogo who is also incredibly nny ...... <br /> <br /> The thing that stands out for me were the dialogues of the film that became a legend of the genre ..... Aamir khan uses his "aaila" brilliantly and Salman goes as "OOima" ........ and for Gogo there is "Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega" ...... each scene is so funny ...... <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the one where Aamir khan and Salman go to get Raveena from Teja and both go to a Moon with money "chillar" in a bag .... that scene is so fun .. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ...... this is a movies that I would recommend having a DVD and you will never regret it. ......
