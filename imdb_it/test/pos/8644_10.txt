Hitchcock would be proud of this film. Even when nothing happens, it's full of suspense. Director David Lynch brings out some economic trills here and there, but divides them with other film techniques to prevent it from becoming dull. <br /> <br /> Completely surreal, this film is like waking up and remembering most of Dream but not enough to make it sensible. I'm still trying to figure it all out and I'll probably have to see it again to capture the things I've lost that might help me understand it better. It's a very detailed plot that very slowly unites, so you have to be patient and pay attention. Make your bathroom journey ends before it starts. Yet the plot is obscured by the theme, the mood, the character development and the shooting techniques. <br /> <br /> The double roles of the lead actress, Naomi Watts, show her enormous talent. I mean, when I could take my eyes off his co-star. What couple of actors. <br /> <br /> Lynch surprises throughout the film with unusual camera angles, the length / timing of editing cuts, the jump back and forth between scenes. Combined with the intelligent use of music and sounds, everything contributes to creating suspense in our minds, without doubt one of the director's main goals. Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, he made me talk to the actors too to be careful here, and not be so naive there. You know, the kind of things you want to slap with your kids at the movies.
