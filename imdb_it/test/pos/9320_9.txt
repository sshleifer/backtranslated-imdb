One of the best musical bios. Dennis Morgan is as exceptional as the singer / composer Chauncey Olcutt. The supporting cast is very good, in particular Andrea King as the charming Lillian Russell. The atmosphere of the beginning of the century is the perfect environment. The technicolor is excellent. A simple plot, but the film makes you feel good. Morgan was always underestimated as an actor and singer.
