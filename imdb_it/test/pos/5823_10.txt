One of the other reviewers said that after watching only 1 episode of Oz you will feel bound. They are right, since this is exactly what happened with me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about Oz was the brutality and endless violence scenes, which date back to the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint of heart or timid. This show does not punch when it comes to drugs, sex or violence. It's hardcore, in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br /> It is called OZ as it is the nickname given to Oswald's maximum security penitentiary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have a glass fa√ßade and face inwards, so privacy is not at the top of the agenda. Em City is home to many ... Aryans, Muslims, gangsters, Latins, Christians, Italians, Irish and more ... so the fights, the looks of death, the obscene affairs and the shady deals are never far away. <br /> <br /> I would say that the main attraction of the show is that it goes where other shows would not dare. Forget the beautiful images painted for the mainstream public, forget the charm, forget the romance ... OZ is no joke. The first episode I ever saw seemed so ugly to be surreal, I couldn't say I was ready, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz and got used to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who will be sold for a penny, prisoners who will kill by order and get away with it, well-behaved, middle-class prisoners turned into whores in prison because of their lack of street skills or prison experience ) Looking at Oz, you may feel comfortable with what is uncomfortable to see ... this is if you can get in touch with your dark side.
