One True Thing rises above its potentially skeletal material to give us a vision of a family of complex relationships and spoiled and true people. It opens with Rene Zeleweger discussing the death of his mother with the district attorney; saving us the cheap movie shots of a "shocking" illness and death. From there we move on to take a look at a family system, in which everyone plays with a series of unexamined rules, and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /> <br /> William Hurt is the important father and Meryl Streep, as a home mother of Suzy, is at the same time superb; nuanced and not what they seem to be. Zeleweger is seething, angry and surprised by herself. Tom Everett Scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well. <br /> <br /> History is predictable and requires at least a gravely faded turn that was not necessary, but executions and the vision of the family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed, are worth penalty.
