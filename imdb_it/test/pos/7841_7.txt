"The Beguiled" is a strange work among Clint Eastwood's works. In 1971 he became famous as the protagonist of action films, not only Western (the genre in which he made his name) but also war movies (such as "Where Eagles Dare") and thriller thrillers (like "Coogan's Bluff" ). "). However, although" The Beguiled "takes place during the war (the American Civil War), it was made by Don Siegel who previously directed Eastwood in" Coogan's Bluff "and later that year to direct it in" Dirty Harry "is not an action film in the traditional sense. In most of his previous films, Eastwood played an active role, but his role is largely passive here - his character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded fugitive forced to rely on the charity of women to survive.Also while serving with his unit, McBurney did not actively participate in the conflict, he is a Quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms, and he was serving with Union forces as an orderly doctor. <br /> <br /> The film is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and begins with the injured McBurney discovered by a young girl named Amy and reported in his collegue I. The school is small, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the Confederate cause and want to hand it over to the authorities, the director, Martha Farnsworth, decides to protect him and treat him, fearing that his injuries will prove fatal if he were to be sent to one of the notoriously strict federal prison camps . <br /> <br /> Although McBurney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion regarding pacifism, he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following his teachings on the sin of fornication, and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charm both on the personal and on the older girls, and wins the affection of the number of them, including Miss Farnsworth, his assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the older girls. Twelve-year-old Amy also seems to have a kind of childlike crush on him. In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the girls' school, her presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, rejected in favor of the listless Carol, complicates a terrible revenge. (It is interesting to note that the only female who opposes the allurements of McBurney is Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, even though she tries to conquer her, stressing that she is fighting to free people like her). <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" has been described as an anti-war film, but this seems to me a misunderstanding. The film does not really talk about the rights and wrongs of civil war or war in general. The only acts of violence that we see are perpetrated by non-combatants, and are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not by zeal for the Confederate cause. It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of the war. <br /> <br /> At first the school, set in a beautiful old pre-war house, looks like an island of peace in the midst of war. The building is in classical style, associated with order, harmony and control, but the story that takes place within its walls is a disorder, passion and violence, qualities associated with the Gothic school of writing that was in the 19th century often regarded as the antithesis of classicism. The film can be seen as part of what has been called the "Southern Gothic" tradition in American cinema and literature. <br /> <br /> The film was not a great box office success, perhaps because Eastwood was chosen for the genre. It may not be his best film, but he showed that he could expand his range and play something different from action heroes. (In "Play Misty for Me", his first film as a director made the following year, he was again playing a "passive" character in danger from a vengeful female). There are excellent performances by the female members of the cast, in particular Geraldine Page like Martha Farnsworth, outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions. (There are indications that he may have had an affair with a man he left as his brother). There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as the shy and repressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of ​​revenge and from the young Pamelyn Ferdin in the role of Amy. (Amy is an animal lover - a key moment in the film comes when McBurney kills his turtle, so it's interesting that Ferdin later became an animal rights activist). The only character I was less enthusiastic about was Carol of Jo Ann Harris who seemed too modern, like a girl from the seventies who moved back in time until the 1860s. The film is noteworthy for the emotionally intense "greenhouse" atmosphere that Siegel brings. This will not be a film that is for all tastes; some will find it too agitated and melodramatic, and some have found it misogynistic. (Judith Crist called a film for "haters and sadistic women"). Others, however, may find it a compelling psychological drama. 7/10
