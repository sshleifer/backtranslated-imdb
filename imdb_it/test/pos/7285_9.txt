I was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was. Whether you are a fan of gore or a fan of suspense; this you will love it I didn't like horror movies, we considered them stupid. However, it happens that I make exceptions. I find something truly extraordinary in this film. I have rarely seen a movie that scared me, but in reality I tell you that this film gave me the chills up to my neck. Unlike most horror movies, this is about character development. I highly recommend this movie and I'm glad Asylum is finally bringing out good horror movies these days <br /> <br /> which I recommend! To enjoy!
