The connection with James Dean? In a brief plan, we see Emilio Estevez fiddling with a teddy bear (he remembers the first scene of Ray's "rebel without cause".) Furthermore, the main conflict is Estevez against Sheen, father against son, as in "East of Eden". The soldier returned home, and no one was able to communicate with him, not even his sister (a psychology student, who derided). The mother, a raw matron (a superb Kathy Bates), gets bogged down in the nougatine, can't understand that her values ​​(religion, family) have become a thing of the past, especially for someone like her son whose innocence is been betrayed. The father, an irresolute man, under his wife's thumb, even if he tries to interpret the macho, wanted to recover the mediocrity of his life. So he saved his "honor" by forcing his son to do his duty. The scene where Estevez's hatred for his father explodes is very intense. The actor-director gives a contained, internalized performance, as did the students of Lee Strasberg, and his final outburst of anger has increased tenfold.
