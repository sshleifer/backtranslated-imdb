Walter Matthau is as wonderful as the philandering dentist Dr. Julian Winston, whose frequent contacts with his girlfriend Goldie provide manual proof of the dangers of lying. Goldie Hawn's touching Toni Simmons certainly deserved to win her Oscar. Ingrid Bergman's work as a nurse Stephanie is also touching her shell, slowly and nervously. This is a great movie to watch in spring or anytime. It is very underrated; I've never heard of it until I found it in the video store and what a find!
