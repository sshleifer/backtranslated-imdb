This film works on many different levels. It is a profile of a very beautiful couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a couple of times, and every time I look at him I'm not sure who to call first: my parents, my wife, a friend with whom I lost contact. . But it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life and wants to reaffirm those that continue. Expect lots of laughter and probably a few tears if any of the lively characters find a deal here. I'm pretty sure they will.
