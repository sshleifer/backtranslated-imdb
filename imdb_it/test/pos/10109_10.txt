Beauty. Terror Poetry. Horror. The innocence. The Guilt. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's all I should write in this comment for A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. The best thing is to simply watch this movie without knowing anything about it. I didn't even know a thing about the two girls' story when I went to this movie. I just looked at the beautiful cover, I didn't even read the synopsis on the back and put it in the DVD player. I only knew that he won several awards at festivals around the world and that he was highly recommended. <br /> <br /> The DVD cover read "The scariest movie from THE RING, THE GRUDGE and DARK WATER". Even if the scary part might be right, you can forget the rest, because the only thing that ONE OF TWO SISTERS has in common with those films is ... a ghostly appearance with long black hair. It is even unfair to compare it to those famous Japanese films, because this Korean film has much more to offer and is actually a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others. <br /> <br /> This film is simply a small masterpiece, and here are some reasons (without saying anything about the plot): the film itself caught me off guard at least twice with clever twists. And just when you think you've had the conclusion (whether you get it or not, it's irrelevant for the moment) and you think the film will end ... this movie goes on a little longer. The cinematography is surprising, using bright colors during the day and dark shades during the night. The work with the camera is excellent with the director who sometimes chooses high-impact, if not innovative, corners. Some shots are pure poetry (for example the top shot with the two sisters by the lake). Everything looks very elegant. There are only four main characters, but the intrigue around them is intense. The story itself begins a little slowly, but there is a lot of variety of tones and emotions to keep it interesting. There was also a scene (when the girls left for the lake) that suddenly reminded me of Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES. But when horror comes, it's pretty effective. There are also some surprise surprises. Damn it, I immediately jumped from my couch. The soundtrack is fantastic and, sometimes, when it shouldn't be scary, I couldn't help but notice that it had some sort of Italian feeling. A bit strange for a Korean movie. But anyway, a great score. The care of all the details of this film has been a lot, including a perfectly balanced surround sound. I also think that calling A TALE OF TWO SISTERS just a horror movie doesn't give him enough credit. It's more a mysterious horror film that works both on a psychological and a supernatural level. No matter how you look at it, this is the Asian horror that ranks among the best. It may not be gory, but sometimes it gets pretty scary and the topic is rather disturbed. So, if you haven't seen it yet, find a copy, insert it into your DVD player, follow the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for the 110 minute run time. <br /> <br /> Here, I hope I have done a good job praising it without ruining anything.
