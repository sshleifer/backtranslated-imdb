Very violent and well shot film. Paulina is a bad girl who will show that men can also be raped. This film has a lot of black humor. This guy will kill someone just to forget he was a gangster. Sometimes it will happen when you don't know whether to shudder or smile and think "Am I laughing at someone killing people?"
