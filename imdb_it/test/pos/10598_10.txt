"Haggard: The Movie" is well written, well directed and well acted. There is a lot of loud laughter and some fantastic skateboarding scenes with Margera. The scenes in West Chester, PA are shot beautifully and the script is definitely fun. What I like about the movie is that instead of being another corny love story or another version of "Jackass", it takes a darkly funny look at breaks from a different perspective. Most breaking films are played by a naive woman rejected by a cheater. Then he goes to look for Mr. Right and goes to tell his ex-traitor to get lost. This film takes a look at the emotional roller coaster of an abandoned man ... without taking itself too seriously. Ryan Dunn does a great job as the man with the eyebrows and with Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you in this difficult time, how can you take something too seriously? It is obvious that Margera and Co. are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera. I look forward to seeing their films and future efforts.
