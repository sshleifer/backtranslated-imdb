While many consider it a B movie, in fact it is a well-written and recited first-class comedy. Red Skelton is as big as Wally Benton, better known to radio fans like The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's girlfriend Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt is the head of a very well-founded gang of criminals. I read an account of this film which states that Vincente Minelli directed this film, unless he changed his name to Sylvan Simon, who directed all three Fox films. This is a very funny movie made when the imagination has been encouraged. So get over your black and white prejudice if you have one, make yourself comfortable and enjoy a truly fantastic comedy. This was also Red's first starring role. Take note during the climax of the reference to Orson Welles' War of the Worlds broadcast.
