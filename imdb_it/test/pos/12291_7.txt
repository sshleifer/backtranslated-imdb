Leos Carax has made 3 major films: Boys Meet Girls, Mauvais Sang, Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact those films weren't great, but it has the violence of youth, the beauty of youthful nature. Carax in these three films was well aware of what cinema was, but tried to make his vision of art, without thinking of everything he had seen, but using it and merging it in his time. Pola X is a very different film because Carax made Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a monstrosity of 20 million dollars, a film that destroyed everything in its path. After this movie you can't do another one in the same point of view. So Leos Carax must have changed, and he did. The film is not as beautiful as its first, is more reasonable, no longer in the studio, no longer dreamed of Paris, Carax has entered the end of reality. It is no longer clean, they are not poetic characters. Carax has become a romantic in the German sense of it.
