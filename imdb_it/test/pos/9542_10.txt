This wonderful film has never failed to move me. The color, the convincing cast and the breathtaking scenery make a great contribution. This production, unlike the next Carlton remake, is more impressionistic and presented more from the children's perspective. It focuses on a few episodes of the fascinating story of E. Nesbit, rather than trying to create a slightly more documentary "warts and all" style that Carlton adopts. Above all, the superb soundtrack of the late Johnny Douglas is the basis of the story, adding further emotional depth. The net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the moving story of "The Railway Children". <br /> <br /> An unpleasant factor for the viewer to think about in this film is how things have changed since those times - and in many ways, for the worse! Yes, perhaps many of us no longer have to use external toilets and travel in horse-drawn carts, but what about the quality of life in general? Consider the foul-mouthed celebrities who now "honor" our TV screens. Their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable. Also consider the delicate aspects "here today, gone tomorrow" of many "partnerships" today plus all single mothers - whatever happened to that institution called "marriage", when people accepted each other, but they are stay together, love their children? These details add extra spiciness when you watch this wonderful film. <br /> <br /> I hope that, over the generations, children can still enjoy this movie. Not to mention some adults!
