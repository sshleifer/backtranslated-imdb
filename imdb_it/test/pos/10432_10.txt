This is absolutely the best film I've ever seen. At the age of 12 I was late and ran through the film. It was on the USA channel, Up All Night by Gilbert Godfrey. I will never forget. At the time my friends and I were really struggling with different problems, some sexual. You know that 12 is a very hard and strange era. You seem to be stuck between being a child and being a young woman. This film really helped me answer many questions for me. Now I have a 12 year old daughter. I've been looking for a couple of years for this movie. If it ever comes on DVD, I'd be the first to buy. I would advise all parents to watch this with their child when they reach that very difficult and difficult age.
