I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO-type channels. I lost the beginning, but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and I didn't even think until the credits rolled. You'll find yourself cheering on the villains and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy in all this. If you have the chance, take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think of getting the cable company to take off my movie channels, but when they run into great characters like this, you know why it's worth paying extra for them. Happy holidays to all from Cape Cod !!!
