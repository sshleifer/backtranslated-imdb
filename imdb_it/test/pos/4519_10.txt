I just watched this movie at an advanced screening. I hadn't read the book and knew nothing of the story, but I went because the book was voted "Book of the Year" by two local colleges. So I can't compare the book with the film like others have done. <br /> <br /> In short, I thought it was an incredibly moving story. Acting was credible, and the intuition of Afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking. My oldest friend is Iranian-American, so I felt an affinity for certain Middle Eastern values ​​and traditions that were portrayed in the film, because they reminded me of the times I spent with his family. <br /> <br /> the themes of friendship, family, human values ​​and courage under fire are universal and are well developed in the film. I will not list the details of the plot, as these can be obtained elsewhere. But based on the technical aspects of the film, acting and, above all, its heartbreaking story, I would certainly recommend this film.
