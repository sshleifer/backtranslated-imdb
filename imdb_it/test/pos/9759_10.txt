Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan: all are unlikely heroes and survivors. Small but strong, whose strength and determination help to save lives, to march hundreds of kilometers and with calm self-discipline and persuasive powers, Joe Harman ("oh my word") who took risks for Jean and the other prisoners , only to suffer the worst imaginable pain, and Noel Strahan, who trusted Jean regardless of the odds. Her good humor and hardness inspire everyone around her and those who dare to go with her are rewarded. The beautiful scenery and the musical score add to the adventure. Despite its length, it never bored me. These ordinary people have done extraordinary things and are based on a true story. Someone loaned my VHS a few years ago and I never saw it again. I learned my lesson, comrades and will buy another copy when it can be found. It is a pity that the miniseries is not on DVD.
