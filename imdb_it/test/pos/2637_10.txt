This movie was really fun. People who expected to see a comedy worthy of the Oscars, should get by themselves. This was a fun movie to watch with interesting and fun characters, story lines, dialogue quotes and catch phrases. I consider a 10 movie if I bought the DVD, or in this case, the videocassette, and I watched it many times, and in this case, I still laughed loudly. I have about 12 films in my collection with a score of 10 and about half of them have nothing to do with the Oscars. Once again, this was just a fun and carefree movie. I hope this is released on DVD. I highly recommend checking out this movie, if you're in the mood for an extravagant comedy.
