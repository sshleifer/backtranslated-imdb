Like the first film in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake to label this film as a "blax movie". Of course, Slaughter is a tough colored man, armed with a gun, but it's more of an action scene regardless of the color of the protagonist or villains - and an excellent action movie. <br /> <br /> For the second and last time, Jim Brown plays the title character. The film begins with one of the most entertaining scenes I can remember in a movie. While Slaughter and his friends enjoy an outdoor party, a biplane arrives and starts spraying the group with machine-gun fire! No, Slaughter is not so hard that he then shoots down the plane with his .357! But Slaughter is marked and no one is sure why this happened happened - however, Slaughter is about to get to the bottom! Well, it turns out that the shot was attempted in punishment for the last movie. In it, Slaughter takes over the mafia and takes a lot of kicks down in Mexico. Now, in a horribly messy and clumsy attempt, the guys on the plane kill and injure a lot of people but they miss Slaughter. And, since the work was messed up so much, the mafia boss (Ed MacMahon !!) orders the pilot and the gunman killed by his brutal murderer (Don Stroud - in a very typical role for him). Stroud is fantastic - scary and mean in the middle, but Ed MacMahon as the boss ?! Wow, this is an interesting turn! <br /> <br /> Slaughtering is now perplexed. He discovered who the two men were on the plane, but when he arrived he found them dead. So to help him in his private revenge, Brock Peters (who plays a cop) tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the coup and made Slaughter agree to help him by doing an undercover illegal job. Then, Slaughter and her friend protector burst into the mobster's home and steal a list of profits from leading government and police officials. And of course, there are a lot of shootings and bloodshed in the process. <br /> <br /> Stroud doesn't want to let Slaughter go away and kidnap Slaughter's girlfriend. Now it's a stalemate: Slaughter has the list but if she doesn't return it, the lady is dead. Being a tough but brave man, you might be able to guess a lot about what happens next. <br /> <br /> The action is very good in the film and Jim Brown is threatening and hard. The only negative thing I noticed is that, while MacMahon plays this ugly boss, in the end, he simply folded - and too quickly. When Slaughter joins him, MacMahon becomes good for nothing and all the previous wickedness disappears - and this is too much of a clich√© and incoherent. Yet despite this small quirk, it is an engaging film that is NOT for children due to all the violence and tits.
