I too was lucky enough to see "Checking Out" with Peter Falk at the Phoenix Film Festival. This film is an extremely sweet film that leaves the audience fascinated by the difficult situation of Applebaum. More than fun, every family character contributes to a priceless comic relief that not only stimulates laughter, but also inspires some joyful tears. Peter Falk was born to play this role. He plays a "young" 90 year old father who gathers his adult children in what could be one of the most important moments of his life. The 2-day journey that the Applebaum family takes through the delightful New York background (with carefully selected characters) not only leaves the public eager for more, but nurtures their sense of family. "Checking Out" is a must-see film, not only for all those who love the family, but also all those who don't! My thanks to the director who took the opportunity to bring this GIFT to his audience.
