From a simple description of the main elements of THE TOLL GATE plot, one might think that it is a revisionist western of the 60s or 70s. <br /> <br /> * Our hero is a thief, a murderer and an arsonist; <br /> <br /> * love interest is a single mother whose husband without change has abandoned her and their child; <br /> <br /> * twice our criminal hero is "unofficially" released by the authorities in exchange for some good deed, and this is presented as a laudable act; <br /> <br /> * the only acts that are presented as truly evil are the betrayal of one's family and the betrayal of a criminal partner; <br /> <br /> * the hero tries to go straight, but returns to a life of crime after he can't find a job; <br /> <br /> * the hero is on the run both from a sheriff's gang and from a criminal gang; <br /> <br /> * the final redemption of the hero is accomplished by strangling a man with his bare hands and throwing his body on a cliff; <br /> <br /> * and the "good bad man" ends the film by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and riding alone in the Mexican desert, never (presumably) to pay for her life of crime. <br /> <br /> Just go to show you that there's nothing new under the sun. <br /> <br /> Obviously THE TOLL GATE does not show enough the moral cynicism or nihilism of its successors: the hero's redemption is established when he surrenders to the posse after reading a passage from the Bible. I can't imagine Clint Eastwood doing it. <br /> <br /> THE TOLL GATE, an excellent film of any level, and Hart was a very good actor, not addicted to the vast histrionics often used to convey emotions in the days before the sound. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
