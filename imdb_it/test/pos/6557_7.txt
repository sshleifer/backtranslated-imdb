A couple of weeks after watching this movie, I started to remember John Carpenter's In the Mouth Of Madness (not for the story!) For the atmosphere, the fast elements of surprise and the dream sequences. On the other hand, this film mixes the image and the music very well (note the 4th chapter of the film)
