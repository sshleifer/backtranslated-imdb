This is an exceptional film. It is partly comedy, partly drama, partly suspense. Dialogue is exquisite. Most of the actors and actresses were very famous in their day, and for good reason. You will probably recognize someone, even if you don't usually watch older movies. They are also each in a role that is particularly suited to their talents. <br /> <br /> A fix to make on another user comment is that two people, not one, are announced to die in the accident. Perhaps the two unfortunates reflect what the writer considers important in life. The film is too engaging to worry about what it is until it happens. <br /> <br /> History is ahead of its time, but does not lose the quality of an older film. Time and effort have been spent perfecting the view of the camera and the soundtrack, something modern film producers tend to forget.
