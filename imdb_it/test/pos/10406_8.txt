NOROI follows a documentarian, Masafumi Kobayashi, as he slowly discovers something mysterious and evil that leaves behind a trail of dead bodies. After interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud cries from children from the house next door (where there is no child), Kobayashi heads for the neighbor. He is greeted with hostility by the shocked and untidy woman (Maria Takagi) who answers the door (and immediately slams it in her face) and glances at her 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely, both the woman and her son disappear a few days after her visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on the back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noise, as well as her daughter, are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after. This complicates Kobayashi's interest and sets off to find out what is happening. He soon discovers that those with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to tune into something sinister, inexplicable and perhaps even apocalyptic. Well known 10-year-old clairvoyant and television celebrity, Kana (Rio Kanno) seems to think we could all be condemned, but she mysteriously disappears before he can be of great help. Another female actress / actress (Marika Matsumoto) is involved, as is Mr. Nori, a mentally unstable kook / psychic who wears an aluminum hat and jacket and thinks people are being eaten by what he calls "ectoplasmic worms" ". The clues eventually return to the site of a small village that is now covered by a lake, and the legend of an ancient demon known as Kagutaba ... <br /> <br /> Unlike many other horror films by hand, this depends as much on the plot as on the reactionary fear in the first person. Fortunately there is something of a plot here, a very interesting and intricate one in this, so don't rely on glimpses of horrible things through a spastic camera from time to time to keep your interest. The way in which Masafumi travels following the tracks in search of truth - with well-placed jolts along the way - reminded me a little of THE OMEN in its rhythm. The film also does not consist entirely of footage shot by the documentarian, but is interwoven in reportages and variety television programs as if what we are watching is a documentary already completed. This helps to break part of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to harm the realism of the "real" movie. Overall, it's a well-made horror film, with lots of plot turns, a bit of suspense and some really gruesome moments, it's worth a try. My only complaint is that he could have used some finishing touches here and there and it seems to go a little too long. Otherwise, pretty good stuff.
