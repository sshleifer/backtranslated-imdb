Two horse dealers arrive in a city and meet with the head of a group of Mormons who are headed to a valley where they can settle down and live in peace. The scenes of the city enclosure where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of ​​them (Johnson and his companion played by Harry Carey Jr.) who take the train to this valley, are among the best of the movies, like Johnson, a real cowboy, wields a piece of wood while he is beating with Bond. Once on the trail they meet Joanne Dru, who perhaps John Ford saw in Red River and offered her a much better part in this film. There are a number of notable characters on the Morman train. The Mormans are a peaceful group that is challenged along the way by a group of truly evil outlaws. In their case (the outlaws), in the case of the people on the train, and later a band of Navajos they meet, and in the well-written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the film completely escapes stereotypes, while the machine it seems to take a long time to take the viewer the image of Monument Valley that frames the train as it moves along some water passages along the route, in an extraordinary black and white and then returns to what is happening in this community rotating, all with the accompaniment of the beautiful vocalizations of the Pioneer Children.
