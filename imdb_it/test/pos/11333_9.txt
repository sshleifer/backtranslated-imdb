How do you describe perfection? In the mood for love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong practically dance on the screen and give star shows that stay with you a few hours after leaving the theater. Each scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and selection of shots, high-level acting and the sensual soundtrack. Nat King Cole, who sings in French, definitely sets the tone for the entire film. Maggie and Tony look wonderful, with Maggie having fun in some really glorious cheongsam and always trendy Tony. I've seen this movie several times before and every time I see it, I find something new to be excited about. I love it!
