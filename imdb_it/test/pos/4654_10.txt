Twenty years after seeing this, I still find myself citing things from this movie like "Look at the two giant melons", or I'll start singing the "Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme". On the other hand, 20 years later, I can now make sense of "Meat Machine", because there are still many stereotypes like this that they used for this film. These are the signs of a good movie for me. I could say that this film is the test of time, which I can't really say for many films of the 80s. I continue that this film is still on a list of favorite movies of many people as a kid who grew up in the 80s. If you like games and dreams of becoming a "Game Master", or you find yourself venting off on these 80s movies to relive your childhood, you have to watch them. Moreover, it is sometimes sarcastic and funny. But one thing is certain for this film, if someone ever invites you to a "Great All-Nighter" it doesn't mean an X party or an acid trip, they mean, getting ready for a Midnight Madness! Oh, you'll see. Everyone will die from the desire to play! hehehehheh.
