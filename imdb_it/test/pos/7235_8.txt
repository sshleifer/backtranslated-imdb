This trash version of `Romeo and Juliet 'switches to Manhattan today. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a member of the Que family and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy (with beautiful legs and breasts) and a bisexual girl from the Capulet family. The scatological situations that this romantic couple will have to face are very funny. Despite being a cult film (inclusive exposed in the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended for all audiences. If the viewer is a fan of Peter Jackson's previous films ("Braindead", "Bad Taste"), "Toxic Avenger", "Body Melt" and other junk movies, he will definitely love this movie. Otherwise, he will hate it. Since I belong to the first group, my vote is eight. <br /> <br />
