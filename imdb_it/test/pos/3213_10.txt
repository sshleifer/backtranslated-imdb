when the gilmore girls started in Germany I didn't want to see them because for me it was just something that wasn't unique. it was a series and even I didn't know anyone inside. later, I realized that Edward Hermann is part of the outboard cast (a movie, I absolutely love). I had to watch it once with a friend and I've never stopped since. it's just fun, you have the feeling it's good to have sex before getting married, and it's right to be a coffee addict and eat unhealthy things all the time. I don't do these things all the time but when I do these things I feel a bit like a gilmore girl. even my boyfriend started watching them and that says something. from season to season it has improved with screenplays and stories. they have an open mind and being different from any other show, you want to be like them.
