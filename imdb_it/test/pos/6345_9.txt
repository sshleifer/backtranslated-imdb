Let me start by saying that there is no fan bigger than the original "Lonesome Dove" of me. Both the Pulitzer Prize winning book and the gigantic miniseries adapted from it stand out in my experience as moving, dramatic, credible and compelling. There is no comparison between "Lonesome Dove" and any Western movie, at least not from the legendary collaborations of John Ford and John Wayne. With real reservations, I sat down to watch this new mini-series, with McMurtry not participating and with the original cast members missing. After seeing the first episode it was clear that this is not "Lonesome Dove". In almost every measurable way this sequel is not up to the original. But then what? I did not expect it to be measured. Taken as a personal effort, this film is engaging, fun and of excellent quality. If it had been made as a new story, not as a sequel to "Lonesome Dove", I have no doubt that it would not have received so many negative evaluations. Jon Voight did a worthy job like Call, Barbara Hershey was a formidable Clara, and new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well rendered and credible. Louis Gossett jr. deserves a special mention as the wrangler horse Isom Pickett. The film made me worry about the characters, and I don't ask for more than that of an actor. it is unfortunate that this worthy effort lies in the shadow of his predecessor - it is worth seeing him in his own right.
