I just saw this movie for the first time today and I loved it ... <br /> <br /> Yes, it's simple in the plot, the sweetest love story and how no female could fall in love with Callum Blue beats ... <br /> <br /> The scenario in Italy was how you would expect, Bella, the villains lost in the end and for the two lovebirds gathered at the end, it was wonderful, but that scene where a certain Italian was wiping out the confetti after Eric and Wanda's marriage, perfection !. <br /> <br /> Take a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better to have a fabric ready and be won over, I know I was and I hope to have it on DVD soon. All the actors played their parts perfectly, this was a film about the second world war in which one could believe because it was so realistic, and without going over the lines as in other films ...
