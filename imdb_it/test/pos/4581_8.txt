You can't help but admire Mike Judge for his hands on the "I've experienced that" approach. With "Office Space", almost anyone who works a job could associate with the characters. "Idiocracy" has exactly the same feeling. One can easily appreciate the experience of 505 years later than our heroes, because once again, the director tried to put things on a very human level. Similar to Woody Allen's "Sleeper", this film is a lot of fun. Don't miss the deleted scenes like the "Museum Of Fart" is a classic. Imaginative comedy is a rarity, and "Idiocracy" is incredibly imaginative, extremely entertaining and a solid cinematic experience 8.0. - MERK
