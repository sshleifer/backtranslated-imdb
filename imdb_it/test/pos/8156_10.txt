This is an exceptional all-round film. A moving experience full of real life emotions. There are lessons to be learned about American love, sex, work, religion and culture regardless of sexual preferences. <br /> <br /> Although this film is a fierce accusation of the Mormon (Church Of Latter Day Saints) belief system, any conservative faith could easily take its place. But it is a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the Mormons in no uncertain terms. Here is a faith that has imposed on the generations that believers practice polygamy! And these true believers gave up this practice because they were forced to do so by the federal government for Utah to enter the Union. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scenes portrayed in the unrated version are tasteful and surprisingly short. There is nothing here that would offend anyone with an open mind. <br /> <br /> What this film makes so obvious is that homosexuality is perfectly natural for people who are gay, because heterosexuality is for people who are straight! While love and sex are obviously very different needs, it is absolutely beautiful, beyond words, when both occur simultaneously between two adults! Deep erotic love is one of life's most precious gifts! My congratulations to the filmmakers for a job well done!
