There is something in real stories that makes them much more interesting than fiction. I guess it's the fact that truth has always been stranger than fiction. The Falcon and the Snowman tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a former alter-boyfriend and intellectual, who tries to find a job that can support and entertain him. The FBI father is able to pull the ropes and make the idealistic son work in the defense department. Boyce has little responsibility and seems to be complacent about drinking and joking with his work colleagues. However, over time, Boyce begins to learn top secret information that makes him doubt his government's morality. The idealist Boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the CIA is carrying out in all places, Australia. Boyce eventually decides to leak some of the top secret information he knows about, to the KGB. Of course, Boyce's mistake is the assumption that, since the United States is doing bad things, the USSR is the good guy. Over time, Boyce and his drug friend Lee (Penn) start selling their top secret information to the KGB. What was once idealism turns into capitalism and espionage. The strength of this film is the incredible performances of Hutton and Penn. Even if one of them starts with the best intentions, both will soon find themselves in an endless downward spiral. Excellent direction, music, everything. Not just a great movie, but one of my all-time favorites.
