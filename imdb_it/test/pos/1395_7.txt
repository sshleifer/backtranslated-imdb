Although the video cassette for many copies of this film claims to be upside down people, this is a total lie. In fact, apart from the opening segment, the film is not even a horror movie. With his sunken treasure, legions of fish and mad scientists, he is much more like a Doug McClure adventure film. Obviously, this film is not a work of art, but it is fun to watch ... Just be warned that the beginning is quite bloody.
