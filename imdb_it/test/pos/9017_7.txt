In England we often feel very attached to the British films that we like, since we are used to the usual American settings and accents. Being from London, where virtual sexuality is set, I felt a strong emotional attachment to it. The characters of Virtual Sexuality, in particular the females, are exactly like the English teenagers, it seemed to me to be almost in the movie. I immediately referred to Alex's character from the film, his shyness is quite common in most British teenage boys, especially around girls. The Virtual Sexuality made me feel really good as one of the few British films that doesn't talk about gangsters or the upper middle class, but about the people who watch the film, mediocre teenagers. Americans will not really feel the emotional attachment, but every British teenager should watch it. Anyone from London will recognize parts of the city from the movie, it certainly has a special place in my video box!
