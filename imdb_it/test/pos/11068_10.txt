Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulaine) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper in the role of "Cleent" so perfectly chosen as a laconic Texan who knows that this girl can't do any good. When the two eyes close to the French market, we know that this match will be full of sparks. When they walk in his garden in his restored house in the French quarter and the theme of love plays it is a dream for all of us romantics. <br /> <br /> The costumes are adorable; the decoration of the set makes you want the "neighborhood" to be like that. And that Saratoga still had that hotel with the large veranda with all the old gossip. <br /> <br /> From the novel by Edna Ferbers, the story is about revenge for old wrongs and struggles for those who would run the railways in the early days of that industry. <br /> <br /> In the Saratoga scenes, Florence Bates as a grand'dame steals every scene. <br /> <br /> But it is the scene of Cleo that takes the little lawyer you The relatives of New Orleans have sent to buy it out which is a magic moment of the film. After Cleo beat him in the negotiations, he looks at her with desire and says "I can say - you are very beautiful". And Cleo with a happy and evil smile says "yes, he's not lucky." You want to shout "YES" !!! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite romantic movies ever.
