THE GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) is for this viewer the best film of the year to date. It is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. More importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is a much needed mirror for us to see the immigration history of "foreigners" in America at a time when the only mention of the word "borders" is a political fuse. Writer / director Emanuele Crialese gave us not only a moving story, but also provided a touchstone for viewers to re-visit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of Native Americans, we all entered America as "foreigners" at some point in our stories, and it is humiliating to see this movie with this fact in mind. <br /> <br /> The film opens at the turn of Sicily and the poor Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climbs a rocky hill to present their tokens on the cross to ask for a sign if continue to fight for existence on the island or go to America, the land of dreams. Mancuso Pietro's deaf-mute son (Filippo Pucillo) runs up the hill with the postcards he found with images of America (money growing on trees, bigger fruits and vegetables than people, etc.) and Salvatore accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to America. After convincing reluctant mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and her sisters Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to make the trip, she sells her only goods (two donkeys, goats and rabbits) and the man with the boat organizes the trip, delivering the family's shoes, appropriate clothing and instructions to board a transatlantic as third-class passengers. While the Mancuso family is preparing to embark, a photograph is requested and while they are posing behind a painted set, an Englishwoman Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) enters the picture as if she were part of this peasant family. Lucy cannot embark for America without a male escort. <br /> <br /> The journey begins and Luce, in her gentle way, identifies with the Mancuso family, finally consolidating her safe passage by proposing to Salvatore to marry her "for convenience, not for love" when they arrive in America. Through a violent storm and appalling living conditions, the multitude of third-class passengers survives, joins and eventually arrives at Ellis Island, believing that their dream of America has been fulfilled. But everyone has to pass tough physical tests, de-louse and even intelligence tests to determine if they can enter America: officials let them know that America doesn't want genetically inferior people to enter the new world! Every woman must be selected by a man to marry on Ellis Island before being admitted. The way in which the Mancuso family remains united until a rather surprising ending is the closing of the story. <br /> <br /> Few of us understand the strict rules and the harsh treatment that immigrants face (or at least face the century themselves) on Ellis Island and, if we do, we have chosen to submerge it. THE GOLDEN DOOR presents the case of immigrant struggles in a way that not only touches our hearts, but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation. But apart from all the political problems, THE GOLDEN DOOR is first of all a film of enormous beauty, exquisite photography, performances deeply felt by a huge cast and a very sensibly written and directed story. It is a film that deserves wide circulation, a film that is a must see for everyone. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
