This is one of the great modern kung fu movies. Many reviews seem to lack the point that the comedy is based on a rather subtle contrast sometimes (sometimes right in the face) between the old and the new China. Kara Hui, for example, is called a country spinster and gets into trouble every time she tries to adapt to the new, but in the end saves her family clothes like an old-fashioned heroine, in contrast to modern military style by Hsiao Ho. Gordon Liu seems to have played his part in laughter by playing his serious character, a monk with silly wigs and a guitar. The end of the fight is simply fantastic and ends with a defeat for Johnny Wang rather than death. Kwan Yung Moon should be mentioned for his great game of a thug with "invincible armor" - simply terrifying. And Kara Hui does a wonderful acting and fighting. A great movie.
