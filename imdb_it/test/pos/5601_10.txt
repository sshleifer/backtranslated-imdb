The promise of Martin Donovan who plays Jesus was, quite honestly, enough to show me the film. Definitely worth it; smart and fun without exaggerating. Low quality footage was probably an appropriate effect but ended up being a bit too strident, and the ending sounded more like a Hartley PBS program. Still too many memorable lines and great moments for me to judge him hard.
