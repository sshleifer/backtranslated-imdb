I think this film is undervalued. For me I felt like a sip of fresh air. Some people complain about the implausibility of the plot, the too long sequences and the lack of sex (the latter is, I believe, the main reason for the "implausibility", and why are there no drunk teenagers who speak dirty?!); but it's not their thing, and it's good for them if they can't relate to the story. The performances are great; I would love to see other actors in other films. Emotions are genuine. The whole unrequited love thing is presented with unsettling subtlety. And it gives you the tense feeling you expect to get from a good movie.
