This is a prematurely well-adapted talkie adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's comedy. Its main disadvantage is a static camera, and consequently it comes out almost all the time the comedy is played, which is a pity, because it is a beautiful piece of primitive film, made at a time when the sound posed all kinds of technical problems, and as a result most films were experimental regardless of whether this was the intention of their producer. Garbo is mysterious and charismatic as he was in his silent films, and his entrance is still classic. His voice is strangely deep, almost childlike, which does nothing but enhance his already seductive and eccentric personality. Like his fianc√©, Charles Bickford is appropriately virile, - he was apparently born steep - and a perfect counterpart to the divine Garbo. His Irish accent is not bad at all, and he always seems a natural man of the sea, very O'Neill in his independent and thoughtful nature. As a (very) confused father of Garbo, George Marion really looks like from another era. It has the type of face and voice, - open, without intelligence, totally devoid of cunning - which has disappeared from the earth. Marie Dressler is also in the swing of things O'Neill. His empty expression and intensity around his eyes speaks for a long time, while he interprets his character as drunk as a woman sometimes on the verge of psychosis. Poetic license, perhaps, since it is not in the script, but we can forgive the excesses of Miss Dressler; she's too good at it. The story ends with a movement towards the next thing, distinct from the resolution, which is not the author's cup of tea; and those who like their films, in the end, will be disappointed by the absence of a real surprise. In Anna Christie we are in the country of O'Neill, a place of sea, storms and fog, a feeling of all-pervasive uncertainty and damnation, which we would call ambiguity or anxiety neurosis. Rather than analyzing this state of mind, the author presents it in a simple and wise way, while time, the earth, the ocean and people intertwine and touch each other in a unique language that seems privileged to have heard.
