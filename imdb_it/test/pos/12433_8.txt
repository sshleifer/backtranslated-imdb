Before watching this film from beginning to end, I happened to take the last half hour. Normally I don't watch a movie if I haven't seen it since the beginning, but a friend has it and when I started watching it I couldn't stop. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised this movie didn't have much theatrical success. This is a pretty funny movie (often the mood of the gallows), and the monster and the monster truck in it are quite threatening. The monster makes Leatherface look pretty, and the monster truck is a cross between a German WWII artillery vehicle and a giant coffin. <br /> <br /> A shy twenty-five-year-old virgin makes a long journey to stop the woman he loves from getting married. His ex-best friend follows him and constantly shreds him. They are threatened on the road by a vintage hearse and by the monstrous monster truck. They also pick up a hitchhiker, played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks. <br /> <br /> I also looked at the animated trailer with the director's comment and the electronic press kit and found that both were interesting. I bet the commentary on the director and the two male stars is a lot of fun, but I have so many other movies to watch that I've never seen before ....
