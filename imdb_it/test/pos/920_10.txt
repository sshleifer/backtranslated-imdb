The biggest movie ever. <br /> <br /> How does it go in a contest? However, if we look through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colors Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough to simply say this: Three Colors Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not really very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both need to step back, then Three Colors Red is the first masterpiece of all time. As a discussion of human morality, Three Colors Red works on an intensely metaphysical level, with a depth that no one can match. The blue came almost into the human psyche, but stopped as he was about to pull the rabbit out of his hat. White forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this, in retrospect, was even better, but still not quite there. Red, however, is the real thing. What it expresses in this film is an expression of what it means to be human. In reality, what it expresses is how it feels to be human. It forces us to examine the minute details, the very nature of our souls, of our ethical selves. In Red, meaning can be found on one of its different levels. On the first level, Red reaches a high level of verisimilitude - we couldn't have problems calling Red an exceptionally funny story. However, the coincidences inherent in the film and its alleged forcing force us to examine the film as a movie. It is as if Kieslowski said: "Ceci n'est pas la réalité". Indeed, in pursuing a humanistic objective, Kieslowski can also challenge reality. It is a trick that Kieslowski has attempted since Le Double Vie de Véronique, but until now, his final film, he has finally managed to reach this divine intertwining of destiny, philosophy and circumstance. Actors and actresses also seem to be at the mercy of greater power. Valentine (Irène Jacob), is rightly the name, since it seems to represent an almost pure love. Meanwhile, the idea of ​​first impressions is being questioned by Judge Kern of Jean-Louis Tritignant, an irascible man, who eventually becomes an almost omniscient observer of events - a character who seems symbolically to possess the power to gather characters - a power to make people happy, a power that could only be achieved through Valentine. <br /> <br /> We have the ability to view movies as something more than a series of images. In fact, films have the potential to have more meaning than literature. Obviously it will not happen, but at least we have the power to see this film, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve something that we cannot define, but that we all possess. A synopsis of this film reads: "A film about a woman hitting a dog". Well it is. <br /> <br /> Isn't it true? <br /> <br /> -Simon Huxtable <br /> <br />
