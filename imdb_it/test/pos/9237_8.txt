This film would be especially fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially in any indie capacity ... those whose legacy includes a cinematic introduction may not appreciate it as well. I'm hard to please in the documentary category. This doc is different though- his pleasure comes from an earthy realism of punk indie directors who are a hoot to be around and watch. Whether you've ever wondered what it means to be in the movies, in front of or behind the camera, or if you've made your way through the indie world, sometimes painful and hard but rewarding, you'll surely enjoy this movie.
