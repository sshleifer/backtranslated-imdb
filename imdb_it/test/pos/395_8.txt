Victor Mat√©, as a mountain man and mad hunter, mostly civilian and mostly out of control, could be on the poster, but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to "cut ribbons" from the Confederate artillery to Shiloh, and is sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence, he has the most interesting part, married to a young and difficult to recognize at first Anne Bancroft. The uncivilized passion matures for the colonel's wife, giving the film an interesting and even obscure subplot that goes so far as to hatch another man's wife at one point from James Whitmore who plays the most mature and wise father figure of mature. Directed by Anthony Mann, this film is lost among his most famous westerns with James Stewart, but even so you don't really need the Indian threat to make this movie worth seeing, even though Preston tries his bad judgment as a commanding officer of new in an expedition failed to finally bring the submissive Indians, in a well-organized attack between the forest that quickly turns into a route.
