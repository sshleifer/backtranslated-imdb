A great show. <br /> <br /> First, to people who don't like it ... Don't like it, so DON'T WATCH IT ... <br /> <br /> This is (was) a fantastic show. Better than Jim says (one of my favorites). Show a REAL family of family (as opposed to 8 simple rules, etc., where everything goes peachy). <br /> <br /> They are noisy, they are messy ... I can sympathize with their drag in the kitchen. It happens in real life ... It is like the "Portal of Hell", and everyone growls like dogs on fast-food boxes. <br /> <br /> It's a show "I've been there" .... You know what's coming, but fun to watch, because you've been there before. <br /> <br /> A good cast, they work great together, a show admirable enough to justify a DVD version. Mel Gibson's "security videos" were also a highlight of the series. <br /> <br /> Opinion? A beautiful show, deservedly worthy of a DVD version (worthy of not being deleted as well).
