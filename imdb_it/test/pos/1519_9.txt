this film has blocked me in this endless cycle of thinking about it for days ... conceded that I'm not the cinema snob that looks like there are some people around here, but I thought it was incredibly well done and a powerful creation, if one is missing little subtlety in execution. I happen to admire films that can effectively recreate the feeling of watching a theatrical game, creating a disharmonious strangeness that works well with this film. I'm also a big fan of alan rickman, so this could be my prejudice. personally I found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing - this could indeed be everywhere, and probably it is. I say go easy on what was a powerful experience for me and probably for anyone involved in any kind of political activity.
