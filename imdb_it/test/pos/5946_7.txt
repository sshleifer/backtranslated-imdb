A rather funny parody with great attention to detail: the appearance of the espionage films of the 1960s and the way the action was staged. The fighting sequence in the hotel room was a blast and the casting was perfect with a Peter Lorre lookalike added to the bad mix. A big advantage: Jean Dujardin is enthusiastic and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight. Furthermore his eyebrows deserve a sort of recognition to do a great job. <br /> <br /> Funny aside: the people behind me in the theater kept rattling after each twist as if they were watching a "real" espionage thriller. <br /> <br /> Before the film began, a "Get Smart" trailer was shown. The preview made the film seemingly embarrassing with lame attempts to incorporate the TV series jokes and gags. It looks like a bomb and rather a contrast to the relatively comparative jokes and gags of OSS 117, although, of course, the OSS had its share of mishaps. The general tone of OSS, however, was not an insult to the intelligence of the public, and the material did not feel as if it had been "speechless". I had the distinct impression that if I understood the language, I would have captured more than one line, and one in particular (the pistol of the gun) was mishandled in the interpretation of the subtitles.
