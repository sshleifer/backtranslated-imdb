With Nurse Betty (2000), the acclaimed independent director Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) enters the big budget (Betty $ 24 million against the company's miserable $ 25,000), a mainstream realm - and yet remains true to its roots. While his cast is now composed of Hollywood series A names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman and comedian Chris Rock), his material remains bizarre and bizarre as his first two features, proving that it could be the next big thing. Nurse Betty has been one of the darkest comedies to be advertised to mainstream audiences for years, and considering her moderate box office and critical success, perhaps the spectators were not as stupid and brainwashed as we thought. The story follows (both figuratively and literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who fell in love from afar with a beautiful soap star (As Good As It Gets by Greg Kinnear) but is trapped in a loveless marriage with a slimy retailer of car (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big screen debut in Company). When her husband is brutally murdered by two hit men (Freeman and Rock), she is upset and unconditionally realizes that Hollywood meets her object of affection, unaware of the fact that he is only an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car he took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they hit the road and it is scandalous. Fans of previous LaBute work may find it difficult to understand how this could be the same guy who directed In the Company of Men - a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs playing a deaf a deaf collaborator - but when you think about it, the connection is quite clear: in Company, a vulnerable woman is not aware of having been ruthlessly exploited. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is not aware that the man who is chasing thinks that her true worship is nothing but a joke. Someone might start to wonder if LaBute is really a kind of misogynist himself - considering that his recurring theme is about the fall of innocent women. But personally, I think he is coming to the defense of the fair sex and is dealing much more severely with the drug addicts in his paintings than the abused ones. One of the many talents of this film is that the absurdity is to all intents and purposes: many directors, in managing a script like this, would leave the story to two hit men who pursue a woman who pursues a dream. But LaBute knows this best, and even one of the assassins (Freeman) is obsessive about Betty. This was an interesting role for Freeman, because it allowed him to play his "this-is-the-last-time" character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and the fetid Hard Rain of 1998); the supporting cast also includes the famous Weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the future), Allison Janney and `Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by neophytes John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously exaggerated (honestly: have you ever seen a play - or ANY film, for that matter - in which a man is pawed his dining room?). You could argue that the ending is a bit too perfect, but it's not really worth denying everything that is good about the movie for a trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is a sign of what LaBute has in store for us, you can bet I'll stand in line for whatever I decide to follow. <br /> <br /> Vote: A-
