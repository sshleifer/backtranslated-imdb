This film shows a serious side of the thought often of works of fulcrum gore-fest. There is not much blood and guts here, but a good story about the murder and the lives that are affected. <br /> <br /> A real discovery, considering that it was made in 1972 and that it will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary. /> <br /> Take a look at this, but be warned that it's hard to find! <br /> <br /> Ron
