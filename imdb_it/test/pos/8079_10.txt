In the year 2000 (keep in mind, this is two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous artwork on this side of the Mississippi. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delightful TV movie that describes the story of a band of second stringer (hence the title) being pushed into position of starter due to an order of oysters. Due to the motivational direction of both director Robert Lieberman and last minute of Buffalo Bills, Dan "Give'em hell" Heller (played by Canadian actor, Gil Bellows) the Super Bowl snake. -Bitten Bills are in the final position. <br /> <br /> With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflicts, a love story, a camaraderie that only the beautiful sport of football can bring, and a general theory that the loser can compete, Second String is a excellent movie worthy of seeing every possible moment that appears on TNT. <br /> <br /> The only potentially negative thing about this production is the spelling of the name of costume designer Jenifur Jarvis. <br /> <br />
