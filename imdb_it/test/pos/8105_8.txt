I once discovered a 20 minute portion of this film on Turner Classic Movies about 6 months ago. I thought that every minute of what I was looking at was gold and, since it was somewhere in the middle of the film and I didn't want to ruin everything if I saw it from the beginning, I decided I would rent it right away. Well, the video store I frequent had no copy of it, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. I had precedents to this experience having seen only a few Chaplin shorts, amusing but not very skilled, but after seeing the fragment of The Great Dictator, I checked three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush and Modern Times (City Lights were fantastic, I found the Gold Rush a bit overrated, but still useful, and I found Modern Times one of the funniest movies I've ever seen (the second funniest, behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more exactly). <Br /> <br /> Finally, all the Great Dictator. Well, to be honest, he had his moments, both of comedy and drama, but these moments don't always mix well. Chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama (City Lights is the best example), but it does not always work with social commentary, and the fact that there was a dialogue has attenuated the grandeur of Chaplin's talent. Don't get me wrong, I liked the film a whole , but I thought that not would have had no consequence: I would have given a solid 7/10 to the scale of the votes. .if not for the ending. The last speech given by the Jewish barber is enormously powerful. Yes, it is addressed to the tempora et mores of 1940, but its message is perfectly applicable to today's world. The speech made me cry and I consider it one of the best endings I've ever seen. Final score: 8/10.
