Although this film starts with the usual: something goes wrong, spacecraft crashes, people are stuck, etc., Still comes off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas. Riddick is somehow a bad prisoner and has changed his eyes so that he is able to see in the darkness which is a highly sought after skill due to the situation in which the crew and the ship enter. The cut in the film is very good and emphasizes the mysticism that envelops the anti-hero and the male protagonist: "Riddick". The story of Pitch Black is, as already mentioned, to some extent very unoriginal and unsatisfied, but the cropping and cutting of the film mixed with some surprising elements that have been added to the story help keep it still very well and one is later left with a feeling of hybrid satisfaction and more hunger. Vin Diesel behaves really well in the role of Riddick and even though his character is a tough, tough survivor, he makes moral decisions almost to the brink of good, but that doesn't mean that his decisions don't turn into his favor eventually. .. Why destroy an already perfect reputation? All in all this is a very nice film but not perfect. The story seems very unoriginal on the surface, but below it shines with enough originality to entertain. Some scenes have that wow factor while overall it's a bit better than average. It could perhaps be described as a cult film and is certainly a recommendation for people who want a spicy science fiction story mixed with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely Riddick.
