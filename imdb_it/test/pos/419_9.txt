Everywhere I've heard that people call this show bad because its premise is too far-fetched ... well, maybe a good taxi driver in Philly is pushing him a bit (at least the taxi drivers met), but that's what makes it show is fantastic. <br /> <br /> The fact that this show is a bit out of reality is a problem, but it's still fun and entertaining. It's highly watchable and even though you know Mike wins in the end he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the lead role. His supporting cast is fantastic and I must say that the location of the show is particularly beautiful! <br /> <br /> Overall I watch this show not because I'm looking for a good dose of reality or a show with a lot of action, I watch this show because it has fantastic acting, a good premise and a great storyline every week. It is also an advantage when I can locate the reference points you guide, or know which intersection is at. I love this show and I love Philly !! Give this show a show!
