Hi all you adorable Dirty Dancing fans !!!! I came across this forum when I got bored one day and I think it's cool. I love DD! I saw it for the first time at my friends' house when I was 13 (now I am 17) and I fell in love with it !! I saw it there at least another 10 times and shortly after I bought the DVD for myself. At this point, I memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever someone asks me. "Did I bring a watermelon ?! '' It became so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded the song by Micky and Sylvia, and now it's the ringtone on my phone !! Most of my friends think it's a shit movie, but I don't care what they think, I know it's great! I was reading the comments first and have some questions for you - 1. Why are you asking trivial questions like what age Lisa and Baby are? I don't think it matters so much. Are they teenagers in the 60s, isn't it enough? 2. Where did you get this special edition you're talking about? It sounds VERY interesting ... Please answer this. I would like to see the opinions of other fans ... Greetings! charliesangel415 xxx
