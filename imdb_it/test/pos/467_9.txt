Actually, I had thought of investing in this film when Gorman was out raising money. I loved most of the script but I didn't like the ending. Gorman insisted that the ending was as it should have been. <br /> <br /> Seeing the completed film I must say that I am amazed. Reading the script I had not imagined that acting (and Gorman's directing) would be as powerful and moving as it is here. The two protagonists have done a great job. They were very credible and it is worth watching this movie only for the performances of these two wonderful stars. <br /> <br /> Now, for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie, please do not read more deeply before you have to see the movie (I really wish I had never read the script, so I could have experienced the movie that ended in first person.) <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two main problems with the film. First of all, and I'm sure I mentioned it when I read the script, the wife should have died. If she died, the ending would be much more credible. As it is, we have this guy who was tormented by a woman who left him "years ago". If she left him and is still in love after so long, he should be seriously disappointed. But he does not come across this in the script. (There is also the problem of why he did not spend all this energy going after the wife he still loves.) <br /> <br /> Furthermore, if the wife died, we would actually be able to believe that they had a rewarding , mutual love, and so I think the boy is pretty devastated because the ending is reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, I don't buy Daphne who does what she does in the finale. I need a lot of convictions to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore but believable for Bohl's performance) did what she did. The character is simply not cold enough. And if he did it for some kind of love, or something else, then there's a whole piece of the missing movie / story. <br /> <br /> Much of this film is reminiscent of "Sex, Lies, and Videocassette." I think it could have been so popular if Gorman had chosen to give the film a more believable ending. <br /> <br /> So watch the movie, enjoy the performance. And get your idea.
