Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political, government and well-written TV dramas in the last 25 years. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb, the writing is spectacular. <br /> <br /> Diry War reveals the real side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear, biological and radiological terrorist attack here on American soil. <br /> <br /> Dirty War should be turned into an important movie: it's so beautiful! I highly recommend this great drama to all those who wish to know the truth. <br /> <br /> This television movie reveals how British Intelligence (MI5 and MI6) attempts to expose a terrorist plot and a conspiracy to destroy innocent victims, due to England's involvement in the Iraq war. <br /> <br /> Even the scenes from different parts of London, in England, are spectacular. <br /> <br /> Dirty War is a must see !!!
