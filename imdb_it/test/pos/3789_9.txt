Considering all the comedies with a military situation that was made in history, someone had to be the first. It could be said that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that it was a bold move then. If you consider that some of the best films involving characters like Bob Hope, Abbott and Costello, Laurel & Hardy have involved military service and done during the war, it's just something you accept and laugh. <br /> <br /> In the First World War Chaplin and his companions Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford participated in bond tours. He was a great supporter of the Allied cause, unusual for any of his leftist views. It would seem natural that the tramp would have been drawn up and unfortunately he would have turned around and destroyed everything. <br /> <br /> Many of the things you would see in World War II service comedies began with Arms on Shoulder. Chaplin had no more imitators because within a few weeks of the film's release, the war was over. <br /> <br /> But a comic art form had been created by one of the greatest geniuses of comedy.
