As a longtime admirer of the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge" and a more recent admirer of the Jean Renoir film, I knew that sooner or later I would inevitably see his "French Cancan". The film tells a fictional story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. The entrepreneur Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to transform the washerwoman of Montmartre Nini (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) into a cancan star, without arousing the anger of her stormy lover, Lola's belly dance (Maria Felix). This is just one of the many love triangles in "French Cancan" - true to the stereotype, these French performing artists always fall in love. <br /> <br /> Renoir directs with his typical kind humor and attention to supporting characters, and has also written the lyrics of a beautiful waltz song in the foreground in the film. Gabin perfectly embodies the aging of the French playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead who keeps her in dance numbers, except for some twists in which a double is obviously used. <br /> <br /> "French Cancan" is advertised as a musical comedy and while there are many musical numbers taking place on the nightclub stage, etc., only one character, Casimir, breaks his song in the middle of conversation. The actor who plays him, Philippe Clay, is fun to watch - a very tall, thin young man who sings, dances and writhes. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a long sequence of cancan, as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together. The dance is much more brilliantly illuminated and coherently modified than "Moulin Rouge"; in fact, if I have a complaint about "French Cancan", it's that the whole thing is a little too technicolor. Even when Nini experiences the heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song, the lighting is bright and flat, without shadows that intrude. Yes, the result is a cheerful and warm musical comedy; it's just that I can't help thinking that things have never been so colorful and innocent in real life.
