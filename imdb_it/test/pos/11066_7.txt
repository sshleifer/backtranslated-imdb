"Saratoga Trunk" is a 1945 film with Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It is based on a 1941 book by the great Edna Ferber. In the subconscious he may have had Gone with the wind on his brain; parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. <br /> <br /> Set in 1890, Clio Dulaine is an illegitimate child who returns from New Orleans from France with a mulatto servant (Flora Robson) and a dwarf servant, Cupidon (Jerry Austin). She is given a title of Countess and claims to be a widow. Her mother accidentally killed her father and her family avoided her. Clio takes over the old farm with the idea of ​​embarrassing her father's sister and wife, which she does with great attention to herself. Her plan is to marry a very wealthy person who can give her the security and respectability she craves. Then he sees Clint Maroon (Cooper), a Texas player, and falls in love with him. The two have an unstable relationship - and he has no money, so he can't marry him - so he leaves for Saratoga Springs. Eventually the Dulaine family has had enough, and their lawyer gives her $ 10,000 to get out of the city. She does. He goes to Saratoga Springs and chases the owner of the railway, Bart von Steed. But Clint is always around. <br /> <br /> Bergman is beautiful with dark hair and wearing period costumes, and Cooper is gorgeous with that incredible 300-watt smile. How she could resist him is beyond me. And the love scenes - whoa, what chemistry! The supporting cast is excellent, Robson and Cupidon create interesting characters, and Florence Bates offers an excellent performance as a woman of social importance who brings Clio under his wing, knowing that he is a great fake. <br /> <br /> The film performs a bit long, and some of the recitations may seem outdated today, but it's a compelling story full of atmosphere and vivid performances. The ending will not come as a surprise. It's a fun journey, though.
