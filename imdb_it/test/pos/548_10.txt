Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). Here's how the movie starts. Adele decided that she and her daughter would move to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband for no reason. The story is about the relationship between mother and daughter. It's really deep and moving, thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated for a Golden Globe for that role. She's one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen, and so is Sarandon. They really look like a mother daughter. Even the soundtrack is fantastic. The film is incredible. * 10 out of 10 *
