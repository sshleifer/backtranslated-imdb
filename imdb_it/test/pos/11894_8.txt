I saw the film and I am very happy to see a film so different in the characters and in the story for the stupid, main American productions. It is a film with an interesting background for young people like all age groups. Contrary to certain reviews, the public seems to divide my evaluation because the film is very successful, wherever it has been exploited all over the world. For example in the Netherlands it was ranked at number 3. Negative statements must be respected, but they should be expected to be guided on a factual basis. If you have the chance, watch the movie and enjoy it.
