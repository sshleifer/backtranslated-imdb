I sympathized with the plight of the first man, Schmitter, whom we see killed in this episode. It reminded me of the trepidation associated with being a solitary security guard during the night somewhere - the kind of work I did briefly about 20 years ago. Of course, I have never been in danger of being burned to become crunchy, as the head of the colony (Lynch) is fond of describing. The monster in the dark here, which kills members of a deep mining colony, creates a frightening impression in the first act. We don't really see it in the first scenes and, as many of us know, the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination. 'Big and shaggy' is a sound description, but it actually looks like a big, big pepperoni pizza, hurtling across the ground like a silicon centipede - a limitation on the show's budget, unfortunately. This also shows the latest opaque painting, famous for Trek fans, the only way to convey a long rundown of mining operations. <br /> <br /> But the whole theme of this episode is about what's inside, rather than external appearances, anyway. Of course, this Horta, a recently discovered form of silicon based life, seems at first sight a brainless monster. Thanks to Spock's telepathic ability (probably the best use of a Vulcan mental fusion for plot purposes), we learn that it is an extremely intelligent, even sophisticated creature. In addition to the instrumental use of his talent by Spock, McCoy manages to displace his usual medical routine, treating a creature similar to rocks or asbestos. He also manages to pronounce one of his most famous phrases: "I am a doctor, not a mason!" I found it very realistic in his scene where he rejoices in his success, even if he can't convince Kirk to share his enthusiasm: Kirk is too busy organizing the results. The episode throws unexpected blows in the character and motivation to the public as the story progresses; Spock claims the need to preserve this life discovered while Kirk takes his usual position in preventing the death of any red shirt (without half measures, as in "The Man Trap"). But later, it is Kirk who, for some reason, holds a deadly shot, as if the heat of the chase had vanished and he had time to reflect on Spock's point (I think it was during the shooting of this episode that Shatner has known that his father was dead). Unusual for most of the first season, this has a happy ending. The conflict stems from the needs of basic capitalism, such as fulfilling standard quotas, with respect to protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants - a version of the space age of protecting owls from tractors of modern progress. Somehow, despite the numerous killings and the feeling that everything could go to hell at any time with a raised phaser, Kirk and Spock manage to negotiate a deal that satisfies everyone. I imagine that people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century.
