"The Couch Trip" is one of those silly comedies that came out of the 80s. In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who acts as a psychiatrist, and goes to Beverly Hills to undergo Charles Grodin. Most of the film's mood comes from their satirical gaze in Beverly Hills and the empty lives of people (a woman has a power struggle with her maid). <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie you only watch to have a good time. Don't expect any kind of religious experience. But most likely you'll laugh a lot about how the people of Beverly Hills flaunt their wealth. Also played by Walter Matthau, Donna Dixon, Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson (of "UHF").
