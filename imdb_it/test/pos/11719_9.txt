An intense and obscure action drama with unusually rich support from Casey, Keith, et. al, many of whom get the best roles in their careers and run with it. The film has a strange shape: often the action slows down only to let the characters get caught in seemingly improved but well-made dialogues - during the picketing, almost the whole "Machine" is captured by perfectly delivered humorous monologues - and the director Reynolds deserves a lot of credit for making Reynolds' star back and giving him space. And unlike most action movies, you really like the characters, which makes the second half, when their various fates, good and bad, take place, in an unusual way. The combination of character development, brutal violence, a jazz soundtrack (Tarantino must be a fan - watch this and then "Jackie Brown" and you'll see what I'm talking about) makes this film occasionally imperfect (The villains are a bit melodramatic) one of the best modern detective films, and in my mind superior to many of the overrated modern names like "Body Heat" and so on.
