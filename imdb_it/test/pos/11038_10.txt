This World War II Popeye cartoon had very nice gags in sight, and was definitely above average for its genre. It was also well designed, with some great angles, good details and .... well, lots of interesting things. <br /> <br /> What amounts to is Popeye in the sea in his boat and accidentally running in a small Japanese boat, with two boys on it. (Incidentally, why were the "Japs" always depicted with large round glasses and peeled teeth?). <br /> <br /> However, these innocent-looking Japanese sailors want Popeye to sign a peace treaty. Oh boy, the naive Popeye thinks, "wait until the admiral sees it!" In one of those great art scenes that I alluded to above, we see slowly how that small Japanese ship is really a great destroyer ..... and Popeye is deep ... er, water! "Why, duplicate the Ja-pansies!", Our Sailor Man screams. <br /> <br /> Getting out of the situation is fun to watch.
