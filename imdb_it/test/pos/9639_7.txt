A good video of ships and planes of the First World War complements this excellent drama set in the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no space for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission must always come first. Robert Montgomery is the lieutenant who has not yet learned the role a leader must play in combat. He makes bad decisions, endangering the submarine and his crew, but eventually becomes a "real man" after being martial and fired from the Navy. Robert Young plays the role of lieutenant junior grade and Jimmy Durante as a cook. At the same time the war drama is an equally important war love triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans who plays Huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically wounded aviator. Recommended.
