Bottom has been my favorite sitcom since I saw it on t.v and the film is even better if you are a huge fan I say it is a forced purchase !!! the plot is that Eddie and Ritchie run a hotel called Paradise guest house but all is not well for them as customers leave until a famous actress comes to try and make it better to impress her but not all is well, this is a British education cinema so buy it and you will get wet with laughter. also played by Simon Peggi (shaun of the dead) and also bill neigh (actually love) may not be good at the box office or on the look of it on this site but don't listen to them buy this and I swear I will love it
