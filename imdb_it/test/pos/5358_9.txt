Wallace and Gromit are the main characters of some of the best cartoons ever made. The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "A Grand Day Out", "The Wrong Trousers" and even "A Close Shave" some of the best animated movies ever shown on television. By winning several Oscars and countless other awards, Nick Park became quite the popular man in the UK, but his impact on the United States was not great. After the third short film by Wallace and Gromit, there was all this speculation about a feature film by Wallace and Gromit, yet nothing had happened for years. Then in 2000 instead of a feature film by Wallace and Gromit, we get another brilliant claymation film from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which was nominated for best film at the Academy Awards. Perhaps it was the success of this film that eventually pushed Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project. <br /> <br /> Five years later (this type of film takes a long time to know) and a lot of waiting, Wallace and Gromit finally arrive on the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and the marketing campaign, this film offers in many ways. This film will be a pleasure for children and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden under the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly succeeds in attracting both children and adults. This rather difficult technique is the one that only Pixar has already perfected and that DreamWorks has had a lot of problems lately. Although the DreamWorks logo is slapped on the poster, this film comes mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are the first to run a business that protects citizen crops from the ruin of rabbits, which, apparently, had gone wild and in large numbers lately. Their activity gave them much respect from the other inhabitants of the city because a giant vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace attempts to manipulate rabbits to not like vegetables and then a large eating machine is unleashed on the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and prevent it from eating away through the gardens and even their approval by the citizens. To add to this, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who also captured the attention of a snobby suitor with the name of Victor. Plot is simple, yes, but there is more than it seems, get ready for some fun surprises along the way, a bit like in the other cartoons by Wallace and Gromit. <br /> <br /> In animated films with few dialogues, it is the animation that has to set the rhythm and mood of the film. Although it takes 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the reward is fantastic. There is an enormous amount of detail that requires more than one visualization to really notice it. Even more incredible than a detailed and almost impeccable animation is the indescribable amount of visual humor in the film. Whether it is a creative shot or normal labels placed in the most enjoyable position possible, or they are the so adorable rabbits that are constantly shown in the film, the humor of Curse of the Were-Rabbit comes mainly from the simple watching of the movie itself taking all the references before it's too late. Imagine only the Madagascar movie, except the funniest references to pop culture and the best animations. <br /> <br /> The casting was great, although in a film with little dialogue, it wasn't that important. Peter Sallis still does a great job as Wallace, although in this film there was no quote that could be used at any time (The Wrong Pants: "They are the wrong Gromit pants, and they were wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes does a great job as Victor, the villain, and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult movie "Fight Club") which confers her beautiful voice while interpreting Wallace's love interest. Although nothing could overcome the final pursuit of "The Wrong Trousers", Curse of the Ware-Rabbit had a lot of action scenes, including a fantastic chase scene between Gromit and Victor's bad dog. Last but not least, rabbits really steal the show in some moments. Whether it's their cute expressions, their funny movements or their howling, the rabbits in the movie even get a bit of the glory of the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the film is the same "damn" rabbit, until the end of the film made the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Although not as memorable as "The Wrong Pants" ", this film is just as good and fun as Chicken Run. Unlike almost all the films released this year, the film is not it drags at all, reaching only 85 minutes, but with still so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone looking at it asking for more. There is very little wrong in the film, it was a real pleasure to watch. This film is a total contrast of decent films. but vulgar, untrimmed, rough they made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40 years, Virgin Crashers and Sin City) and for families and those who want to be harmless fun, that's a good thing. heartily, this is the best animated film released this year and among the best we've seen in this decade Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the werewolf rabbit: totally harmless fun from the second 1 to the second 5.100.
