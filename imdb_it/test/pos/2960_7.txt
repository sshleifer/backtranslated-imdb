A wounded Tonto standing alone to protect three innocent lives. A devious woman who creates a deadly plot. Racial tensions. Smart Indians. <br /> <br /> These are things we have rarely seen in the TV series, but this film adds them all to the mix. Although this is definitely a Lone Ranger film, it mixes the formula just enough for those who are tired of the series that will probably appreciate it again. Definitely recommended for any fan.
