if you're dating a girl who's in wicca! <br /> <br /> many parts of this film have been murderous and the feeling you get from this movie while you watch it and after that it is enough on its own to sit around anything but a little things really bothered me about this movie that I can't understand ... <br /> <br /> I think this film is one that every art student or photography student should see the b / c of the camera style and graininess that I've never seen, but that's right ... it seems that an art student has made it and the plot, if there is one, is so nervous that you really need to do a lot of drugs to get what's going on
