Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are as brilliant as Sir and his Dresser. Obviously the game is brilliant to begin with and nothing can be compared to the immediacy and collegiality of the theater, and I think you listen better in the theater; but on the screen we become more intimate, we are more 'close' than we are in the theater, we see subtle changes in the expression, "we see" better and we listen. Both the game and the film are wonderful: moving, intelligent, enlightening - of the social background, of the historical context, of the two main characters and of the parallel characters in "Lear" itself. If you can't see it in a theater (I don't imagine it's produced much these days) then please do yourself a favor and take the video.
