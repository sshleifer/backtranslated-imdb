Harvey Keitel offers a high-level performance in one of his first starring roles as Colony Buckmaster, the young, brave, ambitious and uncompromising personal producer, a real talented hot shot with a "golden ear" and son of a famous jazz pianist start. Coleman is eager to cut some tracks with the group's R & B Smokin 'outfits (none other than Earth, Wind & Fire in their first incredibly funky), but his rigidly commercial label A-Chord Records is run by -the-road square Jerry (a true dislocation of Ed Nelson) wants to record a successful single for the unbearably popular Carpenters pop trio, the Pages, a seemingly clean and exquisite group that includes a skinny pedophile stepfather Franklin (a perfect cowardly Bert Parks), the bitch, neurotic daughter Velor (a beautiful, fickle turn from the lively, handsome brunette Cynthia Bostwick), and her hedonist son Gary (former fifty-year-old of the sitcom Jimmy Boyd). Coleman, extremely naive and idealistic, must immediately learn how the music business really works and play the dirty game as low as possible, or lose both the Group and its credibility. <br /> <br /> Adopting an acrid, incisive script, corrosively harsh and distinctly incorrect by the journalist and rock journalist Robert Lipsyte, the director Sig Shore (the most famous producer of "Superfly") shows a decidedly cynical and unflattering representation of the various bribes, pay offs, broken promises, back-agreements, duplicates and double-games that are an unpleasant part, but intrinsic to the largely corrupt rock music business, with particularly thoughtful thematic topics concerning Art against trade, struggle to maintain one's own artistic integrity, and the recent push to homogenize rock into insignificant, respectable, creatively stagnant and traditional respectability. Furthermore, this gritty and pessimistic gem offers a fascinating, meticulous and meticulous behind-the-scenes insight into the recording process, such as the recording console cowboy Coleman struggling with his own words to "prepare the chicken salad with the chicken". Appearing in nifty bits are the disc jockey and the legendary "fifth Beatles" Murray the K as the dancing and lascivious DJ Big John Little (Velor bites his hand after Big John scratches his thigh during an on-air live interview! ), New York soul DJ and the host of "Friday Night Videos" by NBC Frankie Crocker as his jazzy'n'jivin 'self, R & B singer-songwriter Doris Troy (wrote the adorable "Just One Look") as church pianist, and tubby, balding 70s the blaxploitation favorite Charles MacGregor as a marriage priest. The rather poor sound and the sloppy cinematography of Allan Metzger inadvertently adds to the general authenticity of the film, rough and rough, the film. Although technically a bit lacking, this film continues to be regarded as one of the biggest, incredibly pessimistic backstage gems of the shocking 70s.
