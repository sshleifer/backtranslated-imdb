"Half Empty" is an exhilarating musical about the eternal optimist ?? in this case, a self-help writer who goes to Germany wrongly thinking he is popular there. Instead of an adoring audience, he finds himself adrift in a world of exhausted misanthropes, including the woman who should be his publicist. His attempts to make friends in scenes that are largely improvised lead to one big fight after another when he is verbally abused by nihilistic musicians, grumpy gangsters, etc. Over time, he manages to win over his publicist, both she and her heart and his mind - but his vision of the world is shaken when his hero, a much more popular self-help writer, turns out to be not quite what it seems. The action is punctuated by different musical numbers. <br /> <br /> We saw it at the DeadCenter film festival in Oklahoma City and we were amazed. This is a very entertaining and inspired small-scale indie production. You could quibble about some technical things (like lighting, which is a bit dark) but the piece is fun and inspired enough not to worry you too much. If Voltaire wrote "Candido" today, the character would be a self-help writer.
