Overall, a well-made film. There were the parts that made me jump, and there were the parts on which I threw my hands, but I came out with something more than the one I entered. <br /> <br /> I think the film suffers from serious excess ambition. Without ruining it, let me tell you that the obvious references to the process of fire in Ramayana, is far beyond what this film represents. Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200-page book that puts women in India. The film is about two married girls in a very particular Indian family. While the basic principles of "unwritten laws of family tradition" seem to be those of conservative India, we assure my reader that I (having lived in Delhi for 12 years) found whole parts that simply did not ring those bells. I mean a few things and some actions are very true, but some other things are simply out of place. Especially today. <br /> <br /> Delhi is complicated. India is complicated. The director tries to simplify both. And it fails quite miserably at this. <br /> <br /> Why in English? You can imagine a movie about American Indians in English. Or the French that speaks in English. Seriously jarring. Even the servant spoke in fluent and accented English (though with a hint of colloquial expressions in the language for "credibility"). <br /> <br /> But the chemistry between the contacts is palpable. If you like it hot, this is a movie for you. I think it's the greatest saving grace - the development of a real love story in real life. <br /> <br /> If this film was about Radha and Sita, then he would get top marks from me. And in being on them, he could make a subtle statement. But this film goes out there to say that this is what India is, and that's what Indian society is. And in this respect it succeeds as much as it fails. Take everything you see with a pinch of salt. The dark secrets of India are not revealed. Only two girls are falling in love. Just like it happens everywhere.
