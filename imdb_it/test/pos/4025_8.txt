We saw La Spectatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This film has deepened the fear we all have. The fear of rejection, the fear of intimacy and, above all, the fear of our inadequacies. <br /> <br /> The three main actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo adapt well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to see the dynamic between the three as it seemed real . I think Barbora Bobulova is a reference point. I hope we will see it much more in the coming years. <br /> <br /> This film does not take the easy way. Congratulations to the Italian team that put this film together. Highly recommended.
