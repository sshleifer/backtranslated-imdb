This is a good movie, no doubt, but with some strange aspects. Without ruining anything it takes place only in 3 places: a Sicilian farm, the boat and Ellis Island New York. All the shots are close together, so we never see a wide range of things. I wonder if this was to save money? There are no street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close-ups. And the music ... what the hell was playing Nina Simone's songs, decades before they came out? I could have done even without the business of the milk river ...... But hey, before thinking of me as a pure misanthrope, let me repeat it, this is a great film, with heartbreaking moments, wonderful photography, great characters and more accuracy than the usual (American) efforts in the immigration experience.
