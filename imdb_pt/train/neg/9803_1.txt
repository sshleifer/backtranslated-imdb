Power rangers are definitely the worst television show and a completely ridiculous line of plastic toys in United States history. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing even remotely interesting about this thoroughly horrible television program. <br /> <br /> This is simply the worst show ever made, with horrible actors wearing multicolored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, since there is no redeeming value to this absurdity. <br /> <br /> Todays kids should try to watch better shows, like the Toy Story movies, instead of this junk.
