It's a ghost story. It's a story of cannibalism. It's a revenge story. It's a very badly done film with a lot of violence. I suppose it follows the low cost along the lines of all the horror movies you have ever seen. It has the usual secluded place, the arrogant campers, going to the desert. Granted, there are some pretty intense scenes. It's so bland. Bad editing and all the work. There are ghost kids who seem to be talking in a bin. I'm not sure what governs the ghosts and the psychopaths with the seed limit. He also has the coarse scene in which a man eats a piece of meat that is really left over from his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous and unhealthy violence. I fear it is just one more step in our desensitized evolution. Three is not clever here, there is nothing ironic, just a sad waste of time. A lot of blood; little plot.
