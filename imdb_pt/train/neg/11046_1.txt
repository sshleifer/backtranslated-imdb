This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot, all bad. In the last 15 minutes a suitable cyborg cat is presented that confuses everything. Malcom MacDowell must have had to make a payment at home because otherwise he would have to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just do not know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to that crap and be able to look in the mirror every morning. I could have made better special effects in my bathtub. There is no continuity. The editor must have been sleeping or the drugs are so bad Acting They have to smoke to be bad The gun shoots blue flares or bullets, makes your decision The bad girl and the other girl in the movie seem so alike that this is confusing O which is called the 2013 Seadly Wake. It has nothing to do with the movie.
