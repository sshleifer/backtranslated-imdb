This is bad. A really bad and annoying crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary. A series of crimes, the killer that you do not see throughout the film, the classic investigations. And also the classic tale about a police officer who finds out what is happening and is not believed by anyone, so he has to fight alone to reveal the truth. Not much in this one. Vote: 4 out of 10.
