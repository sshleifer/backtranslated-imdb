This film is a farce and does not serve to keep the company with the original superior. The plot is an absolute mess, and the film is very long. Every time they're fighting, they desperately inject a sentimental reminder of the first movie. "Gregory's Girl" is one of the top 10 British films of all time, this one is horrible.
