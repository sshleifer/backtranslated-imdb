During the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a kind of hero in the United States. Inevitably, the men in your position are offered the movies that exist just to capitalize on this. I have no idea what Thomas was paid to do this movie, but I would have to get a lot of money to agree to make a national idiot in a movie. The film is obviously derived from "Enter the Dragon" as well as most martial arts images. Only instead of a true martial art, they invent a new absurd martial art, accurately described by a critic as "a cross between Kung Fu and break dancing." A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress, but each room has a prop which is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the villains back. Of course he fights the leading villain and, of course, has a fantasy fight, with an ending that will astonish only those who have never seen a martial arts movie. There are touches that nostalgic types will like, particularly Thomas Mullet haircuts and many of the male co-stars. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now wishes never to have set foot on the set.
