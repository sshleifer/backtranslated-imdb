Seeing the jewel of Tobe Hooper, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the college / crocodile niche of the exploration / monster genre. I look forward to a disobedient producer to accompany with various sequels to these delicious bonbons of camp kindness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of talent and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts and a room full of monkeys creating special crocodile effects on a computer, all we needed would be a crunchy fodder mold with Russ Meyer's breasts and Ren Hoek's pectoral implants. While Tobe Hooper's crunchy pamphlet referred to his own films, Blood Surf chose to distribute a lot of old subjects from the bucket of other films. See if you can look beyond the continuation sets of Revenge of the Nerds to find the Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000, and any James Bond movie. Also, try to find the fade out for the TV, where the publisher gave up making sense of the stock. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that the clay pot was not able to experience its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy about environmentalism ... or crunchy appreciation, but quasi-captain Ahab of history gets his tourism address . Maybe, in the next few years, we'll see a crock galloping after a gunfight on a golden sunset. Or, hopefully, a monkey will throw a crocky in the toilet of an international space station for dwarves and enjoy the monkey zero / dwarf / crocodile exploitative waltz waltz. <br /> <br /> All in all, the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irritated me.
