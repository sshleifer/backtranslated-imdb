at first I was happy to know about a new superman movie, although it's great, but it was not. <br /> <br /> It's a bad copy of Richard Donner's work, Lex is again a villain who does nothing else, even played by Kevin's seasoning. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same as the first Donner film very forced. <br /> <br /> The script is predictable and simple (all the things Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> History is the wrong thing, it must be the Kevin Smith Script and maybe it's better. <br /> <br /> I just expect a sequel without Brian Singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy. Everyone read you later
