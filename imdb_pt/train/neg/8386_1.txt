Destroying this movie is like shooting fish into a barrel. Too easy. So, I'll challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I'm impressed by the special effects. It really looked like Marlon Wayans' head was stuck in a small person's body. I never doubted it for a minute. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected appearances. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and his interpretations of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were invaluable. John Witherspoon, who coincidentally played Grier's father in 1992 at Boomerang (if you recall, he "coordinated" the mushroom with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is as believable as White Chicks. How stupid is it even when the doctor can not say that he is a man of 40 years and not a baby? It has a full set of teeth !!! How is it possible that no one seems to realize that it is not a baby? Little Man is so bad there's a cameo by Rob Schneider. And please, if you're stupid enough to waste $ 8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your kids. This movie is very sexual for little kids (lots of jokes and insinuations about sex, downslides, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed by the parents who brought their kids to the exhibit that I was forced to endure. If you insist on watching a silly movie, at least spare your children pain and suffering.
