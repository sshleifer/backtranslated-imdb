I found Horrorvision almost unwatchable. While only 70 minutes long I still found myself pushing the fast forward button again and again. The acting was from the school 'if I scream and say a lot' I'm intense '. And history was, at best, a scenario that still needed to be realized. <br /> <br /> Although I've never been to Full Moon to make a great movie, I've never seen them produce such bad rubbish.
