This self-indulgent mess may have put the flurry in Mr. Branagh's career as a Shakespearean movie adapter. (Launched 4 years ago, not a peek of an adaptation ever since.) I just saw it on the cable - God, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the sentiment of a critic below who said that reviewing such an obvious and sad thing is an ungenerous act that seems strident. That said, I'll take the risk, even though * Love's Labor's Lost * is the perfect reward for those who overestimated Branagh's leadership skills in the past. Branagh has always been a lousy director: extremely reticent; starry unforgivably nasty to his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but he loves himself more, making sure he gets all the good lines). In that vein, the sad fact remains that Love's Labor's Lost is hardly worse than the endless, horrible, bloated Hamlet of 1996. In fact, this film may be preferable, be about 1/3 of the length. Branagh decided that it would be a good idea to upgrade this poor Shakespeare work to the environment of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. So he sets the thing up in 1939, leaves about one-eighth of the text intact in favor of notorious interpretations of the 1930s patterns (wait until he sees the actors dropping threads toward the ceiling during "I'm In Heaven"), and throws actors who are not known for dancing or singing (including him). The result is such a surreal disaster that we were amazed that they did not call a horrified stop of the whole thing after looking at the first few journals. I do not even blame the cast. To paraphrase Hamlet, "The script is the thing!" NOBODY could do well in this miscellany: the illustrious CSR alumni are no better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could act on this thing? <br /> <br /> Branagh's first mistake was to think that Love's Labor's Lost was a piece worth filming. Trust me, it's not. It is an anomaly in the bard's canon, written expressly for a group of educated courtiers - NOT the usual audience for which he wrote. So there are many precious (and TENTH!) Word games, references to contemporary scholastic absurdities, parodies of * Euphues * from Lyly. . . in other words, hardly the kind of material to attract a broad audience. Hell, it does not appeal to an audience already predisposed to Shakespearean comedy. The piece can not be staged without drastically cutting the text and "refreshing" it desperately with whatever trick that comes handy. Which raises the question: Why bother? <br /> <br /> Branagh's second mistake was to think that Shakespeare's cream pie could be served with a side order of Gershwin's marmalade. Clearly, the idea, or hope, was to make the Elizabethan exercise unintelligible palatable to the modern public, while managing the nostalgic American pop culture in its throats. But again, this raises the question: why bother? <br /> <br />
