A real disappointment of the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I Jane tells the story of a first woman who has been through hellish training in the Navy SEALs. The training is the most difficult and difficult to exist as the instructor says in the film to the main character O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no specific message or point in this movie or I could not reach it properly. It may be a kind of statement of women's rights and abilities, but it all sinks under the tired scenes and the stupid fight at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why Ridley uses so much zoom that he mentioned the last battle of arms in the desert ?! It sounds soooo stupid and annoying and almost amateurish, so I'd really like to know what the director saw in this technique. When I look at your latest movie, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the battle scenes (which are many) and they are very intense and skill driven. The entire ending in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more than shoot and kill stupid and brainless. <br /> <br /> This is Ridley Scott's worst film, in my opinion, and there are no significant touches that this great director is known for. Thankfully I saw this in Widescreen format because there are still some great scenes and samples of Scott's abilities, but they are very few in this movie. <br /> <br /> A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on ..) of this talented director. So I'm forced to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
