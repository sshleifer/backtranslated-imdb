(NB: Spoiler Warning, as it is!)) First, this is a teen horror movie - the genre Spam-In-A-Cabin, as Joe Bob Briggs put it in a poignant way. If you are looking for Roshambo, this is not it and it will not be. I'm desperately impressed with the blows in his cinematic performances, directing or acting. <br /> <br /> Second, this was not Zuniga's first horror film, it was his first period of screen appearances, movies, TV, anything. For what it's worth; nor is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you have to give even a flirtation of slasher props. Of course, it follows the deeply offensive message of the genre: any young woman who has or shows interest in sex is beef, and the time of harvest is now. <br /> <br /> the sweet virginal protagonist too! Now there's a mediocre teenage death movie that has the courage of your convictions! Interesting that this was said the only role of ingenue in the cinema. Another Wonder of One Hit, except that the term gives too much credit to the girl. <br /> <br /> (So again, this movie probably has one of the highest percentages of actors in a movie in history.) Of the nineteen credited actors, some thirteen screams never appeared in any other movie. film by the same producers.Only one other than Zuniga has up to six screen credits.What was this, the Multiple Surgical Society was and never was?) <br /> Granted, I saw this a long time ago in the late night cable when I was bored and never anticipate being so bored in my life again but I see no reason to hunt everyone involved and throw them in the incinerator with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
