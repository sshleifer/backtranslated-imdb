Man, I must say when I saw the trailer I was excited. Futuristic soldiers taking over the bad-ass Vampires led by the veterinary genre Michael Ironside .... In space. I mean, I was not expecting high art, but it looked like a potential B-movie classic. This was undoubtedly a TV pilot, reissued some time later in a feature film, after not being chosen. Okay, I'll start with some good points in the movies, the action was competent for a lower budget movie, and the CGI and the locations used were passable. Now for the bad, first Michael Ironside was barley on it, and his performance here .... well was not tasteful in a good way. But like I said, he was not very involved, so I can not blame him. One thing that was really stupid was the PETA-type vampire group, no, I'm not joking, it's the most unbelievable thing I've seen over time, and it's taken seriously. Also this movie commits one of the main sins of movie B, causes a lesbian scene and does not comply. Above all, what sinks this movie is that nothing really happens. Since it was designed to be a pilot, the script is almost non-existent and does not have a regular ending. Even the main villains only come at the end. If ever a movie needed to increase the factor Sleaze and gore, it's the Vampire Wars. To conclude, I will say that the main crew of the spacecraft was composed of very capable actors and could very well leave this mess behind and continue with bigger and better things. They simply had nothing to work for here.
