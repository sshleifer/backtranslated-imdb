Sequela of terrible terror for "The Howling". This starts with the funeral of Karen White (she was killed at the end of the first movie). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee, unfortunately) arrives there and tells Karen's brother, Ben (Reb Brown), that Karen was a werewolf. He is going to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning), the werewolf head. Ben and a co-worker of Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him. <br /> <br /> A terrible script, bad direction, inept editing, and really hideous acting by Brown and McEnroe, on their own, do away with this one. The effects of the werewolf are kept mostly in the dark - for good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Subpar's special effects too - though I liked the cartoon lightning coming from Danning's fingers. There is also a werewolf orgy that is particularly stupid and Danning takes off his top at least eight times during the final credits! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I found the village in Transylvania amusing - it looks like it came from a 1930s Universal horror movie! There are interesting camera tricks among transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good at it - but they can not save him. Really - why did they do it? Where are they hard to make money ??? This is one of the IMDb movies. That's all I should tell you. Supposedly Danning was horrified when he saw the movie - I can understand why! A must see.
