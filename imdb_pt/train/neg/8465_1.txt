I can not believe how horrible this movie was. I feel magnanimous even referring to him as a "movie". The performance was flat, the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many important questions unanswered. The premise was OK, if it was not original: a small group of aliens are living in the US and trying to take humanity slowly. But it goes quickly down from there. How could they convince a "human" to accept an alien as his wife in order to make them a human-alien hybrid they need? They show an alien larval but never show what it does. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce perfect skin on an industrial scale. They play in the huge alien monster required with teeth. The ending was almost too painful to watch. I suppose I am disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner has anything to do with it. How could he say to the huge alien monster with teeth, "Get away from him, you son of a bitch" with a serious face? It's a long fall from your 5 days of Babylon. Avoid this at all costs.
