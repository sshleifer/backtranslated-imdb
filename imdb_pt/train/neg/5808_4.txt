When Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a Hollywood couple of explosive temperament and great power, they filmed this (almost) scene-by-scene remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw action thriller about a fugitive couple. It almost worked for the first time because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen - even the silent and tired stone, you could feel the clock ticking its magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league, but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor - if so, this is not a showcase of his attributes. Basinger does well and certainly looks good, but James Woods is artificially weak in a silly role of the Mafia. A sub-plot involving another couple taken hostage by Baldwin's ex-partner was unbearable in the 72-year-old film and plays even worse here. As for the action scenes, they are very old, which makes one wonder: why even redo the original? ** in ****
