What?!?? Why are people saying this is "mind blowing"? Just face it the end is about the worst end of the history of cinematography! 4 left and the whole world is over! Not to mention that character 9 was an idiot the whole time that killed everyone. I was right all along, if he sacrificed 9 then none of this would have happened. People giving there live for a stupid cause and why? ... to make it rain? I admit that the movie had its parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But a lot of that was clich√© one after another. And has anyone else had the feeling that this is very much like "The Lord of the Rings?" Characters have died for stupid reasons, there has been almost no character development, and honestly one wonders if it is good to have only four faces in the world; is useless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen and thanks to God! How do robots turn against humans in some creative way? It's been done like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, go see a movie worth watching as Star Trek, The Hangover, or Inglorious Basterds, these were good movies!
