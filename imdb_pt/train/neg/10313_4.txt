This movie was hard to get, and when I finally saw the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline sector and walks away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or spoiling the attempt. With all of this interest built in, how could anyone make a film so dull and full of talk about this real-life event? While Williams is always interesting, the writers have assumed that D.B. Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic as a movie star, what we get is a type - without any engaging details or insight into a person's mind daring enough and smart enough to have achieved it. Harrold practically steals the film with his courage and sheer beauty, but the real disappointment was in plot management and the lame direction. What a shame in this movie to exist even.
