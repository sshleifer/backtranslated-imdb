Mike Brady is the first person in the community to realize that there are killer slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, mind you, but a larger-than-normal carnivorous killer, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only run as fast as a normal slug, which is not so scary, but I digress). No one will believe him at first, but they will. Oh, yes, they will. <br /> <br /> Okay, the killer slugs are well above the psychotic sloths and just below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the scary factor. So the absurdity of all this is quite apparent from the start. The movie is a bit of fun and it's kind of "so bad it's good". I appreciate that they spelled that this was Slugs: the movie as opposed to Slugs: the children's game or Slugs: the other white meat. He probably is not worthy to watch it more than once and forget it quickly, except for playing a rather obscure game of trivia. The director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is best known for his previous films "Pod People" (which the MST3K deservedly ridiculed) and "Peices" (which is possibly the funniest film ever made) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Rosa shows T & A <br /> <br /> My Note: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Just a theatrical trailer for this movie
