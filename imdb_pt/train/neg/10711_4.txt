Minion is about ... well, a footman. A servant of Satan and whose goal is to take the key that will open the door where his master is trapped. He is some kind of demon who possesses human beings and when the body dies he will possess another. Anyone who happens to be possessed, goes in some berserker fury. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret order of the Templars, who is in charge of keeping the key away from the footman. The film begins 1,000 years ago in the Middle East, where two Knights Templar flee the footman. So let's move on to 1999, where the key ends up somewhere underground in New York. An archaeologist is assigned to study / excavate where the key was found. Needless to say, the servant is after the key, and the film becomes a long chase scene between the footman and Lukas and archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The film, that's just it, a low-budget movie from movie B. The film has no energy and just goes on. You will follow the persecution, but you will never feel involved in the story that deliberately accepts ideas from previous films (especially the Terminator films). The fight scenes with the footman are problematic, because you will never have the notion of how good or how bad a warrior this devil is. He "cleverly" becomes a one-man army when fighting a Templar squad, but it sucks when it comes to one against one. And it's supposed to be around for a long time. All this serves to show that any sense of logic is thrown in the drain for convenience. The whole idea of ​​a secret order of Templars, a door to hell and the key is not well explained. We are just to accept that they simply exist. The film seems to have been made with the feeling that there is not much potential for the story, but just enough to earn some change. Dolph Lundgren certainly looks like he wanted to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 2 of 5 stars.
