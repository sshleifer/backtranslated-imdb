This movie could not decide what it wanted to be. There were a few subplots that for a while made you think that these items would fit in the end ... but they did not. If you want a story of "aliens in the frozen junk," stick to the 1950 version of THE THING (not the abomination that was redone in gore-o-vision 20 years later). <br /> <br /> I could not get over the fact that the "alien" seemed practically recycled from INDEPENDENCE DAY. The "minimal" sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and take the intended mood. Much munching scene with little reward. .
