Down to Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who gets hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and he gets another body. Lance takes the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So Lance does some things on Charles's body. The film has some laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a Chris Rock fan. Madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is best. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock did a lot better than that. This will only make you laugh about 4 times the entire movie. And it's not really funny. You will laugh at yourself and you can laugh, but you definitely will not roll on the floor laughing.
