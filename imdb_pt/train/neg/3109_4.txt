This movie was not horrible, but it was not very good. I'm a big fan Toni Collette, I think she's a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins with Robin Williams, who is a writer and receives a book from a 14-year-old boy. The book is great and he does not believe a kid wrote it. Toni Collette plays the guardian of children that you do not know if this boy really exists or is inventing everything. I will not ruin the movie, but I will say that the film is not scary. <br /> <br /> The performance is very good and the performance of Toni Collette was amazing, as was Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The film was a big disappointment, in my opinion, I would expect it to go to the DVD.
