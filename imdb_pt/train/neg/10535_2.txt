<br /> <br /> According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are young college students 20 years old about to enter college. Jolly joke! <br /> <br /> 1955? The keyboard synthesizer has not yet been invented, but there it is in the bandstand. The Ford Pony Car has not yet been invented, but is playing old music. The synthesizer seemed to be a model from the mid-1970s. Pony Car at best is the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> 20-year-old college kids? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this TV movie was produced. <br /> <br /> The plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of free time to think about all the bugs appearing on their TVs.
