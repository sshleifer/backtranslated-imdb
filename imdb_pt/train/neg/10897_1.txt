This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! It was stupid there was no plot and the special effects were ridiculous !! And I've never seen such a bad performance in my life! The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what these people were thinking when they made this movie !! I did not even want to end the whole thing because you get to that point in the movie where the guys are all in bed playing on themselves. I mean, it was like some kind of child pornography and sick! I advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested to see it just to forget it and find another movie to watch! I was very dissapointed !! The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion.
