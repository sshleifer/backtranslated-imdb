This film begins promisingly, with an opening scene in which Frank Morgan counsels against Gary Cooper's marriage to his daughter, Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, playing a brash prospector, complains loudly to Cooper about his perceived shortage in the hands of his family - including his daughter, Anita Louise. I'm a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (in my opinion) a Hollywood treasure, Cooper a legend, and Louise a very lovely, versatile and underrated actress, rarely seen in the lead role. I also have nothing against Teresa Wright, and although not blessed with great variety, she usually offers heart-warming performances. <br /> <br /> From a promising opening, the story goes to the end. I did not find it funny to burn the house of Cooper's in-laws. The butler of a house so fastidious and non-smoking would never back off happily, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or alternatively he would surely provide some means of disposing of his unwelcome cigar. Besides, no one with good sense would allow himself to leave a lit cigarette without asking for some means of discarding it. And finally, no one in his right mind crushes a cigarette in a handkerchief and puts it in his pocket! All this sequence made Cooper look foolish and clumsy. It is a poor artifice - poorly conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule, not laughter. <br /> <br /> Cooper's forced medical examination is also invented. No one is allowed to undergo a complete medical examination without being warned of his purpose or giving his consent! That Cooper did this is very different from reality to be funny - it's absurd! Stealing hospital babies is a legal offense, and that too is no laughing matter. Finally, scenes of Cooper's overly fastidious and neurotic attention to food and his baby's weight may have hit a nervous nerve in some people who have had anxiety about their own newborn babies. But to me they seem tedious and slow. The wardrobe and support departments went to the top in these scenes, while, paradoxically, the screenwriter went to sleep. <br /> <br /> The lines are simply not in the script to generate mood. They only lose on all cylinders. The laughter does not reach a kilometer per minute, but more like a light year-by-minute. The only time the film has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera. <br /> <br /> The scene that is totally wasted is when both Cooper's love interests and their respective parents are confined to the same hotel. room together. There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine, but none of this has been extracted. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of two very nice girls will get hurt. Predictably, it's the character of Anita Louise, who is abandoned on her wedding night! Although not on camera, this is your destination, and not particularly funny - even as a loose end. She did nothing in this movie to make me unfriendly (unlike Gail Patrick, for example, in My Favorite Wife). Consequently, I was hoping (maybe "hoping" is a better word in the context of the movie!) For Anita Louise to enjoy a happy ending too. The fact that such a cool character is essentially eliminated at the end of the movie really weakens the "happy ending" effect for Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to happen, through ingenious dialogue. so characteristic of the films of the time ... And never delivered. A good performance of Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here.
