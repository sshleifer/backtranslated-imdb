Not only has the plot of this film been invented with the ease with which the two psychopaths can kidnap a pregnant woman without sweating her shirt, but it was a terrible blow to "Misery." However, the main reason I gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely pissed me off. <br /> <br /> I'm not easily shocked at what moviemakers do and have always had a love of terror. but this movie went too far in terms of violence and torture just to get hit points on the shock factor. <br /> <br /> I think most people, when they watch only the first ten minutes of Hide and Seek, will find themselves reaching for the remote.
