Although the idea is more original than most science fiction films, the execution is, as usual, absent. While the practical effects of the mummies are not bad, and the character "Gun Nut" is above the top, the only attraction is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin gathered on the small screen. I suspect that was the idea all the time. They do the best they can with what they have, but the "must see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when the Morena character wore some Tomb Raider style shorts. Not eyebrow cinema I know, but you can not deny the true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin once again defines him as the guy you love to hate. If you just want to watch some of your favorite Firefly characters have fun with some secondary material then this might be for you. If you want good acting and character development then it is advisable to look elsewhere.
