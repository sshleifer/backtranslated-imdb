<br /> <br /> Okay, well, I rented this movie while I was in bed, I got painkillers, and let me tell you, it did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a man who buys a car while undergoing a middle-aged crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow the car . Since I do not want to ruin (not that there was something to ruin) I'll let your imagination discover the "Zany" (and I use that word lightly) following pranks. <br /> <br /> I've struggled to stay awake through this one-minute snore of film, and I'd like to say that if you're venturing into the movie store and are thinking of being adventurous, please do not, it's a waste of the printed film again. <br /> <br /> Then again I may be wrong ...
