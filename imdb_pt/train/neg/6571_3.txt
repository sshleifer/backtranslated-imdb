Although I totally disagree with a reviewer who described Charley Chase as bland, in this movie he certainly is. It's a shame as I suspect the other reviewer must have seen just a few assholes Charley and Chase took over the guy was not funny. Movies like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE AND WHAT PRICE GOOFY? are very good chase movies, so it could be very funny given good stuff. Unfortunately, in this movie he received absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the normally good Oliver Hardy as a leaf is of no help because the basic premise (the boy wants to marry a girl, but the girl's father thinks the boy is a coward) and the jokes are so bad. It's a pity, because I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those accustomed to Charley's mid-1920s look, you'll be pretty surprised how Chase does not wear glasses or mustache - and it looks like very little as you'd expect.
