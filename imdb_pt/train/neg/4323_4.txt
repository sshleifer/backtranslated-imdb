European Holidays (also known as National Holidays of the National Lampoon) is the weakest of the holiday films (the first and third are the most superior of the films). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they receive a weaker script with very bad dialogues. This makes the rhythm suffer, with not very funny jokes. To be specific, what really makes this movie suffer is the fact that "jokes" as they are, are just pasted into a hardened script, instead of serving a central plot like the other 3 holiday movies. Well, they can not win them all. 4 out of 10.
