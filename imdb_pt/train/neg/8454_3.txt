This series has its occasional ups and downs, and the latter is the case here. There is a pleasing amount of splashes, with an inventive implementation of baby stroller guns, but the editing film is seriously disconnected, the film itself is rougher than usual. Sometimes the action slows down as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the "puppy," which is almost lost early on. All in all, disappointment. <br /> <br /> That said, there is an oriental quality of spaghetti for music and action that can gain the approval of dedicated viewers. This portion spends much of its time after the little misadventures of the boy, who begins to look at the abyss of death that his father opened for him.
