The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really put on top-notch performance, and the girl who played her sister was really amazing and beautiful. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can not say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He's one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too "real" for me. I prefer the witty nonsense of Lestat and Louis to the slaves' struggles. Eartha Kitt was so chilling and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined by me; I could hardly stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not want to give anything) Sorry, but it's not my kind of show.
