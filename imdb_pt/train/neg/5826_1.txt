Slow and beautiful images changed one to the other, with sometimes annoying songs (you know Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the movie. If you have not slept enough, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20% of the film director decides to bring the idea of ​​rebirth, re-incarnation or else, through S & M images: "spiritual lovers" are cutting each other's bodies with knives. For me it was very disturbing and really changed the overall impression of the blend of abstract art and images of the modern Japanese mystery. <br /> <br /> The operator and the director are great, but weird. <br /> <br /> He did not like it at all.
