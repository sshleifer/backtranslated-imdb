(See our What-To-See-Next blog for more details on our rating system.) <br /> <br /> Here's a movie that will get you scratching his own face an attempt to gain release from boredom on the screen. <br /> <br /> You will not be twisting your hands, rolling your eyes or sighing at your popcorn. Not even. For a * this * averagousity movie, just claw in your own face will do. <br /> <br /> When you start scratching your own face - how you should start! - start at the bottom. You will need your upper portion, with its tear ducts at hand, intact for the third Truly Tear-jerking act, which can leave you on your knees if you have not been able to leave the entire theater there. <br /> <br /> In a season celebrating Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms as the new Gold Standard for foreign leadership and diplomacy, perhaps this film is received as something that anyone could create. * Watching him, however, is a much more dangerous task. <br /> <br /> Here's our story ... <br /> <br /> Sidney Young, the London publisher of a fourth-level entertainment / celebrity magazine, is about to see his magazine go down. He needs a miracle, and what he gets is a phone call from New York, USA. <br /> <br /> Sharp's editor, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges), says, "Come work for me." With your own employees carrying the fax machine from your apartment / office in the background, saying "yes" is obvious. <br /> <br /> Soon, Sidney is working in New York City, doing everything. wrong things. Their interviews consist of asking the Broadway musical directors if they are (1) Jewish and (2) gay. <br /> <br /> He kills Sohpie Maes's pet dog, the industry's hottest movie star, when she leaves the magazine offices during a business lunch. <br /> <br /> This is a bad luck point for everyone, as among other things, Sidney imagines that he is in love with Maes, before waking up to the character of Dunst. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is that he totally alienated Alison Olsen (played by Kristen Dunst), a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of * and * The Big Apple. (We were, of course, a movie before, and then we know how that relationship will end. That is why we need intact tear channels for the third act of the movie). <br /> <br /> The problem with The Thing is that the script never fits except for the only tear duct set in which True Love prevails. <br /> <br /> Editora Harding is supposed to be a son-of-a-band who also wants to play the whole job. The script never rests firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy, however, and Bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze. <br /> <br /> Alison Olsen must despise Sidney Young, but whenever he comes to her (as he does constantly), she makes a point of engaging him in conversation, rather than trying to discourage his existence. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" of the first scenes is built around a piglet that destroys an expensive hotel room and then take the elevator down to urinate in the expensive heels of a celebrity in a cocktail reception. <br /> <br /> Hot little star Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because he is "hurt." "The character never shows us * because * he is injured, however.This is more a result of the mortally wounded writing of the film.At an hour and fifty minutes, This Thing seems longer (and more deadly) than the withdrawal of It is uninspiring, bland, irrecoverable and not even profitable.
