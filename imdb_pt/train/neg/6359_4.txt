Woody Allen, when he is at his best, has one of the sharpest pens in the world. He can make a keen observation and wrap it in a punch line like no one else. However, when he is at his worst, his films can sniff out pretentiousness. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" have such a stink of opening to close. Setup is one of your most intriguing ideas at a time. Four friends sit in a restaurant arguing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help solve the argument, a man reports the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing (one is a comic playwright, the other is a dramatic playwright) whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men continue the story and the film shows the stories they weave. Now when I first heard about this movie, my understanding was that they tell the exact same story, the genre (comedy or drama) only changes according to how you look at it. Now that would have been interesting. However, the stories share only one main element and some minor elements. They are totally different histories, with great differences of plot. The drama is so harshly scripted and pretentious that it can only function as a self-parody. If this was the point, then failed because those elements prevent the public from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. Comedy is history that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Will Farrell obviously intends to be Woody's replacement, but he could have interpreted this character much more convincingly without adding Woody's stutters and ticks. Woody is the best at being Woody. When another person tries, he is not playing a character, he is modeling a recognizable actor. That sort of thing just gets the audience out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen films make me leave the theater a bit lighter in spirit than I did. This made me wish I had my money back.
