Vulpine Massacre should have been this real title of films. And the slogan should have been "Guaranteed to make your kids cry!" This is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Beginning with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the attempts to create them. The only talk is made in the narrative by a tree that stands on the den, giving a view on the animals loves and lives ... Lovely scenery and beautiful filming of animals. Sounds good right? Well, from there things go straight to hell and then they start drilling toward the core ... Spoilers Below - Or they can be a Warning! Almost first, we learn that one of the foxes is born blind. But it seems to go very well and there is a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him ... And then he dies ... Then we have one of the brothers' adventures. And then he dies ... One of the sisters takes the time from her screen ... and then she dies ... And so it looks like a horrible horror movie, like one fox after another is killed by nature in traps, just up and disappear, and even by a lot of snowmobiles! At the end of the film, almost all the foxes were slaughtered. Although mercifully no death is shown on the screen. (At least not in the version we have seen.) Contrary to what is said "Tarka the Otter," the deaths in this film are almost all useless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built and then eliminated. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It's a nature movie after all. But not nearly the entire family. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this movie fooled by the cheery box into thinking it is safe for children. Watch with some prescience that things are not going well and that you or your children may be feeling very badly, depending on how sensitive you or they are. You can have fun. Or you can not ...
