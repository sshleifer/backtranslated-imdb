I chose this movie on the cover that was a bad move. It was not funny at all and the main characters were unpleasant. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the acting were terrible. It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. Terrible movie with a surf "theme" that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfer. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just because she's in the limelight now, being married to Gordon Gekko and everything, but if you have not seen it, do not waste your time. A bad movie with great surfers, real surfers and incredible cinematography was in the hands of God.
