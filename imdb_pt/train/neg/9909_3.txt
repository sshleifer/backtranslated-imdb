This was not a well done western. You have this nut walking in the scorching sun in a buggy with an umbrella over it, killing people for their own reasons. You have this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard, cutting off pieces of your anatomy that have been frozen. So you have a woman in a house in the middle of somewhere, shooting at wolves that are not there. What is the purpose of this film? Bruce Dern could not find something better to do? This was a waste of film.
