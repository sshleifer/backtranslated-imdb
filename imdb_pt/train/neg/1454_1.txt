I recently watched this movie twice, and I can not understand why the creators made that pile of crap. I mean, yes, that gives a great impression of Hitler's environment, and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890s, the First World War and the interwar period. What I can not understand is why they imagined Hitler as a 100% pure, crazy, insecure, mentally unstable evil. After all, he was a very considerate, loving and intelligent man, who obviously had his dark sides, no doubt about it. But why in the name of heaven do you portray it this way? All its positive aspects have been eliminated from the scene, leaving only a portrait very similar to an advertisement of a man who had the greatest influence on modern civilization of all time. Yes, he played Germany in the devastating Second World War. Yes, he was racist, and yes, sometimes he was menially unstable, especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; Why the hell did they plan to lie to the public? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely do not think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they were able to rise to power in times of severe global weakness. The fact that this evil is so recognizable but so embraced by almost all living Germans (not to mention the Austrians and a lot of other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact that Hitler is a "weirdo" . If it were as the makers make us believe - I would be convinced that the German people were retarded. A man like this in this movie would never have gotten close to the party leader - not to mention the ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
