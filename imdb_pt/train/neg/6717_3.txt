That was awful. The story was all over the place and more often than not I was confused because of the horrible editing. I did not feel sympathy for anyone because their characters were not sufficiently developed. They were extremely superficial people, without dimension. Stereotypes cheeky and clumsy with subplots that led nowhere. The stripper girl was just a distraction, even if she had a good look. I do not know what this was trying to be, but how shocked were they when they showed this garbage at Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. Do you think a channel like this would show more quality movies. There are much, much better films with gay and lesbian themes out there. "The Celluloid Closet" is an excellent documentary. I really liked "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others that have slipped out of my mind at the moment, but what I'm trying to say is that it was not worth it. If you get on the TV, ok but otherwise do not bother. <br /> <br /> There were maybe three or four scenes that looked really cool (sad I can count them in one hand), otherwise cinematography was very bad too. Lighting was far away in many places. I think some of the effects were used to try to add something that had practically nothing to do. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that Johnny Rebel is very yummy (without blonde hair, of course). Too bad his acting did nothing to me. Stay with real porn, buddy. 3/10.
