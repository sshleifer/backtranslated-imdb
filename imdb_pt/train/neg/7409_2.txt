There are a few elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe, but are overshadowed by bad acting, plot holes, deus ex machina played ins, stupid dialogues, weak script and predictable clichés ... <br /> <br /> that we have here is a horror movie with a plot that does not lead to anything much of the time. A group of unlikely heroes, including a black man who gets the first one (yes, that cliché seems still very much alive, even in Finland), seems to have difficulty trying to get out of a mysteriously empty hospital. There are ghosts screaming (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought at least they did not use zombies, but they did come), and a Finnish glam-rock band with demonic makeup, getting in their way. There is also some doodle of present time change, but nothing adds to the plot. Autistic girl and a tramp seem to have a deeper understanding of a situation, but they never reveal it to the viewer or their confused friends. Its lines consist only of deep thoughts about life lessons such as: "What happens will happen ..." or "Light can not live in darkness ..." or the sinister "I need a red pencil ... pencil red". So all these characters (including the worried father and the sweet doctor in sorrows) end up running around the dark floors, and misleading the demons. Occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies appears, and if it looks like a demon keyboardist can not identify a group of six people coming toward him, waving a flashlight and talking, he was just pretending. And, apparently, this demon can cross the walls without much complication, but opening the elevator door is beyond his capabilities. <br /> <br /> In the end, we even have a sequence of "it was all a dream". Or maybe it was not. Oh boy, I wanted this movie to be, and this kind of thing that makes time seem to move faster, so everything happens in just 10 minutes or so ...
