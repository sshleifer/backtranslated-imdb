I've generally found that if you do not hear about a movie before you watch it on DVD, there's probably a good reason for that. I had not heard of this movie until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf. Since all the good movies had already been rented (the ones I wanted to see, at least), I figured I'd give it a present. <br /> <br /> It's not much different from other movies in the movies. genre such as The Singles Ward or RM If you like these types of movies, you'll probably like this. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a Mormon, this movie probably will not please you. There is no avoiding the overtly religious (Mormon) message contained in it, and at times it is sentimental and tacky. Ultimately, if you do not fit into Mormon demographics, it's probably best to watch something else. <br /> <br /> Of course, there were some very funny moments in the movie, but I did not think it was enough to save the movie overall.
