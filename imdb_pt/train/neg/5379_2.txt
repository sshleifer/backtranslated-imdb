Released on DVD in the UK as Ax, The Choke is a teenage slasher who fails in virtually every department: the story is almost non-existent, resulting in a film consisting mostly of people wandering through a dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are obviously destined to be the survivors of the film), all are totally objectionable, which means that the viewer would not mind when they were massacred; the killings are not bloody enough (unless a brief shot of half a pound of minced meat covered with fake blood turns your stomach); and the free sex scene shows no nudity (an unforgivable mistake to make in a horror movie!). The fine, thin plot shows members of a punk band stuck inside what appears to be the world. The biggest nightclub (there are runners and endless abandoned rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where they are picked up by an invisible mugger. For a low-budget effort, production values ​​are fine, and the cast seems to be a fairly capable actor, but with genuine enough not enough rests, a reluctance to get really confused (this is a slasher, so where are the graphics splatter? ), a lot of terrible dialogue (particularly the undead-soon-enough drummer) and some ill-advised use of cheesy video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the film quickly becomes extremely annoying.
