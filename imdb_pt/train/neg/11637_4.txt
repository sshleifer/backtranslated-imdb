Uwe Boll did the impossible: create an adaptation of the game that remains at least a little faithful to the game; he transformed a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So as an adaptation, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll that we're dealing with here, so do not expect the movie to be really good. although it has its moment, "Postcard" wears very fast and becomes a pain to sit. <br /> <br /> In essence, Postal is a satire in the United States, as done by a year-old boy. Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to the comic value: the more offensive, the funnier, and the more exaggerated, the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of lack of taste while being extremely hit and lost. Yes, some jokes work, but it seems to be pure luck. Highlights include the director lampooning himself, and people being violently hit by trucks and other vehicles. The lows include ... pretty much everything else. <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise disappears, Postal simply becomes a tedium to watch. Yes, there is a good joke every ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems like forever. <br /> <br /> This probably worked as a short movie, but it is not enough content for something that lasts more than 90 minutes (though it seems to be twice as long). There are good ideas and good attempts, but they get lost in endless and useless action scenes and content that is offensive just because of it 4/10
