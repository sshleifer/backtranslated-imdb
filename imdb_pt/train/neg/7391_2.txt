Okay, like most Steven Seagal fans I know I will not expect a masterpiece every time he makes a movie, but I hope the film has at least some budget. The main problem with the copy I watched was the awful thing about dubbing, I know that in some movies this has to be done and I accept that, but when they overdub with a totally different voice actors and continue doing it through magic overdub movie. In addition, the sets seem to be built with little care, since in a scene the sliding glass cover in a secret lab has a massive crack running through it. I was really disappointed with this movie and I hope that Stevens' next project is more complete before sending the film for purchase / rent. The story of this movie made me wonder if I was watching a science fiction movie or not some parts seemed strange, but they never fully explained what was happening, I found it very confusing.
