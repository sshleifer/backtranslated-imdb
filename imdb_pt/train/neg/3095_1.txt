Wow, I've finally been able to, after several attempts, end up watching this horrible movie, only to find out that Rick Sloane and his production crew have completed a direct sequel to the video this year. <br /> <br /> All the films reviewed by the MST3K - and they really go through the bottom of the barrel, displaying the 'Hands', 'Werewolf', 'The Incredibly Strange' and the smaller disasters known as 'Laserblast' , 'Zombie Nightmare,' and 'Time Chasers' - this certainly has to be the biggest pile of crap they've ever shown (which makes it perfect for riffs). Quite simply, the movie is about a bunch of Munchies-like gremlins on the loose, exploring people's desires for fame, fortune, dexterity, and, of course, sex in ways that do away with people being killed. But this is the kind of film in which the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with gardening tools), writing is so forced scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of a girl who would notice if she turned her head a quarter to the left ... and this is not the first time in the movie that this happens), and the story is so ... rarely giving attention (hence the MST3K's rumor about a "law in the future where films have to be made by filmmakers"), that you really twist by furry puppets to kill everyone on the screen.
