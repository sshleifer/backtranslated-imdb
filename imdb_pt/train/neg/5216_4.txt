"Metamoprhis" is the story of a dashing young scientist, revered at the local college, who is investigated by financial providers for college. This forces him to take shortcuts in the typical melodramatic fashion of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> My first thought after the conclusion of this movie was this. "Not good, but not bad, for the early eighties." Of course, then I realized that it was done in 1990, which almost led to a '4', but decided to keep it in the mediocre '5' that is. 'Metamorphis' does on some occasions, it seems like a good movie trying desperately to leave. The performance, although not stellar, is mainly competent. You may even see the occasional glow of modest quality. Rhythm is a big problem with the movie. After thinking that I was watching for ninety minutes, I realized that I was only watching an hour. The special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be quite competent enough to get around this weakness. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, a slightly charismatic man who seems to be trying a mixed channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher. Reeves, reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon's character in 'Wild Things'. Female heroine does a good job, but it does not distinguish itself anyway. There's a "naughty girl" role here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it does not look like much. There is a child actor that the director can not decide if he is grumpy, cheerful or just plain weird. <br /> <br /> The pace, as I said, is the worst problem with this movie, until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a Power Ranger blush. It's bizarre and inexplicable, until the final scene that is supposedly dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with all the bad camera tricks and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> A Decent Time Watch at the 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. Nothing that will bring you back and nothing to buy on your own.
