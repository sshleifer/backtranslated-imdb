I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess I did not do this before watching TLB, and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above-average rating on IMDb. I thought I had a complete lack of history. You end up falling into it (and, unfortunately, not in the way that Private Ryan's Rescue left us in the movie), and it also has a sudden end, which was very unsatisfactory for me. <br /> <br /> To admit, the wounded soldiers seemed quite realistic to me, especially with the low budget in mind. But prepare to laugh ... Some guys are being thrown into the air after an explosion, as if they were Olympic gymnasts. A corkscrew in the middle of the air or a somersault during World War I is a little too much for me, especially when it runs countless times during the movie ... But the parts that really made me laughing until I almost cried were the scenes containing close combat. The German voices screaming and screaming ... incredibly funny. It seems they are spoken by a single voice actor / performer, because they all sound exactly alike, and it sounds like a "typical" German voice. <br /> <br /> I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone except for people who just want to laugh because of the sad and tacky quality of it.
