How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just do not understand. Trick or Treat did it. That sucks and likes it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of those movies that I have to warn people about. It is a vile atrocity to induce vomiting just begging to be seen so that you may feel much worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no redeeming factors. <br /> <br /> For a movie about heavy metal, it sure does not seem to understand what heavy metal is or what it stands for. This film manages to make heavy metal look lame and that was 1986, probably one of the strongest hours of heavy metal. This is a great feat, no matter how negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or treat = so bad that you will be angry at yourself for having watched. This simple equation, hopefully, will keep you away from this film without brain and without bubbles.
