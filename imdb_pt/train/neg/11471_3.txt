Is it a coincidence that the Orca was made two years after Jaws? Orca is not exactly a "Jaws rip off," but it's obvious he tried to profit from Jaws' success. First of all Orca in my opinion was a bad movie, not terrible, but definitely not good, average at best. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a killer whale (orca) after seeing his mate and his fetus killed by a fisherman looking for revenge. I could not bear to watch this movie again. The direction of this film is poor and when compared to Jaws, it seems that the director, producers and writers were almost without talent. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it was very average and believable, but the real characters are not at all pleasant. The effects were good for his time and the images of the killer whale looked very good. <br /> <br /> Violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people. The music is exaggerated and very loud, muffling the sound effects and annoying at times. I hated how they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales do not mate with only one partner as described in Orca). <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was bad / bad in my opinion, because of the reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this movie more because of the concept of revenge between animals and humans, so I will not spoil this movie and I can understand why some people might like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but by its concept possibly a 5/10)
