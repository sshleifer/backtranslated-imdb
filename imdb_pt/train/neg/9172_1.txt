When I go to see a movie about zombies, I'm not expecting Oscar-caliber performances, or writing at The Godfather level, but I hope the actors at least do not seem to struggle to read their suggestion cards, and dialogue this does not appear to have been typed 10 minutes before the actor reads it on camera. This movie was just awful, I actually got up and left about 25 minutes and went to the next door and watched Cold Creek Manor, which was not great either, but it looked like Citizen Kane was compared to that pile of trash . On the plus side, the girls were very pretty, this is probably the only thing that kept me in my place for longer than the first 5 minutes, actually I left after the hottest was killed, there was nothing to hold the my interest thereafter.
