I had never thought that the pattern of Yashraj movies would degrade in such a way! The film has a nonsensical plot that does not draw attention. <br /> <br /> Saif turned out to act. Kareena has improved her figure, but she's not a good actress anyway. Akshay is good. Anil is good too. I can say that the paper was not good ... Much of the low price is filled. He asked if this should be the "comic part" of the film. Just because the last films were unsuccessful, does that mean the Yashraj movies should do that kind of crap? It has a history of so many good movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.
