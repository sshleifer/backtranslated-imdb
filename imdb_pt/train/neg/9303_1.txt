I'm writing this review having watched it for several months ... the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy that ragged excuse for a movie. It's a complete joke ... and literally a spit in front of true horror-generation classics like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which they even had the audacity to compare on the back cover. The producer who played Brandon should use hamburgers and serve greasy burgers ... hell he could not even be good at it either! The lighting was bad, bad and a big hassle throughout the movie that you could not see the actor's faces at times. I do not even remember the rest of the cast members, which is really sad, they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable. That's the whole time I'm going to lose this analysis. PLEASE, stay as far away from this pile of garbage, even if you get 25 cents, do not buy a piece of chewing gum, at least IT would keep you entertained! If you want good quality low budget fun, much better than that ... then check out a Jeff Hayes movie ... because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it that! I gave this 1 star just for the cover art .... this is the only thing worth liking about this so called "movie" <br /> <br /> Rick Blalock
