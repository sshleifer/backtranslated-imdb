I downloaded this movie yesterday through a website the quality was kind of good! I was watching the movie with great expectations (although I knew it was a failure), especially since the movie has superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a villain. Although at least actors like him had made some value to their roles. sadly, Mr. Bachchan failed to impress as a villain this proved that no one can compete with the judgment of AMJAD KHAN, the magician Rgv, to re-ignite the past! Sholay, the former is a landmark in Indian cinema with a cast of stars, a cult dialogue, sleek cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack that is still a hit too for present generations. A good actor like TALENTS by Ajay Devgan is wasted and his performance was average. Prrashant Raj, a newcomer does not know what acting is. Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have I do not know how she is still in the RGV team Urmila & Abhishek seen in a song without emotion and passion Mohanlal tried his best and the work of Susmitha Sen was good in some way I liked her work in this movie It was a carnage Total of the original Sholay
