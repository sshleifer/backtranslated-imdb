The black guy becomes a rich white guy, and the rich white guy seems to embrace hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments in that movie are the result. The problem I have is that it does not work and hardly ever works. <br /> <br /> OK, so no one would expect Lance to take such a body and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. That would be asking too much. I'll grant that. But at the same time, it goes too far in the other direction. Should I imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely challenging things, playing as if he were a bastion of hip-hop culture, and people just accepted it? And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him * like a rich white man *, though she does not care about his money or power? This is so unbelievable that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> I just could not suspend disbelief and could not finish the movie. I added an extra star because it made me laugh, even hard, sometimes. But I just could not get past all the "white guy doing hip hop," which has never been well done in any movie I've ever seen that tries it. This was no exception.
