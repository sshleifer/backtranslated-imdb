It's been a long time since I last saw such a bad movie ... The acting is very average, the story is horribly annoying, and I do not understand the words about the execution. It was completely unoriginal. And this is as much a comedy as a pregnant Schwarzenegger from Clint Eastwood! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the one with the TV show - where the hell are you?) worked out - the cast was 80%, let's face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I guess that could never happen to that on your resume! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who is an actor and clearly should be an actor) did. Fred Durst was the only one who looked better than any of the others. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you consider watching it - I recommend you become something less traumatic, because that's not all. a total loss of time, but also a weak example of bad cinema.
