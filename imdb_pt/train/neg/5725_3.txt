2005 gave us the very decent "gore porn" flick Hostel, and 2006 gave us Live Feed; a not-so-decent rip-off from the Hostel. The Live Feed follows pretty much the same formula as Eli Roth's previous film except that this time the dumb boys are in Asia and not in Central Europe. The plot focuses on these idiot kids, and one of them bothered one of the locals to get them in trouble. The locals decide to lock them all in a theater and kill them. Despite the fact that I heard some less favorable things about this movie before seeing it, I still hoped it could be at least kind of decent because director Ryan Nicholson made the very decent 45-minute rape and revenge movie 'Torched', but this movie falls down simply because most of it is ridiculous or boring. The film is obviously trying to go back to the good old days of the Grindhouse movie theater (which the Hostel did successfully), but it really does not come out. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work on special effects - not even the blood is impressive ... although it's so much better than acting! There's not much else I can say about this movie ... it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!
