I already liked Wesley Snipes in several action movies and I expected a lot more, even with a score of 5.8 from IMDb, the movie can not entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is unfortunately slimmer and will imitate a "worst-case scenario" of playing "strong" feelings accompanied by bad acting ... Do not waste time on this movie, but if you want to cry, it may be enough, even if your tears are crying over Wesley Snipes in the tragic comedy action movies ... <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10, it was really horrible, if you want to see a decent movie, go see the shooting game or rent it, it's all good movie is not.
