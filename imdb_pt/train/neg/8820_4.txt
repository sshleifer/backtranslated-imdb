Going into a movie like this, I expected nothing amusing except for a bunch of deaths ... what I won was even less. <br /> <br /> Christmas Eve 1947 a child witnesses their parents doing this while Dad is in a Santa Claus outfit. Horrified, he climbs the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is his normal boyfriend every day ... except for the fact that he is obsessed with Santa. After his boss makes fun of him, he goes crazy, dresses up as Santa and starts killing those customers who do not believe in Santa and his boss. A cluttered neighborhood comes up to him and just as they are about to torch him, he drives his van from a cliff ..... on the moon. It was not the best final I saw, but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow, boring movie that really did not have ransom quality, except when Harry went to churchgoers. There was almost no blood and even the "sex" scenes were attenuated. <br /> <br /> Very tedious ... 4 of 10
