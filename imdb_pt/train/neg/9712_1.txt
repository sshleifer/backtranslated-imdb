This film is one of the most distorted portraits in history. Extremely inaccurate, this film does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of enslaved Dutch, British, Chinese, American, and Native American workers whom the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge should be built "on the bodies of the white man," as the Japanese chief engineer claims. It is disgusting that such indescribable horrors committed by the Japanese captors are the source of a film, where the bridge itself is nowhere near the royal bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. And the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and everything it's supposed to portray. His friends were starved, tortured and murdered by cruel sadists. Those who have not died of disorder, hunger or disease are deeply hurt by the film that makes the light of their dark times.
