This was one of the most ridiculous and poorly directed films I've seen in a long time. I never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I'd try it: a big mistake. The film supposedly shows how the murders of Son of Sam's real life affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; what he really did was focus around the most boring characters that I doubt anyone cared about their problems with drugs, problems with marriage, etc. etc. The scenes that describe the murders are just that and nothing more; a shootout and then back to the Saturday Night Fever! What's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee's choice to appear as a reporter in the movie: Spike, trust me, you're not Hitchcock, stay out of the movies, that makes them even worse. The dumbest scene had to be the dog talking in a goofy voice, which was portrayed in a scene before it, where it should have been filmed ??? Spike, what were you thinking when you made this movie? Not thinking at all is my guess. People who think they will see a crime drama, take my advice and do not waste their time or money on this loser. You're better watching Jerry Springer in this case! Waste of film, I gave him a 1 in 10: horrible failure.
