Justin goes home to live with his rigid and uncompromising police detective, but it looks like Dad turned upstairs into three makeshift apartments, each with bizarre tenants residing in them. The straight-line idealist Justin is pushed into the world of occultism, murder, drinking underage and other cowardly things. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, I saw the same movie that almost all the other reviewers here saw ??? Intelligent, convincing, original, intense, intelligent, brilliant ???? !!? I witnessed none of those things. What I saw was a low budget, uninteresting, bland, whimsy, extremely clich√©d thriller that was full of implausibilities and no tension at least as the killer is telegraphed as soon as in the movie as he gives his monologue / debate / discussion . And where are those good-humored moments of laughter? I never laughed, maybe because I was too busy struggling not to be put to sleep by the movie. <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Audio commentary with director Dave Campfield; Second comment with several contributors as well as isolated music tracks; 4 featurettes (Making of, in the set, transforming 1 room into 4 and into the black circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Desiree Gould and Raine Brown; Alternative scenes; bloopers; a video clip of 'Addiction'; A trailer for this movie; And trailers of "Shock-a-rama", "Chainsaw Sally", "Skin Crawl", "Sinful", "Bacterium", "Creature of Caipira Lagoon" and "Millenium Crises".
