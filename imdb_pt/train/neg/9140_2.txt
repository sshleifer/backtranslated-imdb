Phew - I do not know what to say. This is a movie that can be very good with a lot of stoned viewers. Some of the actors reminded me of John Waters' first offerings. Maybe I should accept that - I do not want to insult Waters' ability as director / storyteller. I particularly loved the lawyer by taking the "full faith and credibility" clause. It is about "full faith and credit"! <br /> <br /> It also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys," where the lead actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc. This kind of multi-stakeholder ventures, such as this one, are likely to be left to experienced film professionals who would have the technical ability (even if it's a feat, some would say) to pull something like that.
