The Battlestar Gallactica was so good because it had a tight writing, great looks, great actors and interesting stories ... And yes, there were hot men and women running in and out of the uniform. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just lazy. Lazy writing. Actors smoking a storm to give them "character". Outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else (yes, this is a Ford Focus sitting in the background). Lots and lots of teen angst. Many naked women spinning (but in the background. Which I'm sure will be cut to the series) and a symbolic view of some men in towels. None of the actors except Polly Walker caught my attention. In an hour and a half, I was still wondering when it would end. <br /> <br /> So, what exactly should that bring me back? Science fiction? It's very clear about that. The actors? In addition to the good play of Polly Walker, there is not much interest in being done here. There are no hotties in the cast, except perhaps Esai, although for the younger group he is quite old, since he is over 25 years old. I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and unfortunately, I think I'm right. I predict a very short run for this as a series, unless they really sharpen their pencils on SciFi and work doing it more than The OC on another planet.
