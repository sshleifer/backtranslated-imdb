This movie is a mess. I'm surprised you even have a theatrical version. Without Robin Williams, he would have gone straight to the video. It is misspelled. It's misdirected. It is worse the offense is that he took an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and annoying thriller that has no thrill and no suspense and no internal or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour, the film fits into a series of ridiculous sets which are so exaggerated that the audience I saw was laughing at it. Save your money. The trailer is totally misleading - it is not suspenseful and there are no emotions - in fact the worst offense of the movie is that it is simply boring.
