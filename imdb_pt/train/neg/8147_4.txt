This movie was a confusing piece of trash. You never knew what was happening. The characters were poorly written and for the most part they were totally unfriendly, except for Gus (masterfully played by George Eads). I hate this movie, but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) he should have won an Academy Award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameful and tacky film. All your life you've sunk to every new low. Someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies. It was also supposed to be a horror movie because it was so much funnier than scary. For shame Lifetime, out of shame.
