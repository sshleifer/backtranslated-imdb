You can not go far when the initial story is not so good. The premise that the cyborg is in need of blood is just stupid. <br /> <br /> The script is blas√© '. The actors do not have much to work with. The scenarios were staged in the desert to cut costs. It is a trademark that if the background is the desert, then the film has no budget. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget is good if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work from $. but this movie looks like they had to join the change just to buy a sandwich for the cameraman. Again, forgivable if only the story were not just a drug. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie commits the greatest crime of all: it does not end! It simply ends up as if it were a commercial break from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. Just weird. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
