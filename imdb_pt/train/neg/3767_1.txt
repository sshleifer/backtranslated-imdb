Budget, decent actors ... who knew these things were important. Do not waste your time on this piece of junk. The effects suck. The acting sucks. The only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little T & A cheap and that is wasted in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is very strange profanity. It was as if they found the only 7 people on the planet who had never cursed before. Let's take off the hat! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a poorly dressed guy, come back and see old photos. The only way for a Bigfoot movie to be good is for it to have a big budget and some actors that did not come from the Frogballs Community Theater.
