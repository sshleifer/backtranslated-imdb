I am a Christian and I say that this film had terrible, unreal and unreal situations and a completely different facade for Christianity. You can also watch "Remember the Titans" and at least not mix Christ in a football movie as a stereotypical steroid for losers. Let me make some really compelling comments of what bothered me in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and was a white academy school. I did not notice a single student or black player in school. I deal with the "Christian" White Academies in the south and they were built just to re-establish segregation. This is worrying when the film is about Christianity and Christ changing lives ... how about changing the hearts of segregation? (Note: I loved the symbolic black coach, as if it compensated the wholly white team and all the black players of the 'Giants'). <br /> <br /> 2. The uncritical acclamation of all Christians about this film. I can call some people to say that it was bad acting, bad filming, poor writing and, in short, poor compared to other movies. If we were to compare this to another football movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. The half-cooked Christianity that was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending. If Christianity is simply reading a small scripture and praying to begin a complete change of life, then do not be surprised when no one will hear what Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a cure for all. It does not have to be sold and you do not have to cling to those extravagant lifestyles. No wonder everyone regards anti-intellectual Christianity with this unreal presentation. <br /> <br /> I recognize that this movie can be inspiring to some people. For most, it will not be. It will not give a real picture of honest struggle and tension. More important to me, he is not a Christian at all. It has values, but it falls short as a "pull-up-to-pluck" message as shallow as positive thinking. If you live alongside people struggling and / or living in Third World living conditions, this movie will be empty, like most churches nowadays in their religion.
