Here's the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visually stunning animated film of the current home theater release. The art and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend you give this film a visual by virtue of the visual. <br /> <br /> And now for the bad news. I really mean it when I say that animation is the only thing this movie has for it. You may remember that "Spirit" was badly defeated by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person who argues that it was because Disney is better established and had better publicity can write me a four-page essay titled "Why the Lilo and Stitch script did not stink." /> For all the incredible new animation technology on display in "Spirit", the story is almost * incredibly * bland. There is a lesson here and (needless to say) does not just apply to animated films. You may have the most amazing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we do not care about your characters, it's a bad movie. That simple. The animation is still mind-boggling; I can not wait to see what someone with more imagination does with it.
