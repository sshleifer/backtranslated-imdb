Confessing having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a fairly difficult admission for a heterosexual to do. But what can I tell you? Maybe it's that famous extra that everyone talks about and makes a star a star. Cross that barrier. It pulls you into unfamiliar sensual and emotional territory. Brando had in spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course, and in more recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. The women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt, alone, redefined the concept. He's the only reason to get out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into a theater to see "Troy" If you liked Jupiter's Darling epics you might like that. But if you do not, keep it the same, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
