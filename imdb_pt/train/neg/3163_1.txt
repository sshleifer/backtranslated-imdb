Well, this is the first post I'm commenting on about IMDb. You understand, this movie made me come and warn all the good souls that will stop trying movies. <br /> <br /> As most of them have given their comments I thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors (although having read the worst critics against this movie) I thought of trying it assuming it was some movie of comedy. Well, it all started well with some ... comedies ... so it all started to get pathetic ... man, you can believe in yourself, you feel like going and hitting your head every time the pathetic-looking woman called heroin of the film becomes impotent. ..Huh ~~ Well, how much a person can stomach a sick ghost every witch trying to do everything he can to annoy him and prevent him from what you are doing. <br /> <br /> The second worst thing about the movie is, the hero "ZOMBIE", yes, while he loses his fianc√©, he walks around like a goat, with black marks Under his eyes, and with the sister "terribly stupid" of the hero ... you would be bleeding from head to toe if you tried and could watch this movie completely!
