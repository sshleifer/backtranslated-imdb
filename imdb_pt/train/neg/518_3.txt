Bela Lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve-part adventure serial, playing the part of Frank Chandler / Chandu the Magician, enjoying his role as White's forces representative against Black's forces while exhibiting vigorous fighting ability courting a young Egyptian princess and cutting a gaunt and gaudy figure in yacht equipment, wearing a nautical cap. The somewhat troublesome plot involves Chandler / Chandu in a continuing series of adventures aimed at getting the ransom of his fianc√©e, Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and others from the clutches of the idol worshiping sect of Ubasti, who covets Nadji's blood for revivify an old mummified princess buried in the mysterious island of Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, a veteran of these entertainments, keeps the events moving, but he repeated scenes and filming, much of which can be found in KING KONG's previous year's Skull Island scene and the SON OF KONG harbor site . reduces the original action to less than 60 minutes of the series runtime of more than two and a half hours and if viewed in one session, it becomes devoid of effect for most viewers unless it is insomnia.
