Nicolas Roeg? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DO NOT LOOK NOW didn`t it? Strangely, the aforementioned film was aired on BBC television over the weekend, which made today's screening of Cold Heaven, which does not favor as much. <br /> <br /> You see that it is impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DO NOT LOOK NOW, since they both have the same director and the same structure, and in the first third of COLD HEAVEN I thought they also had The same conspiracy, except for a dead husband, was replaced instead of a dead child, in fact, my mind was turned to this movie that revolves around a tormented widow watching her late husband running through Venice wearing a red anorak. This does not occur, but about a third of the way through the execution time there is a huge turnaround and although being an essential turnaround is not explained in depth. In fact, very little is explained in Cold Heaven, which spoils the film. <br /> <br /> People have mentioned COLD HEAVEN's rather weak production values ​​and it is impossible not to notice them. If I had not been different, I would have thought that it was a TVM, since it has made for the television to feel up to white capital letters in the sequence of the title. Roeg also tries to inject artistic pretensions through processes of spoken thought, but again this does not help the film at all. One can not help feeling that Roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists, which are totally flat on the screen. <br /> Cheap production values, disinterested direction, and really bizarre premise and screenplay make a bad movie
