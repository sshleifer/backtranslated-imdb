This must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with another commentator who said the special effects were fine. I found them very bad: it simply was not realistic and they were so false that they ended up distracted from the real story. <br /> <br /> Maybe this distraction is the reason why I did not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for "the whole". They do not bother to say that set, or what is so special about it. This also does not make it clear why they seek him in California while the film's introduction takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you are shooting a movie that happens in the desert, make the effort. to really go to the desert. The beginning - the old ceremony - seems to have been filmed inside a studio rather than a desert. <br /> <br /> The level of action was constant throughout the film, without ups and downs, without climax. This made the film look short, and that's certainly a pro for that particular movie.
