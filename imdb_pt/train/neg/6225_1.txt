I doubt this is a cult movie. I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I did not expect much from that movie and I won even less. What might have been clever and moving was exaggerated. It was devoid of music that made Gram and had more fill than cheap food for dogs. There was no record of Gram or the colorful people of the day. The characters shown were not familiar to me, even though I was a fan of Gram and all the versions of his "life-after-death adventures" I heard. Rock and roll is full of tales, good too, but they must be taken with a grain of salt. They might be great stories, though exaggerated. However, this movie had a good story and turned into guts. Stealing any corpse and the ensuing implications should never be a dull story, but somehow made it monotonous. I am tempted to steal all copies of Grand Theft Parsons, go out into the desert and burn them all.
