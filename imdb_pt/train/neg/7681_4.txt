Sean, you know I think you're absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can not praise him for that. Comedy is not your forte. <br /> <br /> However, it was not all your fault. Some of the things were very difficult to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you must wonder where the lines came from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... I apologize.
