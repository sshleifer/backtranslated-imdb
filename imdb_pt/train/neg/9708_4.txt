When theater employees find an old movie roll, they decide to show it at the midnight session of Night of the Living Dead, assuming it's an old preview roll. Unfortunately, it's actually an old Nazi mind-control experiment that turns the public into a horde of noisy, senseless zombies. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the hatred for this movie. It's a low-budget independent production with lots of camp, but it does not deserve a "1.1" here in IMDb. It's so fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love old horror films, and have created an amusing homage to them, full of references and tributes to a variety of them. It has the feel of things like Night of the Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, and several others. <br /> <br /> I liked the explanation of how zombies, although really only hypnotized into thinking that they are zombies, actually come to have the physical attributes of the undead, perhaps, but I appreciate the effort of the writers to explain it. The bloody effects were decent for the budget, the acting was good and the story was fun. I liked it.
