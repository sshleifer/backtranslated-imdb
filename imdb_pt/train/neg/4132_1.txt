Characteristic of the cinema of the beginning of the 21st century, it allows different evil and evil creatures to meet against each other. We have not seen things like this since Godzilla v King Kong and so forth. It always sounds good on paper when you are matching and in a fog of good things you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing before you like Beethoven's symphonies. So you get to write it. Great ideas like all vampires are women. Ergo hot, seductively deadly, but somehow I want to perish in a way. And all zombies are men. well this is what men are like a woman soon after she was thrown away or cheated, right? So everything looks good to actually do this. Then the rot begins to settle. The Mosters fight. Nothing happens much. Another fight Philosophical noodles and wallop cod. Eureka found out how to win. Great fight again and the end. Sounds great, does not it? If it were an independent company, it would be great. But that's Hollywood with the dollar eye: brightness instead of what the fans want. Everything could have been very soggy.
