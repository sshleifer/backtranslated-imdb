I rented this by mistake. I thought, after a superficial examination of the box, that this was a time travel / science fiction story. Instead, it is a "Christian" story, and I suppose it is a rather typical example. If you are sold in the message, you will probably ignore the embarrassment of the plot / acting / etc, but I found it quite painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I am bothered by the rewriting of the story in this story. She paints the 1890s as a kind of paradise of family values ​​and morality (a character is horrified by the fact that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), But neglects very unpleasant sides of this "highly moral" (rigid racial , sexual and social discrimination was widespread, for example). And at one point the hero complains with a clothing store owner about things that do not sound so different from some Iranian leaders' complaints about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent WSJ). <br /> <br /> All in all, I thought, I suppose it's the kind of thing you'll like if you like that sort of thing, and it's certainly healthy ...
