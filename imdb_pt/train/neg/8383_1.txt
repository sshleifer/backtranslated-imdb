...Ever. This is the background. I'm not kidding. The theater should have had some kind of warning. 'Abandoning all the hope of you who enter here' would have been appropriate. <br /> <br /> I have no words to accurately describe the hell that this movie is. His debilitating stupidity still can not amuse. This movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the litter box. The story was blatantly stolen from a 10-minute Bugs Bunny cartoon and then stretched out as Mr. Fantastic for 90 terribly painful minutes. <br /> <br /> I remember when the Wayans were funny. I think the Hollywood pressures for them to produce produce are guilty of poop that develops at a consistent rate. I'm sad and offended that they think we're stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of jokes with a little story based on a cartoon. <br /> <br /> I did not like almost everything about this movie. . I will not ruin anything, but the baby is actually a dwarf with Marlon Wayans' evil face superimposed on the dwarf's body. What I liked was the ending. Not the resolution of the movie, but the real ending where we all get up and leave. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a star, but it clearly deserves less. I do not feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star. That deserves a Razzie and I ask God to get it. <br /> <br /> When people will learn; if you stop paying to see this idiocy, they will stop vomiting. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.
