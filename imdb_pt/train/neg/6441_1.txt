When I looked at this year's Wrestlemania game card, I was so happy and unable to control myself because I was full of emotion. <br /> <br /> It starts ... and ends. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, angry at hell because of how much I wanted my money back. I mean, you watch Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) which will fall like a classic and then you expect the same and get the average junk they have from time to time. The only moment in the whole show that ruined for me was when HBK knocked out !!!! At that very moment HBK losing to JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is a loser / poser. Almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 when he hit TRIPLE H! I could not watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to watch again (luckily). I again have faith in WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I've ever seen) that was a pure and classic Wrestlemania. Definitely made up for 'Mania 23 and gave us many memorable moments too. <br /> <br /> If you've watched ANY of the Wrestlemania before this, like the ones that turn you into fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), PLEASE do not watch this and make the same mistake I did and leave the WWE back. And if you watch and get angry, start watching again and see Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
