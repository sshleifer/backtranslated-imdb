The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this film is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire immensely. The bonds had absolutely no chemistry. Not for a second could I believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them. The story just does not sound true. Add to that affected conversation tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow plot that basically does not get you anywhere, and you have a real problem. Kay Lenz's nudity scenes may be worth it for those looking for some lewd food, but on the other hand, this is a colossal waste of time. My thoughts while watching the movie was that it would have been better titled "Cheesy."
