This is a horrible movie. Yes, the girls are beautiful, but they are not very good. The plot having a cowboy getting involved with an Indian maiden would be interesting if sex did not get in the way. Well, okay, it might be interesting, but it's not, because it's so rhythmic and only partially acted. I can only imagine what the dance closes were like on a big screen, probably more laughable than on TV. (I'm not even going to mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing in the chest. I've never read about it in the old west) This is a film that requires the liberal use of rapid advance. /> <br /> I like schlock movies, but this is ridiculous. There is a reason I do not go for this kind of movie and they are not very good, the plot occupying a secondary place in the breasts. The original nudie cuties, as they are called, were originally nudist films or movies where there was nothing, but when the adult industry began to grow, the filmmakers tried to be smart or tried to exploit something else to get asses in the seats. The smart ones were very few who only left hacks that were of limited talent. The comedies often worked out better with the humor approaching the first series, childlike, but harmlessly fun. Something that could rarely be said about any other gender cross dressed as a nudie. <br /> <br /> The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces, but it's made for being neither western nor sex movie. <BR> I do not need to see it again. <br /> <br /> Of interest to anyone, the rapist and murderer of the film was played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for murdering a schoolteacher not long after filming wrapped. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this kind of thing will ruin some people's lives.
