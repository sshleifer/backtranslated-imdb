I expected a comedy like the movies "Big Mama". Instead, the film was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story. <br /> <br /> This film has three plots: the first involves Madea and she having an adopted child. The second involves a woman who is committed to a rich man who is abusing her. The third involves a relationship between a single mother with two children and a single parent. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is very little comedy in the movie. There are also several very distorted messages in the movie. For example, Madea beats the foster child with a belt (in a comical way), to convince the child to straighten up. The child, in fact, turns around. Apparently, it pays to beat up the kids. <br /> <br /> There are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old men who look at young girls who are related to them. (The look goes on at a family reunion.) The movie jumps from the plot to the plot so that you are always unbalanced. Is this a comedy, a love story or a drama? In fact, it's nothing ... except a waste of time and money.
