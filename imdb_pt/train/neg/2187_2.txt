I bought this movie on DVD so I could have an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fortunately, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are watched because the movie itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story that can be followed and some actors that can act, there is nothing else. The film was so boring that I firmly confirmed that I will never watch it again without Tom, Crow and Mike. As summarized above, however, it was better than the movie presented in the episode MST3K that preceded it; Mitchell.
