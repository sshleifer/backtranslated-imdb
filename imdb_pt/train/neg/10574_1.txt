With the exception of FAMILY, this new season is worse than the first season. I can not imagine what they are thinking. As a horror fan, you can tolerate a lot of violence and clutter, but this series gets worse with each exit. I can not imagine how discouraging it must be for the actors and staff to go to work every day, toiling to produce this crap. STORY! Is it too much to ask? CHARACTER! How can we give a damn about ANYONE's fate in these stories? If we're not engaged, who cares if they're broken or whatever? Almost all episodes end with irrational bloodshed, going into a coarse shock with no sense of revelation or conclusion, or REASON why we were subjected to an hour of bloodshed. Even Dante's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and turned to a meaningless conclusion. Ironically, production values ​​and performances tend to be faster while content is absolute crap. I have high hopes for VALARIE UNDER THE STAIRS, but let's see.
