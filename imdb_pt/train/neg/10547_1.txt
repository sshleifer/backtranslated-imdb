I can not remember a movie where I have cared less about where the characters came from, what happens to them or where they are going. I realize that Hollywood's biggest hobby is a navel look, but these people are either too sleazy or too boring to handle the weather. Why it is worth, however, the discussion that followed the exhibition, under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series, made the three women show some redeeming features. I disagree.
