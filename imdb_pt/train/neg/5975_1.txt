I never wanted to see this movie, so one day, for a joke, I watched to see how bad it was; my prejudices have been confirmed. To begin with, I would like to question the policy of the film. It hides behind the women's mask 'making it big in the city', but the only way women can make it great is through the use of their sexuality instead of their intelligence or skills. These women are no longer prostitutes. Are slightly less attractive girls who can not succeed? This is not the only right message from the movie, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge wads of money. A good example of how the only powerful thing in the United States is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even taken a look at this film. Money is represented as the only important thing for young people. <br /> <br /> The bar manager declares that she does not allow drug users in her bar, and then she goes for poor gallons of her own neck liqueur and then the necks of her staff and clients. Anyone who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And finally, why are scenes in which the main character is a point of sexual interest? interest to the public (when she is undressing or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watched her undressing with the camera practically stroking her legs while she is a phone to her father. She 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her boyfriend. I find this very strange. In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascist, degrading to women and, frankly, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
