This is a typical low-budget mess of the 1970s. It's supposed to be a documentary about a crew hunting Bigfoot by the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype, from the Native American to the cynical cowboy. The acting and narration are a complete joke. If you expect to see a lot of bigfoot images - keep waiting. There will not be much, and what you can do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder; would look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like the low rate of 1970; I do. It is that this is a mess of bad acting, bad characters, bad story and no emotions that you just can not enjoy. It does not fit into the category "so bad it's good", nor can you laugh at how bad it is without the help of illicit substances. It's basically a lot of boring scenes of people camping, hiking, riding horses and watching wildlife. There is a bigfoot attack that is completely stupid; supposedly our friend Sasquatch is throwing rocks on the campers from above while firing his rifles back at him. By now, you're really hoping Bigfoot will knock some of the rocks off the filmmaker's head and stop the whole thing.
