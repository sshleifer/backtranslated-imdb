### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What is this movie offering? Out of control editing and cinematography that combines with a terrible plot. It's sad to see that Denzel Washington's talents are wasted on junk like this. We are certainly insinuated that Mexicans can not save themselves, necessary external forces, possibly military, Americans. And we know that the father is a dark character, after all he is Mexican, unlike the woman who appreciates Creasey more because he is American. He killed them all thinking she died. It's her? Of course, she will not, she is a child and you should not hurt the sensibility of the Hollywood fan. Trade off the scene was the only thing that prevented me from rating it below the "implausible success" (as some critics pointed out) "Taken". The nausea of ​​such films will take time to go. It is in the classification of such films that we have to doubt the credulity of IMDb.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Who knows! Mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
