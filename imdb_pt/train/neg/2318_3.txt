Kid found as a baby in the trash and raised in a martial arts academy has a way to sink baskets. With the help of the man who found him, he enters college and is promoted to the championship while looking for his true parents. Infinitely better in action comedy pieces is a real mess as a whole. He seems to be struggling for a hippie basketball version of Shaolin football, but the comedy is scatter shot, his focus wanders more than a Chihuahua with ADD in the quadruple espresso. I kept asking, "What am I watching?" I watched from start to finish and still do not know what happened. It's a shame, as there are some action scenes, some fun jokes and occasional moments, but nothing, none of that joins, I accept.
