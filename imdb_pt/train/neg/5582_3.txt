The 60s were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social turmoil and turmoil were common as people talked about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were part of daily fabric and daily news. This film tried to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining film, and largely succeeded. <br /> <br /> In this film, two families are followed: one white and one black. During the first half of the movie, the story follows each family on an equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. It is true that there are more characters in this family, and the plots are mixed, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century. <br /> <br /> In general, the performance is well made and historical. the footage is mixed with original colored pictures and in black and white to give a documentary feel to the film. The film is a work of fiction, but clips of known historical figures are used to define the timeline. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but the situations were predictable and the plot was one-sided.
