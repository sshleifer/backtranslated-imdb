After the superb AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of a Gujarati piece, it comes with WAQT, which also looks like a play. <br /> <br /> In plays, we have characters screaming, exaggerating here also the same <br /> <br /> The first half shows Amitabh almost playing with the 40+ Akshay Kumar, who acts very funny as a little nerd <br /> <br /> The film has a good message of how not to ruin your child, but unfortunately the way Amitabh wants to make Akki responsible is absolutely false <br /> <br /> Even his motive to hide his illness , your hospital escape and Akki's melodramatic speech is a discouragement <br /> <br /> Some emotions touch you, but most are way above the top <br /> <br /> Rajpal's comedy is hilarious , but very stretched in the second half <br /> <br /> The direction of Vipul Shah is very exaggerated, although some scenes are good. okay <br /> <br /> Among the actors Amitabh exaggerates in the first time, but is superb in emotional scenes Akshay Kumar also does his part well but seems a bit uncomfortable in some very small ones His chemistry with Bachchan is unparalleled Rajpal is a he makes you laugh without overdoing and just his presence and his stupid behavior and impassive humor he is a riot Boman is good in some comic parts but very high in places Priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do, this is his last movie with Akki so far Shefali is incredible although she seems too young for Bachchan
