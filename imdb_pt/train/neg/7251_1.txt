Great West I hear everyone say! Brilliant first effort! Well, I'm not sure of the movie you guys watched, but it must have been different from what I saw. Great westerns or even good movies of any genre have characters you can believe in and this movie had none! The acting was bad to say the least and I could not care less about any of the characters, making the whole movie pointless. the story was too big for the creators and maybe they should try to do things directly for low-budget TV, as you see in those science fiction "FACT OR FICTION" programs. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for a good movie, a great western or even just a nice hour and a half, please look elsewhere.
