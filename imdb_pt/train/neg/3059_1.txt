Okay, I recently got a chance to rent this and watch Santa get the martain. Although children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa was a much worse movie. As a designation in Spanish in Spanish, we all had to attend. I'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie we're all just talking and eating food, but not for this movie. Everyone just gasped, wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch would do next. Would Merlin help Santa?!! or would your reindeer robot come and save the day? I would suggest renting it because it's the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen and I love it for it. : D
