Stereotyped sending of slasher movies falls far short of the supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner and Zane Busby, and in fact the entire cast is totally lost. Dull jokes are plentiful and all phrases are well wired. The donkey liners come at a fast pace, and almost everyone falls like a crushed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and persists throughout the film. Another downside is the claustrophobic environment entirely within the walls of an abandoned secondary school. Avoid this and look for one of the truly funny "Lampoon" movies, such as "National Golddiggers Lampoon" - MERK
