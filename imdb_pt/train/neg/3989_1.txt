Who in good conscience plays a lyric song while at the same time portraying an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his wronged wife in the locker room, the music sung with lyrical content is as loud as dialogue, so no one can hear either, diluting whatever emotional impact the scene may have had. The scenes of Annabella being beaten by her father with fists, a lamp and then a belt were so caricatured that they were absurd. This whole movie is a cartoon, the unbridled prejudice against whites is literally amazing. The discussion of black women after Flipper's wife discovers he betrayed her to a white woman - as if it were a discussion of a team of Oxford debaters, is ridiculous. Unbridled racism may be possible to bear, but the soundtrack and sound mixing during this 'movie' is too much. It was a technically poorly made movie. There is no understanding of the basic craft of making movies, soundtrack, editing, and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this film afloat. I really felt sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he accepted a role in this film - his looks are painful. This is the first movie I saw by this director and will be my last.
