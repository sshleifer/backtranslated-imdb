GLOBAL PERFORMANCE: - Finally, the long wait AAG reaches the screens. Unfortunately, it was not possible to define progressive fire in the audience. The first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of ​​remaking the powerful SHOLAY. And Varma made a good choice to change the overall setting of the film. If he repeated the same Ramghad background, people will say again that there is nothing new about it. Different contexts are appreciative, but the way he introduced them is not worthy. From the beginning of his career at SIVA in Telugu, he used the same lighting and the same kind of experience. I do not really know this guy that Varma considers about lighting or not, or it may be that he has no other lighting technique besides Gordon Willis GODFATHER. IT'S ALL DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why would any body use so many Dutch angles and extreme close-up shots !!!!!!! The shooting division is lame. The characters could not carry an emotion, the performances are not their brand, Storytelling is worse, Background are really terrible. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabhz was prioritized in his work. VARMA produced great villains such as Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he could not sculpt the best characters of all time in Hindi Cinema. There is no comparison of Gabbar with Babban. Babban is a psychopath more than a villain, yet he has a soft chant for his brother (it's a gift in that movie). Performance Amitabhz is not your brand. Your appearance itself is pathetic. The scar on the nose symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema. Whatever they have worked on Babban is not successful. Babban is not a comparison with Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The first best thing about this character is not to put the audience in suspense on your hands. If varma did this, it would be like teaching ABCD to a bachelor. Itz good he opened the secret early. But the flashback is pathetic. Varma could not use a great actor like Mohanlal to brand him. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character with improvement. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and has been used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Hero, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body bothers or at least considers this character. The absolute failure of the film begins when the director can not work on the intimate friendship between our hero. These characters do not bring anything to this movie. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is degrading, diminishing. AAG can totally be treated as a C grade film. Sholay is a fire of revenge, problem of a city, which means a real friendship and much appreciated annoyance and amusement by Dharmendra. AAG never carried an emotion with its characters. The storytelling is too weak not to make the audience feel sympathy for the characters. Do not compare AAG with sholay, yet you will not like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare watch this movie. You will be burned alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
