Calling a movie like "Thinner" bad is like calling the Earth or Pauly Shore without talent. No news, but how they got it is what people want to know. <br /> <br /> As for this movie ... The book was good, even if it was somewhat derived from other stories of the "Be careful what you wish for" genre. Burke plays a fat lawyer who kills a gypsy's daughter and is cursed by her father (Constantine, from Room 222) on several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why involve the mafioso (Mantegna)? Why shoot so much automatic weapons? Why turn it into something so heavily dependent on FX? I thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of the madness of weight loss, illness, death, gypsy awareness and such. <br /> <br /> But no, it's not meant to be. Remember, this is the Stephen King we're talking about. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost the same as the book, but a little too much. In fact, the whole movie talks too much, feeling that it has to explain every plot that turns us on. Not that I expected "The Dead Zone", but I could have done without another "Pet Sematary", thank you anyway. <br /> <br /> One star at least to try to do a decent makeup job. However, the rest of the movie is left to be ... tell me ... "Thinner".
