This movie is really terrible. terrible as it is an 84-minute waste of your life. Special effects are so terrible. The performance was not convincing. It's about a crocodile that attacks tourists while filming a documentary about blood surfing. Blood surfing is when they surf around sharks, but it becomes terribly wrong when a 31-foot crocodile breaks holiday there. The sharks do not look real. The crocodile is even worse, and gets even more pathetic when they are fleeing from the creature, but the crocodile gets trapped and two females flash it. The killings are fake and the pirates are just to fill the time. <br /> <br /> A meaningless and terrible movie that is not worth seeing !!
