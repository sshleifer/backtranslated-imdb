This type of turkey is The Brain Machine, which has seven different titles. It's about a top-secret government project that's supposed to be able to use a computer to read people, but instead, it drives people to kill each other. or themselves, or something. Its filled with level B TV actors sitting in a paneled room with chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense. <br /> <br /> It's a nasty type turkey. Avoid this.
