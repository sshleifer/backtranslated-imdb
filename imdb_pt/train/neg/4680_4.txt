If asked how I would define the word "Shallow" I would respond "Watch a production of Jerry Bruckheimer." If asked how I would define the phrase "Potential wasted" I would respond "Watch a production of Jerry Bruckheimer." Bruckheimer's productions are almost always certain that the fire hits the box office, but almost always receives criticism from critics. Out of the top of my head, I can only think of an OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and a BLACK FALCON receiving much critical acclaim. <br /> <br /> CRIMSON TIDE has also received some critical acclaim, is certainly one of Bruckheimer's best films which, unfortunately, is not saying much. The problem I had is the scenario that sets the story: Russians are fighting the Chechens and the conflict spreads across Russia leading a Russian ultra-nationalist to take up a nuclear missile base and threaten the West if they interfere. Maybe the end of the Cold War was all about it, but I found that very unconvincing. Is it not helped by some errors in geography such as the French carrier Foch being in the Med (Wouldn`to Foch be better positioned in the Black Sea?) Or that the expository news consists of family filming featuring Balkan conflicts, the first gulf war and even the Vietnam. Again the adjective "very unconvincing" penetrated my mind. The story improves a bit when the story itself - a battle of wills involving orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - is underway. Director Tony Scott does his best as well as the cast, but the problem is still in an unconvincing setting. The worst thing is that if this had been done in the mid-1980s, when WW3 was a real possibility - not likely - this movie would have terrified me, but once the cold war was over, the dangers of nuclear war meant CRIMSON TIDE . impact.
