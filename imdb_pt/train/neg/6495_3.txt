I rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack joined David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a movie, this would be the end result. I do not think I've seen a movie like this that made a trip with LSD look like an episode of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of scenes where the characters come in and out of reality, or various realities, and the movie does not culminate in anything until the last 5 minutes, where it suddenly makes sense. I wrote a blunt review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything, and I will not do it here. It's a well-played play, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me tell you this, if there is a redeeming feature in this movie, it's the song. This fits perfectly. Some of the dialogues are incredibly good, and incredibly bad, all at the same time. <br /> <br /> I liked parts of this movie, I really did, and once you get to the end of it, you really figure out what's really going on. It is unfortunate that you have to go through 2 hours of madness to get to an important point, which minimizes the effect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this movie is not acting, that's all.
