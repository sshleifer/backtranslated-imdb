Another banner of British cinema swings. Real rubbish on offer here again. I can not understand (and I am British) why this patriotic nonsense has never been done. Eight years mark you, since when World War II had really ended! Other commenters commented on the editing and the apparent continuous use of archive images. This is extremely poorly observed. Archival material is in abundance. Aircraft model sway from wires in 'action scenes' like the wings of many children in the wind. The usual sequences from the map room tattoo the film to make us supposedly drawn to the whole Malta event. Guinness must have its worst performance ever. The shocking scenes of dog fighting back are laughable. Hawkins annoys us all in the map room. Ealing made many great movies. This clearly is not one of them. They should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot!
