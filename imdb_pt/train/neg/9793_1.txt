Powerful Morphin Power Rangers have to be the worst television show ever made. No plot, just a bunch of kids dressed up in martial arts while wearing second-rate spandex clothes. <br /> <br /> Special effects seem to be from the '70s, the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy, and the show is just plain awful. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the television show is toys, only second-rate plastic trash fed to our kids. <br /> <br /> There are much better shows for your children to watch! <br /> <br /> Try to give your kids something like Nickelodean, these programs really have some intelligence behind them, unlike the power rangers.
