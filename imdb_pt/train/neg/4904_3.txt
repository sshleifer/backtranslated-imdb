Teamo Supremo are three children, consisting of their leader - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Boy, all with their own war cry (hoe! Chika! Woopa!) And clothes and moves. They work for the governor, Kevin, and were recruited after they wanted to be heroes and play in that game. They lead normal lives as well, and have family and school duties, but most of the action happens away from school villains. All villains have unique and unique characteristics, like Mister Vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are, but they act anyway. From an evil robot to a perverse baron, the three have to confront them and stop their evil and often strange plans of gaining power, revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is quite nice and smooth, but the style seems to be simple on purpose. The backgrounds have color overlapping and the buildings look futuristic. The music is really cool, and the show is not that bad, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> The plots are almost always meaningless and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and No one can blame them for it. However, this would not be on the same level as Fillmore! or Ann Pepper.
