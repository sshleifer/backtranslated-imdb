No matter how well your "message" is - this movie is a tremendous tremor on the road - a horrible performance, a bad camera job - I do not know why Carr agreed to try to stutter - he sucks at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follows you - he just absorbs - he loves being the center of attention. He's a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Somehow Carr exhibited this film in City Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention talk about how the film touched them and maybe did - but as a film itself is hectic, predictable and Vi√ßoso .
