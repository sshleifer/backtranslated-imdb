"Laughter is a state of mind," says the tag, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson. What could he have thought during the production of "Toys"? When he saw the reeds, did he see a successful and funny fantasy? If so, then he is working on a different plan than me. This is an excruciating image, one in which the production design is 90% of the thing (and even the colors of the cartoons are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (more especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy tycoon who are skirted as heirs of the factory when his father dies. There is nothing remotely funny (satirical or clown-wise) on display here. It's uniformly arrogant, ugly and one of the worst "big" movies ever made. NO STARS of ****
