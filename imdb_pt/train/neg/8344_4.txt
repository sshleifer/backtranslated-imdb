After reading all the compliments about this movie and some that give a so-so. I finally decided to play in my valley no penny. I agree with the majority that if it had not been for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would have been a disaster. Shot in Mariette OH. north of Dogpatch, where all true talent has fled south for 77 years, at least until a gas tank allows. I got a laugh from the reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a bit better than most, claiming they followed the plot without a hint of confusion. This little tale of the Crook brothers is like an old record with a leap in it. As an American, I understand the difficulties movie artists have to face. A trip to Romania would have eliminated the budget for sure. Let's face it all this movie was a loop loop of Claire at the gas station, Claire on the side of the road, Claire under the bleachers, Claire at the house, Claire at the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire there. It almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actress in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living, but they do not write a two-page script and turn it into an hour, twenty movie. Before writing another screenplay about dreamy ghosts, watch an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little experience. The whole cast, except the one mentioned above and a couple of others were involved in their first and last film. In addition, there is an appearance of co-director Jeff as he is in all his films. So is Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the film had was that the videographer seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis's derri√®re. Well, with all the sarcasm now satisfied I still recommend the movie to the horror fan only to see this young actress in the time of her career training (I hope) and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a worthy villain worth watching.
