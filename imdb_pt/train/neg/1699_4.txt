I'm a bit of a fan of Lynche's work, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It's a series of short cartoons that try to show a disturbing and disgusting kind of humor. The animation is very crude, no doubt made using Macromedia. Each cartoon has a big fat face beating in his family and generally acting like an idiot to everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> For people who are not familiar with this vein of animation, they will probably be impressed by it. However, if you've spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, these designs will not be unlike anything else you've seen before. Many of Newgrounds' popular amateur artists are doing a much better job than what was shown on this DVD. If Lynch submitted this work to the site, it would blend in perfectly with some of Newgrounds' best artists. But since I've seen this on DVD instead of on Newgrounds, I give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as I would have otherwise. These designs are fit for the internet, but with a name like David Lynch, I expected better quality in both the story and the animation.
