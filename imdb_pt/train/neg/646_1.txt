I saw this movie by accident and this movie was an accident ... well, it must have been. Blonde women being chased, the villain appearing fading from one place to another in a minute, disappearing and reappearing, hiding. He was not even a superhero, so I do not know how he did it. He could not scare a cat and this is not hard to do. <br /> <br /> The old "mirror in the bathroom" is no longer scary, in fact, it ceased to be scary years ago. you had the policeman on the villain trail, another cliché (played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent, he's from London), the director had no idea and made a movie full of cliché and "scary movement" That was a COMEDY looks scary .. pathetic!
