You talking to me? (1987) is a very bad movie, starring a guy I've never seen before or since starring as a neighborhood guy trying to become an actor. He has a heavy jones for Taxi Driver as he tries to use this shtick to make it great. When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone else does, change his image! It goes from good to a surf guy at night. Your friend can not believe the change (but he earns points with Faith Ford and gets a great performance). Can this young punk keep his credibility on the street by becoming great? <br /> <br /> This is a real movie that tries too hard to incorporate many things at the same time. An interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution. Who knows, maybe someone will get the ball and run because the filmmakers messed up the ball this time. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this movie. Unless you want to see a hot Ford Ford and a young Bubba from the Forest Gump. xx
