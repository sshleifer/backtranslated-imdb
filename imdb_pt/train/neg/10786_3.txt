How this movie was made with so many great stars is beyond me. This is a terrible clich√© movie with the worst performance that any of these actors ever did. It really surprises me that many of these A-list stars agree with this bland movie. What's even worse is the fact that almost 100 million are made here in the states. It shows that big stars can make money, even if the movie is terrible. I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore festival. Billy Crystal tried his best with what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions. Whatever you do, do not fall in love with the excellent cast because no one could have saved it.
