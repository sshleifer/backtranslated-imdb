It's incredible because it can be terrible on many levels. The script, the acting, the direction and the choice of the cast are all terrifying. The costumes, scenarios and pseudo-medieval language are also terrible. In a weird way, I really enjoyed this movie, since I accepted that it would not be good. It seems a shame that people spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, when in fact they could have done something fairly decent from the premise (though not very believable!), But instead we are treated with a somewhat nauseating and tacky tale of dragons and knights, which does not have the charm of being found in other fantasy films. Let's just hope the Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis's haircut makes him look like He-Man. That!
