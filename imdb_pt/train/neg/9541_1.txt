I suppose a lot of people comment / review their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible - I'm writing because of the latter. <br /> <br /> I was excited for the sequel to "Wargames" .. I found the original was very good considering its length of time and content, I felt it was worth watching more than once. Being this 2008, I had high hopes for what they would do with this movie. Computers, games, terror, overzealous military has grown so much since the time of the first film, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" had the opportunity to bring everything into a great movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie has failed on virtually every level, but I particularly blame the writers and anyone who has any opinion on the realism of the aspects of the game. "The Dead Code" was a 1990s air flight simulator with some people on the floor waving their arms. Meanwhile, Will Farmer is training about 7,000 commands - none of them impacting what's happening on the screen. Until finally it "wins" by clicking on a box on the screen with the mouse that releases gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (no one is near the gas). Because he has won 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, that tells RIPLEY (the real-life war machine) that he is a high-level terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> Even if any child aged 5 to 16 could complete this same task - The government believes that it is a deadly threat to humanity. They say things like "He has expert knowledge in bio-terror" ... He showed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Bio-Terror Wiki entry. So a chase scene with about 0.01% of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles follows. They have about 1000 opportunities to pick it up and clear up the whole affair .. sometimes they are angry they barely miss it .. but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let it go intentionally to follow it. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I'd write more ... but I've already lost 1.5 hours watching this, I'd rather watch Broderick and Joshua play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.
