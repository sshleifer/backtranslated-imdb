I watched the Canadian videotape of the movie as "The Witching," which somehow made it to New York state. The audio was really bad, I had to raise it to about 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack was often overloading the dialogue. Orson Welles was a hater, worse than usual, and part of his dialogue and others ran through an echo chamber. A ghostly figure that keeps coming back has had its voice distorted. Some closed captions would have really helped! <br /> <br /> A group of witches or satanists (the final credits say that the group should not represent any real group!) There is a ritual in which they get naked and cause abortion by stabbing a doll. The woman who suffered the miscarriage and her husband moved to a town called Lilith, where she was offered a job in a toy factory. Although one of the AKAs in this movie apparently is "The Toy Factory," we never see it, and it is only occasionally referred to. <br /> <br /> On her way to Lilith, her husband becomes impatient with some of his questions about what his new boss, Mr. Cato, wanted to know about his religious persuasion. He drives aggressively and causes another car to get off the road and explode. After police arrive, she picks up a doll that fell from the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the film. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mr. Cato and all the people in town are witches, and that they are the ones who caused the abortion, although she does not realize it. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, of which she was not really aware. <br /> <br /> Some images of the film have some impact, but overall the film is not very engaging. The film looks like a mess, and this is undoubtedly largely due to its reissue and the addition of new images. The original version, according to the final credits, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. The magic of the DVD may allow us to see both versions on one disc, but relaunching this movie is probably not a priority.
