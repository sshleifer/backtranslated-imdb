SPLIT SECOND may have been a good movie. A story about a "road rage" homicide, has a very young Clive Owen giving a good performance; BUT ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers reduced their own film with stupid camera work and really horrible editing. The camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owen's stress on business, family, and traffic. What this really does is give the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> As the filmmakers did not mind making a good movie, but just to impress one another with their silly picture, one should not waste time on this farce. .
