Witchy Hildegard Knef imprisons a group of people in an isolated hotel and catches them one by one in a distorted and disgusting way. I thought I had seen everything until an unhappy man here is crucified and then his head is on fire. Hildy is also playful: she picks up an annoying harpy and slaps her mouth ... then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a bonfire! "Witchcraft" made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write it as the worst movie ever made by competent people ... until the end. I have to admit that I loved the ending. It involves a boy and his toy recorder cornered by Linda Blair who looks fantastically possessed. The scene lasts only about a minute and the movie is over, but you already know that old saying: "If you have a great ending, people will forgive you for anything!"
