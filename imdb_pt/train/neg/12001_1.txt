My sincere advice to all: do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even get close to the theater where this movie is being played !! even a glimpse of it is bad for health. Really. without jokes. It's 3:30 in the morning. and I came back from this most horrible movie in this universe. FOUR HOURS NOTHING !!! I am proud to have survived after all! If this is called survival. <br /> <br /> I'm very frustrated. boring disappointed. It was pure waste of time! money has been drained! without plot. I hope to wake up tomorrow and are without memories tonight !! RUBBISH FILM. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day for one and all :)
