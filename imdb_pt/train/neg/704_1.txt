A delightful romanticizing sexual exploitation of black New Orleans women by white men of power and privilege. Ooh Does it whet your appetite? Well, then, belly up to a VHS or DVD and swallow it gratuity by trolling through a sordid segment of history. For a good measure, it is adapted from the book by the famous hack Anne Rice. The direction is as boring and melodramatic as the tacky dialogue. Most of the acting is amateur. The only interesting note of the production is that it employed practically a dozen black actors, who were barely employed in the market today (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that were barely seen. (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). It is, after all, an excellent showcase for Nicole Lyn. The pompous and heavy James Earl Jones is also at hand. Thus, it is the late Ossie Davis, a minimal talent that owes its success to have been affiliated with the legendary Black Ensemble Company. This film should be classified as "T" for casings.
