First of all, the great actors nominated need the money ... The surgical scenes were laughable ... and surely they should know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this absolutely absurd ... Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant ... nor do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... I could not concentrate on the story because of all the surgery scenes stupid ... no blood, no staff and then the doc hero coming and going ... not a movie to think about adults ... Also the budget must have been limited ... the street scenes were good, but who was it the technical advisor ... Looks like it was directed by a total idiot ... Save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD and does not rent it.
