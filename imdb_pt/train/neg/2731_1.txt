Really bad and easily the worst episode I've ever seen ... ever. <br /> <br /> They tried to make up for it by giving the routine 'we know we're doing it'. That would have been funny had it not been for The Simpsons to have done it. And it still would not be worth it if the idea had come up in the first place. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks occurred as part of the fantasies of the usual character (mostly from JD). The flashbacks were not even real events that occurred, just compilations of, say, JD falling or, I do not know .... Elliott falling. If I wanted to watch a compilation of Scrubs, I would go on YouTube and not waste half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> Scrubs fell into the trap that most sit-coms have to disappoint. I, they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the scrubs did not have to be that kind of comedy. <br /> <br /> And as a passing thought, why the hell was Dr. Cox bald?
