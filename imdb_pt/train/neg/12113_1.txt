Townies is the laziest movie I've ever seen, and I've seen the Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). You seem confused at what you want to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not good enough to watch. There are scenes of a man doing "slapstick / bloody" karate so I guess, oh this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then jumps without warning to a drama about a missing girl, a retarded woman (mental disability) and a confident mother. Then it fits into the ONLY good part of the movie, which seems to be set up as a sitcom without the laughing banners. The part of which I am speaking is a solitary TOWNIE who is so lonely that he finds comfort in a rotting corpse. That was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling. The rest was a waist of my life. So, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is, there's a kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of Wayne's movie (the director) making fun of Toby (the star) in public. That made me sick. Even though Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other Wayne movies) are not the best, at least they're thought enough to keep you entertained until the final credits. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, had some great lines that I still use until today. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like movies, and if you like to watch your feet, just resting were them, you will not like TOWNIES! <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br />
