Life is really too short for movies like this. I knew it could not be good when I realized what I already suspected - that David Schwimmer would be playing exactly the same kind of person he plays in 'Friends'. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, whether the guy can not play anything but a nerd or he is never offered elsewhere. I have the feeling that it is a mixture of both. <br /> <br /> And I have to say that it's extremely hard to like a movie that totally misses the handsome talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol. Kane !!!
