For the most part, this movie looks like a "made for TV" effort. The direction is grip, the acting (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overdone and soapy. Denise Crosby, in particular, delivers her speeches as if she were cool reading them from a suggestion card. Only one thing makes this movie worth watching, and that's once Gage comes back from the "Seminar". There is something disturbing about seeing a small child murder someone, and this movie may be more than some can handle just for that reason. It's absolutely creepy. This movie only does one thing right, but it hits the right thing out of the park. Worth seeing only for the last 10 minutes or more.
