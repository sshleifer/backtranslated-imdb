Adrian has just left the asylum, being rich and without parents, his life seems empty. One day, he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother is a prostitute. Desperate to earn some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian research about his life and who his parents are. This is a film by a new director, and it is perfectly clear in most of the film: scenes not properly directed, dialogues a little forced, some inconsistencies in the script ... Anyway, the ending is unexpectedly well done (well, just a little ) and this saves the movie a little. Actors are known and with great quality, however, they are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; they all did better work on another film. The movie is boring and you'll probably spend most of your time thinking about how long it will be until it's over. Of course there are many worse movies, but of course there are many better ones.
