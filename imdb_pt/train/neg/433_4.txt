This film is predictable; is more predictable than a Vinnie Testaverdi pass when he throws the ball to the Jets. One of them saw the ending coming in the middle of the movie. Politics reminds me when I was back east. Many people know when the correction is inside. I gave this four because of the acting, but the story is stupid.
