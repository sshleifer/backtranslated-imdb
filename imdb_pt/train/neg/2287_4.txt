I only saw Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and I really do not remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy. <br /> <br /> She did not really think what she was doing was wrong even when she left the business and found her religion again. <br /> <br /> The photos she made were certainly harmless by today's standards, and it's funny to see men with sexy cameras and politicians pontificating the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night and Good Luck) played an important role here. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an excellent biopic of the most famous pinup girl of all time.
