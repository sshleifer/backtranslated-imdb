"I'm working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and I'm starting to get confused about who I really am, shit! I have a headache and things are going faltering, oh no, here comes another noisy montage of quick and subliminal cut of meaningful but puzzling images ... '<br /> <br /> I rented this movie because the few reviews were all favorable. Because? Cypher is an inexpensive, derivative and monotonous film, set in a world of unfulfilling future, with wooden clues and a laughable ending. <br /> <br /> A sinister feeling that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a movie. a series of increasingly foolish and unconvincing events before the filmmakers slap him in the face with an ending that combines Bond's worst with a Duran Duran video. <br /> <br /> It is painfully obvious that they took the production using The Dr Who improvised improvised special effects to include some good CGI sets (if it is a bit of Babylon 5). This sub-club Fight Club, the future byproduct in the thriller Philip K Dick, fights for a much wider scope than its modest budget will allow. A cold, blue climate served with a po-faced seriousness - disappointingly dumb. That's not clever Sci-Fi, this is the plot of a computer game.
