Given that this movie was created in less than a year, this may explain its lack (81 minutes - including final credits, approximately 76 minutes of actual movie). But what it can not explain is the lack of humor that the previous film possessed. <br /> <br /> Jokes are quick and sometimes not funny. The only funny and true parts are the quick fakes on the Nike basketball points, the depiction of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist's James Woods, and fragments scattered throughout the film. Very disgusting was the takeoff of Charlie's Angels, which as the first horror film and the Matrix spin scene, basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it. <br /> <br /> Today's youth may not be able to relate to the parodies of the classic supernatural horror movies of the 1970s, such as the Exorcist and perhaps the 1980s Poltergeist, etc. al. <br /> <br /> I hope the horror movie 3 takes some time to assemble, making the spoofs nicer. <br /> <br /> But one thing, the film has more than the last to promise the young actress Anna Faris (which I admit looked exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just because of his ability to launch and act, I give this movie a "3" of "10".
