MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... BUT MISTAKES CAN REALLY BE SPOILED !!. <br /> <br /> Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amateur. This movie tries to be the best to be different from most movies by the type of footage of 'Blair Witch' ... does not work .... it ends up appearing and feeling that someone had a cheap video camera, a van and I decided to do film. The story has no explanation, the protagonist receives no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a power suit compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to speak ... just the sounds of screams and snaps. The whole movie happens inside a van, which means that a decent scenario is out of the question. The five girls really do their best with what's been given to them, but they usually appear as very awful actresses ... although with the material given, it's hard to judge if they really can act ... they go through the entire movie. screaming, screaming and whining ... so much that in half the time it's hard to understand what was said and the cameras are so bad that it's really hard to say who said it. This video looks like a violent torture movie, but in fact it's just five girls in a screaming horror van ... which literally sums up the whole movie ... so we come to an end after what looks like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive ... with one minus one finger. The only thumbs up (get it ... finger ... LOL) is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voice (and their pride) after making this movie terrible. Do not judge this by the poster ... you will be very disappointed.
