I got this movie in a small screening held by members of my college gaming club. We were warned that this would be the "madness reefer" of the game, and this movie more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man re-starting his college career after "resting" for a while. half. What we, the viewer, discovered as the movie progresses, is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to an RPG game called "Labyrinths and Monsters," a game with which he becomes familiar after a group of games recruits him into a campaign . . <br /> <br /> This movie is laughable on many, many levels. One scene features the group "candlelight games", which is probably the best way to describe it. While I'm sure this should be cult in some way, as most players know, it's terribly inaccurate. Most role-playing sessions are done in well-lit rooms, usually with a few cookies and a can of soda. <br /> <br /> The acting, although not of the Oscar, is not horrible. This is one of Tom Hanks' first roles, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two on the horizon. The support cast, while not very memorable, still features decent performances. <br /> <br /> Especially the badness lies in the fact that it was a movie made for the TV that shows the "dangers of the game". see if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
