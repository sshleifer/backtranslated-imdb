The world may be over. Unfortunately this movie has survived as further proof of Canada's inability to make films that go beyond the deprecating. Maybe it's because all of our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and others) are going to Hollywood.) Actually, it's too bad. Short has not been released in this apalantively pretentious and banal film. He could have given some credibility. The Canadian government should realize --- and this movie is a magnificent example --- that pushing money into the trough does not result in a good movie. If people who absorbed these public funds had to compete, they might have been forced to come up with something worth doing. How did they produce yet another laughing embarrassment.
