"That 'Malcom' show at FOX is really killing ... can not we make our own version?" I speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts we all know it's true, and that the one thing NBC added to the metric "Malcolm" was sex. And boy did they add sex ... Tucker, thirteen, gets horny and covers up with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally enters his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of seeing her and knocking him out. He spies the pretty girl in the house next to his bedroom window, and she knows he wants to see her topless, but she causes him to smile and close the window. And that's all in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Accept this from an adult man - a boy's puberty is so sex-driven and testically driven that it's impossible to make it funny to a conventional audience. The only times someone came close were in movies, and you can count them on one side. So it's no surprise that "Tucker" has the warmth and appeal of a strip club bathroom. Did the network really think we'd like to see kids dealing with puberty? Is not that what people go to jail for? If you doubt the depravity of the show, consider the following: 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled the show after only 4 episodes aired; they then made the unprecedented move to "burn" the remaining episodes, exhibiting them TO MIDNIGHT so that no child could see them. Ironic since the children were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> In addition to its general shallowness, Tucker presents an active voice from the main character to detail the poor writing. Even in 2000, it was terribly dated, with incidental ska music and super sarcasm. I could not like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes did not come exactly a mile a minute ... What a shame on NBC because of this dirty theft ... they are better than that. GRADE: C-
