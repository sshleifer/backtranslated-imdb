When I first saw this movie in the movies 11 years ago, I loved it. I still think the direction and cinematography are great, just like the music. But it's really the script that over time started to bother me over and over. I find the writing of Emma Thompson egocentric and unfaithful to the original book; she reduced Marianne to a secondary character, a second violin to Elinor, which is too old and too severe - she gets into the film a lot of "focus moments," and often they seem to be there just to show Thompson. <br /> <br /> I understand you cutting off several characters from the book, but leaving out the only scene where Willoughby in the book is rescued? For someone who embodied and loved the book long before the movie, these are things that are always hard to digest. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She does not have the best script in the world to work with, but she still pulls her gracefully, without much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a little old, but he plays the role beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she's absolutely fantastic as ever.
