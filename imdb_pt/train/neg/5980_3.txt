There are a group of Fox TV executives sitting around a meeting table asking what new program to order. <br /> <br /> "How about pointing to something like 24 or The West Wing?" says one, but everyone agrees that it would be very expensive, and cheap TV is less likely to harm the station if it fails. <br /> <br /> "Well, how about pulling together some great comedy writers and doing a quality sitcom?" offers another and is fired on the spot. "You do not know that good writers cost a lot of money!" the great chief beats. "That's why we invented the reality show." <br /> <br /> "We could do one more criminal drama ..." suggests a man in a dull suit. "I'm listening ..." replies the boss, suddenly interested. 'People like CSI, so let's make another copy of it,' adds Blandman. <br /> <br /> 'But there are already many CSI clones out there, what can we do to highlight ours?' a naive junior asks and is fired instantly. 'Stand out! If we do that, people can be confused! Let's give more than they already like! the big boss shouts. <br /> <br /> "Let's just add more violence and make it really horrendous, after all we are Fox," suggests another suit to the warm response of "now you understand", the great boss. "We could make them the Deviant Crimes Unit," he adds, clearly on a roll. <br /> <br /> 'For Jove, he did it!' the big boss laughs, 'and the victims may be pretty, vulnerable women who use very little on the screen.' "Well, that would certainly distract people from average acting and bad scripts," notes Blandman. <br /> <br /> "Then it's settled, we just need a name," announces the big boss. "Could we call Sexual Violence Violence?" "Too literal, how about Killer Instinct? It conveys violence, but it seems a bit like Wild Instinct that has had a lot of sex." <br /> <br /> 'Puuurfect', the big boss responds and then they all pat on the back and will cancel Arrested Development.
