The problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst camera possible and the film is blurry and grainy. Maybe it's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera could not stay still because they were having a seizure or something. There is also much poop and vomit in this movie. There's someone throwing up every twenty minutes and that makes me think it was done by some bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there are annoying cries that go and continue and do not stop until the credits roll. I also did not like it when all her friends were being shot (or not, I do not know) and she gets into the van and puts on band-aids. That was really pretty stupid even to have this in a movie. How much gas can a person drain to get a van? It must be a lot because they do not run out of gas for the rest of the movie. It was a terrible movie and I suggest you never see it in your entire life.
