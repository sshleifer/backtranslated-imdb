I've tried to like this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and then on DVD. However, I could not get into this story because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) seemed to be in love with themselves, on the one hand. I admit there was some clever dialogue at the shows, which was a key part of the TV show's success, and I really enjoyed that dialogue. <br /> <br /> Basically, this was almost like the old humorous movies of the 30s and 40s, with men and women. You get lots of arguments, accusations, screams and screams. A lot of people apparently love this kind of fights, but I hate it, so I never got into the Moonlighting movement. Only Allyce Beasley as the unfortunate advisor "Agnes" was fun. It's a shame she had little time on the air. Shepherd was cool with his eyes and I suppose the women would say the same to Willis, but much discussion between the two finally made me give up.
