Effect (s) without cause is generally not possible in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood remakes, not only is it possible, it is necessary. Haunting received computer treatment courtesy of a first-class director of photography who proved to be promising (Jan de Bont-Speed), but produced a series of big-budget trash (Twister, Speed ​​2). <BR> The actor is superfluous in such a film and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act as they wish they were anywhere except in this movie. Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the process, but whatever is something is unknown, since the script seems like half of it is missing. Events happen, good and bad ghosts appear without rhyme or reason and then the story ends with a more unsatisfactory non-event which means ending the previous 90 minutes of inanity. <br /> <br /> Even reason to see this for effects, since we all know that anything can be put on the screen now. Why not observe the effects at the service of a good story instead of just for themselves?
