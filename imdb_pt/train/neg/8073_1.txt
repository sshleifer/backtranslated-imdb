If the writer / director is reading this (and I imagine you are now why you should be out of work) then I must tell you - I have seen some bad movies in my time but this one has the distinction of having the worst premise that I've heard. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. I laughed out loud at the end. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE - (If the whole movie was in a coma, then the scene where she sleeps with that guy means someone raped her while she was knocked out?) <br /> <br /> Disparate .
