There seem to have been any number of films like this one released during the 1970s. And the fact that you can not remember the one-sided title is a measure of its impact. This is what novelists would call "boilers". They are little more than a vehicle to keep movie stars in the public eye. <br /> <br /> We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; more than enough names to get bums on movie seats. Every taste in hero is served. Although it is suspected that most of the public still went away disappointed. <br /> <br /> Your talents are simply thrown away, and I wonder if stars with so much money and such reputation can be so desperate or devoid of common sense. . This type of film hardly adds color to a resume. Sometimes, maybe the actors should choose the director, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that it would suck even from the start. That ridiculously disjointed jaunty-jazz theme song, which also infiltrated every time some incidental noise is needed, had all the atmospheric conviction of the Muzak elevator. Who fancied using a jazz band when a scene featured the humid jungles of central Africa, or the endless Sahara with camels and palm trees as the backdrop? Definitely a serious ball. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do; and their results would have leaked enough atmosphere and tension to increase my rating by two positive points. This director should have taken the trouble to watch 'Lawrence of Arabia', or even Sergio Leone's Faroes; he could have learned some things. But then again, probably he would not. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock touched on the subject of the disappeared woman with good results in his film 'Frantic'. Later, it was redone with equal panache facing Harrison Ford. In each case, the confusion surrounding their loss and the strain of persecution were tangible. Here, when Michael Caine could be forced to employ a little brains and braggadocio, Rex Harrison continued to appear nowhere, like some old geniuses, to put him back on the rails every time the narrative stumbled. <br /> <br /> At least the photograph was quite good, with excellent use of the often beautiful environment. But then, stupid music needs to channel and blow into the atoms the little environment it has created. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were also artificial and flamboyant, with sequences of fighting so ineptly choreographed that they could have been staged at first. year-class theater. And of course, players should strive for a jazz accompaniment - just like you do. <br /> <br /> And that's about the comment that this item deserves. Except to say that the script was also very bad. <br /> <br /> Stick to your hobby in this movie. Even if it contains your favorite movie stars, you will also be disappointed.
