I was excited to discover this comedy of the late 60's looking at some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and of course Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was therefore compounded to find that the film does not work as a comedy or a perfect assault film. Ustinov plays a short time outlaw out of jail who sets his sites on a major American corporation based in London. Bluffing with the grumpy CEO Karl Malden and the tech nerd Newhart, Ustinov presents himself as a computer expert and immediately plans the movie part as "perfect assault." To do this, it needs to go through a tamper-proof security system that protects the corporate mainframe. And here's a problem. Your perfect plan only works because everyone else in the movie is incredibly confident and stupid. Your tattered excuses are taken for the apparent value and this should be the only computing hub anywhere that does not bother with video cameras. The second problem is the robbery (the fraud really) happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie, stealing the rest of the image dramatically. Maggie Smith is sadly miscast as a neighbor / secretary serving near Ustinov who just can not keep a job. I love Maggie Smith, but she seems a lot here, very composed, the part called for more a crazy and physical comedian. Also, Ustinov and Smith do not have chemistry together, maybe it's the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, as devoid of real romance as it is, still comes off a bit scary. Ustinov co-wrote the screenplay, and was well thought out at the time, but I found it bland, winding and sad waste of a great cast.
