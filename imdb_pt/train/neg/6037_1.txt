Moron and his girlfriend perform some ritual to resurrect the dead in an attempt to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, they resurrect a dead soul that begins to cut them with an ax, and the next day some college elders are telling the story around a campfire. The guy with the ax appears and starts attacking the idiots telling the story. The group calls the police, the policeman sees blood scattered all over the body and thinks he is a mountain lion (!?) And soon after is killed by some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> A small splatter movie that was filmed in broad daylight, but where several characters carry flashlights and talk as if they were in the middle of the night, and they wanted to send a beacon to attract attention. A guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other but he does not bother loading it, so after he finally carries it, he has several opportunities to shoot the killer, but he does not mind, because that would put an end to the movie. too early. Then he throws the gun away! Also harmful are the characters who show no emotion and do not seem at all worried after their friends are cut to pieces and lousy effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car exploded in the end was clearly a car model ) and terrible dialogue and some really ugly female nudity does not help. And in the end, try to get away with incoherence, saying that it was all the invention of the same school-aged people telling stories of bonfire at the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> So the killer really appears in the last scene and cuts them to pieces. Once again. <br /> <br /> Mediocre, it's fine, just for some unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
