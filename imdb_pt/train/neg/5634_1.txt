The poster that called this "Plotless and Pointless" literally picked up the words I would use in my subject line. The only thing I would add is "without passion". For a movie made by a real couple and with lots of sexually explicit scenes, this movie manages to turn what should be a stuffy situation into something other than cold ice. Dafoe and Colagrande seem bored during the sex scenes, and the viewer may well get a Valium and end it. Also, please the women in the audience have already seen many tampons used in their time, and any guy who is excited to see Willem Dafoe take a bloody tampon from his wife's vagina really needs to do therapy. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the movie (if there is one) is the restaurant scene, where a waiter explains to Dafoe, with sleepy eyes perpetually, which is a "deconstructed jambalaya." (All ingredients in the dish still separate rather than boiled together.) This movie is a "deconstructed thriller." All the elements are there: scary house, isolated, dead spouse, scary violins on the scoreboard, weird janitor who comes and goes as he pleases, auto accident deaths and almost deaths, characters with a secret past. Basically every suspense clich√© you can think of, but NOTHING comes along. Everything stays there and never fits into a coherent plot or even an artistic piece of humor. In the restaurant, Dafoe passes the "deconstructed jambalaya". Possible renters of this mess would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the shelf of the video store.
