The nice thing about this highly mocking movie is to play "guess" at that location. What reference point in Toronto will be the American / international location? <br /> <br /> Who knew the Antichrist would be Russian? obviously he can not be American, since we need the pulls to save the day - oh Buck ... you're going to tell us the whole truth ... you're going to show us the light ... and the way out of the building owes those Nasty anti-christers get what they want. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope they do not do another of that kind! We have no prayer.
