I do not know what else to say about this horrible movie that has not yet been said. Honestly, I just have to be angry. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie that would suck horrible, but I loved the War Games, so I allowed myself the whim. I will live to regret this decision for the rest of my life. From the outset, when government personnel explained that their supercomputer could determine who a terrorist was by how well they played video games, I knew I was about to go for a walk even though the land I was writing well forgot. The list of very, very, very bad scenarios, dialogues and performances is so long that I would break the IMDb if I tried to publish it. For those people who said they saw the worst movies of this, please tell me. In fact, I'm curious to see anything that can overcome this steaming pile of horse dung.
