Another FINE effort by America's darkest filmmaker. His knowledge on the subject of racism is STAGGERING and IMPRIME on more than one level. Accusations that Lee is actually just a petty racist, a venomous dwarf who opportunistically exploits Hollywood's Affirmative Action system to make inferior films is absurd, mere propaganda from the right. The very notion that Lee would resort to the misuse of the current climate of political correctness in America to produce hate-filled anti-white films is simply FALSE and malicious. <br /> <br /> Some of Lee's detractors come so far. such as suggesting that the GOTB glorifies African Americans while overthrowing other races: obviously another FALSEHOOD spread by people that AGAINST the peaceful coexistence between different races in America and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in the movie is a long dialogue between the rich black republican and the others on the bus. The views put forward by this man are simply WRONG - across the board. 100% without rights. He LACKS education, unlike the brilliantly INFORMED guys who very deservedly throw him off the bus. <br /> <br /> TERRIFIC performances, and a SMART screenplay make for a viewing experience that has been RARELY rivaled by any political films ever since. <br /> <br /> I also want to stress the incessant Lie that the Millionaires March had only 80,000 people participating in it! <br /> <br /> (And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all words written in capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> So, what message does Lee send here? If someone does not agree with their political opinions, simply apply the violence and throw it off the bus. I thought the movie said "take the bus" ...? <br /> <br /> Apparently, Mr. Lee is for bus segregation after all, that is, no different than the KKK lunatics before him: the bus is only for blacks who are in line with the line of thinking of the Democratic Party. So much for "liberating the slaves" ... The final credits: "This film was entirely financed by black people." And distributed and marketed by a large Hollywood studio run by Jews and whites that Farrakhan despises ...
