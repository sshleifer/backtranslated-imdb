This was just a terrible movie. It hurt me to watch this. Almost every action was demotivated within the context of the film, acting was really poor (P.Diddy was the best actor who actually says something about the movie) and the plot was usually predictable. Some links to Carlito's Way were fine, for example, his dream of one day moving to the Carribien, but overall they were weak. The love interest in my opinion was wrong, but that is debatable. Anyway I really was not expecting much before watching the movie and I think you could say that even those expectations were not met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he really is a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky, because I'm sure there will not be many people watching this movie. I usually give the films a decent rating, if they arouse my interest, then I'll give it two stars. Better luck next time. And yes, I liked Carlito's Way.
