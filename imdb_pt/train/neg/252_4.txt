The uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a beautiful but bland adaptation in which dialogue seems to be recited rather than sincere, and appearances tied up in money by ghosts fail to garner any sense of fear or magic; Edward Woodward, as the ghost of the Christmas gift, swaying around stilts and seems to be making an impression of Bernard Cribbins. Like Scrooge, George C. Scott is very ironic, and he never really seems to believe in it, which steals his performance. The scenes in which he showed his past have as much impact as if he were leafing through his family album. No one else seems to be struggling, except Frank Finlay, who chronically makes an overactive one.
