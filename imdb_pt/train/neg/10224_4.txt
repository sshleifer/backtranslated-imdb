Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, the one-line summary says it all. Melville's "Le samurai" is the original and there are elements of "Leon". And they are better - much better! In the "Samurai" Alain Delon is a professional solitary / killer warrior who keeps a bird in a cage and is stealing cars for his work (with so much suspense in these scenes!). To the end it is exactly the same: the samurai seeks death with dignity and is being shot with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed, he realizes and there is no place for the samurai. <br /> <br /> Delon is not killing as many people as the ghost dog. But I think Jarmusch really liked "Leon" or even "Desperado" by Rodriguez. So he added that too. And let me guess: Will the girl become a professional like the Ghost Dog (as Natalie Portman in "Leon")? <br /> <br /> So, what was Jarmoch thinking at all? Where is the original, the original thought in this movie? <br /> <br /> I can not see the point in making carbon copies (celluloid). <br /> <br /> A rating of 4/10 by Macaulay Connor
