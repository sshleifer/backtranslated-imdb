I have a great collection of movies, and this was added to it. Number 274 to be exact. <br /> <br /> The title made me go first. Splatter University. I thought this would be a great horror movie. I was wrong? Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been so much better. I love all the movies but this was one that was more of a laugh then a fright. <br /> <br /> Poor audio quality, bad acting and poor arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br /> The film is ideal for a good laugh. If you are looking for one of these movies to make fun, then this is one!
