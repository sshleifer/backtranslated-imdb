The time spent watching this movie was lost. I do not dislike science fiction. I do not reject any genre in itself, since good work can be done in any genre. This movie, however, is not good work. I can not criticize the look (when it does not involve alien makeup), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not of the BAD type, for a trekkish comic. But the visuals of fx were, of course, where all the interest / attention / money of the creators went. The direction alternated between slow and confused (it was not known exactly who was doing what and with what and for whom, at least in a crucial moment). The "acting" was actually pretty bad indeed. There was no basis for most of the line readings, plus a hint of "It was like that on the page and the director told me that I should be crazy / sad / scared / whatever. Since when is this an excuse for correction problems in areas that should be considered essential for a dramatic environment, am I amazed that the pilot sold the series, or is the money in the hands of the technicians as well?
