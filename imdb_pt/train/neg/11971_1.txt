Although a movie with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, you'd better skip this one. I watched this on television so I did not have to spend money for it. My luck. <br /> <br /> The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes are pretty believable, it gets more and more unbelievable in the end. It is highly questionable whether an experienced soldier like Lieutenant Waters would disobey direct orders. And even if he did, if the rest of his platoon did. They know he puts them in direct danger, and they know they'll surely die if they follow him, but damn it, he's our lieutenant. So let's do what he says (despite the direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> Still, there are some cool scenes in this movie. In a way, they save a village, where the total population is being massacred by the rebels. Well, they save a dozen villagers or more, the rest have already been killed. The strange part of it is that they took the trucks that the rebels left behind. They prefer to walk. Maybe because the roads are not safe, but there was no explanation for that. Anyway. I think that's what made the film the only point I gave him. <br /> <br /> What made this movie an insult to the brain and therefore completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so many rebels without being injured or killed. Just near the end they lose some comrades. And that's only because they have to fight from an army of almost 500 or so. Can you believe that? <br /> <br /> They fight against an army of many, they kill hundreds of them and only release some of them. And they have rounds and round of ammo. Never run out of it. Grenades and claymore mines, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get these things? Loading around or what? They even have a laptop that shows the activity of the enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that lasts for days. Same? Who thinks about this crap? <br /> <br /> I think if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you'll give this movie a high note. If not, skip this one. This saves your time.
