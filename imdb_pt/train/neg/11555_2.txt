A great horror movie - shame they were the producers and not part of the script. Basic Plot Summary - A man with a redhead fetish will invite these women to his apartment just to indulge in some kind of weird coma and proceed with varying degrees of success. Only the behind-the-scenes crew must have thought the film was as publicist as me and cut the film out of the film. Nothing flows, you get lost with the redhead with whom he is at the time (was not he gone before?), And most of the time it seems that the cameraman fainted and resumed filming when he woke up. Not that I can blame him, I fainted 2 to 3 times and had to go back and resume to try to recover the little tangle that exists. Warning when you see the end DO NOT try to connect it with anything that happens before - you will just get an aneurysm. It's not worth the time, effort or God does not allow money. Only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the small chance that the hacking occurred between the movie release and the horrible version I watched.
