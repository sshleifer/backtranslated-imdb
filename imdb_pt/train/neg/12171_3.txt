Being a horror movie aficionado, I'll usually settle down to watch all the movies that go through my retinas, which sometimes do more harm than good to my brain, I'll say. As the channel surfed the other night, Sleepaway Camp II came to me. Of course, I wanted to take a look, since I had heard of the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but I never saw any of them (ashamed, I know). I will note that as I have not seen the original, my criticism probably should not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong with this is entirely intentional by the very design of the franchise. <br /> <br /> Now I'm guessing that the Sleepaway Camp franchise itself is a joke about itself. Hell, even the name appears as an intentional joke. Sleeping outside the camp? It's so much fun. I can enjoy the movie by wanting to just put something together for pure horror worth from the camp, but that's as far as I can go. The acting in this film made the cast of the original Friday look like the viewers making a version of Macbeth. Campy demands bad acting, but come on. Pamela Springsteen as the malicious killer with reality did a better job at killing my interest than killing the entire cast. As far as comedy was concerned, there were times when I laughed, but it was little and very much in the middle. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, SAC II is very annoying, and I really wanted to sleep outside the camp. The deaths are so obviously staged and false that you can barely enjoy them. If you are looking for a horror movie comedy with good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel's navigation takes you to it, check it out and see what else is going on.
