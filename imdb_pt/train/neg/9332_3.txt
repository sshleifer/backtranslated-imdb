It's not a terrible movie, really, and Glenn and Keitel are top notch actors. Also, they do an acceptable job with very weak script. The setting is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. Also, I understand why these actors and the team made the film, they are professional and get paid for it. But I wonder why the studios spend the time and money to make a movie and then do not pitch it to the theater audience? Even if a movie is a box office failure, it will certainly make some money. If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn, rent the video or watch it on TV, just like me. Granted, the film will not help solve the immigration dilemma with Mexico, but the experience is much better than 90% of today's TV Rate standard.
