With an interval of three hours and twenty minutes interminable, "Salaam-e-Ishq" is a beautiful and superficial comic novel of India that amuses us with six intertwined stories of romantic love (that are at least four histories in my opinion) Shot like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial, the film is a hodgepodge of exotic environments, dazzling colors, sexy dancers, music and dance with strides. numbers, dream sequences and fantasies, flashing character comments, blunt dialogues, and exaggerated comic performances - all very normal with Bollywood happenings today. It's an exhausting task to just try to keep all the characters straight as they dance, steep and wind their way through the incomprehensible plot. <br /> <br /> There is so much for the viewer to feast your eyes on here - not least of all. all the beautiful women dead - but he will need the patience of Job to help him.
