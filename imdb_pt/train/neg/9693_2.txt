The overheated plot of "Bonjour tristesse" is taken from Fran√ßoise Sagan's first juvenile novel, which became a bestseller, although God knows why. For teenagers who want to get rid of a potential stepfather, they may have a certain appeal. Do not get carried away by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy's father and Deborah Kerr the stepmother-in-prospect. Unfortunately, a lot rests on Jean Seberg's fragile shoulders. She is beautiful and easily fills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can attack poses, but she can not act. Anyone who has seen her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's first film, St. Joan-Seberg, knows she was unable, at age 19, to carry a movie. This film, also by Preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first. It was his second film; she was 20 years old. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of capacity? Is not it a chance? Seberg's character is at the center of the story and, as compelling as she is, though she may be physically at age 17, she can not meet the emotional demands of the role. I do not know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures. But whoever thinks this movie is better than mediocre needs a taste check. Despite Niven and Kerr, this remains a juvenile story performed in a youthful way by a beautiful young woman who needed a lot of acting classes.
