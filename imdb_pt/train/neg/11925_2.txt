This is a very strange movie ... I was not really sure what it was, some N London rebels find a dumb kid in the woods who everyone believes to be some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all their way, change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster. The movie ended after about 90 minutes, leaving me quite dissatisfied, almost annoyed at the lack of sense of it all. I did not care about any of the characters - none of them had the chance to show themselves to the viewer. <br /> <br /> What was the message? Am I being weak? It was very strange. What happens to the Runner? Why does Emilio shoot the boy? ... that made absolutely no sense, meaningless. Can anyone help me understand this mess of a movie?
