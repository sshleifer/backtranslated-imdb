1 is being very generous here. I really like BOOGEYMAN, although it's not really the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the cover of the DVD and we all know it! That scared me. But this movie is something else. Being directed by a longtime guy who directed a lot of movies, it looks like it was filmed on a VHS camcorder by a 10 year old! The story and acting are atrocious! David Hess, you let me down too. After playing one of the most menacing villains in movie history, have you resorted to it? The story and acting may have been forgiven, however, if someone had taken the time to make the video more professional. There are a lot of footage in video films out there that do not look, or at least they are not so obvious that they diminish your movie attention. I can not say it's the worst movie ever, because I could not get through the whole movie, but it sure is close.
