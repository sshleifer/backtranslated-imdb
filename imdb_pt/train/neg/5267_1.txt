The plot progression is enough to "fit in" and create curiosity about the outcome. However, ultimately, the feeling that remains is that the film's producers have forgotten to end it. If the intention was to create a perpetual circle (occasionally made in the Twilight Zone), it was too sloppy to be seen as a positive effort.
