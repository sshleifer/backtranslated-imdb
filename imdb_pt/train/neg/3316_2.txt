This was the first Ewan McGregor movie I've ever seen outside of Star Wars. Since then, I've become a big fan of Ewan McGregor, but I still can not forgive the existence of this film. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a big fan of Jane Austen and, because of this, I have been subjected to several of the classics, Emma being one of them. I've always found them annoying, stupid and boring. However, after attending this awful performance, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was charming and charming. Ewan McGregor hardly serves a purpose in this movie after they hacked and mutilated Frank Churchill's part. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is normal and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone who is remotely interested in period drama in English ... go see the originals. If you're an Ewan McGregor fan ... believe me, by skipping this movie, you've lost nothing more than five minutes of collectivity with a silly hat and a bad haircut.
