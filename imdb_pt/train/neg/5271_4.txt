A brigona americana family, on vacation in the west, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Little do they know that this ghost town was once a nuclear bomb test site, and a deadly presence is chasing them. I usually love mystery horror movies like this. "Cube", "Duel" by Spielberg and "The Birds" are great examples of movies that do not give answers, but that leave us intrigued and want more. Apparently, the director / screenwriter of "Disappearance", Walter Klenhard, was trying to make exactly this type of film, and the success or not of it depends on the spectator. I personally think he's about halfway there, so the movie just sank. <br /> <br /> The actors are all kind of silly. They are not especially bad, but we as a public never feel their fear and they react to situations in unreal ways. Has anyone absolutely SICK of characters just coming out to investigate strange sounds?!?!? At least give them some kind of justification to do it!?!?! <br /> <br /> With regard to films made for TV, it is a fair above average for sure. Director Klenhard should be commended for actually ordering the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the scenarios were impressive. There is a very cool scene in which two characters encounter an old nuclear test field where the sand was completely melted down to the power glass as far as the eye could see. I wonder if this was real? <br /> <br /> There is no blood to speak, and the 'creatures', or what the heck is after these people, are never shown, not to mention that we are never given a true clue about what they are (Mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient Indian spirits of evil? Oh, that really slows it down for us!) Or where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There are lots of clich√©s here too. Why are the people of the city in these types of movies always very, very dumb? Why is there always an old guy that everyone thinks is crazy and right? Because? Because? Because? How about a new scenario, folks! "Disappearance" tries to be different and clever, but ends up failing because in many ways it is very familiar to us fans of direct-to-video horror movies. Hey, I've seen much worse movies, and disappearance is not bad, is it just too much? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
