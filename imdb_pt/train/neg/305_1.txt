I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr.Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a painful home movie. <br /> <br /> I really like your other movies ... but if you're a fan like me ... stay away from this movie. This can change your thoughts about Adam. You can never recover from the horror that is this movie ... I had a better time watching old people play scrabble in a house .......
