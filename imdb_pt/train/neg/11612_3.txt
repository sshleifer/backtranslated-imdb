Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time it is a movie that is touched by laughter. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty on the seabed, her feet as you might expect, wrapped in cement. Rome immediately in the case after being hired by mountain man Waldo Gronsky. Rome is immediately at risk as he has to investigate some types of mafia who have seen the game against him and he is the main suspect, he must now run away and hope to solve the case alone. The burly Sinatra struggles to sell us the idiot jokes and makes us believe he is a good detective, oh, and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, but he fails miserably in this fucking-fisted-vanity design . The frankly ridiculous ending that surrounds every woman is quite surprising, every woman in the movie is a cool head, who likes to bow before the camera, director Douglas, of course, forces them to zoom in on the cracks in their butts every time they flex your posterior muscles. There is even a ridiculously exaggerated gay character who lives in the belief, this was a movie made by "real men" to "real men" to reaffirm their own sexuality, it is a shameful shame.
