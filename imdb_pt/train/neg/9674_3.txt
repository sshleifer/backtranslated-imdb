This movie reminds me of some really bad science fiction films from the 50s and 60s. It's not scary or interesting, but it's boring, flamboyant and stupid. Special effects are laughable, all actors are ridiculous and the ending is just awful. waste your money, rent or buy something better. I give 3.5 out of 10 (I found this turkey quite fun because of its stupidity).
