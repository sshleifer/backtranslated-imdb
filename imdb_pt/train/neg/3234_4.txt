Well, how do you rate a movie like that? Does it really have cinematographic value really? It's a movie that tries to get as close as possible to being a snuff film. Basically, the whole movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a girl. It is not very attractive and moreover it is also not really realistic. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the film tried to be as realistic and as shocking as possible. However, the movie is just too fake to work as intended. Slapping and stumping are all soft and fake, in addition to ringing. They are usually just kicking the floor, rather than entering the girl, obviously. Also the way the girl responds to all the torments is very meek. I mean, if this were real, she would have screamed. There are more groans than screaming in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously low budget and it is a worthwhile attempt to achieve something shocking and realistic, as well as original and provocative, with very limited resources. Do not think that this movie made a lot of impact, although it was released at the time, despite having done something good, since a total of six sequences were released after that. <br /> <br /> Shock fans and Gore will probably be disappointed with this movie, although there are still some fetish people out there who will have fun with this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
