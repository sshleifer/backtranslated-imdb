Something somewhere must have gone very wrong by the time the director was noticing this plot. The film, which should be the remake of one of the most beloved movies in the cinema, fails to show all aspects of cinema. The best of the artists also could not pick up the tuning, which simply shows that the film itself was a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> The issue is bad. Direction sucks. Acting is out of this world (omg)! Characters that should have seemed scary force people to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and fantasies. <br /> <br /> I did not watch the movie even if someone paid me the ticket price or even gave me a free hamburger with it.
