I did not think it was possible, but I found the movie worse than 'Body Melt'. This movie is really bad! And the worst of it is that it's another Australian movie ... Filmed with what looks like VHS, and with an 80's rock soundtrack, everything gets worse and worse, which is difficult. believe seeing how bad the start is (skinned male hanging upside down in a spray jar of white tomato sauce, anyone?). <br /> <br /> And why do their accents keep changing? From the bad accent of New York to English, after the pure Aussie! And that happens to the whole cast! <br /> <br /> This movie also claims to have won some film festival on the cover (I believe it was the Utah Film Festival). This has to be a lie because no one in their right mind would name it for anything (maybe the Golden Rasberries, but I think it's too bad for that too). <br /> <br /> Come on, folks! This movie has to be number 1 in the bottom 100 !!! It has to be ten times as bad as the movies that are already there. <br /> <br /> Well done to the "filmmakers" of this garbage, for proving that there is a reason not to see movies ... 0/10
