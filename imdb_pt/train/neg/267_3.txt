The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers follows a slightly slow pace, following Johnny Rico leaving his parents, the girl (not very attractive) he wants, and joining the mobile infantry. The aliens in the series are nothing like the barbaric insects in the movie, instead they are squid-like monsters that fire lasers out of their mouths. <br /> <br /> Watching this version, I was continually amazed at how fruity they managed to do the whole thing. The show is mainly concerned with the relationships between the recruits, and the sore and prolonged looks they give each other through their battle visions, with 80's synth pop coming up sometimes during the meager sequences of battles that finally appear in the few finals. episodes. In terms of construction, he has a debt to Top Gun, sharing a lot in terms of rhythm and content (and all that implies).
