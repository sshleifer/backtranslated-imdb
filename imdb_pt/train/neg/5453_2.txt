Okay, I got this movie in half, but osh.d..god.it.sounds.like.the.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially that guy who is now in the Teachers and the Book Group, although at least he has proven that he can act if he wants! (the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad movies, both in terms of acting, routing and general plausibility). He clearly seems to be a trump in Human Trafficking, but while this is not the best movie ever, it's at least original and had actors whose delivery does not resemble those of sincere and desperate GCSE students trying to get a passing grade. Not as much as Human Traffic as a car accident!
