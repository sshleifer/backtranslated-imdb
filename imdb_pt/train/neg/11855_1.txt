This is one of those movies that show up at 2 PM to entertain bored housewives as they pass by. The performance is of second order. Poor Mathew Modine seems to dream about the whole movie. And God help Gina Gershon. His accent is very exaggerated. Does not sound like a real English woman. It seems forced and false, much like her acting. She should stick to what makes her the best, lesbian showgirl artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are no better. They are two-dimensional. Empty, tasteless and silly. How should we care about these people? At one point, Christy Scott Cashman is lost in Central Park. Same? It's not that difficult to navigate Central Park. Just follow any way out. Not only did I not care about any of the characters, but I also hated them. The only reason I got stuck with this movie train accident was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant mood could not save this dying fish. Each scene is typical romantic comedy and nothing is left to amaze us. The script was horrible as was the acting. If you catch this fish throw it back!
