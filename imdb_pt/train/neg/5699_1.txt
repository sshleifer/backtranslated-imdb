WOW, this movie was so horrible. I'm so glad I did not have to pay to see this horrible movie. it was like a story nut was in a craving for cocaine! the previews of what made it look decent, but it was really bad. I'll say the idea sounded decent, but come on. was really too bad. If you sat down and thought about it, you would also realize that it was unrealistic. come back the day you think they had all these things to work on. It was not like Ben Franklin sat down one day and made a fucking riddle. was completely ridiculous, and you want to see a bad movie so by all means will see this. All and ALL the HORRIBLE movie may actually be in my top 10 WORST movies I've ever seen.
