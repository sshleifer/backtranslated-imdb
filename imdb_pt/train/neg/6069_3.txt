It never ceases to amaze me how you can have an excellent actor, and put you to lose in a movie like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he could not save this movie. In fact, his character is very much like what he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can not stand it when the actors do the same thing in more than one movie. I believe it gets old, and that's the case here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising about this movie, but the story has already been told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is his typical baseball player, and his presumption is evident in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this film is less than amusing. <br /> <br /> However, because De Niro is in this movie, that makes a draw if you are a fan (no pun intended who sees everything he does, no matter how bad. But to see De Niro in his better, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas", or "Cop Land", or even come back and check out "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II." Do not waste your time with this drivel.
