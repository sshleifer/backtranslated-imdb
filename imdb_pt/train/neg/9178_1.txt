The thing about calling "House of the Dead" the worst movie of all time is that it actually is not. There are worse movies out there. I watch a lot of Hong Kong ninja films that are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama, with ninja images inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called a "movie." <br /> <br /> House of The Dead is, however, one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters. Walking halfway, I really felt like I was a little dumber for having spent 45 minutes of that piece of junk.
