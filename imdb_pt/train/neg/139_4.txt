This movie was rented by a friend. Your choice is usually good. I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie. Although it was a horror movie. Which I do not prefer. But no horror came to mind while watching the movie. It was a boring movie, not a lot of fun. The appearance of Denise Richards was again a pleasure to the eyes. But that's it. We (the four of us) <br /> <br /> we're a little disappointed. But feel free to watch this movie and judge yourself.
