I do not think I've been so impressed with the absurdity of a movie in my entire life as when I got out of this piece of crap. NOTHING in this makes any sense. none of this is intelligent or well thought out. for lack of truly suspenseful moments, they repeatedly use this total cop-out trick, in which you build the music before the character does something like open a door or move a curtain away and then nothing is there. this is ok to do once, maybe, but I've counted three times. there are things played for no apparent reason, characters, half-formed plots ... the characters were not well developed in EVERYONE. the end was ... bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component of this movie is terrible. and I'm here just to warn you of all this.
