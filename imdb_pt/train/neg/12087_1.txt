I've seen all kinds of "Hamlet" s. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh's was more ambitious, Mel Gibson's was quick and to the point, Laurence Olivier's was the best - hands down. But now we come to the opinion of Maximilian Schell about the Bard. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this is a dubbed version of a German TV production of the venerable chestnut tree of William Shakespeare. But if there is a slower, slower, more lethargic and worse version somewhere, she must have acted at the elementary school level. <br /> <br /> Having seen this on the MST3K helps, with Mike and the robots welcoming the old boy, piercing the depth of black and white TV, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of the Germans representing an O English plays and makes it look like a rejection of Ingmar Bergman. <br /> <br /> Of course the best parts are the MST riffs. Better lines? "I'm going to drop the Great Dane," "I do not think so, 'breathe,'" "Meet the Beatles," "Hey Dad, you're going to help me with my science project" and, my personal favorite, party - "Garrison Keillor is leaving Germany (YAAAY !!)". <br /> <br /> But there Schell, playing Shakespeare's greatest character as a department store mannequin would do, but not so expressive. Undoubtedly, he is a great actor, but here he does as well as Paul Newman in "The Silver Chalice". Have you seen this? You have to watch these two in a double account! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is an example where it is true that you are much better off just reading the book. At least the book is not dubbed by Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> One star just for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, of course, for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Prince of good night, not so sweet.
