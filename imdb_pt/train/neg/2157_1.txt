Siskel & Ebert were great at this program whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict generated by their separate professional opinions. Roeper took this show down a notch or two because he was not really a film critic and because he replaced snide by opinionated. Now, when Ben Lyons appears I feel like I'm watching "Teen News" - you know, that children's news program organized by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is obvious that they have only found a steady diet of traditional films for life. The idea that these two amateurs have something interesting or to say about movies is ridiculous. If they are reviewing a non-formula movie, they are completely lost. Show them something original and clever - they just find it "confusing". Wait - I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper promoted independent films and were just hit or miss with the big budget studio productions - what a surprise: these two guys love the great studio schlock and can only tolerate some indies. In addition, everyone knows the age group advertised by TV advertisers. Gross nepotism is the icing on the cake. In what alternate universe do these guys qualify themselves as movie critics?
