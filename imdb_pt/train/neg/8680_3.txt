I just watched this movie and WOW was so bad. In fact, the only thing that kept me watching was that it was so MONUMENTALLY bad it was kind of entertaining. The characters' action is hilarious, in the hyper-dramatic way that they fall to the shooting, to their incredibly bad acting (did the bad guys just leave the street, or were they actually actors?), To an incredibly poor delivery of lines, to the your unexplained actions (if you will try to shoot someone through a door when they enter, obviously the thing to do is shoot directly at the door knob !!). This movie should break some record of worst written and delivered lines. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera was also very bad - you can hardly see what is happening in the fight scenes due to the exchange of camera angles and tremors. I would have voted "1", except that I like Chiba and the help of Sue Shihomi, and I was entertained with some scenes: 1) break a villain's arm so the bone leaves the skin (this has to hurt) 2) a drug dealer eating a brown-skinned animal (a monkey ??) cutting the carcass with a meat cleaver 3) Sonny Chiba is doing improvised eye surgery on a guy with his fingers. <br /> <br /> I'm really a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but this one is not worth much. I've seen about 7 or 8 of his movies and I've come to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching (and they're great!) Are the Street Fighter series and The Killing Machine. I also heard that Executioner and Golgo 13 are good. I recommend staying with those.
