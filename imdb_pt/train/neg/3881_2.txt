A few days ago, I watched a documentary called THE FIVE WORST FILMS OF ALL TIME and it was here that I first heard the movie THE INCREDIBLE FUSION MAN. Being a lover of shocking movies, I'm making a point of trying to find some of the documentary films - not just including THE AMAZING FUSION MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad movie" I've seen since then and I must say I'm a bit disappointed. Although it's a bad movie, it's not even close enough to be on that list. Now before I see the documentary, I've been enjoying "bad movies" ever since I read the book "The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time" by Harry Medved. Despite the same title, the book went long, long before the documentary and the creators of the documentary never credited Medved to the concept. From the Medved book, I've seen about 35 of the 50 films, but I've come to a standstill - the rest of the films simply are not available on VHS or DVD. So, I thought about testing the movie with the same name. <br /> <br /> The reason I was most disappointed with the AMAZING FUSION MAN was that there were some good elements in the movie. First, the special effects of the melting guy were usually pretty cool and disgusting. It is obvious that a professional (the famous Rich Baker) was involved in making it look realistic. However, I should also point out that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effects - like the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran after the left arm was cut - you could see "cleverly hidden" under your clothes! As for the story, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously penetrate the rings of Saturn without being crushed. So they comment on how beautiful the sun is - how we see the closes of it. This is strange, since Saturn is so far away - it should not look like this - it should be a big stain. Regardless, immediately the scene changes and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital. What happened between the last scene and this one? Yes, nobody knows. Well, soon after, the survivor escapes and engages in murderous fury as his entire body melts. <br /> <br /> Now, considering they have a psychopath running about who looks like a melted popsicle, you think the government would pull out all the stops to find and stop it, right ?! Wrong. A general hires a lone doctor to find him !! No army, no police - just a foolish doctor. Even after the bodies start to accumulate, at no time will the doctor or general do anything to organize a meaningful quest or gain support. <br /> <br /> Now, given the stupidity of the movie, you would not be surprised either. to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the guy who is melting is running near the doctor's house, the doctor gives the wife a powerful sedative and leaves it at home. <br /> <br /> When a beautiful elderly couple is driving late at night, they naturally stop in an orchard to harvest fruit and are killed. <br /> <br /> When a lady sees a face melting, she barricades the door to protect herself. That would be smart if she did not have the back door of the house next to her! Instead of just leaving the house and running away, she just waits! <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model are taking pictures, the guy picks up his assistant and rips off his blouse. Because? Well, to give the public a cheap thrill and make it a R movie. <br /> <br /> When the guy who is melting is finally located and the sheriff has a clear shot at him, the doctor stops him - though now the monster killed about half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the movie is full of stupid elements. It's a really bad movie. But given the special effects that once in a while were good, it just was not a horrible movie like I expected. Of course, it's good for a laugh, but it's not such a close place and should never have been included in the worst list of movies either.
