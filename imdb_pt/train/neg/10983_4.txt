When this piece was first shown by the BBC more than 30 years ago, it would have been something quite different for the time. So some people would have found this quite scary, and may have been impressed by the special effects? Looking at the play nowadays, it does not seem to be that scary. more, even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> Would it really allow a train to pass a RED LIGHT in a dark tunnel? I do not think so ...... but if you watch this game again, you will notice that the first train that enters the tunnel, passes straight through the RED LIGHT! (maybe that's how it was in dickens time)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the trail leading up to the signal box is very steep and in poor condition. Certainly there would have been a series of appropriate steps with handrails for the Signalman to rise or fall on the cut. (I can not help but notice things like that) <br /> <br /> I'm not going to take anything from the acting, both Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) gave wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's going on ...... I mean, it was the ghost of the traveler, or what ??? Does anyone really understand this rather confusing story altogether? (well, maybe I'm the only one who does not) <br /> <br /> To summarize ..... <br /> <br /> The play has a wonderful atmosphere everywhere, with great character. It suffers from not being so scary these days, and a little if not very confusing in some places, and has some pretty unusual signaling practices .... Thank you for reading my review.
