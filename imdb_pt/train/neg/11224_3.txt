... and even then, they can live without seeing. To be honest, this movie (if anyone deigns to call it that) is of real interest only to the slavery fanatics. Bettie Page fans will not learn anything new (and I mean * nothing *), nor enjoy the warm feeling of experiencing anything familiar, loved or loved. <br /> <br /> No matter the abysmal script, wood, less than the performance of community theater, total absence of direction, poor lighting or any of the other production values ​​of the bargain basement . This is definitely "Hey kids, let's make a movie!" filming of the lowest order. I suppose someone could be grateful that at least they knew how to turn the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of this is pertinent to why this thing is so clear * wrong *. <br /> <br /> It's wrong because the girl who plays Bettie Page, a rather zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the Queen of Curves is dark hair and the trademark, can not bring anything to the role beyond the will to be tied and gagged. This is apparently a good thing for his film career before and since this excessive but not by excessive, which consists mainly of a number of B & D scenarios lovingly recreated between horrendously horrible faux biographical scenes delineating Ms. The fall of grace page (so to speak). In fact, there is probably more information about Page's life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. This is not a companion movie worthy of "The Notorious Bettie Page". This is not a movie worthy of everything. This is a fetish piece that draws on the fascination of one of the greatest pin-ups of all time, and does so without class, without style and without any real sense of understanding the character of Bettie Page. No Bettie Page fan will think it's a disappointment, I guarantee that. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. If free, remember that time is also money. Yours may not be worth much, but I bet it's worth it that you'll be sorry to waste time with this one. That's it, I finished, you were warned.
