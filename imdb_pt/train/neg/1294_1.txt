The central theme of this film seems to be a confusion, since the relations, scenery, performance and social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be out of his element, and does not have its flawless clarity, direction, and intensity. To make matters worse, his character's name is 'Che', and we're only told (directly by the narrator) in the movie that he's not 'that' Che, just a guy named Che. Family relations remain unclear until the end of the film and, once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation for America. So clich√©. Other analyzes discuss how the film portrays the impact of revolution on a boy's family; however, the director's political position is obscure at best, and we never know for sure who is responsible for the bloodshed. So they lost their properties (acquired by the profits of the game) - so what? Refusing to take a political stance, when making a film about the Cuban revolution, is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention that the movie was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they were not allowed to film in Cuba. And if family life is more important to look at here, it would be great if we could find out who it is - we're "introduced" to everyone at the beginning - a cheap way out to make relationships clear during the movie! The acting was largely superficial, wooden and unbelievable, time was out of the way. The "special" visual effects were confusing and disturbing. References to American films - and the black character as a Greek chorus - are strictly gratuitous, intellectually ostentatious, and consistently out of place. I just watched the entire movie because I was waiting for clarity, or some point for all of that. This never happened.
