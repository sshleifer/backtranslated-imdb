You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell the story of their lives, and you sit there with a pathetic smile when all you really want to do is slap your ass and walk away? Well, I had a similar feeling when watching this movie. Okay, I actually chose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about the taste of Nanni Moretti for becoming the only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last installment of his memories I wanted to give Moretti Mother of all the covers. Dear Diary was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters got a word on edgeways. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights over dialogue, so everything you hear for an hour and a half is an acute groan going on about how your politics are best, or what peculiar piece of popular culture is pleasing your fantasy. at the time. He also finds time to back up movies he does not like, something that I thought was reserved for losers like me. Certainly being in a position like his, you'd think he'd try to make a point about cinema a little smarter than that. Making an appropriate film, perhaps, with some ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps one that is not completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he began to flatter his newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of somebody normal, preferably not a movie director obsessed with a strange tendency to playful music. The next time someone you do not know tries to tell you their life story, give him a slap on me. Each blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
