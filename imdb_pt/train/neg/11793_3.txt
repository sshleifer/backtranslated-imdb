Deep Shock presents itself as a TV movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, a creature ill-engineered to be the "villain" and a script full of technical and political jargon than knowing what to do. I checked the film for (I love to see what the filmmakers have in mind for their projects on these cheap videos) and, right from the start, I was disappointed that the creature in the box was not the only one in the movie. The actors I expected because of the kind of movie that is (really quite generic and not thought beyond a certain point). The music was a typical and not thoughtful symphonic song. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computers and technical equipment, along with the design of the mini-sub. The film has come to flow very well, with screens that let you know in which scenario you are watching the story unfold. But there is not much history here anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 3/10 IMO star rating. The boring quest and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting you ... kind of boring. Even licking is the marked love relationship between two of the characters you do not see coming. Chalk this up to be a movie that tries to take the careers of the actors of the bank and in a video. Do not bother yourself.
