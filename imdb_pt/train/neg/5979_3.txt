Pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the TV series, strung together without the usual commercials. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, fighting and a resolution where everyone is happy in the end), and there is nothing unique or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are filled (on the final credits!) No explanation, and everything is a bit too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. Both my kids like Pok√©mon, and by showing interest in what they like, we're closer. Watching a movie at a movie theater is still different from watching it at the movies, and my kids enjoy the whole experience of going to the movies. I gave the film a 4, especially from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
