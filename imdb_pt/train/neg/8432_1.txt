Leave it to geniuses like Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to convince the superiors in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt of a movie. The sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of the attempt to make a film with such fine material. Most of the photos that are made in Spain fall into two categories: those about the Spanish Civil War, who love to present past history as writers deem appropriate. The other kind of movie shows the viewer a lot of free sex because the "creators" have no interest in saying anything. <br /> <br /> As the movie opens, we get to see Pere's penis as he tries to cut it and put it on one of the party dishes. Later, Sandra will show everything she has received for the audience to admire. The story of Pere's attraction to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happy and married, is false from the start. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching the film was centered on an earlier and better picture made by mr. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished for watching on this venture. As for the comments presented in IMDb, all negative votes come from Spanish viewers, who speaks volumes from them!
