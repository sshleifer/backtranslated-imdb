This is an attempt by both author Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers, in an Arabic "Tarzan of the Apes". But this desert movie shows nothing of the majesty present in the most successful adventure in the jungle of Burroughs. The focus is on the love between the handsome Englishman Jon Hall (as "El 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic Arabic beauty Kathleen Burke (as "Princess" Eulilah), with vengeance taking place to coincide with his will to merge. The opening says that although guilty of misconduct, the boy's mother is alive - but never goes back into the picture. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" has deteriorated, and it seems that images are missing. <br /> <br /> The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
