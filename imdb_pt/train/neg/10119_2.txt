The animation in this re-imagination of Peter & the Wolf is excellent, but at 29 minutes, the film is sleep inducer. They should have called it "Peter & the Snails" because everything moves in the rhythm of a snail. I could not watch the movie all at once - I had to watch it for 15 minutes at a time, and that was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save 30 minutes - do not watch this movie - and you will thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the Oscar nomination committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner of the Best Short Animation category (short!), Voters will have to go through it all. I already feel sorry for them - and I have to predict that there is no way this movie can come close to winning.
