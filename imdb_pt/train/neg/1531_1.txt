This movie is so bad it made me want to vomit. Badly produced, a complete laughter-free zone. Why, in god's name, would you fake a movie that, to some extent, is a parody (and a funny thing)? The scenarios are laughable, the effects are so bad that they are not even laughable and the acting is ridiculous. It is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this piece of junk. The National Lampoon has already done Animal House, which people still consider completely and totally hilarious. Now they've been relegated to making TV movies like that piece of wood. Name your swear word and it can be used accurately to describe this movie.
