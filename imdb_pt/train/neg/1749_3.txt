I have to say that this was the worst priyadarshan movie (releasing alongside kyonki much better than it was also his directorial venture), does not contain any specific storyline and only focuses on showing body debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan is becoming very repetitive in his comedy movies, just as Govinda and David Dhavan did in the past, after giving some good artists, they also lost the public. So it will be good for him to focus more on the script and try some variations in his direction. Give us more of the weekly from Herapheri and Malmal instead of giving failures like garam masala!
