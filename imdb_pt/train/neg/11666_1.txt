As gently as I can, I truly believe that this movie is a waste of time. I did not find the movie 'hot, emotionally satisfying' that others did. I find it annoying, with music that distracts from the movie. The story was thin, the characters discovered and the pedestrian direction. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to write more about this movie, so I make the 10 line minimum. There is really no more to be said and brevity is important, but the IMDb has its minima, so here it goes. <br /> <br /> The young eager boy finds nascent talent, seeks time with the embittered and aged mentor despite the father's cartoon homophobia. The aged and embittered mentor ends up drinking a lot and teaches very little. conflict arises. While I do not think this is a spoiler, I've added the warning in case someone thinks too much information is too much. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I found the film boring and pretentious. A waste of my time. I honestly do not understand how little there seems to be, especially on this site, about the transcendent quality of this film. I think it's worth avoiding. But as Dennis Miller used to say, "Maybe I'm wrong."
