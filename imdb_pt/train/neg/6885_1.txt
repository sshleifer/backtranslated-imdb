... in an otherwise awful, naive and pretentious age comedian. <br /> <br /> I was the lonely victim in a session at 7:20 tonight (3 days after the movie was opened), so there is some satisfaction in knowing that viewers have heard the warnings. <br /> <br /> The flower is loose from Jon Heder's rose. The emerging double chin is not his fault; but going over your geek boy in another bad wig just is not working. It would be another crime if this were the last appearance on Eli Wallach's screen. Diane Keaton will probably survive having received this payment - basically because so few have seen her in this, the worst vehicle she has chosen in recent weeks. <br /> <br /> Sitting alone in the theater tonight I survived. (laughed, even) whenever Daniels received the latitude to deliver the only three-dimensional character of the film. He really is among our best actors. <br /> <br /> In short, not even the work of Jeff Daniels can salvage that image.
