Watching now, it's still as pretentious and sexist as I remember. comes from a time when girls were "Dolly Birds" and basically male toys. It's hard to understand that it's from Hammer studios and the fact that it's available on DVD when good movies are not. Our nations shame where the working class is portrayed as timid work or worse! The problem is that you can not help feeling nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus. Try to hold the contents of your stomach when you see Olive in a fluffy? "Sassy" blue sweater or something like Shirley Bassey used to wear to a concert in 1972. Warning this movie shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double-decker bus, which I was informed is not a Routemaster, but A Bristol. <br /> <br /> Look, do not bother watching anything decent like Porcupine or Daddy's Army ... or a fly up a wall.
