Oh, exactly what I needed, another movie about 19th century England. Which is a lot like regular England, just the football stadiums of nobody's vandalism. In this picturesque setting of lords, ladies and other randomly chosen titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg walks aimlessly like Jane Eyre, of that novel no one has read willingly. in the cradle of Mr. Rochester, where she tries to teach a French girl to look at an empty slate all the time. One day, Mr. Rochester (William Hurt on autopilot) once again falls in love with Jane and everything else, but there is still the issue of his fruitcake wife who is locked in the loft.Oops, which was not in the brochure. some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire (they probably rented the set), the movie finally comes to an end. Everything seemed really authentic, this is something I think. But then again, nah.
