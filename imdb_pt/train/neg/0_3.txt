Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. It starts with an opening scene that is a great example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is transformed into an insane and violent mob by the crazy chants of their singers. Unfortunately, it remains absurd all the time without any general narrative, which ends up making the conversation very bad. Even those of the season should be turned off. The enigmatic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy for a third grader. On a technical level, it's better than you imagine with a good cinematography of the great future Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
