I can not say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But then again, I can not say it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> OK, so it's basically a girl who skates, is good at it, wants to go to an expensive school, can not afford it and has to take a hockey bag. She has to hide her skating secret from her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like the actress who played Katelin. She absolutely could not cry to save her life, just made whining sounds, like a child pretending to cry to have her own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just a boring person. The way she tried to act kindly and helpful to people. Also the part where the two skaters are calling their names and they say something about their choreographer and she says "draw the line" made me tremble. <br /> <br /> We all knew where to go with her and Spencer. Classically they did not like each other and kind of getting together in the end was just typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this is a movie to watch if you like to skate, but if you do not mind the main skater being extremely annoying. It's good to kill time basically.
