Okay, I admit, it started very nice and good, but after it fell, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar could have finished reading the script after about 5 minutes in the movie, the only reason I actually sat through the whole film, I wanted to see the turnaround in ned, and to my surprise, well, guys I can not even tell you if there was one, because the end leaves you confused, and then the credit paper, I was like what the hell? that did not deserve a run of the theater, I'm sorry, but that does not mean it was horrible, the only reason I gave it a 4 is because it had some leftover parts ... that's right! you can watch it, I'm not telling you not to, hey you might even like it or even love it! but if you hate it, do not say I did not warn you!
