You may consider some facts in the discussion as spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to win an Oscar for this play, and I think the Academy was right about it. vote. (Other Oscars best nominated for the actors and such ... I do not know, but it would be hard to justify, given what they said to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg directs this. is so invented, so nosy. While watching this film, a distinction made during a Film as Art course that I did was shouting to me: "Feeling is an honest emotion, honestly rendered. Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life." This is exaggerated sentimentality. When in real life do two people begin to read aloud in synchrony, as Celie and Shug Avery do when they sit on the bed replaying Nettie's letters they find? There are examples of such false behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around Miss. Millie and jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she leaves; Harpo falling on the roofs of several buildings he is working on (a cheap joke); the whole troop of revelers going from the Jook Joint en masse into the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's chant ... non-stop. Nothing sounds true. I even wondered if Harpo's name was intentionally chosen because it's the real name of his wife Sophia, "Oprah," backwards. Spielberg is not above such a "cuteness." <br /> <br /> It is not that Spielberg is unable to honestly render action and emotion. Schindler's List was incredible, deeply touching to me, and I greatly admire Soldier Ryan's Rescue too for his realism, even if the story is a bit fabricated.
