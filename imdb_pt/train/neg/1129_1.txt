I saw this movie because I did it (my job includes seeing movies of all kinds). I could not stop thinking "who gave money to make such a horrible movie and also submit it to the Cannes Film Festival!" It was not only boring, the actors were terrible as well. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
