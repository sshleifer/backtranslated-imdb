This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It could be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad they are good; this movie is so bad that it goes through a nice camp and simply becomes terribly awful. It's the anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intention of messing up, and my whole family gathered for a fun night of smart remarks; instead, we were stunned silence, sorry for poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the lively Lord of the Rings. It's worse than the sequences of the Matrix. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Do not let this film come close to ten meters from your television.
