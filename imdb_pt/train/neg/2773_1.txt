Up to this point, Gentle Rain was the movie that I found the worst in history. It was supplanted by this 'blockbuster' out of Asia. It has a "star" and is John Rhys Davies. He's out of shape to be the flying, magic bumblebee baddie he's climbed here. The rest of these people could not get out of a high school play. No clich√© was forgotten in the dialogue, and the special effects were called as fast as possible. <br /> <br /> It is fairly easy to see that someone in Asia had some money and needed to create a vehicle for some actors. they wanted to play money. Or maybe it was a director or writer who needed credit. My guess is that any career with this movie on your badge <br /> <br /> Do yourself a great favor and do not watch this movie. A hundred thanksgivings could not consume this turkey. <br /> <br /> The only funny scene was not intentional. The king's brother appears on the scene. King? A beautiful, older and short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) Brother? A six-foot European. (Also a bad actor.) No apologies were made for this. They just hoped we did not notice that the poor man's brother, Jet Li, was an aspiring Pierce Brosnan, in a cheap "Injun" wig, coming out of an old western movie of the 1940s.
