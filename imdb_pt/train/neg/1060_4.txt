OK, so it was written in 1996, before Sept. 11, so you can give a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director makes a plan to blow up that plane before it lands on the destination. . the world is prescient. That's it. That's the good thing. The acting ... just. The plot ... silly. The "twist" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not as if no one had thought of what to do when an airplane is tainted. Do not you think bureaucrats have a manual for "plagues" and how to contain them? Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It is not to send them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is loaded into the air, why was the plane's door opened and the "sniper" standing there unprotected? In fact, has it ever occurred to someone toss your legs? That would prevent her. But not so dramatic I'm a sucker I always watch a movie to see the end once I started But that was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable I saw it using a tape recorder so I did not have to watch to all ads, that was an advantage. It's a good example of why I watch so little network TV.
