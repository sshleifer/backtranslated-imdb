Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible .... . . . . . As a fanatic fanatic by Robin Williams, I found it necessary to buy this movie as the first on-screen appearance. Wow ... I could not imagine a more mind-numbing movie. Essentially, the film takes one joke in bad taste after the other that your Uncle Artie would tell you after dinner and dramatize them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30-second set. <br /> <br /> I'm all for obscene humor, but this humor was not pleasantly vulgar, or ribald ... it was just dulling the mind. There are no redeeming qualities for this film, as well as fanatics for Robin Williams, like myself, who simply have to own each piece of film.
