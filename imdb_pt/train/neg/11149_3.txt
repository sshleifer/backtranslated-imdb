Recap: Full moon. A creature, a huge werewolf, is on the hunt. Not by flesh, not by blood (not that it seems to mind biting the way), but by a partner. He's in search of a girl. No girl though. The girl. The girl who is pure (and also a werewolf, though she does not know yet). Three, well check it out, two policemen (after the first scene) and an old lady in the bag is all that can stop you, or even know that the thing that kills and eats a lot of people around the full moon is a werewolf . This particular powerful werewolf, Darkwolf, is approaching the girl. If he gets it, mankind is doomed. Now the police have to find the girl, convince her not only that there is someone, a werewolf who wants to rape her, and maybe kill her, but she herself is a werewolf. And then they managed to stop him ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one of the boys, the teenagers. A lot of scenes with semi-naked girls more or less important to the plot. Mostly less. Well, I think you need something to fill some time because the plot is (expected) fine. And sadly there is little beyond the girls to help the plot break. One usually goes back to two main themes. Nudity. Checks. And then special effects. Hmm ... Well, there are some things you can call effects. They are not very special though. In fact, to put it bluntly, they are very bad. The film seems to be suffering from lack of funds. They could not buy clothes for some of the girls;), and the effects are cheap. Some of the transformations between werewolf and human form, obviously made by computer, are really bad. You can ignore these things. But Darkwolf itself is very rude as well, and you can never see any murder. Only a few mutilated corpses later. And there is surprisingly little blood in a movie that honestly should be soaked with blood. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to say about actors and characters. Most of the time, they do well, but unfortunately there are lapses in which the characters (or actors) just lose it. Some of these lapses may be related to the problems mentioned above. Such as poor effects or poor budget (?). That could explain why there are precious shots, even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in sight (and do not move). But, hey, when you're in real danger, there's nothing that will save your life as a good one-liner ... Unfortunately that can not explain times when the cop, Steve, the Only one who knows how to deal with the problem, the werewolf that is, runs away, when the only things he can be sure of, is that the werewolf is coming to the girl, who is next to him now, and that he can not let this for her. But sure enough, let the creators extend the ending a bit more ... <br /> <br /> But I would not mind seeing any of the main actors trying another try in another movie. <br /> <well. To give a small conclusion: it is not a movie I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
