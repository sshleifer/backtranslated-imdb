I was very disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was the Serial Mom and I loved it. So I saw Pecker and I loved it. So I watched Polyester and really hated it. The only thing I liked about this movie was DIVINE. She / he had a lot of talent. I was really surprised. As a whole, I would not recommend this movie ...
