Before watching this movie I had very low expectations and went just to see the cars. Eventually I even regret going for that reason. The plot is almost non-existent. The development of characters is non-existent. So many cliches and so many jaw-dropping jouissances existed in the movie that I could only watch and imagine how it was released. If it were not for the exotic, I would not even have rated this movie as 1. An attempt to create a coherent plot is destroyed by the absurdity of this elite cult and the laughable characters that make up its members. In fact, the plot of the film is so predictable and simpleton that an ordinary child could predict most of the plot. Bad acting, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see it. Play Gran Turismo HD in its place and quench your thirst for sexy and fast cars without leaving a bad taste.
