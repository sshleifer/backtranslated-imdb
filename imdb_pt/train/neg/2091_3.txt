I remember watching the BSG driver. I can describe exactly the night. I remember which chair I sat on. That show was magical. That came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed parts of the third year, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, totally faithfully, with high hopes that somehow he would turn around. Well, that did not happen. I watched the Caprica pilot and was fascinated. There was hope for something good here. So I started watching the regular episodes, and they are getting increasingly boring. <br /> <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the political correctness of his last flawed show, Virtuality. <br /> <br /> Much of his line work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true in the beginning when they followed more or less the pattern of episodes defined by the first BSG series. When they left after meeting with Admiral Cain and Pegasus, everything went to the pot. It was as if he wrote the rest of the program without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe this will get better. Maybe it was just a few weak start episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
