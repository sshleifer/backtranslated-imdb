I loved the Batman TV series and was really looking forward to it. But they tried to do too much. <br /> <br /> Why they had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me. I do not want to beat Burt or Adam for the way they look now ..... It's been 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but seeing them dressed in gala costumes and fighting 'badguys' was kinda sad. I'd rather just watch the former stars make comments. The history on the side of the batmobile was stupid. <br /> <br /> As for the flashback movie, I think it was too short and left out too much. It was really just a quick overview in my opinion. I'd like to go deeper. They showed Penguin and Joker for about a minute each to tell the same things I already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his make-up and the penguin had to smoke, even if he hated it and was a former smoker. That was it in those 2. <br /> <br /> I'd love to read the book. I'm sure there's more to it than that. Like why there were 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commishioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. the list goes on. As I said, even the ones in this one were little involved. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really cheesy.
