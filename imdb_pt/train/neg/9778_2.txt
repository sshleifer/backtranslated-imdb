I'm sure Operations Dames was a favorite with drive-ins in the past. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise worried. And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities, you'd have a few curvy cuties on the screen to leave you in a good mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there is not much that Operations Dames can do. . It is set in the Korean War, where a platoon of soldiers, along with a British, gets a little too advanced and has to go back to the UN lines. It's bad enough, but these guys also come across a bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same situation. <br /> <br /> You know what's sad about this movie is that it took women generations to finally be accepted. the Army and in combat situations. These USIM bimbas place the liberation of women in clear years. In fact, not even the tough professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep you in your pants. <br /> <br /> But that was probably best to remember what they were in the drive-in. for. This name is not better for me, not recognizing any of them for any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Dames Operations is definitely a team failure.
