The show is medium. That does not make me laugh particularly. However, I think Courtney really brings this down. It does not look natural. She has these three modes of speech, all robotic. She speaks softly (without intonation), speaks normally (without intonation), or does that thing in which she begins to speak normally and begins to shout little by little. However, his scream is like "let's pretend I'm screaming because I should not be too loud on set." <br /> <br /> She is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing. It's annoying. You can not really get her personality because she does not really produce emotion, and she does not get upset. She has this husband, who is doing all these stupid things, and there is no reaction from her. Very dry and simple performance.
