I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me in my place. I guess I expected a movie with Gere to have some value in it eventually, but nothing of value ever appeared on screen. The story is a silly excuse to rack up shot after shot of slavery and torture. There is not a character in the movie who does something like real life. The "style" of cutting is based on jumping cuts, mini flashbacks and overimposing to give weight to this insipid setup of a gang of seemingly free sadists for years and SURPRISE the leader is the "victim" of a executed killer. I do not see how Gere, a Buddhist, got involved in this violent, sexist junk.
