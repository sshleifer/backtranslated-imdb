Note to all the mad scientists everywhere: if you're going to turn your kid into a genetically engineered monster, you need to give him a name more scary than "Paul." I do not care if he's a scary hammerhead with his mouth full of sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land. Give the boy a more dignified name like "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon". Because even if he eats me I'll probably sit there laughing, "Ha! Get a lot of that! Paul, the Monster, is tearing me to pieces !!!!!" This is the worst part of this movie, this shark thing is called "Paul" throughout the movie. This makes what could have been a decent and scary horror movie look silly. Not that there are no extravagant, invented parts of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy." Scientists spend the entire movie wandering around this island, and suddenly one of the girls starts scratching madly for walking in the lush forest, and just has to spill water on her feet to relive the itch, which naturally allows "Paul" to leave the island. water and kill it. The only thing the SciFI channel did right in this movie was to leave the hottie live. But that's a small thread of hope in a movie that would otherwise be disappointing.
