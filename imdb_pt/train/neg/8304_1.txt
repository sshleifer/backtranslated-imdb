"A Christmas Story" is one of the most beloved movies of all time. ACS was able to take the viewer to a time and place in such a way that few movies did it. He had a sweetness and goodwill that is rare. <br /> <br /> So I waited (and waited) for his sequel, "It Runs In The Family." The film was almost released a few times, only to be taken at the last minute. When it finally came out, the IRITF was (and is, I think) a total failure. <br /> <br /> Scenarios and cinematography were fine, but the direction totally missed the mark. The film was nothing more than a formula of lazy cast box flow, lazy writing and disjointed acting. <br /> <br /> The narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of America's greatest comedians and storytellers, forced us to a false reprise of the warm wit he used in ACS. He exaggerated, and why he did it I'll never know. Somehow he managed to become an annoying parody of himself. <br /> <br /> The writing and acting in the IRITF is inauthentic and forced. Actors may have seen ACS, but regardless of ACS 'wit and nuance, they should not have been registered in any of them. The performance was embarrassingly a slap and devoid of any dry mood of Shepard. <br /> <br /> The ACS will always be a true treasure, but calling the IRITF's sequel is insulting all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
