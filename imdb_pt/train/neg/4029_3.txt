The idea of ​​the story behind THE LOST MISSILE is not bad, but unfortunately the story gets a little boring in the middle and the excessive use of movies as well as bad special effects sinks this movie down. /> <br /> The movie begins with a missile heading towards Earth. In panic because it is about to hit the Earth, the Soviets can divert the object. This is not necessarily good, however, as this seemingly unmanned craft has a steam trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit on the planet. In other words, with each passing, there follows a death band - one that could potentially kill us all !! So it's up to the good US scientists (led by Robert Loggia, a young and almost unrecognizable) to formulate and plan to save us - and especially save New York that is on its way to immediate flight! Unfortunately they are not able to save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can not tell if this is a big loss), but thanks to good old American know-how, they are able to eventually destroy it. harbinger of destruction !! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the idea of ​​history is not bad and it is original. But many old clips of fighter jets and guys controlling radar scopes get a little old and look like padding. On the whole, a decent, but hardly inspired, movie that radical fans of the genre might like - everyone else, they see at their peril.
