Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film are true. <br /> <br /> BUT .... If I have to watch a movie, they will be: Director <br /> <br /> Director of photography <br /> < I can not even miss the damn Microphone Boom coming in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie, as I can take advantage of and focus on the story as well as believe in the damn thing when I remember the technical details of making a movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> WAIT FOR THE DVD OR NOT INCOMODE
