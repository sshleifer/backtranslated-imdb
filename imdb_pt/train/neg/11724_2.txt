I once used the name of Wesley Snipes as a clue to go ahead and watch a new untested movie in which he appears. So now, for the first time, my Snipes movie recommendation method failed. Totally I should have come here first to see these reviews. Snipes should be ashamed of allowing his more serious efforts to be wasted on "The Contractor." <br /> <br /> One of my worst movie fears came to bitter fruition. I feared that the unstable, blurry, pseudo-documentary, "disregarded" directing and editing style (first brought to my attention by Paul Greengrass's "Bloody Sunday") could spread to other films. Greengass's unhealthy style was then taken to new, sickening levels in the last two films of the Bourne trilogy. My fear was over. In my opinion, these films are actually hampered by these motion sickness inducing methods, which confuse indistinct blows of "action improvement." But the "Bourne Franchise," as Greengrass so fondly calls his money, apparently convinced others in Hollywood not to be pro-searchers for fast and big money. <br /> <br /> Read my lips, your Hollywood types. The action needs to be clearly photographed and presented, not only suggested by poor and lazy cinematic techniques. <br /> <br /> And "The Contractor" goes so far as to imitate "The Bourne Ultimatum" in inaudible repeated sounds. , in the hope that their (apparently valued) juvenile audiences will not be able to perceive them. For example, if I hear a police radio popping "Yankee-Romeo" one more time, I'll scream. Chances are good I will not listen again: I will certainly never see "The Hired" again. <br /> <br /> I recommend to those who have not yet seen the "Contractor": just be content with the tranquility that this lack provides to your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I'm tempted to lower this to a 1.
