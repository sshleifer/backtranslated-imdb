I've seen fantastic stories, but the premises of this are so unbelievable that they come close to being ridiculous. A rich young boy goes through a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and somehow he is witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, what happens next is a mixture of dialogue between ... shall we say ... souls? ... maybe in real life, where the dedicated mother will do anything to save the life of her child. There is no shadow of suspense or emotion, just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that the film is completely lacking in quality. - in fact the director of the first time Joby Harold does a decent job directing a good team of actors that includes Hayden Christensen in its first important paper after having taken off the fantasy of Anakin Skywalker, the fabulous Jessica Alba and the gifted Lena Olin. Everything would have deserved a better story.
