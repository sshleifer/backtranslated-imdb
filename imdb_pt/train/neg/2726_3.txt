Considering his pedigree, this should be a much more fun movie than it is. Even with a collection of eccentrics in the cast - what fan would not eagerly anticipate a film that brings together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - the whole event is totally stimulated, ill-fated and, for the most part, senseless. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts were not essentially comical, as she confirmed in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a good comedian, as he has skillfully demonstrated in films ranging from the history of Philadelphia to Harvey. I think he does better out of this mess than anyone else. Except perhaps the cat.
