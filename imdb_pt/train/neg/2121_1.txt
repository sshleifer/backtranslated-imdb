Frankly, it also seemed like seven hours of annoyance. What is it? What is it about Will Smith that I just can not stand it anymore? I think he seems very committed to being taken seriously and getting an Oscar. I understand how biased it is, but unless it goes through some new acting lessons, I will never see it winning. He is a big name and therefore is often confused with a talented and diverse actor. It simply is not. I credit him for trying so hard, and being able to cry at the drop of a hat. That is all. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds was a kind of eyeroller to me from the start. The 911 suicide call did not intrigue me at all. I was not curious to know why he was calling on his own suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson were well accepted in screen chemistry. Besides, I do not know her name, but the Hispanic woman did a great job with her role of scared and beaten wife. Woody Harrelson had a very limited screen time, but I'd say he stole the show every time he was on the road. <br /> <br /> All in all, just a little original mill plot. I could not help but wonder the whole way because I cared about any of these people. I've never felt for Tim / Ben once. Did he kill himself with a jellyfish? Were you the only survivor in an 8 person crash? Geewiz. Did not see any of this happen ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is very generous.
