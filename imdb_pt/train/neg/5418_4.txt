This film is like the material SE Hinton was writing in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early 1980s, and if Trueblood really had been a product of either, the results could have been much better ( especially in the actuation department). Instead, we have a bit of mediocrity pretty bad. Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street-teller, I suppose is the accurate description. That was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and 30s and dressed them in greaser clothes or some sort of more effeminate selection of gang costumes and they fought with the bad music of the 80s. However, Ray is the only caretaker of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where he screams a lot), that he is forced to leave inexplicably behind at a train station when, running away from the police, he is arrested and forced to serve the time in the Marines. Let's move on to the present day and Ray is back in town and looking for his brother, who also became part of the street gangs, although in a gang that was Ray's opponent and now the old scores should be violently resolved (and again, cops must be dodged and this time, a lady's honor was defended in the direction of the action movie) before Ray could continue life at normal pace with his brother, Donny. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, the movie is ridiculous. For me, most of this has to do with too much exaggeration, though not Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays the waitress he befriends. The guys in the gang and Lowe himself seem to do a bit of unnecessary exaggeration like the street thugs in New York. Although the biggest problem is the recycled plot and perhaps a kind of film that has surpassed its peak as a product of 1989.
