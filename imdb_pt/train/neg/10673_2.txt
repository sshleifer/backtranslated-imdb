This movie was like a bad indie with a top-notch talent. The plot was silly, all the way to the end. It reminded me a lot of something produced for the domestic video market in the '80s. I would have given one, but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really striving to make it worthwhile. I think the worst thing was that the underwater scene was kept off the dock. The underwater lighting seemed to come from no age, and whenever someone we should be worried about was almost out of breath, that air tank would look sort of appearing. I would avoid this, unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Good day.
