As a big fan of David Mamet's movies and plays, especially his first House of Games movie, which also starred Joe Mantegna, I was expecting great things from this movie. Instead, I was bothered by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility. Racial insults are played without any feeling or meaning behind them, hoping to create a racial tension that for me never materialized. Identity is fully reevaluated and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of his oaths taken as a policeman, the main character refuses to perform a relatively small action that does no harm to anyone and can save lives, and still performs another action that is very violent and VERY illegal, but still refuses the least. action. In addition, a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who killed his family is introduced only because of a plot that was virtually announced with skywriting, and the police officer's reaction to this occurrence increases credulity beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after waiting for another exciting thriller from David Mamet, I was extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10.
