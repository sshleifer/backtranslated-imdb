This effort was like a flamboyant TV movie ... I do not remember it being released in theaters ... If so, it must have died quickly. Watching the DVD in the comfort of our room, it was obvious that this movie was not for much more ... Ed Lauter, an art critic with a greedy claw? What a fun turn it must have been ... I have not seen Ed since "The Longest Yard" ... Everyone practically acted for the numbers, led by Baldwin, except for Pompeo ... She had zero charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking with most of the image ... Pompeo's daughter had a dimension ... she played in all the scenes like a lovely puppy ... the slowest delivery queue of any 3 year old I've ever seen ... br / > <br /> The chase scenes gave my wife and I headaches ... very fast and angular cut ... If you're going to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you might want some WIDE shots to explore the beauty of your scenery, right? The whole story was quite implausible and exaggerated, but hey, we like it more than "The Life Aquatic ..."
