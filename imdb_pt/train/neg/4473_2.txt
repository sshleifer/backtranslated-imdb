Dane tries hard and goes to the extreme with all his screams and going crazy, pouring water on himself and rolling on the ground. To much. Calm down, join us and make us laugh. I did not quite understand his comparison with comics and rock stars. Just because there's so much on stage or something? He said every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield liked that when he was alive. He had some good jokes, like the Burger King joke, where people yell at the car ride. I also liked the joke of Reese's Pieces. If Dane just did not act so mentally, he could be funnier and I could have given a higher note, as high as maybe an eight.
