Horror movies are often seen as derivatives, repetitive and downright non-original. I happen to be a fan of horror movies, but this movie was so bad that words fail me. The script is gravely lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the acting surprisingly bad. Just a whole crap, I wasted time of my life. This had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a movie that was terrible at first. <br /> <br /> Who lights up this mess? <br /> <br /> I only liked two things in this movie. The first was the assassin's mask - which was cool. The second was the Australian affinity with humourous swearing. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this hideous mess.
