*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Are all teenage slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality? That sounds terribly. First of all, this is a noble premise that could have been well used. A rejected young nerd who grows up, lurks, and kills all the girls who tortured him when he was in high school? I can not say that you had nothing to work for. But this movie goes through the same movements as all other recent slashers. Everything from scoring to camera angles allows us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will attack. We know the pattern now. These stupid movies of terror push the envelope of credibility more and more every minute. Let me ask you one thing: who, in their right mind, will surprise a friend of theirs in a gloomy, gloomy morgue in the middle of the night and surprise her out of nowhere while she is alone and surrounded by corpses? Does that make any sense? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is occasionally groundbreaking. A good shot involves the massacre of Denise Richards' character. She gets trapped inside a pool and the killer nudges her with a chainsaw. There are some good songs on the soundtrack, including a cool Orgy track. The video clip is contained in the special features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even the acting is mediocre at best. All actors sleep in their roles. It is clear that David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his interpretation as a title character in "Angel." Denise Richards is a good actress, however, and she holds a stony face throughout the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is exactly as you would expect: pretentious, implausible, forgettable, tacky and without a good scare sight. Do not even bother. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (out of 10)
