This film is an embarrassment to film production. I can not believe it was even listed as a comedy - not funny. Not only was the screenplay appalling, but cast members should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just an excellent actress, but beyond that ... 99% of the rest of the cast ... alas. Almost everyone ... wow, it's hard even ... wow. Here is the number one rule on the comedy "DO NOT TRY TO BE FUNNY". There are many very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them have been used in this movie. Canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate the production of bad films in Canada. I realize that this is technically an "American" movie, but look at the director, the actors, the location, etc. I just saw this in Bravo - they should be ashamed to buy the right to show this movie. Again, there are many great movies out there that can not be displayed and show that crap.
