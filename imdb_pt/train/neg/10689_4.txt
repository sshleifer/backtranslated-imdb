Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself for the assassination of the president of the United States, I will immediately say that this is not the kind of role that this talented actor is known for, and this film shows us why. He joins a persistent reporter (Angie Harmon) to discover the conspiracy surrounding the president's death, and so on, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with a cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr., Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' can not catch your eye, simple and simple; part of the action is good, the acting is not all bad and the story, though clich√©d and made before, could lead to a fun and entertaining film - GOOD DOES NOT! The writing of the script and the direction make absolutely sure of that, at no time it shocks you in the story or makes you think as little as possible about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's boring, predictable and dull.
