Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just confuses the mind. This show is not funny, it's not smart, it's not original, it's just a steaming pile of junk. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional idiots with loud, exaggerated voices that sound like nails on a blackboard. The dubbing could have been better. Then there is the animation. My God, it hurts my eyes just by looking at him. Everything is very flat, too pointed, too bright and covered with candy. Then there is the humor, or lack of it. It's completely stupid! They only get those grade B jokes that are not at all funny and repeat them to death. They also play in some useless potty mood that makes me sick. And finally, last and least important, the music. It's just annoying. It seems to have been composed on a child's computer and does not generate any emotion. I wish there was a score less than 1, I really do. This show seriously needs to be canceled. It's a show I try to avoid like the plague. Whenever I hear the theme song I immediately turn off the TV. If you've never watched this show, then do not. Watch quality programming like the Simpsons or Futurama.
