I do not see this movie. Bad and stupid effects. A complete waste of time. I was hoping to see a lot of murders and hot girls, instead, the director relied on animal slaughter videos to shock you, the observer. Disgusting. The murders are very bad, basically strangulation. A woman as he puts worms in her mouth, one he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her. BTK = BTK broiler, new Burger King "killer" sandwich ... ha ha. I do not think this movie depended much on real facts. I mean, BTK's true killer did not carry a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms ... and, yes, a downed cow's head as well. Who knows.
