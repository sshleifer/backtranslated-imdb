I had just watched an episode of this show and could not even make it to the end of the show. Every minute I watched this program, my IQ should drop by about 10 points. This is basically like a children's show but with swearing. Not even the name-calling and insults she tells other people made me laugh. Anyway, the story must have been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script to this program to shoot must have been held at the scene of the war and had no choice but to film this late, disappointing and terribly-acted program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some acting lessons.
