The killings in this movie are not so bad, but it sure is. It's even worse than that. Nor is it worth the wear and tear it can cause when putting it on your DVD player. <br /> <br /> Not even the wear it causes on the shoulders, taking it from the DVD store, not to mention the money. and the time you spend renting and watching. Horrible. <br /> <br /> It's beyond understanding how anyone could say something positive about this movie. It was just a mere masochistic tendency of mine that made me not stop watching, adding to it the pressure of the group of my co-observers. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is horrible, the direction even worse and the acting is scorn simple. <br /> <br /> I hope you do not see this as a spoiler your fun, I'd rather see this as a fair warning: Do not waste your time watching this crap!
