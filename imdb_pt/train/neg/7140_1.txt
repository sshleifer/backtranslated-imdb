You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst movies of all time should include one of the most beautiful cars. Why cars should not only be victims of rape, but also the only real actors and artists. So how on earth do you Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever can allow these people to get in touch with their cars and ruin their reputation to which you give millions. Try to get a car advantage and make money on your breasts. It's painful for those who like cars. It is painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want my money back !!!
