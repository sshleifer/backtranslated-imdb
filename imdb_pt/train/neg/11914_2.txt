Shiri Appleby is the cutest personification of the evil that became good demonic girl, kicking the clone of Buffy, Elle. But I'm getting ahead of you, you see that Lilith was the first woman made by God as Adam's mate. But she has all the evil feminists so arrogant that God has banished her from Eden. A clandestine order known as The Fath captures her but does not kill her, so now with amnesia (which is actually not well explained) Lilith (now Elle) is free to become the aforementioned clone of Buffy who has to fight a mad scientist who received an injection of Lilith's blood. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph sounded terribly complicated, it is because it is. The film is also monotonous, generic, and for a movie with a plot impregnated with theology, it seems like it does not know anything about it. This bad CG movie was apparently a failed series pilot. All I can say to the fact that it was not caught is a resounding Amen. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary by Writer / Director Bill Platt and co-writer Chris Regina; and Stills Gallery; samples of video effects: before and after (also has a "also available" selection that you THINK would take you to some trailers, but not in DVD covers for other movies, which is a stupid idea) /> Extras of DVD-ROM: Final script of filming and transcription of deleted scenes in PDF format
