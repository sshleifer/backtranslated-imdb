This was a DVD used for blind purchase. That totally killed a good buzz I had when I hit the game. <br /> <br /> It's comedy with bubble head, but it's one. squalid. The plot is ZANY !, but the characters do things with each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently planned that I found it depressing to watch. <br /> <br /> Maybe the box will lead me to expect something more than an erratic, goofy caper movie. (I know, I know, the quotes in the box and the Oscar nomination mean nothing.)
