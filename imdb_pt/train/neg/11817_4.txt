A very common scifi movie. The plot was more or less obvious from the beginning. Although the acting was reasonably good, the writing seemed very clich√©, using ideas drawn from numerous films. <br /> <br /> The basic plot: Scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from colliding with the red dwarf they were orbiting. On board, they find a stasis capsule, which coincidentally does not work at that very moment. After 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the cocoon waking up, you realize that he is a complete lunatic. Something that totally escapes the crew of 3 people from the research vessel ... <br /> <br /> After that, it becomes a steal all the other films involving a crazy psychotic terrorizing innocent victims, in general I think Speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject, which I do not consider to be a good movie either. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, take the aliens out and watch it again. <br /> <br />
