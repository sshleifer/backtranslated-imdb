Dolph Lundgren meditates and frowns amid this incoherent mystery / suspense that is not as cool as the box would like you to believe. He's really good here, but the story is a bunch of B-movie cliches (detectives, revenge, tycoons, prostitutes, S & M) that seems to have been invented as they happened. The film picks up a bit in the second half, but for a more decent Lundgren movie, rent the RED SCORPION instead.
