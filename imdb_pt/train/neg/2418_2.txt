The first mistake you make in titling a movie is to use "the undead" without actually having a budget for real zombies. Of course, this was a low budget zombie movie - very low budget. I thought it was a movie school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It was not too bad considering what was said above, and he presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you're going to get an "R" of violence, you can give us good pictures of the girls being attacked. Women were so little used in this film that they could almost be classified as "gay interest." <br /> <br /> And, I'm getting out of Oakland. There have been a lot of filming going on and there are no cops in sight!
