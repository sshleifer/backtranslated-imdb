The idea of ​​Thumb is not that successful the second time around. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for several reasons. Primarily, I think Mr. Oedekerk had much less to work on in the case of Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic has not yet become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made, which will resonate with the public. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, holes are populated by punctual jokes that really do not seem to be related to anything. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine is not clean during the scene "jumping off the ship" - is not funny. Instead, you think, "Did I miss anything in the original movie?" There were many of these types of groundless jokes (see Arachnid). <br /> <br /> In return, sending the smarmy ship's designer had a meaning and was funny. Also very funny was the sending up of the guy in the movie who wanted to go "faster" as a maniac who runs around demanding * everything * is "faster" including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. This type of joke meant something in the context of the Titanic and gave a meaningful meaning to the Thumbtanic. <br /> <br /> The "media" of the thumb, the faces and the voices are still fun. The props and sets and the CG animation deserve to be appreciated. Overall though ThumbTanic proves that strangeness by itself will not work, this filmette still keeps you entertaining and laughing to the end.
