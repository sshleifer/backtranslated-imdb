This movie is supposed to be a mysterious and serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes after the movie, it turns into a funny and unreal story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly karate kicks that blonde girl or when he "punches" that old lady. The lines, characters and acting are all poorly done from the start. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he made some terrible movies this year; this being by far the worst (yet ...). <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an exciting thriller thrilling story. If you really want to enjoy this story, rent the original. However, if you plan to watch it, get ready to laugh at some of the final lines and scenes, rather than taking them seriously; This is the only way you can enjoy this movie.
