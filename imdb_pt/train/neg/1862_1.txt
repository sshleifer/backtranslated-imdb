It's not just the plot that makes this movie an instant shutdown for the bored audience. It's the terrible direction with a horrible script and left and right mistakes that makes it very agonizing to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' in it. Just the thrill of pointing out the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. Well, I'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as stupid as the sheriff who got into the van full of antifreeze with an open, bloody wound. Oops! I forgot to mention that this sheriff is not just a poor actor but can also avoid impaling with a load of antifreeze soaking the exposed flesh? I think he forgot when he won a not so exciting win over the snowman.
