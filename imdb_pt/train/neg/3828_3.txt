In 1976, western was an exhausted genre and the creators of this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of archiving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they moved on and did so anyway. Apparently needing an interesting topic to get the audience to come and see the movie, they decided to make it as violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why should not it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script, but the script for The Last Hard Men is simply old-fashioned junk. <br /> <br /> It is hard to imagine what drew Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their work. respective functions. Heston portrays a retired law enforcement man behind a bunch of convicted fugitives led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicted and subjected to sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> This is a bloodthirsty movie that, every time someone dies, is over-displayed. detail at the top. It's tremendously disappointing, because star-matching looks like a mouth-watering prospect. There is no sense of rhythm or urgency in the film either. It takes an eternity to move on, but when the action finally comes, it is undermined by the emphasis on evil. All in all, this may be the worst movie Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he hates to include in his illustrious resume.
