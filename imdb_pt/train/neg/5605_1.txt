I was very disappointed with this movie. I expected more from a female crime movie than Thelma and Louise. Instead, the fugitive prison woman in that movie had no sense of loyalty to each other. They were a bunch of extremely vulgar hyenas, who beat each other, betrayed each other, and even committed lesbian rapes against other women in the movie. <br /> <br /> Instead of being trapped thieves, who stood together to plan their escape and find the hidden stock of money, the escaped women were too selfish and cruel to trust one another for too long. These women were not released in a positive sense. They turned out to be a bunch of loose cannons, unable to respect themselves or each other. If you like crime films in the '70s, skip this bomb and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase starring Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
