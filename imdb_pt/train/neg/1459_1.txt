This is by far one of the most boring and terribly portrayed reports of Adolf Hitler's early days that I have ever seen. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but casting him as Hitler is simply wrong. To climb Liev Schrieber as a friend and long-time helper of Hitler, Haefengstal must have issued cries of despair and anguish from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. A J-W playing a Nazi supporter, a bad one. This was not a nice family movie with a good track record. This was Hollywood bullshit at its best, harnessing the strength of a strong (but very underutilized) cast of actors who seemed to have virtually disappeared from the acting radar in the last 5 years. <br /> <br /> The false German accents (vee vill vin zis var) are insulting to Germans everywhere. My mother is German and she sat furiously at the sound of the voices that kept changing from American / English / German in the same sentence. The support cast makes better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than on the screen. Jenna Malone as the fatiguing Geli Raubal, was splendid, she captured the innocence and confusion of this young tragic who ended her life to escape what her future would have been in the shadow of Hitler. <br /> <br /> If you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of Hitler's early years, including and including war / holocaust, rent "Inside the Third Reich," starring Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi like Hitler. It was good and made more sense than this nonsense. As a historical researcher of the Third Reich, I can honestly tell you that this made me pick up my books to confirm my myriad inaccuracies.
