: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with Love's eternal joy. I was waiting for a long time to see him and finally had the chance when he aired Thursday night at the Hallmark. I love the first three movies "Love", but this was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were lots of jokes and the editing was very poor - for many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened soon and Clarks' appearance in the movie just did not seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all out of emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think the writers should have gone beyond the book. It seems that all the films that have been made so far are increasingly far from the writings of Janette Oke. I mean, in the movie they never mentioned anything about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think the reactions of Missie and Willies to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been made so far, I have to say that Love's Joy of Love is my least favorite. I hope with the next four films that more of the book is followed and if the character Clarks is in them, I hope he has a bigger part and I hope that part of him is not so dull. I also hope there are more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty, but who knows what the writers will have in the store below.
