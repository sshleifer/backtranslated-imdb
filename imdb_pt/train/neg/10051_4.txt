I gave this 4 stars because there are many interesting themes that many have mentioned here. From domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos in it. Out of the blood, I really would not call this horror as much as it would be science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's dark, depressing and hopeless. Although I do not mind a less than cheerful ending, I'm actually very tired of the clich√© of "human sucks" that is central to every movie. I know you can not get a liberal arts degree today without leaning toward the self-hate alter as a member of the human race but how is it that as a writer / director we pretend we are different from everyone else in the pack and note that the aliens who kill the human race are evil! Right now, if you're reading this and believing that humanity deserves to die, just get out, find a pond and swim until your arms are tired. This way you will not be around to direct the next movie or write the next book saying that I deserve to die for being alive. It's silly, not thoughtful and boring.
