Why, why do people get good material and feel the need to change it in some way? Having read the book on which this film supposedly relies a few years ago, I can say that there is little or nothing of the original book. I got into this movie with low expectations - I knew he would have a lousy style of cell phone - but he even failed to know that. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it's the story of a totally different character who got the same name. They just spit in the face of all Carlito's Way fans; adding insult to injury by choosing Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original film in a different role. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that now that this movie has been made, no other movie will be made. addressing the original and untouched material from Carlito's Way book - something I'd really like to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of the most feared figure of the underworld of Australia, instead they did a movie about a crazy, but strangely pathetic little crook team (although Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never see Carlito's true rise and fall. <br /> <br /> The three stars is because, looking at it as an independent film, it's not so terrible - there are some decent performances. (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito, but he may be good at other roles) and the story is not that bad. Even Puffy Combs fits his role. But they totally misunderstood the nature of the underworld at that time (I'm a bit of a non-fiction fan) - something that the original movie and the books got right (having been written by the then lawyer and now Judge Edwin Torres) it's a stand alone - maybe it's the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.
