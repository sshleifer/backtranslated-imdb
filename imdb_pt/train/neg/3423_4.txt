This is a typical mild sex prank of the 70's in the genre Russ Meyer, though perhaps less bizarre than some of Meyer's works. This film has larger 'production values' than many of its contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. It's plot, writing and acting are out of Zone B, however. Lately, this film has become one of the cornerstones of B movie channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in the universe of 500 channels. If soft core is what you're up to, this is as "good" as anything else in track B. Do not expect Polanski though, Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more, nothing less. Jennifer Welles performing as the "mother" is perhaps the best of the cast. None of the actors in the movie came to greater fame, not surprisingly. Confessions of a young American housewife is far from the worst example of this. It's watchable, if this is your type of movie. 30 years ago, this would have been an avant-garde and riske movie. You can see more or less the same kind of thing on the Showtime / HBO series now and in prime time.
