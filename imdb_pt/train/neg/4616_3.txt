This movie did not age well. Maybe it's just the impact and ingenious characterization, acting and direction we saw with The Sopranos, but I just saw Prizzi's Honor for the first time on DVD alone. <br /> <br /> The experience of watching this with an audience of 24 years ago must have been quite different, but I have to say, I was shocked by the ending. Not just violence, but the mere idea that it would somehow be a satisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> I like a good shock, but this seemed so out of character ... Also, when was this movement supposed to be defined? The cars seemed to be from the 1960s, and yet the towers of the World Trade Center (completed in 1973) were clearly visible in many scenes of the city. <br /> <br /> Another way the film has aged badly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel from coast to coast with a knife in his person. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the public of the mid-1980s found this movie charming and funny. Mid 80's, know the delays: only you can live.
