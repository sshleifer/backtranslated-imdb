How could such a terrible script have attracted this cast? Ridiculous, predictable and completely unbelievable, this is well-intentioned and well-directed, but the material is so bad it still qualifies as one of the worst movies of all time I've seen in years. Surprisingly bad, and not in a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the cast.
