There are no fireworks despite violent action. Science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce, largely because the transposition of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and unfortunately for its producers, this work is lacking in both cases, regrettably so in the case of the latter. With virtually no budget to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt to describe a range of events such as those within this scenario and in particular the special effects of the space opera war that appear just as clowns, while the writers' seeds lie to some of the foolish misunderstandings of the basic scientific principles to be found. These include the frequent firing of weapons within a closed environment and a law of gravity that allows cast members' freedom of movement while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept them than pretend that either episodes a basis in plausibility. The plot involves a life escape convicted prisoners from a penal colony from the space station to a waste landfill on our moon and their various attempts to get the passage back to earth with a few capable players present who are execrably driven by the first timer Paolo Mazzucato, whose production team squanders efforts like holographic pornography, ignoring a basic and urgent requirement for creating states of suspense and momentum. <br /> <br />
