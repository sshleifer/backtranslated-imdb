A group of kids set up a theater for a marathon of horror movies that lasted all night. However, as the night progresses, there is someone among them killing them one by one. Who is it and why? I saw this in a theater in 1991. I was looking forward to it - but boy! It did not work at all. The premise is good, they have a very attractive young cast and some professionals like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it does not work. The story fails to make sense in the middle (which may be because of a huge issue before the movie is released), the murders are relatively bloodless (as this has an R rating is beyond me) and the assassin's unmasking at the end it was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's too bad - this movie had potential. With a better script, this could become a great horror movie. However, most are forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed (I heard Stone not talking about it). I give a 3 and that's just for the cast.
