I debated whether or not to tick the spoiler box. Since 99% of this program has probably been seen by any follower of Scrubs, it probably is not in the category of a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Clip shows. Grrr We all knew Friends was going on the subway when they started with clip shows ... and five and a half years in Scrubs they went and fell into that hole. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if the writers just could not bother writing that week and just said to themselves, "Let's show the other funny things." Did not work. <br /> <br /> To begin with, showing every time people fall is not funny when out of context. It's not funny to see Todd hanging on his banana net, unless we know why he was hanging on his banana net. <br /> <br /> Second, for what should be a compilation of JD's fantasies, one was Turk's dream. another was not his fantasy, though I forget which. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is totally forgettable. We've seen all these things before. And the collection of clips of people dancing? Because? This is not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must admit that two of my favorite moments of Scrubs were shown in the last compilation ... Dr. Cox realizing that Ben died ... and JD telling him how proud he is. <br /> <br /> But even seeing those moments again, did not save the episode. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> The worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE, do not let your show be the same as the Friends, keep it cool, keep it funny ... or wrap it up.
