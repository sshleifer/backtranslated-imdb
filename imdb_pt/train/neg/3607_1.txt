I'm starting this comment with a big giant spoiler about this movie. Do not read any more ... here it comes, look away! The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other horror movies, is murdered here. There, I just saved you 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those cheap movies that were played together in the middle of the 80s era. Despite killing heroin, this is just trash below standard. <br /> <br /> Both priests and college students get a bad rap here. They are portrayed as oversexed sociopathic idiots who have many internal problems in dealing with what appears to be life on the college campus ... and college students do even worse. "Splatter University" is just goofy put on your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest you watch your head cleaning tape, this would be more fun. <br /> <br /> This is evaluated (R) for strong physical violence, profanity, very brief female nudity and sexual references. <br /> <br />
