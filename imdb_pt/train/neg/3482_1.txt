So I know I voted 1 out of 10, but really that does not deserve more than half a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unreal, I can not believe that none of the stars signed to make this project ridiculously absurd. James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent at their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were also very good, but the story sucked and I encourage anyone who sees it in the video store not to. bother to pick up and read the back cover, but just walk away ... I do not even want to get into what the movie is about, because it's too stupid to pontificate. <br /> <br /> Do not rent it! It's awful! Horrible!
