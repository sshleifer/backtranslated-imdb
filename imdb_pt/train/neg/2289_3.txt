Unfortunately, Marry Harron decided to make a fictional account of Bettie Page's life to go along with her own problems with men. As is typical throughout their work, all male characters are portrayed as weak, clumsy or distorted. To add to her fiction, she projects ideas and problems that are not true, according to Bettie Page herself. Bettie did not quit because she thought she was morally wrong or had religious issues (although she was born again later in life through the influence of her third husband - a minister). She left because she was in her late 30s, her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks. The insinuations of sexual abuse and rape are invalidated and denied in Bettie's own words and are the director's attempts to argue that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots (not delivered to her by "sick" fetishists). Harron also makes no point to say that Bunny Yeager, who made many famous photos of Bettie, also made many "naughty" photos with Bettie and was not the morally correct professional photographer portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks a lot like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other films and documentaries more accurate and honest for your life and for the people who compose it.
