Where to start. The movie started really well but after the 30 min mark I caught myself watching the clock. The horror at the beginning of the movie was good, but then the story began. It got stupid and stupid over time. <br /> <br /> The actors gave a medium performance in this film. Little bit bored of Vinny Jones constant frowning in the movie. <br /> <br /> As the movie crawled, and took my word for it, if it crawled, it just got further and further away. <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the movie could not get worse, for the end loads if skeletons looking for monsters appear , only to eat the dead people which made no sense at all. It ended up being a kind of meat cult and the good died in the end. The ending, in fact, only made me laugh at how bad it was. Once the lead role rules out Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie made Creep look like the best horror movie ever made. I gave it a star because the female lead did a good job, but even she could not save this disaster from a movie !!
