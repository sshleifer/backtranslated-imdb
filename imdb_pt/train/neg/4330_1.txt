Last night I decided to watch the prequel or should I say the so-called prequel to Carlito's Way - "Carlito Way: Rise to Power (2005)" which went straight to DVD ... no wonder ..... completely .. .and I mean completely S% e KS !!! Waiting for watching time and I think it would be a sheer waist of time writing about it ... I do not understand how De Palma agreed to produce this sh # t-fest from a movie .... except for just one fact that I shot my hat to ... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante ... reminded me how De Niro dressed as Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but the difference De Niro It was incredible and I still have one Oscar for this !!! Jay Hernandez well he has the guts to try to be a young Pacino .... too bad for him I do not think he'll be playing in the movie anymore and by the way after I watched this movie sh # $% ty, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
