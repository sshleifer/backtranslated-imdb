This movie has many problems associated with it, which makes it look like a low budget class project from someone at film school. I have to give credit on your camping though. Many times throughout the movie I found myself laughing hysterically. It was so bad at times that it was comical, which made it a fun watch. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a low-level movie with a touch of psychological horror and a hint of ridicule, then pop a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends and have fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. The dialogue is almost impossible to follow most of the time and the soundtrack is there.
