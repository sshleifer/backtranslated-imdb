So let me start by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain. I was really bored on a beautiful day in 1997 and then cycled to the movie store. I asked the clerk what the worst film he had in stock. Without hesitation, he accompanied me to "Lucky Stiff". He told me he would waive the $ 1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if I promised to watch the entire movie. So watch it, I did it for free ... This movie is terrible. God-terrible indeed. I do not need to go into plot details, read the other reviews. Jokes make no sense. The acting was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting. You may try to see it as something to laugh at, but it's so bad that it's not funny that way. Avoid!
