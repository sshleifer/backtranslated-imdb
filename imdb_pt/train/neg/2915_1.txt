It's a bad movie, it looks like there are only 5 policemen in HK, they were not using the gun and it makes me feel like the Jacky Chan movie. All the while they were using the gun to point only to the suspect. When they finally use their gun is when they kill each other, what a funny movie. In the movie, it's as if all the good guys died for no reason. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie is also terrible, the story jumps back and forth and annoys people. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, I think this is just some kind of cool movie, I think zombie movie made in the USA is bloody hotter than this
