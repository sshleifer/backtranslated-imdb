I had recently been watching Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor in him. I failed horribly. Cartoon Network generally has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable for all audiences, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" at its lowest form. The writing is incredibly predictable, and the running jokes are not much of a joke. Kids will love it, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Now, that does not mean that everything is bad. The original opening theme was actually quite captivating, but for some reason they took his skeleton and broke it figuratively with a figurative aluminum stick. It's a shame because this was really one of the best things to do. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters can be very interesting in theory. With a little work, the characters can work well together, but they are very one-dimensional. Then again, this makes it easier for the kids to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is also a bit too fast. The episodes are very busy, leaving little time for intelligent writing. This is a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the program brings. On the plus side, however, the fast pace will prevent children from losing interest, and that's really the whole audience. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show looks pretty good on paper, but it does not work. succeed in being funny or interesting. This is a show I want to like, but I'm incapable of it. There is so much potential that is not realized. Kids will have fun, but that's all.
