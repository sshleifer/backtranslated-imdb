I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another of her movies, so when I saw the Protocol for $ 5.50 at Walmart I bought it. Although it's slightly fun, the film never takes a step forward. Some scenes, like a party scene in a bar, last a long time and really have no purpose. <br /> <br /> So, of course, there's the preaching scene at the end of the movie that gives the whole picture a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I do not think this scene was added to the movie. I do not like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written for a few years 60 burn especially! <br /> <br /> In the end, although I'm glad to own another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was worth the money I paid for it!
