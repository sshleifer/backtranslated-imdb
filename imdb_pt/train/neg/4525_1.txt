Some nice scenery, but the story itself - in which a self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and, in the course of making Egyptologists, the most anti-Egyptological things (eg flash photography in the tombs, of ancient parchment, etc.), reveals a black market war and somehow (in the space of two days, no less!) becomes the epicenter of the war jumpsuit - it is more intriguing than any enigma that the Sphinx has done . Down is simply horrible as the visiting British scholar (she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt and even less about antiquities is the writers' fault, certainly; but that she is annoying since all leave because of her fault) and the rest of the cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seems as confused with the suit as I do. In short, it's not what you'd expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and company. It pays to watch a ridiculously dated scene in which Down trembles against all male scholars, blaming them for her failure as an academic, as she bathed in the softer light that Hollywood could muster. To complete, she spends the next hour of the movie screaming and running and running into the arms of any face she may encounter. Wow, talk about your performative irony! <br /> <br /> * Note to would-be Egyptologists: take a year or two of Arabic in college. This will really help in the long run ...
