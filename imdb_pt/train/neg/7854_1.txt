wow this is the worst movie of all time. The only reason I signed up for IMDb was so I could complain about that movie. I never left a theater or stopped a DVD, but I almost stopped this (and I should have). but I watched it all the way to the end only to disappoint me again with an absolutely terrible ending. wow, if that's all that wes craven can produce your time is over. I've never seen the first one and never after watching it. his terrible performance with a terrible plot. Hey look somebody is shining in a mirror for us let's take a look. and the sad part is that when this movie was released on DVD, the film was completely in the blockbuster forever. so I feel bad for all the people who saw this crap.
