My first question after watching this movie was: "Why the title LIAM?" If the intention was to tell a story from the boy's point of view, it was not well executed. Of course there was the stereotyped use of camera angles in the boy's scenes, but much of the crucial action occurred outside his field of vision. Having a "main" character unable to speak (obviously suggesting the mute and helpless position of a child) makes it difficult to give depth to this character. <br /> <br /> The melodrama is defined as: "dramatic or other literary works". characterized by the use of stereotyped characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality and conflict. "LIAM fits this definition for a T. The spectator is hit in the head with typical stereotypes of fire and sulfur Catholic church in the severe school marm and the priest well fed by squeezing money from parishioners (a stereotype that is becoming very tiring.) And more: the Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners! Much of the film was predictable ... Who did not think we had to see Theresa rubbing the toilet after her mother told her "No daughter of mine is going to rub another woman's bathroom!" I am a fan of British realism if it is well done. <br />
