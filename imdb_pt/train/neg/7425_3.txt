This Las Vegas casino robbery movie, tiring and cumbersome, almost impossible to watch and get involved with. It's something that you "look" at if you have absolutely nothing better to do. The only two decent things in this movie are both linked to the beautiful Stella Stevens and one passes the whole program in the hope that it falls from one of those tops that she uses. Lots of great 1970s photos in Las Vegas (when it was still a cool place to visit) and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well. Otherwise a big yawn. The Rhino DVD has a very good widescreen transfer, but even at less than $ 10, it's still not worth it in my humble opinion.
