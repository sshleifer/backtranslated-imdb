Normally, I'm willing to like low budget gonzo movies, but Darkman III is so unpleasant that I feel nothing but contempt for it. <br /> <br /> It looks and looks like a TV show, and particularly one in that. Scenarios are sparse, lighting is flat, scores and effects are disjointed, and camera work is film school 101. There is no plot to speak, the characters are one-dimensional and the actors are sleepwalkers. Most of the cast looks like they should be doing soft core porn ..... In fact, the only reward I got from this mess was spotting the amazing strabismus faced Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) without her Klingon rugged head makeup. Its skin tone is about two shades lighter than in Voyager; or she was discolored to that paper or blackened to Voyager. Very odd anyway.
