This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I rented this as a joke, expecting to chuckle in the first scenes, and let me just say that I never laughed so much in my life. The first scene where the ninjas randomly appear on the air and start a huge and ridiculous firefight is one of the most incredibly funny action movie moments of my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but another film that makes fun of (and does not mean anything) the action genre. I did not see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I do not think I have much that I missed. If you want to see a movie that fits nicely with a six pack or any herbal remedy, then I insist that you rent that movie, sit back and watch the 100 years of progress in the movies being thrown in the trash and being destroyed by the carnosours
