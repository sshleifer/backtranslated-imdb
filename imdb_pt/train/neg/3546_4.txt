Spoilers ahead - proceed with your own caution. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers - with relative ease - he continues to yield to his demands. And then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to turn on his classic car to explode (with money in it), which makes us take a very high leap of logic. <br /> <br /> Okay, so he wanted to keep his affair with Cini out of the public eye because of his wife's involvement with the DA campaign. This I can see, but why not hire someone to slap these little critters, or even kill them after he has determined that there was no evidence of blackmail (for example, Cini's body?) This was a very interesting film for the first 2/3 of that. After that, it kind of collapses.
