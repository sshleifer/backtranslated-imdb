This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Despite presenting good actors, the film does not live up to expectations. The most dramatic thing about this film is the music, which sums up the film very well: compensating for a bad and confusing plot by having known actors, loud and dramatic music. That does not change the fact that this is a very annoying movie to watch. Earned a rating of 1.
