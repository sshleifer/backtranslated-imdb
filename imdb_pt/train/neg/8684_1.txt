Abysmal with a capital "A". This has to be one of, if not the most unusual show on TV now. I'm as anti-bush as possible, but this show does not even give me a laugh. What you think of Bush as president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you like this piece of crap. The "jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene where lil bush has his underwear on his head: "Welcome to the al-qa-eeda camp!". There's nothing funny about it. Is it supposed to be a joke? The commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show were funnier than the show itself, and that's just sad. Hopefully this will not even be considered for a second season. Nor should have had a first.
