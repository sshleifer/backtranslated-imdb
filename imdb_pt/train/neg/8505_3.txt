"Holy Week" or "Angel of Death" is a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows at people. Mira has an Italian accent that fails from time to time. Could not she speak English? All other characters have a Mexican / English accent that distracts. The dialogue is very bad and the delivery is made of wood. Cinematography looks good, but that's not enough to save that gut. THE NEXT PART OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> During the climax, it looks like the villain will run away, but then he goes down the stairs to get shot and do a cool maneuver on the railing. This only shows that this script has no originality whatsoever. AVOID!
