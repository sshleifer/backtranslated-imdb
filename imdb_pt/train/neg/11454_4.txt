So, I had low expectations for this movie, but it failed to satisfy even those. while there were some funny parts, even one or two loud laughs, this movie fell far short of what I would call good. the funniest jokes were unexpected and very quick, leaving us sitting there "WTF just happened?" besides, there were some jokes that just crawled on and on. the part where he falls from the mountain made me yawn. also, the issue was really missing. there have been some poor scene transitions, but that seems to be the style nowadays. It made me laugh, but I would not watch it again, and I'm so glad I waited for it to rent. give it a try, you may like it, but do not think you're into something along the lines of the 40-year-old virgin or Superbad.
