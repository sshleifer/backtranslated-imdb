I'm a big fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I like Stephen King less, but I like some of his work. <br /> <br /> That being said, I should have LOVED 1408. <br /> <br /> *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I entered anxiously. I left disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is not the actors' fault. Shalhoub and Jackson have very small roles because the premise of the film puts Cusack in the scenario "face in a locked room". <br /> <br /> This was not a bad movie, but I can not call it a good one either. It was a muddy mess that had moments of "oh, that's wrong," combined with moments of "oh, that's just painful," and moments of "oh, now that's just unhappy" with very little connectivity of continuity between them. Eislin's father appears once, and there is no apparent connection to the rest of Mike's personal life we ​​see when he tries to survive the room. <br /> <br /> An earlier commentator described Olin / Enslin's argument as worthy of being noted, and I very much agree. But besides that, plus some clever musical clues (the room almost haunts Enslin a little, and gives him a chance to get out before he raises the bet ... and at that point he gives him the one-hour countdown and the line "We Only Only Begun" is mostly "things that bounce when you least expect it!" kind of terror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my age, grabbing one to the other in the summer while Jason chased Camp Crystal Lake. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was "let's revive some of his most painful experiences" mindgaming, with "let's liven up the paintings in scary ways" cheese cliché. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I expected better from this movie with the name of Stephen King attached to it as well as the actors I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> We never discovered the origin of evil. although we may presume that he may have been defeated. <br /> <br /> And the end was just a shocking "What?!" time. <br /> <br /> Wait for him to come on the cable. I would not have minded paying for it as a matinee, but I'm feeling a little bad for having paid opening night prices for this.
