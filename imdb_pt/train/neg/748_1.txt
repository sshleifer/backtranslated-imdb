I love movies and I watch any movie, just to give it a try. Finally I can say that I found a movie that I can not watch all the time. The acting is terribly obsolete and monotonous, the CGI looks like a computer nerd did it in his mother's basement with minimal software, and ..... the long scenes of just ... walking !!!! And this movie has THREE LONG HOURS !!! I did not even do it 15 minutes until I quickly uploaded the DVD. The scenes with the aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "War of the Worlds", let's call it "War of Long Distances". That cost 5 million dollars to do! What do they spend the money on, the dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> Oh, but on a positive note, one scene you need to watch is when the aliens start killing people. This is hilarious, not because people are dying, but because when they turn into skeletons, they still squirm for 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> So ... like I said, if you're a fan of boring stuff, obsolete movies, no action, here is one for you DVD collection. But I did not write this for you, I wrote this to billions and billions of other people who hate this movie. Not worth your time or money <br /> <br /> I know this is by the book, but the book is not so long, and I am a complete worm / nerd / geek / whatever book, but why ? Just get the Steven Spielberg version, it's not that good, but it's 10 times better than that !! <br /> <br /> I give this a BIG, FAT ZERO of 10.
