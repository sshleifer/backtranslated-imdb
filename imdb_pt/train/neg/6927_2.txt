Although I rated this movie as a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in attempting to create a quality horror movie, it was a 10 on the unintended funny scale. I could not figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were, but I did not care because I knew that every scene would have something to make me laugh. The dialogue is minimal throughout the movie, but I believe it is because they started filming without a screenplay. The fact that there is no plot makes the film extremely versatile. It does not matter if you sit and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in a setback, it will be confused with fun. I particularly like the scene where the inmates are taking turns running outside smacking each other with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment. Genius!
