This is the most saccharine romance I've ever had. The perfect movie for an idle housewife in scarf, housedress and high heeled mules, trimmed with ostriches, to watch the afternoon, lying on the sofa eating bonbons. In fact, the candies play a prominent role in the film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could watch until the end, is that I finally got to look at the dreamy face of Keanu Reeves in almost every scene. . In most of his films, he moves too fast to take a good look. The only quick action on this show is Giancarlo Giannini shaking hands with the Latin emotivity - more Italian than Mexican, actually. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is as hard as wood. Unfortunately, no bodice is torn - the hero is shamefully perfect and gentle. The clich√© of the aristocratic hot-blooded old world family is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> I knew, before the titles ended, that this would not be the movie I expected. The bright grapes looked like the template for all the food ads in Women's Day. I did not see his name listed, but the art director was certainly Thomas Kinkade, who paints the million dollar canvases of Irish cabins nestled in fuchsia. This movie was literally seen through pink glasses. If you like the dreamy pink and blue sky, this movie is for you! (The chocolates looked very good too!)
