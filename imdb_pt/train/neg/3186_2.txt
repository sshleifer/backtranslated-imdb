I do not think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make a movie as bad as his stinky 'Mitchell', but this is a success. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this if you are a fan of Joe Don Baker much better work. But if you like watching fat guys sweat and really, really drew gun fights, you'll love this movie.
