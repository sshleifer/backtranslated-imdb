I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins' books so I was very excited and interested in seeing a movie made after one of his books. I knew there would be no way for the film to capture half of Robbins' magic, but after watching the movie, I never wanted to read the book again. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does not include an eighth of the book's content, and seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot in the film, I think the best actors could definitely have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought fit the descriptions of Robbins in the book were Julian's friends in his five-minute clip at the beginning of the movie. Those who have not read the book may like the movie, but as a big fan of Tom Robbins, this movie was just a disappointment.
