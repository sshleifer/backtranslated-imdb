This movie was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I admit the contrary opinion of the critics. This is not a case of the material not being at the level of the actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) simply do not measure up to the material level. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were as big as Davis and Cagney, and see how One Night Has Happened - a classic of all time. With a very similar story, Davis proves she has no talent for comedy (good thing to her that this is just the only comedy she has ever tried!) The performance of a Davis note emanates petulance but none of the nuances of acting Colbert At Night Happened. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, seems out of sync with his colleague, Davis. The script provides some decent lines and jokes, but delivery seems more suited to drama than to comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the rendition of Davis and Cagney, seems more suited to light drama than a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who performed similar roles throughout his career, dealt more competently with very similar material. In a rather typical supporting role, Eugene Palette offers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role as an ancient Western relic, Harry Davenport, is very good. But in one of his poorer performances, William Frawley is quite annoying. The constant references of his character to the fictitious cops are a weak effort for irony. <br /> <br /> I really love each of these artists, and it's a shame that as a set, they get no more chemistry and no better outcome than The Bride Came C.O.D.
