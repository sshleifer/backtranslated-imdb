Just because an event actually happened does not mean that it will make a good screenplay / movie. Peter Bogdanovich's Cat Miau claims to be based on actual events that took place on a cruise organized by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than having the time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit. The main moments of history seem implausible; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing him to be Chaplin. Basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is banal and artificial. The story tries to be a somber comedy, but Meow's cat loses an important part of this equation, comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. No matter who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is not a strong character to cheer. As a result, conflicts are difficult to worry about and the end result is incidental.
