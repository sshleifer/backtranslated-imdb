What an apology for the movie New Zealnd. I am ashamed to call myself New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand's satellite TV (August 2006). The cast consists of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and still has the company logo (a dolphin) throughout the whole, including the funnel of the ship. The ship must be a cruise ship / ferry between the US and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place is still supposed to be a luxury ship on its maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South Island in the background for the love of God! It must have been a very cold weather in the US / Mexico area! The story is weak, the acting is weaker and the New Zealand / American accents simply do not work. I hope New Zealand's tax payer has contributed to the cost of producing this film and that it was a waste of better money spent on actual production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. Goofy: There's a truck in the basement with a tag and they put a Taco Company sign on the truck door, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the signs are at the top of the markup - you think they would have noticed this in the props department before attaching it. I would love to continue, but this is not worth it in any way.
