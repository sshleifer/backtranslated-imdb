The Deadly Wake is THE PERFECT MOVIE for film students ... to learn how NOT to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what did the team mess up about in this movie? Worst Mix of Music Worst Edition Worst Screen Worst Screen Worst Screenplay Worst Screenplay Worst Screenplay Worst Screenplay Worst Screenplay Worst Screenplay Worst Screenplay Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting Worst Screenwriting .. still would have been awful. All the scenes are dark (people call it "black"), often the score drowned the sinuous dialogues, which was OK because no one spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect. The "evil" robot was hilarious ... what was that? Jazz dance? Oh ... I think I should be walking tactically or something. I'm sure this has caused fear in the hearts ... of the poor editors. And how do you edit so much trash material? It's not possible. Trash is trash, no matter how you mend it. How did someone get this with the dailys ??? <br /> <br /> The result is that- I could not stand to watch segments of 15 minutes, it was so bad ... but I saw the whole thing (with lotsa breaks) just to see if there was any good part in all this. NOT! NONE! <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how not to make a movie ... a must-see for ALL students of serious movies !!!
