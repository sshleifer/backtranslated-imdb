Writer Lisa Lutz began writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991. <br /> <br /> Is she really in the market? If someone gave you another chance after this piece of crap, she's ready for the Happiest Ever Prize ever. This movie sucks to the end ... It never ceases to amaze me what to turn into movies ... and the fact that they made this writer put off for a while? Seriously? I can write better crap than that in my sleep. <br /> <br /> OK, how many lines do I have to type? I do not understand this. I think I'm a newbie. I do not think I understand why there should be a limit to what someone has to say ... or a quota? Seriously, I do not care if you have a one word sentence. Or even a one-word answer, I mean, let's go? Thank you ... is that enough, finally? <br /> <br /> This movie is useless.
