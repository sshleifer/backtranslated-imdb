The premise and the subject of getting a criminal to realize what his victims have spent capturing his family as a hostage sounds promising and interesting. But this is the only interesting part that was treated very gently 20 years ago by director Ravi Tandon in his movie "Jawab" (1985) as well. The problem here is that Ace Director Rajkumar Santoshi has been in some kind of confusion about whether to make it a fast action thriller (Khakee) or a heavy and emotional drama (Viz Damini) and this confusion is quite evident in the final result.If we ignore two of his Pukar (2000) and Lajja (2001) , this brilliant director has always given us captivating films with high entertainment value, so this movie comes as a surprise, about what made this sensitive director of script make a partial characterization of their protagonists - Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman When the film is recovering, the public did not know who to hate and who to sympathize with, and this factor is the main limiting force in the complete narration, so what begins as a war between a common man and a m as a tragic note of self-realization and repentance by the Don about what went wrong with his own family. The revelation of Don's son as a true villain does not come as a surprise element at the climax which, compared to a similar situation in 'Khakee', worked so effectively with the character of Aishwarya, that is not all, there is more to it . The life of a Don Underworld, operating from the outside, seems completely illogical, and his openly landing in Mumbai from where he must flee, chase after his enemies and shoot them personally does not seem believable. as Aryeman opposite Bachchan is not a good idea, but even so the film has some good points: the good camera work of Ashok Mehta, two good fight sequences (coordinator Abbas Ali Moughal), some well-lit scenes of Akshay Kumar in first half, the quick and agile treatment of Santoshi and of course Mr. Bachchan as usual, striving to give a little life to his lifeless character, but all this does not make this vision an exciting experience. you and your family!
