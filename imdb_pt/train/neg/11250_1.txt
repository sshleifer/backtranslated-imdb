I like the time period, I like the attempt, but watch a movie that looks like I'm looking at it through a bottle of Coca-Cola gives me headache. If I played unfocused and out-of-focus computer games, I would update my computer. It could be that this was the look that the director sought, but not so much it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I had not taken someone with me to this movie, I was out of there. Even if it was a series and not a movie by word, Band of Brothers did it. They made it look like a WWII scene with just a touch of grain, but it was still a pleasure to watch. Movies need real people, with real scenes and real locations; Use CGI when appropriate, not for an entire movie.
