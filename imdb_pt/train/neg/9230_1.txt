I should qualify for this title now that I think about it. The checkout is not totally useless. I had the opportunity to see him twice, and the second time I had a great laugh at the expense of the movie. so I think it's worth something for that. and also worth it for the excruciating pain that this caused me in my first consultation. as another critic pointed out, this movie is banal in every sense of the word. not a single original thought entered into this film (which makes the comment below on the originality of the premise entirely disconcerting to me). the film is nothing more than a long line of cliches that are tied together and displayed as a movie. definitely not the next Clerks, definitely not original, and absolutely not "good, clean fun." the film is an absolute agony for the uninitiated (after seeing it for the first time, the second time can be quite funny, in an insulting way). As I looked around the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, except maybe the elderly, were completely bored or suffering from this movie. During some particularly emotional scenes, such as when Nick chews on his mother, the audience was cowering because it was badly made. I even heard someone moaning in the theater, something I had never seen before. I do not care where you get the chance to see this movie, whether at a film festival, or in an independent theater, or wherever. do yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you're like me and just do not resist the opportunity to see what might actually be the worst film ever made.
