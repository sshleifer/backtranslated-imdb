I like movies by the end of the day. I like B movies. I was hoping that I would like this movie. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the inducing lines. I could ignore the inexplicable events, and the fact that the film constantly depends on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject. I could ignore the fact that the people who fight against hunger and try to achieve world peace are the bad guys. None of these things kills the movie. What kills this movie is that it is simply boring and simple. Nothing really happens; almost every scene in the movie is designed to push the morale of filmmakers to viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a fun B movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just annoying.
