I'm a big Stooges fan, but the only and only quality this movie has is that Curley is in it. Made long before he starts drinking too much, he's his classic me in that (and Larry is not bad either). The character of Moe is a straight part (mostly) and this movie would be better called "The Curley and Larry Movie". Not that any of the Stooges films were very good (in my opinion), but as one commentator said here, how sad that this film has real potential. The cast was good, well directed, filmed and edited, but the plot tried to be serious with just a few antics and musical numbers (which I think were good at the time). The Best Thing You Can Do Do it for yourself during this movie if you really believe it has to be better than mowing and taking out the trash (which is subject to debate) is to wait for the Curley / Larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat. during the rest.
