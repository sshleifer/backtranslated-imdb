What exactly was going on during World War II in New Zealand when American forces were there? <br /> <br /> This terrible story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to see. Can you imagine Joan Fontaine's choice as Sandra Dee's older sister? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even more funny was Fontaine getting pregnant in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who showed such great chemistry onscreen four years later in "The Hustler," have no scenes together in this movie. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to stroll there, despite the fact that she is married. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is a widower and finds romance with Paul Newman. There's even romance for the young Miss Dee here. <br /> <br /> The image has little or no meaning. Are they trying to say that everything is fair in love and war? If they are, they have done a poor job at selling this. <br /> <br /> Conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly eliminated. That is what should have been done quickly for this terribly disappointing 1957 film.
