I do not really like this movie. If you have read the Puzo books, or at least watched the first two movies very closely (especially the first one), you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared with the saga of Corleone presented by Puzo's novel, the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships between them are distorted. The story ends up getting nowhere, though it seems to go some way during the film. <br /> <br /> It is understandable that different times are expected for the Corleone saga in the 90s, and that we would not go Find things as they were before. But on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other films, in contexts where they did not fit. Why that? It seems that these poorly made sequences try to copy the qualities of the original film. <br /> <br /> What will never be understandable is that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have come together to do this. A man who has directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost everything he does in the movies until he dies. The same happens with Al Pacino, for being the actor that he is. But Mario Puzo should not have written that. Because? He damaged all his previous work. What a pity, my friend. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 1990s story about the Mafia, and it's great. We can never say the same about the plot for Godfather III.
