This is the kind of movie I most fear. Arrogant and irresponsible, he presents an outline of the Colombian conflict so clichéd and stupid that it insults the entire Colombian people. The performances are wonderful, from Grisales (his naked scene is absolutely pitiful), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (that seems to leave of a nightmare of Tim Burton), to Diaz, that makes a remarkable effort to bring life to a three-dimensional personage, so clichéd and so poorly written, all he left to work on is a mustache. Not to mention the free end, such a cheesy bash that would make Ed Wood cringe. He fails in all aspects, cinematographic direction, art direction, costumes, makeup, editing and, above all, direction, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a bad filmmaker, but at least his previous films had some dignity. I can not say anything good about this waste of money except that I expect Colombian filmmakers to learn a lesson about honesty, integrity and responsibility from this intended fiasco.
