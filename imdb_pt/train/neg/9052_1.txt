I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, compared to the ingenious, hilarious, hilarious and groundbreaking classic of Robert Altman's 1970s cinema, this show was probably meant to be less than mediocre ... even if it lasted 11 years, this does not necessarily do any good. This show formed a wholly integral part of my early childhood (it was in re-runs every night, and I think parents were watching and laughing), but it's one of the memories I do not miss. And now that I've actually seen the movie, I can give this series an accurate critique. By itself, it's not nearly "2 out of 10" bad. However, the characters in this program are not like the characters in the movie. Some of them technically are the same, but are similar in name. For example, since when Alan Alda is similar to Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as is his characterization and perspective. The new characters are not so good; they serve only to make you lose the ones you are replacing. It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that really transfers to the series is Radar, who is still (though interpreted by the same actor) merely a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh yeah. With a laughing clue (no matter if it was used in surgery scenes or not), it looks scary, due to what is happening in the other settings. And because it lasted nearly four times longer than the Korean War, it takes viewers to this bizarre time separation that does not work outside the cartoon world. I never liked this show, and I'll never like it.
