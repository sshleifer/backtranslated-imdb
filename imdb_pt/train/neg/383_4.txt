The plot of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject is of much interest. But watching this movie, we were saying out loud: "These filmmakers go out of their way to find good places, good lighting, make-up and hair are good ... why is the sound so bad?" Throughout the film, the sound was echoed, distorted and much of the dialogue was unintelligible. <br /> <br /> There is a good performance in this film, and I think Jim Thalman is a really good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would be worth doing as a high-budget film. <br /> <br /> I can not reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more to a good sound. Sound is as much part of a movie as the picture and it's worth doing the right thing. I could have won a 6.
