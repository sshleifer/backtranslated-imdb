The worst kind of movie. Basically, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced by a plasma screen and this misled the safety of the museum for several days. Eh? The plasma screen would theoretically work for less than 2 seconds off the watch's battery, assuming it had an internal resistance low enough to provide the required current, which would not happen. <BR> It would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter, but this system would not fit in the cabinet. Sorry to be anal, but that's not even close to being plausible. The rest of the film was not much better and I wonder why the budget could not have been donated to charity or to me.
