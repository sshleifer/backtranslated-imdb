I was not a fan of the 2005 hit "Hostel," and most of those jerks are so bad or worse - even though "Live Feed" has kept me entertained for about 30 years. minutes. It started with a lot of sex and despicable set-ups, followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinese Crime Organized Squad and a 7-foot butcher with a leather apron ... What got me out of the movie was the difficult 'hero' with the Weapons and a grudge saving the day ... I would say that this movie is mediocre, at best, since a premise involving mostly obnoxious young people being massacred in obscure porn, being a hiding place for the mob, is attractive for me. If only the torture were long enough to be completely effective, my classification would have been very different. Unfortunately, most of the horror is brought together in one scene, leaving the rest of the film complete as a revenge scenario. So basically it's just a low budget hostel with the redeeming use of free, almost constant sex during the first half of the movie ... Overall, I'd say do not bother with this one.
