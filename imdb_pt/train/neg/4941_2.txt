I really did not mind the commercials of Geico the first 50 of so long I saw them and even found them to be a little crooked and fun, BUT SERIOUSLY! Is this the best thing these people could invent?!? This show sucks! It's bland and seems to watch an episode of "The Office" with the characters disguised as cavemen (I know many of you will hate me for saying this, but "The Office" just does not do it for me). Okay, I got it: we got the poor guy trying to keep his nose clean and he has a low quality boss who hates him; the pseudo-intellectual who really only has an intellect that barely works; and the dope that just wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT !!! I worked with these people and found them as annoying in real life as on TV ... why would I want to waste another week of my week watching more of these types of nominees?!? Please call your parents and ask if they let you fall on their heads if after thinking about it, you still delude believing this is entertainment.
