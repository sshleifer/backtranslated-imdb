I found it a real chore to sit through this movie. The soundtrack was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. There was little to move the plot and often the action simply stopped and there was an extended period of conversations that seemed strange to the movie. These conversations changed among family groups and the observer was left to try to piece together what was the common thread that bound them together. It's rare for me to rate a film so low and do it in this case, since the whole viewing experience left me thinking "and then" and "why I wasted my time watching it."
