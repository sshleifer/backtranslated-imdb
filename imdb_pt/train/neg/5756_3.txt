This must be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers. Mike Nichols driving. Uh. It's dull dull! Useless and predictable! Slow and unfocused! <br /> <br /> It's a cookie cutter 'boy meets girl, boy house girl, boy has case, girl lets boy' story. Now there is an original concept! After squirming for two hours (were they only two? It looked like six). I was not sure if it was a comedy, a novel, a tragedy or a novel. This was done in 1986. I'm sure we've all done things sixteen years ago that we'd rather forget. I hope the damage to Streep et al's reputation is beginning to heal and that the master's emulsion is beginning to disappear. It's not that it's such a bad image. It's just that it's so bad.
