Young and attractive Japanese are getting on the wrong side of some curse again, this time involves cell phones. Several people die until the disgruntled spirit behind all this is discovered, so essentially if you've seen more than two recent Japanese horror movies, you can plot this movie in the dark with your hands tied. <br /> <br /> The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I've been more impressed with his low-key workings like City of Lost Souls, however, as One Missed Call crawled, I was yearning for its most famous envelope, pushing Dead or Alive or the overly pseudo-Cronenberg from Audition. Although many of his films are essentially empty, at least they have merits like these, or at least something to keep their attention as Tadanobu Asano prancing in bright costumes by impersonating Johnny Depp. There is none of this in One Missed Call; there is little credit: the acting is insipid and medium, there is very little (nothing, in all honesty) in the form of suspense or suspense, and in some places it is simply boring. <br /> <br /> There are times when Miike's sense of glacial humor infiltrates tasteless commercialism; most notably with the example of the TV show intent on filming the death of one of the cursed guys, and the TV programmer more concerned with his ratings than with the girls' lives. But in addition, there is nothing to suggest that Miike be behind the camera; most notably his usual visual style has disappeared without a trace (and this includes his famous blood), although it is more likely that he simply has no enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. A missed call is not offensively bad. It's just frustratingly average. <br /> <br /> Miike obviously loves to drive. With its huge annual output, it is obvious that he will not be 100% concerned about all his projects. But even with that in mind, One Missed Call felt like it was just paying the bills.
