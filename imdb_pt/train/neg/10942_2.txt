Lorenzo Lamas stars as Jack `Solider` Kelly a former Vietnam veteran and a renegade police officer who goes on a search and destruction mission to save his backwoods sister from the hinterland. An outrageous movie is so cheap and so bad that Ron Palillo is third and still has 3 minutes of screen time, and even those are not good. Overall, a terrible movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a bagged and grizzled tree are worth a few (unintentional) laughs. Followed by an improved sequel.
