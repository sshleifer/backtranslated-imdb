I am a big fan of war films and as a combat veteran in Vietnam I have some experience with technical details. I've worked with the guys at the pump more than once and I have nothing but respect for them. Other vets and veterans of Iraq in particular summed up the film's inaccuracies very well. The poetic license is one thing, but this film is a complete fantasy and fails a lot because of it. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units value compliance and discipline for one reason: it saves lives. The opening scene particularly bothered me. The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. Yelling "Stop dialing" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The scenes with the sniper were particularly notorious. As others have noted, your average EOD guy does not know how to be a sniper, and thinking that any Arab shooter is so good really stretches the imagination. Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge simply would not happen. Someone can shoot him, but that kind of risk is limited to movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others pointed out these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if you win a prize, it's an additional reflection of why "La La Land" has that name.
