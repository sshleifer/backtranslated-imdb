I am the kind of person who always goes to the horror section when I am choosing a movie, so I chose five through the eyes, I was disgusted with this movie and thought that there was no plot and no point that you could like, it made my skin creep to think that people like to watch movies that only encourage violence, so it was low budget and a lot of crap! I think I could have done better myself. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and you should not bother watching, the actors were silly, the camera was horrible, the image was bad and the sound was not up to par, I think it was a bit bit like a rip scratch off the baler that design and did not work at all was dirty.
