The guy did a lot of title design for a lot of movies and I think one day he said; I should choose a cheap scenario, try to put as much title as possible (because after all I'm a title designer) and try to convince people that this is actually a movie. One of the worst I've seen, for sure. If you feel the desire to see good titles, check out some posters, do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br /> It's kind of ironic, do not you think, saw the poster? The only part of your project that should have made the title work has almost none!
