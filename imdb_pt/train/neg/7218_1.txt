There is a scene near the beginning after a shooting where the horses are running. If something red catches your eye is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail. I thought I'd seen it wrong, but that's it. A white van in a western. Did not they catch that? Oh well, and I paid more money on rent. It will make you want to get your friends and get them to put 10,000 and make a better movie. The conversation was so slow, the performance was good, but it could not be taken seriously because of the poor nature of the footage. There is a door in the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the special cut. I say watch this movie, and move the Cabin Boy to second place in the worst of all time.
