Although I heard the film was a little dry, I see whatever Scott Bakula is. At the beginning of this movie, I had high hopes for the classic and entertaining end of Scott-get-girl and up to 20 minutes before the end was going very well. The turnaround in the story was crazy and unexpected and very clever. I kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and everything would be a horrible misunderstanding, even when the credits rolled over and I realized there would not be a happy and happy ending. Unfortunately, I was mourning for having watched and hastily take a quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great Scott!
