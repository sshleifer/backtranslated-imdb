Terrible movie. If there is a Turkish movie, you should avoid seeing in 2006 that it should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Besides some cheap laughs, this movie does not reach anything, nothing, nothing, nothing. Dialogue is cheap and sexual cliches are everywhere. The director needs to watch more movies before attempting to direct his own. Red-haired women display examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in learning how not to act, this is a perfect example of bad acting. The only good thing I can say about the movie is: wait, wait, there's nothing good I can say about it. I really did not like writing about it. Wow!
