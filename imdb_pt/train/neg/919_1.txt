Although I have to admit, I laughed more watching this movie than the last comedies I saw. <br /> <br /> The budget must have consisted of exchanges of pocket of the actors. The production values ​​are so low that they really made it fun to watch. Remind me of the Robot Monster, made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In one scene, an unhappy victim gets her arm and leg cut off. Wow, hard to believe, but the scene of the Black Knight of the Holy Grail was more realistic. I was wondering why the victim did not start shouting "None Shall Pass" and "It's just a skin sore, I've had worse." It was one of the funniest scenes I saw last year. <br /> <br /> The "gladiator / demon" was also a point. Between the horribly cheap costume and the nerdy look of the guy, the end result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that is bad enough to be watchable. It's like watching a slow-motion car crash at the movies. <br /> <br />
