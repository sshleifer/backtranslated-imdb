This crap is like watching paint dry. I'm so disappointed because I was so looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> There is simply no sense to this movie. If it was never done, no one would notice or care. He's excited about all the big names, but if "nobody" is inside, no one would give this movie any love. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I was at the point where in the middle of the movie I looked at Vanessa Redgrave and thought, "Hurry up and die!" This is like the "Joy Luck Club" without any joy. It's "Ocean's 13" (nothing but a big cast) of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climactic ... ah, until it's finally over. <br /> <br /> I'm sure they'll all be nominated for the Oscars ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to such junk.
