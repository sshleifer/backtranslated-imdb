I do not know why I like Dolph Lundgren. I think watching it on the screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. This is a good feeling for all of us who have no talent. Some of the other comments point out how Detention is dumb, but many fail to point out the positives. <br /> <br /> Any movie where at least one annoying teenager is killed can not be all bad. Why do so many movies that have a cast of teenagers always need to include stereotyped teenagers? Is not there another type of teenager? Do all teenagers have an angry black face? A nerd genius that nobody likes? A slutty girl who is very friendly and (in this movie) pregnant? An upset antisocial white kid from a broken home that everyone agrees on is talented (but what's the talent?). And a relaxed black kid who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him. Then add some generic disposable teens of any color. They do not say much, but they get shot at some point. <br /> <br /> Arrest would have been better if the bad guys had even blown up the school. Preferably with the writers inside. The dialogue is bad and the plot is worse. When the thugs (and girl) finally kidnap a van full of drugs, then they sit inside the van. They drive the van to school because they want to repaint the van in the school's paint shop, but they can never redo the painting of the van. By the way, it would have been easier to simply put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or truck and leave without repainting the Van Police. They also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren) even when villains dominate school, no one is remotely aware because it is after school. The handful of people who are still in school has nothing to do with vehicle painting, so why go after them? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with lots of machine guns, and they keep finding teenagers (including a guy in a wheelchair) and continue shooting hundreds of bullets. in adolescence and usually miss. At the end of the movie there is a bloodshed. For every time someone takes a shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired. The stunts are very bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of $ 10 million, and I'm impressed. When I saw the film, I figured maybe Lundgren had done some charity work for some film school, where he is the teacher. How could this movie be the final exam of the year. It was a test to watch, but I passed.
