I do not think any Van Damme movie will hit the Universal Soldier, but you never know. This movie was good, but not as good as the first. RV returns a Luc & must do the battle again. He tries 2 b's funny here, but maybe it's worth a giggle. VD has a son this time from Ally W., nice that showed a picture of them 2. Goldberg was cool, he makes his famous move, I forgot what is called because I do not watch wrestling-sucks. VD & Goldberg had some good fights. It was the end as the first but not so good. VD makes his best move in his career, as always, the HELICOPTER KICK. Even so, the final end should have been longer. Anyway, it's worth seeing, but it will never surpass the original.
