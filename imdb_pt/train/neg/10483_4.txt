I saw this movie on an American Airlines flight heading west. It was so bad that it actually made the flight seem longer. The plot had potential (who would not love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills all the Elvis impersonators she knows?), But this has been confused millions of times with really poor writing. Towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of Elvis impersonators are on the roof of a casino resuscitating the sky thinking that he will return, then a group of stars moves to form a constellation of "Elvis", which readily triggers a lightning. lightning on the imitators by sending them to the roof. Bad ... too bad. What is the theme of the whole movie? I would avoid this at all costs.
