As far as movies are concerned, this is quite nice. Fun characters, good dialogue, interesting enough history. I would have really liked it if I had not been very angry while watching the total disrespect that shows the city in which it is. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. However, each character is English (except for Sean's girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in jobs and subordinate roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a spectator who likes her "real life" movies to be a bit more like real life) I really do not think it would be bad to use any of the many talented Scottish actors ... or at least There are English people who could put together a decent accent! The futile attempt to use the word "little" sometimes did nothing but promote the insult.
