Excuse. Someone has to say that. This really is / was a boring movie. Worthy, perhaps, but bland, though. I almost cried from boredom while watching. The acting is very dreadful, the plotted and predictable story, the soundtrack and the work of camera totally standardized and uninteresting. It's one of those movies that you can not hate (because it's about people with disabilities), but I hate that I suspect almost everyone does. It's interesting that the critics have been so kind to this movie. I suppose they can not be objective either. This was done to win prizes - which I remember doing. But it was neither interesting nor amusing. I have not seen the game so I can not compare.
