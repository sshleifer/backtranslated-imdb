The franchise dear, I shrunk the kids was a big deal and not to mention too famous. I loved Honey, I shrunk the Kids when I was little. It was an original story and had such an exciting plot! The sets were so incredible and the cast seemed to enjoy each other's company. Now dear, I blew the boy was very stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved. <br/> <br/> Basically, Adam is a bit grown up now and moms are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their kids. But when Wayne's favorite item is threatened by garbage, he wants to shrink it and keep it, but he and his brother get in the way. But when the wives come back after forgetting to give some medicine to the son, they get caught in the machine too, leaving the children alone at home! <br /> <br /> The plot is silly, but like I said, it was just a family movie that I think some might enjoy. The original honey, I shrunk the children is the best, I think everyone could agree. The third was not so bad, I recommend this at least for Mel, Blew Up the Kid movie, was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
