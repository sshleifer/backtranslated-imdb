Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 movie. There is a good story here about the Axis trying to get coal to use in the next war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we deal with a supposedly incompetent Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> True compliment comes from veteran Katina Paxinou, who won the Oscar. As was the case with her memorable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner, "For Whom the Bell Tolls," Paxinou again represents a Spanish revolutionary, but this time she is a counter-espionage of the Francoist group. She is a very vicious character here, especially when she plays a 14 year old out the window. She believed Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
