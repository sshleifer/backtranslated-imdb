Well done Al Gore! You became the first person to make $ 1 billion of the global warming lie! Just like all other men have made fables in the world, this one is up there with the best lies to have sucked so many people. Of course pollution is not a good thing, and I would love for all the trees to continue growing, but global warming is a business! It employs thousands of people who are very misleading. <br /> <br /> Google it! There are just so many things that just do not add, but well done Al, you failed as a politician, but ended up earning lots of money sucking the world. <br /> <br /> What next? Is Santa Claus real?
