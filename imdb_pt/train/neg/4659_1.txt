This movie is a waste of stock footage. Do you believe that a map of a military mission plan would be placed on an easel in a courtyard in broad daylight for someone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a DEAF person would actually be enlisted in the active service army in Europe during World War II to serve in a "black" unit ... kitchen, supply services, burial details, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would select this same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the allies arrived? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did not realize that a German plane was approaching from behind and would get him in and kill him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers stand in a barn in a farmhouse where the Germans met, FACE their emotions by seeing the German soldiers who were only 50 meters away? They did this in this film, and left any possible entrances to the barn that the Germans could check out totally unprotected. You would believe that in the radio waves and in clear English the captain mentioned the general's post, if not his name, as the person with whom he was speaking and that the general, frankly speaking about open waves, said that being protected the next day? Perhaps they should have sent an emissary to say which direction the American attack would come, to make the Germans a little easier. This so-called movie should be put on a list of the top 50 worst movies. If it was, I'm sure it would do. Watch at your own risk.
