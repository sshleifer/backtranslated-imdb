Have you ever had a cool picture in your mind that thought it would be good to be in a movie: how to see a detective peering through the cracks in a broken fence of some abandoned house? Or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and terribly alert? Yes. Imagine stretching that image for a whole movie, you almost got the idea for Broken, although there are no detectives in this movie, I'm just using it as a visual example. But the intense-looking woman is here and she filled almost 99 percent of the screen time. I have nothing to complain about this woman, she is a perfect choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very open person who can find pleasure from all sorts of artistic expressions and I can really enjoy some really grumpy things. It would be really cool if I could frame a scene from the movie and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest here, the acting is superb. Some of the expressions on the actors' faces are what keep me watching. <br /> <br /> Now, about the problem of this movie. Apart from the weather, there is not much else here. The director basically had an obsession with an idea and ran far beyond what was worth. I do not consider it a spoiler if I say obsession is "mirror". Let's face it, this unique idea is everywhere and that's what the director started to work on. Granted, there are some twists and turns here and there. If you paid attention, nothing will surprise you in the end, leaving aside the obvious arguments. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not choosing bones with this art style, since I liked them most of the time. . I still believe we should judge an art base in the medium it uses to express what artists want to express. The film is not a musical piece, an image, a painting, or even a poem, and certainly not just a cool image in your mind. It's all more a good story and character development. I consider the Lynch style of the movie cheating. It's irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium. We've been filming two hours running the movie for good reason. Therefore, we must judge it differently than judging a single frame of images, such as a photograph or a painting. <br /> <br /> This movie is not quite Lynch's style, thank goodness. It has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion. There is not much history or character development. He introduced himself quite seriously to characters composed of ordinary people, thus distancing themselves from other fantasy things at least from the surface. He offered no explanation of the element of fantasy, nor did he attempt to construct a coherent world around him. Strangeness came out of nowhere and seems quite isolated and accidental. Perhaps the coherence remains in the head of the director, but from what I see, he did not make much effort to perceive it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Where did he put his effort? He seems to have spent a lot of effort building the climate and improving it with music. Music often builds tension that eventually turns into a provocation. Only in the back of the film did the shock and tension materialize. <br /> <br /> In the end, I felt like: Okay, I know what you're trying to say here, but is that where you're trying to spend two hours building all this tension? It's quite irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have. And we are given very little about who the characters are. All we have is this circumstance that we have just put. Disappointing, but I think the director does not have much material to work on and shows.
