I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing compliments but I think critics were just sucking up Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It's definitely the slowest movie I've ever seen with countless useless, ridiculously long scenes of nowhere. In addition to Defoe, who was decent, the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie, including Defoe's wife, Giada, was ridiculously awful (as they played the role the saleswoman in the bakery is beyond me). This film is much less plot with a weak attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that provoked any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came out of nowhere, as if to add some kind of shock value to the boredom that this movie is. Sorry for being so hard, but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie movies, but this movie is not worthy of the viewers' time.
