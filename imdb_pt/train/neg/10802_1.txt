Let me give you a quick summer of the movie: a rotten and rude boy named Max comes across a radio that contains Kazaam: a rap genius. Like all geniuses, he grants three wishes, but, being humorous, also helps Max in his personal life, since he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed with organized crime. During all this, Kazaam raps from time to time, (also showing Shaq's discouraging rap skills). <br /> <br /> This movie proves what we all know: athletes need to maintain sports. I admit it never looked like a movie worthy of the Oscars, but EVERYTHING about this film waste is horrible. The characters are unlikely or stupid, the plot is neither worth mentioning, the dialogue is a joke and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke. I know the movie only drew ANYBODY because Shaq was so big (no pun intended) at the time. Honestly, I can not think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time. Shaq should have put the time used to make this movie to practice free throws.
