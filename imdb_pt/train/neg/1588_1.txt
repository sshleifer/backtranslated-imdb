This was the worst movie I've ever seen Billy Zane. I understand that this movie was mainly to show the newcomers, which did very well for the beginners, but most of all, the film was not believable. <br /> <br /> With all the shooting, you'd think the police would have intervened. Even the coin being a bug in Sean was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes that the coin is the insect, was not realistic. <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie was released quickly. Bad work. Get a better writer. <br /> <br /> The count to the end was not in sync with anything. It took more time to fight. And what a coincidence that every time Billy blows up Sean, he would be without bullets. Once, I can believe it, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was silly. It was so stupid when Sean punched him at the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
