This is the biggest load of junk I've seen in a long time. The last time I hated a movie so much was watching "28 Days Later" and "Magnolia". There's absolutely no point in this movie, except to see some really sick and twisted sex / rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relieving himself on the side of the road, and each sentence of the dialogue having to use the word "F" at least a few times. It has extremely cheap acting and has very low budget. My friend and I finally hung up the movie after about half an hour. We had tried to give it a try, but nothing could save this crap. DO NOT SEE !!!
