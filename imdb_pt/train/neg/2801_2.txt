After an almost gothic and all-fruity music video, the film begins with Cassidy, the lead singer, killing herself. In a perfect world, that would be it, and the final credits would end. We do not live in this world. The insipid band members decide to go to some clown to get in touch with their dead essence. When I say clown, I mean real clown. He tells them that everyone will die through the ghost of Cassidy (the spirit has Dora, one of the bandmates). We could not care less because the characters are all boring, tasteless and extremely awful. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredibly appropriate surname, if it ever existed), and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who after The attendant, and Tower of blood, HATES to know he keeps crap to live), this movie is a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the spectator's need to stay awake. There is not enough blood to appease hunting dogs, nor enough nudity to satisfy perverts. This movie actually has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone. <br /> <br /> My notes: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway goes topless <br /> <br /> Where did I see: Starz on Demand
