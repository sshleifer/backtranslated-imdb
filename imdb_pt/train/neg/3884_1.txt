Many moons ago, when I was seven, I vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie. He appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. Being the adult sages they are, they told me "Absolutely not! It's a pile of crap". Of course, I was very disappointed not to be the first kid on my block to see the "Incredible Melted Man". <br /> <br /> Little time passed - maybe a couple of days. I forgot about "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment disappeared. Twenty-five years passed until he entered the front line of my thoughts again. While browsing through digital cable channels, I found this lost relic from a movie. My curiosity was aroused and I finally decided to partake of this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. The "Incredible Melting Man" is perhaps the worst film known to man. He makes films like "Def-Con 4", "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered" seem Oscar nominated. I feel raped by wasting almost two hours of my life watching this filthy filth. The story was incoherent and the effects were even for 1977. How did one convince a movie producer to produce this film besides me? <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake I heard, listen to your parents if they forbid you from watching this movie. They were right.
