Yet another initial film by Alfred Hitchcock that seems to have been made out of contractual obligation. Like Juno and Paycock, you might say that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie. There is almost no style or skill for it. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young couple who earns some money and take a cruise that proves to be a test for their marriage. Emily is given a chance at a new life with a good-hearted, wealthy man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the higher road and stay with her husband. This may seem more believable if Fred was not meant to be a stinging and completely insensitive idiot who jumps on the first opportunity he sees of leaving his wife for another woman. The couple ends up getting together, but the movie has no real reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry makes a very emotional performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. That's all you can say about it.
