Take Rambo, mix some "Miami Vice," cut the budget by about 80%, and you'll have something some ten-year-olds could create if they had a big enough yard and too much access. for "Penthouse". Cop and former commandant McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know he's as tough as they come) is recruited to retrieve an American super tank that was stolen and hidden in Mexico. Captured with the tank were Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) and the former love of McBain, Devon (Fluegel), the commanding officer and now flesh to the depraved terrorist / spy / drug traffickers, who have no sense of decency, blah, blah, blah. For an action movie with depraved sex, there is a lack of action and little sex. The prank is that McBain is shot all the time and survives, keeping the bullets as souvenirs. Apparently the writers did not see "The Magnificent Seven" ("The man for us is the one who gave him that face"), nor did they think to give McBain even a pretended intelligence. Even for a budget actioner, production figures are bad, with distant shots during the dialogue and very little movement. The main support, the tank, is silly enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who may have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much bigger role in "Crime Story" than Julia!) It has to go from simpering to scared to kicking and coming back again in an instant of warning. Jones, who has been in an incredible array of movies, gets to the bottom here. Both he and Busey were probably just for some easy money and a few laughs. Look for the talented future actor Danny Trejo ("Heat", "Once Upon a Time in Mexico") in a stereotypical and threatening part. Very dull, even for a guilty pleasure, "Bulletproof" is still noisy enough to play when you leave the house, but want people to think there is someone home.
