This is a movie of tired but strangely childish clich√©s. Is there a Nazi witch-master performing sf related experiments in the basement? Oh, please! <br /> <br /> For the purpose of a chilling sensation of horror and fear, the overall impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fear. Having no expectations beforehand, I was with: an aging Xander from Buffy and a monkey-faced heroine who does not seem to know how to act. Said Adrienne Barbeau that I only found before in "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death", much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Camera and editing increase the overall impression of lame.
