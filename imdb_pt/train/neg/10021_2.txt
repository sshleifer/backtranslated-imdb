The worst movie I've seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, no humor, nothing! The action sequences look like a series of random Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up ads stitched together. Strongly influenced by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle, but very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I have not been many expectations, but watching this movie is an exasperating experience that makes you wonder, "What were these guys thinking? <br /> <br /> The only thing you can remember after watching is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini. <br /> <br /> The reason I did not give a '1' rating is that every time I think I've seen the worst, Bollywood proves me wrong.
