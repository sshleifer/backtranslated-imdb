"Guy Thing" tries to capture the feeling of "There's Something About Mary" or "Meet the Parents," but it comes out more like it was edited out of rejections of the two films. Luckily I rented it on a 5 day lease because I could not sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The premise is decent and I liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up. Paul's mistakes (the tester at Save-mart was great), but the script is absolutely horrible. The dialog box gets empty most of the time, and when you think things are finally going on the track, something unnecessary is stuck for no good reason. Also, how many bathroom jokes are really needed in a movie? <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the slapstick humor is great when it's done cleverly as in the other movies I mentioned, but this movie simply misses the mark. What a shame that I love Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate about you was great), but even that could not help me watch this terrible movie. Save your dollars and go rent "There's something about Mary" one more time.
