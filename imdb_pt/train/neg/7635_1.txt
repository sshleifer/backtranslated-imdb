I totally agree with the review by a Variety reviewer that the film is never as funny, lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise seems to justify. Narratively, it is confusing and the lighting is really problematic. If the film is directed by characters, weak lighting does not increase acting and sometimes it is difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty following the English spoken in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I watched the movie at the Cape Town World Cinema festival last year. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from uncontested and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past. Unfortunately the Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the New South African Wave, but some of the notable films about the history of our apartheid will actually be ranked among the best in our 110 year old movie history. Not surprisingly, the movie disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town just two weeks after its release and most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. It has a clearly limited appeal among the South African public.
