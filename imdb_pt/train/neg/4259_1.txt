I did not know anything about this movie before convincing myself to see it by a friend who had heard it was an "epic battle scene non-stop from start to finish." That could not be further from the truth. This was one of the most annoying, poorly written, lovingly directed, horribly acted films I've ever had the misfortune of putting my eyes on. I would rate it there with the movie that I consider the worst movie ever ... Battlefield Earth. There is basically no story, it is hard to believe that the creators of this movie thought that this crappy novel would be taken seriously as a real historical fact. He also features some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Guy says girl "You smell like the moon." The girl replies "How does the moon smell?" OMG! You have got to be kidding me! The scene where the guy was drawn and quartered had some good laughs from the audience, since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound of the guy being separated reminded me of someone making a fart sound with their mouth. If this is playing in a theater near you, avoid at all costs. This movie is so bad that I actually made the decision for about 45 minutes that I needed to catch my sleep ... and I did. Horrible.
