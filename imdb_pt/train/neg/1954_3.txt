First, let's get this out of the way. . . Yes, this movie steals a lot from 'Darkness Falls' (2003). The plot of 'Darkness Falls' goes something like this: The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement, kills people who look at her for revenge. In 'The Tooth Fairy' (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy (that, yes, it hides the face) releases its furious revenge on anyone. A little too much to be coincidental. <br /> <br /> But what should be asked is: if you're going to steal straight from the exact plot of a movie, why choose something as mediocre as 'Darkness Falls'? ? Of course he made a few dollars at the box office, but that was strictly for the theatrical experience that the film offers. A low-budget, direct-to-video movie will not have the same effect. And it did not happen. <br /> <br /> While watching the opening 15-20 minutes of the movie, my expectations have increased. There seemed to be at least SOME production value. The story did not look terrible, just blatantly torn. After the first scene, we have a good cast of characters, including an ex-doctor with secrets (played by that guy who looks like a Busey) and a hot vet student (Jenifer from Argento 'Masters of Horror: Jenifer'). After these few minutes, however, the film slowly goes down the drain. It serves all the basic horrible cliches, including, but not limited to: a crazy old man with an ignored warning, the idiot athlete, the paranormal, and the stripper with the golden heart. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems of this movie was its inability to maintain a target audience. It is as if the filmmakers wanted to change the tone of any character that was on the screen at that moment. When the adults were on screen, it had a more mature feel. When Star (the stripper) and whatshisface (the athlete) were on the screen, the dialogue went down to a more stupid, wrong and immature level. When the boy was on the screen, it looked like an episode of "Are you scared of the dark?". . . just less scary. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is everywhere. The look varies from pretty good to plain boring. Writing is inferior, as is acting for the most part. On the plus side, there is an excess of blood in the parts (including a pretty cool woodchipper scene (albeit painfully predictable) and a pretty cruel nail gun scene. Also, if you're looking for some sexy stuff, there's a short topless scene (but if you want to see that topless girl, there are better movies to do that.) Also, there is not much to worry about when it comes to this movie. is a big fan of 'Darkness Falls' (are there these?), Maybe you can check to see the story done in a different way ... but, that's the only reason I can find to see this. > <br /> Final Verdict: 3/10 -AP3-
