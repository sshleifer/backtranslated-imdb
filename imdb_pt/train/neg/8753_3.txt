This kind of movie reminds me of a Mary-Kate and Ashley movie - only worse. Just the kind thing of the rich sisters I think that despite Alysons plus the actress, in this movie Amanda Michalka was ok sometimes, but Alysons acted in a boring way. I think after high school they needed to think of something better and it definitely was not. The plot was not great and I think they should have gotten two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this movie did not make me like her any more. I think they definitely should be tired of singing and just watching this movie if you have nothing better to do (which unfortunately I did not)
