WE MISS DOWN <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Film) Stan 'n' Ollie mingles with a couple of floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after leaving to visit a theater that burns in his absence! Needless to say, their tyrannical wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are not amused ... <br /> <br /> The comedy of Leo McCarey put the narrative picture for William Seiter's masterpiece, SONS OF THE DESERT (1934), with L & H. playing victims of the circumstance, forced to tell a monstrous lie backfiring spectacularly. A lot of this is very funny, especially the scene where Stan is provoked by Deslys, leading to a violent push-and-shove game. However, some of the fun is cut short by Oakland and Flowers, playing their roles completely straight, which adds an unpleasant element to the scenario of "henpecked husband". Originally released in the UK as WE SLIP UP.
