I was thrilled to learn that someone had made a documentary about what it was like to be a Puerto Rican. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I wondered if you could know what it's like to be Puerto Rican. As far as I knew .... she was a Nuyorican. Well, anyway, I eagerly sat down with my popcorn to watch. I realized 10 mins in that my initial apprehension was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge about what it's like to be Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is more a first hand, tells very very personal about what it is to be a Nuyorican .. and all that implies. She (like most Nuyoricans I know) has a watery, partial, and sometimes distorted sense of history. (How can they not live here?) Yes, they are all proud. How should they be! But many do not know the ins and outs of the REAL culture, history and political context or language for the most part. Everything became very apparent with his participation in the edition of Vieques. Regardless of my personal opinion is on this issue .. at least I know what the heck the fight is for. She is being arrested for something she knew little .. and only participated because it was a "Puerto Rican Cause" I do not really understand how she is not ashamed to admit it. For those of you who are not Puerto Rican, please see this as a partial account of a woman's journey of self-discovery and acceptance. Do not take it as a gospel ... a lot of it is not true either. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; he is not a historian. This film is not and should never be, for other Nuyoricans, the basis for your information. Instead, just take one step to find more information by learning and debating what reality is. Not just what comes from this woman's eyes.
