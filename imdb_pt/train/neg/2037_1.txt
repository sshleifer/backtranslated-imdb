If I could give a zero, I'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead. Absolutely horrible movie without movie plot, does not make sense of what is happening. Just plain boring. Please do not waste your money on this. Please !!! This movie could have done so well if it really represented the story of the true killer of the zodiac, but no, I felt nothing but disgust at watching it. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies, you better watch a movie you've seen as 3-4 times than watch this crap! I do not understand why people bother to make such films when they know it will not work out. Zodiac killer should be called 'Boriac killer' instead !!!
