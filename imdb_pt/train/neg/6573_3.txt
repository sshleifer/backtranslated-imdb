I read the reviews for this and although I do not expect a private saving Ryan I was expecting a movie of some substance. <br /> <br /> The movie gets very lob-sided with the usual introduction of the story and how the unit came into being. But it's 1944 right now and you're not sure where everyone is. The accents etc are very poor as this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian / Asian American, but all speak in a very poor way to take Harvard English imitation of a Japanese person. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes I could not watch it anymore. The characters were one-dimensional, and though they were more likely to be based on real people, I did not feel anything for them, and that left me careless of them. Very bad direction of a very average TV movie that will be shown at midnight on some cable channel. I would avoid it and look for better efforts. <br /> <br /> This is a good story but deserves a better description. You have notion that the director had seen a group of brothers and thought that was enough to sell his film. My advice, avoid and watch siblings band, Tuskegee aviators, Glory or any other movie like when trumpets disappear ...
