Five passengers in a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams as they wait to be picked up. But are there more of these nightmares than you think? <br /> <br /> Lucky me, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment features the worst in acting, special effects, makeup and music. And these should be scary? Hmm .. I think I got more scared during an episode of Teletubbies. I swear, you're going to sit there like I was, bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen. Do not bother yourself. That never happens. In fact, I even stopped advancing the commercials because they were so much more fun than the main feature. And the end is the final end. Yes, none of this really happened. If only the same could be said for the day I put my VCR to record these shoemakers .. 2/10
