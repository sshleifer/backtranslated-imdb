Because?!! This was an insipid movie, uninspired and embarrassing. The embarrassment comes from being from the city where they did it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they let these people do a BAAAAAD movie there? <br /> <br /> When this movie was originally released ... it was more of a romantic comedy ... and nothing of ROBO. All this has changed with the courtesy of Disney's cuteness. BECAUSE???? They made a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. Seeing Matthew Broderick making fun of his own films was not fun either. Sheesh !!
