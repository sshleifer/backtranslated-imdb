The original movie (dated 19 ??) showed no "monster", only suggested "scary" things. <br /> <br /> This version shows all aspects of a "sick ghost", including unnecessary special effects. The "mystery" as presented in the original movie was the scariest part: one simply did not know what was causing the strange things that happened. In showing the face of the "old man," this Mister disappeared completely. Worse still: the special effects (the crying of children in wood) is ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, obviously also spectacular to be as close as the original
