This movie is just like any other Dutch movie, so if you like movies like turks fruit and kleine blonde dood. so you can be okay with this (even if they both have much better stories and actors) Zomerhitte gets strong enough, but even that good scene ends up having nothing to do with the plot. There's a lot of nudity (but me and others just can not find that girl appealing), the dialogue is laughable (as we've done a lot for the annoyance of other moviegoers), and some of the scenes are so random that it's more of a non-comedy intentional than anything else (like a random scene where an owl rips someone's eye ... has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced later in a sentence saying "you heard what happened ... I was there "). the only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the places they look cool in ... that's it. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the premiere (here in the Netherlands we have a strange system in relation to the previews, you pay less money then for a normal movie and you do not know which movie you will be all the that you know is that it's a new movie that is not in theaters yet). My advice is to stay away from this movie if you really want to see a good Dutch watch movie or zwartboek.
