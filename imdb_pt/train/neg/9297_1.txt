I gave it a 1. There are so many twists and turns you can never be sure to twist. Total chaos. Everyone is dead or almost so. I'm tired of crossing my hair and changing the visions. I can not give up the plot. Confused and insane. If I had paid to see this, I would demand my money back. I wish the comments were more honest.
