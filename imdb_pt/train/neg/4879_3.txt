Is there anything worse than a comedy movie that has no humor? The answer is yes; one that does not generate interest in the whole image. The premise is not so bad - a naive frontman for an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and script and simply does not work. <br /> <br /> Was it considered a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the image is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the 30s and 40s, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weakling who killed Gary Cooper in "Lives of a Lancer of Bengal ", so I was not counting it). <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this and gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, get a root canal.
