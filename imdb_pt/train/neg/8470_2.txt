I watch a lot of horror movies (or at least they try to be) and this has to be the worst, if not the second worst movie I've ever had to struggle to sit on. I never knew the depths of Masacism until I rented this piece of moldy cheese covered with a used latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but this is worse than I would have expected for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled over and I still had not seen the pain firsthand. Maybe there are some viewers out there who like this and can point me in the right direction, but then again, I know those viewers who understand if they do not celebrate, especially when we had to turn off the video, and that's just NOT done with our observation we had to make an exception, obviously). <br /> <br /> If it were for a remake, I'd give it a try, as long as they had at most 1% of the original embedded in it. That is all.
