I have some advice for the people who made this movie too, if you're going to make a movie like this, make sure you have the f / x to back it up. Also do not have a bunch of z-list actors to touch it. Another thing, almost all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so do not blatantly copy. All in all this movie sucked, f / x sucked, acting sucked, story without originality. Let's talk about acting for just one second, the Carradine guy, whose career peaked in 1984, when he did "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a great comedy). He is not exactly z list, he can act. He should have just said no to this bag. He should have done what Mark Hamill did after "Return of the Jedi" and go quietly through the night. He made his mark as a "nerd" and that should have been it. I understand he has bills to pay, but this hardly justifies this bag. Did I ever call this movie that? IT'S OK. I just wanted to be sure. If I look a little hostile, I apologize. I only lost 2 hours of my life I could have spent doing something productive, like watching peeling paint, and I feel cheated. I'll close this note. Thank's for your time.
