Someone called Howard Koch from Schlockmeister, but he wrote the script for "Casablanca," did not he? Or he does not. Maybe there's more than one Koch in Hollywood, and I do not really like "Casablanca" anyway. Wait a minute - yes, there's another Howard Koch sneaking around Hollwyood. This is the one who wrote "Casablanca". Does not matter. I'll put as much care in this comment as "Howard W. Koch" put into that production, which means only a little. <br /> <br /> Do you know how that sounds? Someone read Shakespeare's King Lear's Cliff's Notes and decided, since there was no original thought aboard the Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and Hollywoodize it with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide his vast estates between three sisters and, before doing so, asks how much they love him. Two of the sisters threw themselves at his feet and covered his nose to get his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to operate on Lear. But in the play, Lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers their hiding place and deprive the honest girl. He goes crazy and naked during a gale in the marshes, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. Children can do this with you. (Take my son, for example, after all the effort I've expended to create him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer?) In the end, everyone in the play dies. <br /> <br /> In the film, of course, the good sister is grumpy and suicidal, but when she tries to kill herself, someone jumps and saves her, so the ending is more or less happy. That's the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a sufficient tragedy for yourself.
