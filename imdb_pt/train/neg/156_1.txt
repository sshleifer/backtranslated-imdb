Zu Warriors should definitely have been an animated series because, like a movie, it's like watching an old anime about acid. The movie starts out of nowhere and people simply fly battling with metal wings and other stupid weapons until the princess sacrifices for her lover in a cloud or something. If this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me, but soon the villain enters and kills her while the guy with the blade's wings fights against another mystical God / Demon / Wizard thing The plot is not there or it's extremely difficult to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie. The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal who is called by this god to fight evil flying, princess killing the bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed Uwe Boll as a fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something. Even the visuals are weird some may say they are awesome and colorful but I'll say they are blurred and acidic like trip (yes, its a word!). I watched both the dubbing and the subtitles and both were equally bad and difficult to understand ... I'm joking, I did not understand anything. was watching episode 30 of some 1980s anime and completely lost as the story began or as I started reading a comic series of 5 in number 4 because I had no idea how this thing started where it was going or how it would end I was lost I can honestly say that this was one of the worst movie experiences of all time, it was like watching Inu-Yasha in episode 134, drunk ... yes, it's true, you do not know what the hell is going on. brain trying to figure it out.
