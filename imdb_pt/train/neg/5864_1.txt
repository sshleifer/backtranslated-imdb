I'm sure this was the worst movie ever. If you can not make a 13-year-old laugh at silly humor, you should give up the comedy forever. Unfortunately Joan Rivers chose differently. The film is full of predictable jokes (some are racist) and bland jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene in which the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant (as I write this, I can not believe this was actually a movie scene). The man runs to a dead rabbit at the doctor's table and tries to give word of mouth. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The joke that can say how bad things are in this movie is "I knew I should be at the top". ha ha ha ah ha ugh ........
