You have to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, motivation and enthusiasm when it comes to making films: between 1985 and 2000 he made 34 films. Unfortunately, if your Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they are probably all crap (and a quick look at IMDb ratings seems to check my guess). Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students find detentions a little more hectic than normal after being attacked by hordes of undead who escaped from an ultra-secret army base located directly below your school. Working from a terrible script by Brian Eklund (who relies heavily on the liberal use of the f-bomb) Sheets offers yet another embarrassingly amateurish endeavor with horrible performances from his talent-free cast, terrible visual effects (some crap CGI). and what appears to be the front of a giant cardboard space shuttle) and its trademark poor quality (handfuls of kids drawn from underneath their victims' clothes). <br /> <br /> Finally, after what seems like an eternity watching annoying characters running through their lives, and undefeated unknowing people caressing animal bowels, Zombie Armageddon ends with a time-traveling end / paradox twist that forces the viewers to re-watch several tortuous minutes since the beginning of the film. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets, what did we do to deserve to watch again?
