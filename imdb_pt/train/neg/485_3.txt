When I saw the preview, I thought: This will be a great movie. And indeed it could have been. The actress who plays the main character was very credible, and the beauty of filming is undeniable. However, the dialogues cast a dark shadow across the image. The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action that occurred in 1610 and took most of the film's magic. However, I must congratulate the translator because the English subtitles were more refined and appropriate than the French originals, and probably explains the good rating the film received on imbd!
