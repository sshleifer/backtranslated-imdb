Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein wrote the script for a Roth story. This film is a zombie movie, which owes much to George Romero and his early "Undead" films, and to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to mention "Evil Dead" by Sam Ramie. There is nothing original here, and the story is not convincing. The acting is similar to this genre, it is that the story fails. We've seen this movie before and better done. Having said that after having achieved commercial, if not artistic, success of this film, Roth decided that he was a director and came away with the abysmally atrocious, stingy, pointless (though much more ambitious) crap fest Hostel.Roth should have given up while he was behind. Cabbie Fever is not a good movie, however, compared to Hostel is a work of art. But someone (preferably a psychiatrist) convinces this guy that the cinema is the wrong career choice. of cabin, a weak 3/10 for not being as aby smal as Hostel.
