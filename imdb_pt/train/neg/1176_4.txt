Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films, since, in fact, most revolutions are themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this film lacks in drama is offset by an overabundance of boredom. No one cares who wins, loses, dies or lives - just finish it as soon as possible. This is largely due to what seems to me to be a shallow use of basic technology. Scenes from Paris and the interior of France have a quality of cardboard about it. They can be best done on a nude stage and left like this. One can not expect the astounding effects of "The Flying Dagger House" or "The Golden Compass," but, after all, this is a digitally dominated production in 2002. The characters seem to get into a scene by coming on the scene, misses the count of the number of times the character enters and leaves the rooms. In my opinion, this film transforms the French Revolution of the 1790s into the "papier-mache" revolution of a "papier colle" world.
