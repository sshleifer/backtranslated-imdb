"Seed" is a porn torture ... no doubt. But strangely, Uwe Boll wrote, produced, and directed a more polished film than any he has done in recent memory. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch a Boll movie, I feel like some pages of the script movie must have disappeared. There are simply large gaps in history and dialogue. Of course, nothing makes much sense either. The movies are a little surreal in that respect. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Why the six policemen who will stop Seed split up and go? their separate ways when they arrive at the dark residence, unlike real policemen who would come in and clean the house in pairs or for three? Why do not cops ever use their radios? How can bodies decay so quickly, a process that would normally take many months? (I know it's a time-lapse photograph ... but Seed would never be able to keep up with killing people if he always expected the previous victim to deteriorate to the point shown). How does Seed manage to wear jumpsuits and a mask while he's waiting on the death row instead of typical prison uniforms? How can Seed get into a maximum security prison, walk around the block of cells and then walk out again without being stopped or even noticed? If almost 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the film) were murdered, why is there only one investigator working on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should search for Seed at Seed's home, where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims? (He did not think to do this sooner?) Why would the police detective do it alone, without support and without even letting the dispatch know what he was doing and where he was going? <br /> <br /> It's particularly frustrating when Boll obviously unfolds to make sure we understand why the electric chair does not work properly. He spends several minutes on the screen to set this up, when he could have spent them making other aspects of the film at least a bit more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> In short, the film serves only as a framework for some varied scenes (perhaps Boll would think of them as his " visions ") of a brutal death by blows, head shots, execution. by electrocution, and the skinning of live animals bred for their skins. (The early scenes of skinned animals were indeed unnecessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The centerpiece is undoubtedly the death of a middle-aged woman by Seed using a hatchet. It's obvious that a lot of time was spent on it and it vaguely reminds me of the classic "Reservoir Dogs" scene, though without the Steely Dan soundtrack. Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Only if you are a devoted fan of the porn genre torture or if you are absolutely determined to see a sample of porn torture. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this film is quite disgusting and may be disgusting in some respects, it is actually far more competent than most of Boll's films. Maybe he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. I can only hope that it progresses beyond the torture porn and continues more in the vein of "Postal."
