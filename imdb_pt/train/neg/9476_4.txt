Pretty crazy whodunit featuring any cast of a black trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to make it big. Was it your wife? His girlfriend? Your so-called girlfriend? Her father? Your butler? The guy in the paper? Who knows? And who cares? The result of this is just a little discouraging, and the actors here do not leave me wanting to care one way or another to find out. Why the snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music is good, but there is little of it, and most of it is well "let's get it over with" This is not worth your time. There are better all-black cast films out there.
