I'm a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And besides them, Charles Butterworth (a very nice supporting actor) was in that movie, so why did not I particularly like it? Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest writings and more clichés "A pictures" I have ever seen. Given the talent and money spent to make this movie, it's shocking how slippery the writing was. I knew the movie would be boring when, over and over again at the beginning of the movie, I would see myself predicting EXACTLY what would happen next - and I was always right! And that's not because I'm some kind of "savant of the movie", but it was because almost no imagination or effort went into it. In fact, it looked almost as if the film were just a long series of clichés all together! Also, I find it somewhat annoying that Fred had mistreated Carole so much during the film and yet, true to the conventions, she came running up to him at the end. Uggh! There's more suspense in a Lassie movie ("Will it take people to rescue Timmy or the rope he's hanging from breaking?"). <br /> <br /> Despite the very, very tired and clichéd script, there were some good points about the film. It was so cool to see Fred seem like a broken lust at the end of the movie - it was believable and he did not seem to have eaten, shaved or slept in days. In addition, the "chatter" of Charles Butterworth provided some slightly humorous moments. But all this was not enough to make this movie look different from a "B" movie. Too bad ... it could have been so much better.
