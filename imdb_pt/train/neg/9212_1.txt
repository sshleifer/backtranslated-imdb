The only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is. with a plot that makes your average high school writer look good, and acting that's almost as good, gets my lowest score. one of the earliest films of tone, where he obviously did not have the pleasure of being very picky. the best special effect of the film consists of a guy dressed in an incredibly fake rubber monster.
