Anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of junk should have his head examined. We have the submissive, heroin-addicted, part-time wife with lacerations all over her body, lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive child. Now she is squirting mother's milk all over the kitchen floor, the release so won somehow resembling Helen Keller putting her hands under running water. We have the husband who starts sponsoring a prostitute who happens to be his daughter (she is upset with him because he came too fast) and ends up killing his colleague, having sex with his corpse and then cutting it. We have the boy who is relentlessly intimidated by his peers and who comes home and beats his mother. You see, it's all circular. Deep, eh? The only decent moment in this horrible pile of guts is when the father kills the killers of his son. It is good that this turkey was filmed on video because otherwise it would be a waste of expensive film. If this guy who thinks that artists should be interested in this slop is really serious, it's no wonder that most people think that artists are crazy. We saw this bad movie then put on "Zero Woman, The Accused". Oh my God, it was a coup over which one was worse. What is happening in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
