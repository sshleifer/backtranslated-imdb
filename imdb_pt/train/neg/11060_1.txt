It could have been a morbid and fascinating view of the life of one of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, but unfortunately it does not even come close. Terrible editing, direction, bad acting, you choose. This movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot extended in 100. The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as the father, but that is not enough to save this stinky. 1 out of 10.
