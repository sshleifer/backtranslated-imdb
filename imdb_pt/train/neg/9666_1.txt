Having seen "Triumph of the Will", I can only say that this film is ghastly, even measured against the historically low "standards" of the time. Of course, everything is totally fabricated and harmful. This is what we would expect from the German propaganda of 1930. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is banal and cheap. It is also so blatantly ridiculous that even the contemporary Germans must have left the theater holding their noses. In a genre renowned for its basic appeal, lack of originality and lack of remorse, this film neither qualifies as "bad." It would have to significantly improve to achieve this status!
