There is nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of people dying repeatedly on the same hill. The cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer / director / publisher / God goofed. He should have eaten a humble pie (if not for his own good, then by the men who died in Kargil), hired one of these brilliant Bollywood directors, hired a real screenwriter, hired a real publisher, hired a musician who did not was somehow related to him (and who seemed to have heard some bad version of "Apocalypse Now" on some cheap Indian drug), hired a real professional team, threw away all the fireworks, and told a real story. Unfortunately, he, like the heads of the Indian Army, made terrible decisions for his actors and terrible for the public. We all die over and over again. <br /> <br /> Please do not do this again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: The next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, I suggest he hire more than one Nepalese to represent the team. Certainly there are many Nepalese working in Bombay - the last count was 40,000 to half a million.
