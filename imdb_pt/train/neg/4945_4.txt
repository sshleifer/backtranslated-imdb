Of course, this is not really a blockbuster, nor does it target such a position. "Dieter" is the first name of a popular German musician who is loved or hated for his type of acting and that is exactly what this movie is about. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen", written a few years ago, but is not intended to be precise about it. The movie is full of some offensive sexual content (at least for the American standard) which is fun (not for other "actors", of course) or stupid - it depends on your individual mood or you being a "bohlen" . -Fan or not. Technically speaking, there is not much to criticize. Speaking of me, I think this movie is an OK movie.
