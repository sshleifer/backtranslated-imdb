... however I am not one of them. Caro Diario, at least, was watchable for two-thirds of the time, but the boring and egocentric third part of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self-indulgent mess. Moretti says he feels the need to make this movie but does not want to, while the viewer feels he should stay with him, but he does not really want to. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but it's not that movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends are outside the headquarters of the Communist Party, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with Party leaders inside, but it is characteristic of this film that we can never see anything of them. Moretti's political deliriums are the events that led to the birth of his son, and his subsequent home movies with the baby and then with baby Pietro (the movie drags us through several years and more of an election period). We continue to expect to see some definitive sequence or convincing argument, but they never arrive. I doubt I could have the patience to watch a Nanni Moretti movie again. He can make an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.
