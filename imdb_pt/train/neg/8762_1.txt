A scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) discovers how to bring the dead back to life. However, they come back with marble faces. Eventually, all of this leads to disaster. <br /> <br /> Tour of 1940, boring and totally predictable. It scared me when I was a kid, but it only annoys me now. I had to fight to stay awake! With one exception, the acting is horrible. Such boring actors without expression! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about this: Carradine, despite the script, actually does a very good performance. And there are some slightly creepy moments involving a ghost of a Great Dane walking the walls. There is also one of the worst knockouts in movie history. Still, none of it is fun enough to get through. Avoid.
