This must be one of the worst interpretations of vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a hypnotizing subject into a totally uninspired story? Apparently it is not such a difficult task ... First of all, a sine qua non condition of any vampire is a dark and somber atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this does not have all these things .. lots of light - the spots! oh my God, why in the name of Christ / Judas was that? <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula arose he was devoured by the light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: only weak) There was only one scene that was almost worth watching, near the end of the movie (beatiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new achievement). I really liked the first, the Judas-twist was definitely original, but this is not good, not at all. I hope the third one has the vampire signature that I like so much in other classics as Nosferatu from Herzog, Dracula from Coppola or even Interview with the vampire.
