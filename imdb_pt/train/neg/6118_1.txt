This is not good news of Tarzan's epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in the chandelier! Bo Derek in '10 'was at least a humorous film and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing more than soft pornography. If you like this, then go ahead and skip the rest! This film (as the Bolero) was again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show his terrible acting. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; This was one of your few mistakes! Do not waste your time with this movie ... go buy the book.
