Over the years, I've seen a lot of them straight in the Segal movies, and each one holds the same amount of entertainment; Unfortanetley, the entertainment level is on a low level. Of course, the action sequences were fun, but that was pretty much it. Seagal was really at the peak when he made movies like; Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and Executive Decision (at least from the point of view of the action), but over the last ten years, these types of films that star in Segal really do not meet their previous qualifications. <br /> <br /> The more positive side, the film made good use of time, as some of the action sequences and use of wit. Only when the movie only seemed to drag, did a very cool action scene bring him out of the gutter. I sincerely believe that more Segal films would have been better if he were not the only one the fans recognize in the film. Actors and supporting actresses are a very important thing, and if your current films had such well-known supporting actors and actresses, perhaps the film has more popular results.
