I have to admit that I put this off thinking that something would have to happen, in addition to the dead body in the early scenes ... and its disposition of it. I was wrong. It was a movie verge of Betty hits the beach, topped by the first part by Mordant Morven. I really do not care what young lassies in Scotland do today, who their screw is, what the hell they take. Visually, the tour of Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was pleasant and certainly the highlight for me. The Nadir was the dead boyfriend's chop shop. When the movie came to an end I had two thoughts ... 1. Is that all there is? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend killed himself. Rename it. "Bate Boredom Bitch, or what I did on my trip to Spain." I'm so crazy to put these things out.
