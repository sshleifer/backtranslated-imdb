Ladies and Gentlemen, please do not be fooled by the film "A Stanley Kubrick." This is a very bad movie that unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror movies of all time. Horror movies should create a fear that at night people should shiver their hearts as they think about a true horror movie. In Shining, there is no real horror, but what we find is just a naive and foolish attempt to create a creepy horror. Everyone knows how good the attempts are. if they are different from reality. All that is good in the movie is the view of the frozen valley. The hotel where most of the actors were housed also looks good. A word about the actors Jack Nicholson seems like a lost and lazy soul who is never sure what he is supposed to do. There is not much to be said about bald. colorful actor who most of the time is busy pampering a kid actor. It is not necessary to blame the bad weather for the tragedy. It can not be avoided as the film was made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes.
