I see probably 200 movies a year, both in theaters and at home, and I can confidently say that this movie is by far the worst I've seen this year (if not, I've never seen "Quest of the Delta Knights" yet) . This movie is just a bad joke after bad joke aimed at the 13 year old and because I had the dislike of seeing him on a bus trip I could not get out. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental hall. The four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
