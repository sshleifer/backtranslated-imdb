Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors that I enjoyed throughout their careers, and that was the only reason they chose to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is that I totally regretted it! These two great actors humble themselves by executing a series of irrelevant, unimaginable and extravagant sketches (not that this is bad on its own) that supposedly make people laugh, but fail to do so. The only reason I can think of it is that the director was his friend, and they decided to support his movie starring him - I can not think of anything else because this movie is so cheap! Luckily Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not disappointed me since. I would recommend that you avoid this movie, unless you want your opinion about the two actors to be spoiled.
