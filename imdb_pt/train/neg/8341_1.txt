I love horror movies. I can even enjoy most of the cheeses (dude, 9 out of 10 horror movies these days are cheese), but this was just ridiculous. Terrible acting, terrible writing, completely hollow and unbelievable characters (no Meisner actors here!) And a total lack of sufficient counting of bodies. I wish I could SAVE the 79 minutes of my life that I just wasted. At least the Crook brothers are properly called. The only good thing about the whole movie was watching Alicia Silverstone wanting to be punched in the face. How this has come to Sundance is completely disconcerting to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even by horror movie standards. I mean, come on! Who would rush to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a weird stalker had just left home? Lame.
