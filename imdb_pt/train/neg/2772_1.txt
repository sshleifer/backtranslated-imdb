Warning spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, I was almost there. This was such a bad movie, about a true and interesting story. He had such a promise, but acting was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something out of a theme park. I found myself laughing as I watched, what should be, serious scenes. I really wanted to like this movie, but I could not. The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the "King" dying. I liked the punishment of the queens. And the final shot made a nice photo, though. There are so many better movies to watch. I would not recommend this.
