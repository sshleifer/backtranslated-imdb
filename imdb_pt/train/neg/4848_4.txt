I love a good war movie and I fall into the category of "I went there, did that". So I'd like to think that my review is accurate (IMHO). Having just watched this movie on DVD, I can safely say it was a pile of crap. There's no way I can recommend this movie to you. <br /> <br /> I started screaming at the TV saying "you would not do it", etc ... but soon realized that having a little work experience would be an obstacle so I cool a little. But in the opening scene, when the wheel of the trailer fell, I got an unpleasant feeling that this movie would be a predictable failure ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic to the EOD scenes. . I only know that the Army team had some of the most patient insurgents on the other side of the wire or the remote trigger. So much so that I scratched my head all the time. So, when you think you know where the story is going, the Humvee guys are on their own driving through the desert. One of the most valuable assets of the theater, in a joyful meeting with some SAS contractors. <br /> <br /> The shooter's scene was so laughable. It just did not make any sense and made me want to hang up there and then. So for them to drag it off so long really tested my patience. Started with the "Right of Contact" and went down hill quickly. If you had a British accent, you would be shot, but if you were part of the EOD team, then all of a sudden you would be a great marksman and save the day. Then, just as you thought it was over, you stretched out for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story. Are you just watching and asking why you're not done yet? <br /> <br /> So we had the drinking scene where they just beat each other for a laugh ... another scene where you wanted it to end. That did not add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> So, just as my life seemed very boring, the main star left the wire to hunt someone. This is the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen. He defied all logic and ability to write a good plot ... it was senseless and horrible. I still do not understand why they lost time with it. Then, to see him just running down the busy streets going back to the camp, I had to roll on the floor with laughter. Pure comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that this story is all over the show without actually deciding what it wants to be. I thought it was going to be stupid and illogical EOD scenes, but then it was still tangent trying to be something different. But as hard as I tried, it bored me to death. All I wanted was for this to end. It was a confusing compilation of stupid scenes mixed up in a bunch of stupid and nonsensical action scenes (ish). <br /> <br /> There is no way to recommend it. Maybe my work experience has compromised fun, but even the naive should realize that it does not make sense. The only thing stupider than this movie is the artificially high rating of IMDb ... which should be the 24/7 work of the box office PR, who seems to use this site as a way to make everyone think it's good . Sorry guys ... it is not! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... will only bore you.
