WOW! Terrible things. Richard Burton's roadshow / Elizabeth Taylor lands in Sardinia and joins director Joseph Losey for this remarkably ill-conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich and agonizing widow, holding tight to her minions on an island where she dictates, very loudly, her memories to an incredibly patient secretary. When the thug Burton appears claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes that his time is up. Extremely lucid - it is difficult to determine whether Taylor and Burton are acting badly OR whether it was Williams' intention to leave his characters so unattractive. If that's the case then the acting is brilliant! Burton mutters his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor screams. She's really awful. So is Noel Coward as Taylor's tidy confidant, the "Witch of Capri." <br /> <br /> Presumably BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves - two standard Williams themes, but it is so misdirected by Losey that Taylor and Burton did not write it for the public during its monologues, most of which are unusual, any substance the film has had would have been completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has an incredible photograph - the camera would have to be out of focus to spoil the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's talented physician and Michael Dunn as his nasty dwarf security guard ... both he and his dogs make a number in Burton!
