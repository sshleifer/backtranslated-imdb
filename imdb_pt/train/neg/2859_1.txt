It's made in 2007 and CG is bad for a 1998 movie. In one part of the film there's a stop motion picture of a dinosaur that really looks good, but that makes the extremely amateurish work on CG stuff still looks worse. <br /> <br /> The writing, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is simply terrible. This is as bad as, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure crap! Again, as with the other films, the only scary part about this movie is that it really was made and is now being featured on the science fiction channel. <br /> <br /> I still can not understand how they somehow get people who have some acting ability to act in these films and somehow make them as terrible as all the others in the movie . <br /> <br /> For those who are not sure, the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in their review ... or he is one of the people who worked on this film.
