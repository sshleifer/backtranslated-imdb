This is a 30 minute show about a joke. The joke, cave men are not treated fairly. Haha ha !!! He can not dial a phone because he's a caveman. Cavemen are not as smart as humans. Oh, my gosh, these cavemen are so unsophisticated. There is no humor in this show. They can only get away from this joke for so long and they already have Geico commercials. This show does not deserve a time slot on national TV. <br /> <br /> This program tries hard to be funny, but it is not. Watching this show, I was thinking I was trying to be like a "Bachelor's Gone Wild Show". It means they go to the bar and try to sleep with lots of women. The cave man crying is annoying. The caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I can not understand why I do not care about them.
