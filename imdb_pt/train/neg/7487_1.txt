Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, Neil Simons' screenplay is not used in this film, so it does not blink over and over again. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke she is donated, then the joke dies, that is, the couple having sex in the park. They announce that it is a lighting ceremony for New York, well, we all know that the lights will come on and we can see cute and assaulted. Goldie and Steve do a little slap. The whole movie ends up being like this ... a joke is created and donated. Why is not Goldies hair ever messed up in the movie? You'll also notice all the details of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
