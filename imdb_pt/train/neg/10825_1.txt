What made the idea of ​​seeing this film so attractive was the hope that it would correspond to Charlotte Bronte's brilliance of the original classical story. I was deeply disappointed to discover that this film, which seemed to be written or shot hastily, did not have the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Much of the witticism between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be missing in the script or left on the floor of the editing room. Also lacking was the charismatic sense of Jane Eyre, which allowed her to suffer through tumult and triumph over all. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie does not seem to have much to triumph, including one of the biggest parts of the story, when Jane flees from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame at having to beg for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, all to get away from a man she loved were, in my opinion, poignant bits of history that were simply left out of this movie. The title character seemed dry and uninspired. The story was not attractive, and for those who have not read the book, I can not imagine this story to be a little interesting. The script and the Direction made little or no credit for classical history.
