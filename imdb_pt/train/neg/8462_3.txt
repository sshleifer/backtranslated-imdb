"Bullfighter" was made in 2000 but is being released on video 5 years later for some reason. I want to know why? Could it be: the confusing plot, the incomprehensible dialogue said by Oliver Martinez and the annoying issue? It has to be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) go on a mystical journey. They encounter a lot of crazy characters and avoid some evil ones as well. The film looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, while trying subtly, do not draw attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments, and weak special effects. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is in it for 2 minutes. maximum.
