When I first heard about "Down To Earth", I was very excited. I'm a big fan of Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma. But this movie proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not as good as his previous performances, and the film was very poorly directed as a whole. <br /> <br /> First, Chris Rock. He interprets the entire movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously, this works well in the scenes where he should be standing, but in the rest of the movie, it does not work. Even when he's talking to another character, he seems to think he's trying to make a room full of people laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they come mostly during the standup scenes (no wonder they have decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're just there to give Rock somebody to talk to, none of them stand out. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was misdirected. The film basically has a plot of a joke: old white acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this could still have worked and have been quite funny. The problem was that we saw a lot of the rock and not enough of the old white. It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy who tells Chris Rock's jokes, but most of the time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not so funny. The few scenes in which they decide to show us the white guy talking like Rock are, in fact, hilarious. If it had been shown more, the film would have been a lot funnier. <br /> <br /> Overall, a few moments of laughter can not make up for the fact that "Down To Earth" is misunderstood, and misdirected. This was a big disappointment. Rating: 4/10
