Having watched 10 minutes of this movie, I was puzzled, having watched 30 minutes my toes were curved - I just could not believe it: the movie is really awful. In fact, it's so horrible that I had to watch everything to convince myself (!). During that time, I realized that it reminded me of a lot of Danish comedies of the 60s and 70s. The standard is this: get an extremely popular comedian, make a screenplay putting the comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a lot of jokes ( especially simple phrases) and season it with two beautiful girls - film this, and you have a success! I would not know if this film was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that died in silence (with some great comedians), it seems that there is a market for this type of film in the USA.
