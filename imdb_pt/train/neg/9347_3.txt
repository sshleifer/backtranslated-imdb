This film stumbles from a self-indulgent moment to a self-indulgent moment, promising to evolve into something worth waiting for. But that does not happen. It is flat, self-conscious, unimaginative and tedious. <br /> <br /> A series of scenarios and scenarios do not make a movie, they make a calendar. This kind of regrettable socialist pseudo-drama documentary ("It's TRULY REALLY Happened") not only fails to entertain, it can not convince, so it does not even work as social history. Clich√©s mixed with poor acting make this film very difficult to finish, the fun factor wearing down quickly. The characters are one-dimensional, they never develop to the extent that they feel for them. The director's ego is the biggest character in this movie.
