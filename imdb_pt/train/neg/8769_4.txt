This was a movie I hoped I could suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie to end, I knew I could not even watch the damn thing to close. You're almost convinced that the real war did not last that long. Others will try to question my patriotism by criticizing a movie like that. But out of the house, you can not go watching Saving Private Ryan at LOC. Forget the budget difference of the movie or the audience - this does not stop a director from making a smart movie. The length of the film is not so bad and the fact of being repetitive - they continue to attack the same hill, but give different names. I thought the LOC was terrible ground - this hill looked like my backyard. Character development sequences (the flashbacks of soldiers, looking at their last moments, before being implemented) should have been throughout the film and not just grouped into a long memory. To this day I still have to watch the end. But there was a much better film (not much talk) called Border.
