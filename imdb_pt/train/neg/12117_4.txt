You can say to yourself, "Don Johnson like Elvis?" This might work, is it possible? It seems like a terrible choice for me, but maybe I should have an open mind. but he is a terrible Elvis.He is very low, very weak voice, very well featured ... well, you already imagined how bad he would be Add to that a black wig and an eyeliner and a thick hand mascara, and it's a big embarrassing mess. The best I can say is that since Johnson's acting is decent and his acting it's so far away, after a while you do not even think of him as Elvis anymore, you see him as another crazy pop star, so at that level the film becomes watchable. Stephanie Zimbalist is not ideally chosen as the tall, beauty queen, Linda Thompson.But she is attractive in her own right and plays has the role with the honesty, elegance and intelligence that we expect from all its roles. There may be a lot of intelligence in your performance. You have to be a type of drug to stay with a drug abusing drugs. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in this story; we've heard it many times before. If you are looking for new information or insights, you will not find them. It is told as a love story - an unrequited one: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
