Director Warren Beatty's intention to turn Chester Gould's famous comic into a live action cartoon (with Beatty leading himself as a square chin detective) had innocent nostalgia - quite unusual and intriguing coming from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the image is necessary, fun for some time but eventually tiring. Dick Tracy tries to overthrow the mobster Big Boy Caprice, aided by the love of Tess Trueheart, but stumbled by the evil Breathless Mahoney. For the first half hour, the Oscar-winning art direction and stage setter are wonderful to absorb, but as the plot gives a predictable sound (without any twist in writing), things start to freeze. Al Pacino received a surprise Oscar nomination for being the bad boy Caprice, and Madonna (which is used primarily as decorative prop) begins to sing "Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)" by Stephen Sondheim, who received the award of Best Artist. Song. Very heart, thanks to Beatty - who was dedicated to his vision - but the image is very cool and calculated. There is no heat. * 1/2 of ****
