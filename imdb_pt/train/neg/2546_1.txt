This movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller. A tour bus en route to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white trash thieves who drive dune buggies. They drive them out into the desert and then steal all their valuables. The plot changes constantly. One minute they are looking to kidnap a rich daughter of farmers, the next they are looking for a collectible stamp worth $ 90,000. The dialogue is horrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
