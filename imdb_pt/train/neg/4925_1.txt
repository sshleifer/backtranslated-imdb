Please do not waste your time. This film brings together the worst of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock and biblical references) and Blade (high-tech toys). I really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many who are very good out there. But not this stinky. Not even the soundtrack helps, mainly because the film resorts to the ridiculous scary classic music, not the "heavy metal" that some have reported. Only a few times I heard any metal; mostly violins were tortured. Avoid like garlic and crucifixes.
