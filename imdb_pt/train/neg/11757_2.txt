Hi, Arnold! It's a slow movie and a little boring. The plot is not very creative. The character of Paul Sorvino (Shenk) is buying all the decrepit, low-priced buildings to build a gigantic shopping center, commercial complexes and office buildings. This plot goes back to many children's films from the 60's. This is boring. Paul Sorvino is also not very exciting, so the idea of ​​him as the bad guy is not too scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the film is about the last 36 hours, when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the secret help of Helga, whose father hopes to get rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. Children should travel around the city on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not just silly, but it underscores how this movie is written for very young children. Hi Arnold, the TV design is usually a lot of fun, and it has enough humor to attract adults. TV design is generally faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, it's about five times more sedated, and a good way to put someone, including children to sleep. Hi Arnold it was hard to stay awake until the foreseeable end and totally annoying. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, that's it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90-minute movie, the producers started with a 30-minute TV cartoon and tried to expand it in 90 minutes. This Mall Story could definitely have been covered in the TV picture. I hope Arnold bets a better writer if there's any sequel.
