The philanthropic gesture of actress Ruth Roman to help entertain troops arriving and departing for the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco kicked off this Warner Bros. greeting to patriotism and music. Many celebrities make guest appearances as a love-hate romance develops between a rising star and a painfully green and lean Air Corps (Ron Hagerthy, who seems to be delivering journals from his bicycle). It seems that the cable fooled the actress into thinking he is going to battle when in fact he is part of an airplane crew, flying to and from Honolulu (you think she would be glad he was out of danger but instead it acts like most children's children in the 1950s films). Doris Day is around in the first thirty minutes, and her laughter and song numbers are very enjoyable. Roman is also here, looking glamorous, while James Cagney mocks his persona of the screen and Gordon MacRae sings on his beautiful baritone. Jane Wyman also sings in a reopening of the hospital bed after Doris Day's lead, causing someone to ask herself, "Were they out of appliances?" For less demanding viewers, an interesting flashback to another time and place. Still, the production of low rents and the just and proper technical aspects make Starlift strictly a second billing. * 1/2 of ****
