This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Not just the story, but the acting is shockingly bad. The dialog box sounds like someone is reading the news. <br /> <br /> This is classified as comedy / drama / romance, it's not those things! It's a bit of action, that's it. There's really no comedy and drama at all. <br /> <br /> If you went to the movies to see this, I'm sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Almost everything else you choose will be better. This is practically an action / crime film. The action scenes sucked, and part of the crime story was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you are not really interested in a good story or good acting. And you simply want to look at a 'foreign' movie by the appeal of being a foreigner. So this may be for you.
