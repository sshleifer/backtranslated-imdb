This is a genuinely horrible movie. The plot (as it is) is totally indecipherable. (I think it has something to do with blackmail, but I'm not entirely sure.) <br /> Half of the dialogue consists of useless clich√©s. The other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of "Southern" accents that (thankfully) words can not be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the true tragedy of the film is that such historical talent as Mary Tyler Moore apparently was in such financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it. <br /> <br />
