I picked it up a few months ago on the Family Channel, and having a few memories of the TV show from my youth, I decided to watch it along with my 4-year-old daughter. I should have some psychedelic mushrooms to keep up with, because that's bizarre! It is not just a musical with annoyingly forgettable songs, the brutal effects and star appearances for a long time beyond its collective cousins, seems to have been produced as a good acid trip of somebody. Speaking flutes, British kids too old for this kind of crap ... in the words of Krusty the Klown "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I?" If you are a big fan of all of Sid and Marty Krofft's work, go ahead; otherwise, unless you're willing to loop before you watch, stay away, away, away.
