When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch, retreat and watch again and again and again until we faint or become too confused and hostile to support ourselves. So if you're an 11-year-old girl and you've reviewed this movie as "brilliant" or "fun" or "better than the original grease," you have your teenage hormones incipient to blame and you can be sure that this inflexible the fixation with all the garbage will pass. <br /> <br /> If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was nothing more than a superficial, indifferent and sloppy embarrassment to everyone who participated. in its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> Because of criticism, will I dignify the movie now explaining why it explodes? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with some debatable exceptions, the music is obscenely useless. Most of the songs seem to relate excessive and general sex hints ("Score Tonight", "Do It For Our Country" and "Prowlin '") without making a concrete statement about any of the songs. characters or themes of the film. Also, all the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the nastiest looks of a singing or dancing ability. <br /> <br /> 2. T birds must be hard and, if not, at least somewhat kind, but each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred jacket of the T-bird and starts him in the gang, Michael must kick her to the ground, spit on her and pull away to fervently rub any part of her body that was touched by him. . But of course, he accepts as if it were gold, because, despite the fact that they are a bunch of clumsy idiots, there is no greater honor than being one with the T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. As Michael is gorgeous, intelligent, kind, resourceful and above average in every way (despite his musical impotence), it is possible that Stephanie eventually embraces him when he turns out to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a cheek with a drooping chin, a sloppy jaw, a dirty sweater, grossly rude and bland. So besides being beautiful (I think), it has no favorable features, so the public has no justification for the depth of Michael's attraction to her. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I did not want to mention the gross inferiority with his predecessor, since there are apparently so many cranks out there that seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I'm going to say this, though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for the love of old times: Grease 2 is an experience similar to reliving your first kiss. Only now are you 32 and kissing a 13-year-old boy with an acne-clogged nose and gym equipment. The magic is gone and you are feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.
