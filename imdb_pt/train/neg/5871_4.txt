For me, the only reason to take a look at this remake was to see how bad and funny it could be. There was no doubt that it was funny and bad because I had seen "Voyna i mir" (1968). Shall we begin? Here we go ... <br /> <br /> Robert Dornhelm & Pierre Bezukhov by Brendan Donnison - a skinny guy who does not have the depth of the original; Natasha Rostova by Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - a scarecrow, her image can cause insomnia; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison, Andrej Bolkonsky - an OK incarnation who, as the skinny fellow (cf. above), lacks the depth of a Russian soul and "inner struggle"; Robert Dornhelm & Napoleon of Brendan Donnison - a rather blank leader; Robert Dornhelm & Prince Bolkonsky, by Brendan Donnison - a shit with an English face; Robert Dornhelm's Earl Bezukhov & Brendan Donnison - a frenzied spectacle ... The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> The actors' movements and the way they look and speak are often atrocious. They behave like modern EU citizens dressed for a one-day masquerade. Everything seems cheap and never comes close to the standards of our early 19th century Russian men and women. <br /> <br /> A good piece of entertainment to scrutinize and make fun of. We had some laughs in our office when we remembered this modern product, which was shown the night before on our TV. "I think, many young people have never watched our movie (" Voyna i mir "1968) or have a strange sense of quality" Tarantino- Spielberg ". Remember the scene where our hussar is saving his friend, if he turns around, shoots and the bridge explodes? It looks like an explosion of CGI. <br /> <br /> There is no sense or artifice to make a better version of the novel, which was displayed correctly in our country once. But I would be happy to watch a Russian remake of "Gone with the Wind". Hey, directors, wake up and get busy with this, instead of ruining our classics. <br /> <br /> Now, let's get back to common sense. Joking apart. What I mentioned above is nothing new, though exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Making foreign actors trying to get through Russians (while participating in very serious epics and dramas) is a gross mistake and the filmmakers are making that mistake. again and again. Of course this results in a lot of laughter - especially Clemence Poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and her dancing and singing makes a Russian spectator think, "This is so bad that it's funny!"). <br /> <br /> To say something new, I would like to mention the rhythm of the film. In my opinion, this new version is very irregular. The narration and the scenes do not flow naturally - they stagger and emerge as in a modern video. Once again I have to remember our "Voyna i mir" where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit and enjoy "going with the flow". <br /> <br /> I thought maybe the Battle of Borodino would be great (to somehow rehabilitate countless drawbacks), but it turned out to be no match for the war scenes filmed in 1968. <br /> < There should be something good in this movie, after all. And here it is. The actors seem to be struggling to make everything work. They did not get a chance from the start but still joined the losers team. One more point for such recklessness. This makes the Russian spectator uncomfortable - some scenes are ironically ridiculous, although they claim to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing the best they can. All this evokes pity and sometimes laughter. <br /> <br /> What I still like about this series is the last part of it. This shows very vividly how everyone gets their "salary and taxes". Also, judging by the movie trailers, I thought the movie would have an adult sex scene, which would definitely kill the whole project. But, fortunately, there is no such garbage. And that's a big plus. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not "Harry Potter" and today neither we nor here in present-day Russia have enough art to film it properly. Do I have to say that the moral quality of our lives has deteriorated immensely? Fortunately, an appropriate film was shown during our Soviet times. The American version of the 1950s was justified to some extent-ours still did not even exist. There were extenuating circumstances then. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is given from the start, 1 point is worthless for imprudence and 2 points for the last part of the series.
