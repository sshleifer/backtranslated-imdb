All of these reviewers are on site. I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years, believe me, and that hits a lot! <br /> <br /> This is not just a waste of time "so bad, it's good" for explorers, but a genuine, hilarious, Atrocity movie. <br /> <br /> CHECK OUT the furry type white monster thing! WASHING UP LAUGHING in the performance of "spell-weaving" by Thom Christopher! <br /> <br /> GAPE IN SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! in shabby assemblies! <br /> <br /> This is one of those "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear, some of the people who participate in the 'Wizards of the Lost Kingdom' are not really aware that they are appearing in a movie! <br /> <br /> FACT! I originally watched this movie on HTV Wales late at night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to trace a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really awful. This is. Even worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more laughable than all of John Derek's films, this is, in fact, the Citizen Kane of Trash.
