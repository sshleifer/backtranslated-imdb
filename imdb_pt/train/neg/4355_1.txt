Horrible. I see lots of user feedback on how good this show is. It really is a Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan imitation. The jokes are thighs like ... and the plot is ridiculous. The actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cowering when they hit those terrible jokes (if you can call them that). Most of the other reviewers who commented are obviously from another planet (or at least from another continent). Obviously, there are reasons why TV companies should cancel shows ... and none of them is when the shows are going well. Makes sense? Anyway, avoid - even if it's raining and there's absolutely nothing else on this planet to do ... go stay in the rain - more fun.
