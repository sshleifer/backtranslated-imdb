What a huge pile of manure. Stack of video video junk (REALLY bad, NOT digital). It is undoubtedly the stupidest thing ever done. The fact that this crap was actually released is completely ashy. Everyone who sees this will become more stupid to have watched. Seriously. I felt like I had killed several brain cells after I saw this crap. The positive comments of that $$ crap were obviously made by the filmmaker (and I use the term VERY freely) himself and / or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like that waste of life. Trust me, stay away from this video. You'll thank me for it. Avoid as herpes.
