Some time ago, I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but now he is the husband and Jude Law the lover of his wife. The story remains the same and is a fantastic piece. <br /> <br /> During the movie, I always had the feeling of watching a play. That's one of the reasons I do not like this remake of a classic. When I watch a movie, I have adapted a piece that I must still feel to see a movie and not just a play. Director Kenneth Brannigan has done some wonderful movies in the past, but this time he missed it. Another reason was the appearance of the film. The design was modern, stylish, clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never had the feeling that someone else had lived in that house. The photograph was not bad, but the lightning was horrible. Sometimes there was light blue, light green and dark, to round it, without being friendly to the eyes. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good. The performance of Michael Caine and Jude Law is better. I'd really like to see these two guys playing together on stage. But I have to confess that I was never a fan of Jude Law. The weaker part was the middle part. I remember that in the original, this part was still very mysterious and just wonderful. I tried to watch it twice and always in the middle of the part I felt asleep. The final part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not horrible, but it seems to be more of a movie to critics than to the public. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more fun than Sleuth (2007).
