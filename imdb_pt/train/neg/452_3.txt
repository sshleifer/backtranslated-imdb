I watched this movie for a project about love. please tell Nicolas Cage to know what it would feel like to be his character, and then reread the lines he is saying. My life can not go on ... I accidentally cut my own hand ... my brother was around. Obviously, it's his fault. And since when happy endings have included the cool guy who takes care of the sad and lonely mom. There is no closure, incorrect script, and no sufficient extension of secondary characters. Save yourself, unless your for a good laugh. Fantasies were done properly, and extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to do, but keep that genre more specific, I can not recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it's not an intellectual movie. It's not a girl's movie. It's not a strict romantic. And I can not show the kids because of the sex and the following questions. All in all, it just is not a good movie.
