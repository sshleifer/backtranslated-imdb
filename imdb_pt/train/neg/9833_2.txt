Falsely accused, fellow-chasing fellows John Wayne (as John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (as Kansas Charlie) change identity to become "Alias ​​Smith and Jones." Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones." Mr. Chandler must be "Rev. Smith," but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith." At no point are they as entertaining as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; though Wayne may be considered infinitely more successful than any of them in career terms. Beautiful blonde Mary Kornman (as Anne), grown from her days in "Our Gang", is a lovely interest for Wayne. She and Chandler have some cute scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of John Wayne's low budget films of the 1930s, this movie will not make you one.
