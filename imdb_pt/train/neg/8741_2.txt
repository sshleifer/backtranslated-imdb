Five minutes into this movie you realize you've seen it all before. IT'S BOILER. It's the company. AND IT'S THE DEVOU ATTORNEY. And there are no new elements here. Except for the allegory of Bill Gates. Conpsiracies are always good things to do movies, but why does it have to be so extreme? Boiler room is a good movie, because - at least for now - it seems realistic. In Antitrust everything is wrong. How realistic is it, for example, that your boss pays an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you? I would give 1, but the soundtrack is OK, then 2/10.
