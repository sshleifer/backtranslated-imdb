Tidy assumption. Very unrealistic. What I've learned from this movie is that the madly out-of-control speed to go to the weekend booth may not be the best idea after all. I loved how Bill conveniently gets out of the car and down the hill with no injuries! Unfortunately, the same can not be said for your girl. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or track the owner of the wreck. <br /> <br /> Several dragged scenes including a flat stripper (there are still nightmares from that scene). Poor assistant and his miserable and useless hand. I admit that I was intrigued to see what the mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HAHA HA !! The girl really looked sad with anger at being revived. Personally, I would really like a new body after an excruciating experience like that!
