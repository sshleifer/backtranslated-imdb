Quite a movie of the times - extremely long sequences without dialogue, bad flashbacks and an almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of less than 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men. <br /> O'Toole is fascinating whenever he talks; unfortunately, he spends much of his time peering through bushes. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see, but he is also terribly underused. <br /> <br /> The film has an additional positive aspect in that it portrays many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Many of today's World War II films paint the Allies as all good and the Axis as all evil, when history tells us that people are so much more complicated than that! <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie for when you are recovering from the flu and are curled up on the couch and can not absorb anything too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize, this is the movie for you.
