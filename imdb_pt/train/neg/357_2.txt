Just CAUSE shows Sean Connery as a law professor at Harvard, Kate Capshaw (she still gets work?) As his wife (little age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist cop from the south (!) And Ed Harris in a total interpretation . of a southern serial killer fundamentalist. <br /> <br /> Strange cast, but the movie plays seriously <br /> with the audience. (do not read if you are serious about watching this movie or watching this movie seriously because of the spoilers) First of all, I felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy without proof. The coroner, witnesses and even the defendant's lawyer collaborate against him (he is accused of rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. <br /> <br /> Connery is a Harvard law professor who falls in love with speeches about injustices against blacks and the barbarous death penalty. He is approached by the condemned's grandmother to defend him and reopen the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery is obstructed (yawning ...) by the small town authorities and the good boy club of IL, but finds that the case against Blair, the alleged killer, now on the death row, was all made. The main evidence was his confession, which was beaten by him. <br /> <br /> The beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even threw the Russian roulette to get his confession. Connery learns that another death row prisoner actually did the murder and after a few shows with a serious exaggeration, Edibris as Hannibal Lecter, he finds out where Harris hid the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> He receives a new trial and Blair is released. <br /> <br /> I think ... movie is over ... <br /> <br /> So, all of a sudden! It turns out that Blair is a psychotic psychotic and that he used "white guilt" to sign up for Connery. He invented the story with Ed Harris in exchange for Blair performing some murders for Harris. <br /> <br /> Blair is loose again, thanks to Connery's deceptive PC principles! The final 30 minutes is an odd action movie that features a cool drama, Connery and Fishburne battling the serial killer at an alligator house on stilts (yes, you read right) in the Everglades. <br /> <br /> This was a strange movie. <br /> <br /> So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are all just Abu Graib aggressors and torturers, but criminals are really psychotic and deserve to be fried. <br /> <br /> Truly depressing on all levels! The system is completely rotten and the white guilty types of PCs that challenge it are seriously deluded as well. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something.
