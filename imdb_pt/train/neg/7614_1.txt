This may be one of the worst films to come to production, ever. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning, where the guy is walking ... and walking ... and walking (spoiler). There is about a 15 minute walk. As? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention that there are many problems with lighting, and it is almost as if they had filmed the night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The performance was TERRIBLE. It seems they found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then took the people who were rejected. <br /> <br /> Please, for the love of all that is sacred, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, apologize to them. The director must be subject to punishment through the war crimes court for imposing this on the public.
