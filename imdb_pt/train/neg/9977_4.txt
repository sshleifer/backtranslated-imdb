This kid is very bad, but by no means makes him the type that outweighs adults and can thwart experienced thieves every step of the way. No, he is not so much a brat, as he is a child with serious emotional problems. A nice couple, who wants to adopt, loves to adopt him, and although the husband is a little more willing to give this child a chance, the mother is not. Through a bizarre character of Michael Richards and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have a pretty bad movie with a few laughs here and there. I really prefer the sequel to this movie as I like the fact that they've brought Amy Yasbeck back as a different kinder character since there are one to many characters in this movie who are completely unpleasant as is. Even the kid is quite annoying at first, and they calm him down in sequence as well. The plot is quite simple, however, as future parents will adopt this kid who they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party when they leave, they soon realize they have a little hell. Add to that this little hell by getting in touch with a convict of some kind. Not sure about this character, at first I thought it was to be her real father or something. Not so good, but I'll pick this out before the Culkin kid any day of the week.
