This low budget horror B plot comes with all the amenities - mad scientist complete with sidekick, malicious corporate greed from the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering, and information technology .... can not let that go off. <br /> <Start with strange strings of hot-looking anonymous sailors who foolishly decide to take a dip in the waters near an unexplored island and end up preparing to swarm hammerhead sharks ..... <br /> Cut to weak background story that implies the decline of the actions of a generic pharmaceutical corporation that motivates his evil Shakespeare by citing the CEO to receive an unsolicited offer made by a former employee / scientist who was relieved of his job as head of research and which is also a nut ... clear (total Herbert West wannabe). He is offering a new stem cell technology that could make tons of money ... or so it seems ... This attracts several employees to his island Moreau-ish (must have been a pretty impressive output package from the company when he was released for him to pay an island) to validate his scientific findings, including the CEO and coincidentally the ex-fianc√© of the mad scientist's son has now become sharkuman (as convenient) .... The plan, of a certain way, is to rekindle the love lost between the first nuptials, while demanding revenge of the ex-colleagues by his dismissal. (Sheez, how can this guy be bitter? He has his own friggen island after all ...). <br /> <br /> Soon, everyone is fleeing (from an endless supply of security guards carrying heavy weapons, mutant plants - can there be an unexplored island without man-eating plants?, the lamb's child's appetite by carnage, plans to create charlatan and lack of a cell phone signal) ... and everyone must learn to work together to get out of the island alive! <br /> <br /> Will anyone escape? Will a new species be created? Watch and find out. <br /> <br /> There is some entertainment value in this movie, but do not expect too much ... for the real Combs fan, this is not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn.
