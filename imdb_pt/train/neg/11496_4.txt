a manipulated / manipulated documentary about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. portrayed as a fun, safe place ... but sad, a group of sex workers can play on a football team, mounted on what seems like no more than a week! the main focus of the documentary is to prove that society repels such "workers", even though no solution for these poor women is achieved, except that the people who documented this made them a kind of "stars" (as well as the title says yes) in exchange for being exploited for making this reality show documentary. has, however, its own documented reality ... but, unfortunately, this has nothing to do with the main plot. I would not agree to see him again; but I would only recommend for general cultural purposes.
