I felt like I was watching the Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and a slightly different storyline. I'll say the cars in the movie are really cool. So, if you like fast cars, you'll probably find this movie slightly fun. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her in Days of our Lives. She's a great singer, but it's a pity they gave her some bad songs to sing in that movie. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would do here on the radio. Since it's a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a bit, but in real life I do not think an average guy would come across a hot girl like Nadia Bjorlin, who can drive a race car, fix a car. engine, and be a vocalist. It's all very silly. <br /> <br /> Another side note, anyone who is willing to bet 25 million on a car race is crazy. But it was kind of cool in the end, when Natasha stopped before the finish line and messed up Michael. Invaluable. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for car freaks. So if you like fast cars, then I highly recommend this.
