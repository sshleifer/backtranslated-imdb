The third part of the "Carnosaur" trilogy features a bunch of quality Keystone Kops military commands trying to kill two Velociraptors and a T-Rex. I give a 4 of pure sympathy and my affinity with the dinosaurs. The film is definitely the worst of the trilogy, really can not be taken seriously. Most significantly, however, watching this movie I can not help but notice some interesting parallels between the trilogies "Carnosaur" and "Xtro". The first part in both franchises is a dark and disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an "Alien" movie, and the third is an ironic, almost comedy (intentional or otherwise) movie that has you rolling in the floor, laughing. Also, like the "Xtro" franchise, all "Carnossaurus" movies are completely alien to each other. They only carry the name of the franchise to arouse interest in the "strings," I think. Obviously, "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups working here, but if you've seen all three films from both franchises, you find yourself going back and forth between the two.
