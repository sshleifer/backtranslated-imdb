Imagine The Big Chill with a cast of twentysomethings whose characters are all nasty, and an iguana-like man lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of ​​the madness here. On the plus side, the movie does not skimp on showing the monster. There are no photos of peek-a-boo, or night scenes where you have to imagine how he is; he's out there folks. Unfortunately, the design and construction are not so inspired. A little mystery could have helped. You see, I've seen much worse, but if you're going to put it on display for a lot of film, your monster looks better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead !!! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's a twist involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense. This was not a surprise given the poor script writing. As for the performance; well let's just say it was not painfully bad, but I do not expect that we'll see a lot of these kids in future movie releases. <br /> Gore quotient: 2 out of 5; Nudity quotient: 1 in 5; Intelligence quotient: insignificant
