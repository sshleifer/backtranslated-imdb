As far as I can tell, despite previous comments posted by other commenters, this movie is currently available on DVD. I met only a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's on the Value DVD label and I paid the full 98 cents plus tax for it. I found it in a 98-cent store between shelves of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Now do not you people who disbursed beau coup bucks for the limited edition version of Swedish import super-duper feel like they had ??? I thought that way. <br /> <br /> This movie really worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I could start arguing with you. But clearly it's worth 98 cents. And remember this by saying about getting what you pay for. Only for horror movie experts.
