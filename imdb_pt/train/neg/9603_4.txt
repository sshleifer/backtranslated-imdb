"A young woman suffers from the illusion that she is a werewolf, based on a familiar legend of an ancestor accused and killed for allegedly being one." Because of her past treatment of men, she travels the countryside seducing and killing the men she meets. by a gentle man, her life seems to change for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of bandits. Traumatized again by these latest events, the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge against the bandits, " according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> "La magnum mannara" by Rino Di Silvestro begins with a full frontal dance, twisting and moaning by well-done Annik Borel, who (as Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between the legs. The flashback opening reveals that his hairy ancestor was (probably) a licantropic creature. Mrs Borel is not, unfortunately, a werewolf; she's just a very strong lunatic. As a movie, "Werewolf Woman" would have been better if Borel's character was really a female werewolf; with its sexual victimization a great characterization. But as far as the skin and blood movements of the 1970s go, this is hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is naked or sexually dressed throughout the film, which features a fair amount of blood gore. Stunning Dagmar Lassander (as Elena) and handsome Howard Ross (as Luca) are good supporting players.
