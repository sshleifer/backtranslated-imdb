The fourth feature "Tremors" goes back in time, to the year 1889. "The Legend Begins" in the small town of "Perfection," which was then "Rejection, Nevada." When the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the gruesome "Grab√≥ides". Some of the characters in the current "Tremors" movies have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. The most obvious is the ever-directed Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Gross is inept with guns; so he hires gunslinger Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot some "Dirt Dragons". <br /> <br /> This takes a while to get used to - as it does in the distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original movie "Graboids" monster. These "Dirt Dragons" tamers are far from as terrifying as their "Tremors" counterparts (1990). Consequently, in this movie, the characters spend a lot of time on the floor, which would not have happened in the original movie. And it was strange to have the citizens giving up the fight so quickly, when Gross temporarily decides to leave the city. Why so helpless? Why did Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) not immediately meet people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S.
