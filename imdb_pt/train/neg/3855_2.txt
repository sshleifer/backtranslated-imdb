The only redemption was the small part of Larry Miller. It looked like the movie was trying too hard to be "Something About Mary", but I did not even like that movie and it still fell short of those standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair is stuck in the stupidity of her character Cruel Intentions. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father seemed to be trying very hard to be the Randy Quaid character from the National Lampoon films.
