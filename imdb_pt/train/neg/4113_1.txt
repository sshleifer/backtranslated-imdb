I have to finish watching a movie once I start, regardless of how bad it is. This movie was agonizing to sit on. The "sparkling" bullets, the reporter with "ninja" as it moves, the way the thugs shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seem to hit innocent bystanders, the predictable result and all the bad acting was simply horrible. Like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends apartment and goes from "what the hell are you doing here (holding a stick)" to "hey, you're cute, want @ # $%!" in 1.2 seconds ... Just bad ... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids (or dog)!
