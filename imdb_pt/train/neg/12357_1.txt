I'll be short and to the point. This movie was an insult to anyone with an IQ at room temperature. Sorry, liberals, feminists, etc. No woman will ever be a Seal. They may forget the draft or be in combat as well. Will not happen. You see, difficult as it is to understand or accept, men and women are physically different. Regardless of the fact that it is 2007, reality can not change things so that people will not let their feelings hurt. Men can not give birth or breastfeed babies (Oh-I forgot Saint Franfreako). <br /> <br /> Women do not have the physical strength to be on the same level as men in combat or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Lastly, I could not give a bloody whistle in hell if what I just wrote upset you. Come think about it - if it upsets you, it only warms my heart the most. I did not write something that was not the truth. This imbecilic movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one.
