Come on, what's the problem with this show, Power Rangers anyway? I always felt that the show, which was originally brought from Japan in a better way, took what was great in Japan, and became one of the most ridiculous and meaningless excuses in the history of toy merchandising! There is absolutely no point with this show. <br /> <br /> Bad haircuts, bad clothes, earrings, etc., all show what was ridiculous in the 90s Of the two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to the "duhs" of the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME A ROMANCE! <br /> <br /> Saban brought this from Japan, and after Disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the audience has to endure reruns of this show on the Disney Channel and such. <br /> <br /> All I can say one more time is give me some time!
