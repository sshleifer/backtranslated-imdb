This was a watchable film, but the plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of Rodney's previous films. With that said, it was well worth the time to watch. I gave this 5 out of 10. So basically it's one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see, but if you find it in the tube, give it a try.
