A Stinko from a movie with a frayed plot and, to be kind, acting less than the caliber of the Oscar. But for me the only more serious flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet plane, and especially a 747. Some of the main mistakes: 1. No Flight Engineer (or even a 2. Intermittently identify the F-16 interceptors as F-15) 3. Charge passengers in a supposedly accessible "rear luggage compartment" - Even if such a compartment existed, putting so much weight that much back would make the aircraft useless 4. Pointy bullets that "would not damage the aircraft" 5. The entire landing procedure was so bad that I wanted to vomit. SR-71 (of all airplanes) with a pressure hatch 7. Opening a cabin door out - to the wind - in flight !! <br /> <br /> Oh fuck, it was just a really bad movie. the list of the last 10 of the year.
