This is the most elementary type of traditional ghost story, not even livened up largely by the use of Irish sites. If the great M.R. James ever invented such a thin story - James does not, in fact, have a story called "A Thin Ghost"? He would not have bothered to publish it. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles appears on the bottom as a favor to old friends, producers of this film. His presence and the internal joke of the film industry deserve this Oscar nomination. This is further proof, if need be, that Oscar has never been a guarantee of merit.
