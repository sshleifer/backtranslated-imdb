First, I realize that a "1" rating should be reserved for the worst of the worst. This film takes it from me because, as a critic points out, it's not bad in a self-conscious and exaggerated way that may allow it to have some comic or cult value. It simply loses its mark on all accounts. ** Contains possible spoilers ** The dialog box is completely false. Continuity is so deliberate that it is painful. Daniel has just spoken of his lost love and, with his last word, the flamenco dancers begin. The mock-shock of her name (see? I do not even remember the name of her character, much less the name of the forgettable actress) when her husband (Baldwin) tells her that her friend is the villain. The car and the motorcycle chased the right things. Vegetable carts were gone. Cars hitting each other. Motorcycles down the stairs. People almost being stricken but remarkably, no one is. Oh, that's right ... except for the one guy who was stabbed multiple times, he's obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds, and an approaching car apparently did not notice him there. Hmmm <br /> <br /> It's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made. There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money, you would think that someone in Hollywood would think about making good movies worth watching. Now there's a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not watch this movie. Do not rent the DVD. Do not watch the cable. There are many other things you can do to make you more satisfied.
