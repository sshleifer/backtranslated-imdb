Dire dire dire. The script is invented, the acting is painful and the story just creeps. It is undoubtedly a celebration of Sally Potter and little else. This would not be so bad, but she is the director, writer and star of the film, and so it is just self-glorification. I found myself not caring about the developing romance between the two main characters, and the ending did not come too soon. It has two redemptive features. The first is that many of the scenes are very beautiful, particularly in Paris, and look very good in black and white. Secondly, whether you are a tango fan or not, the music is generally excellent (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk, or if you need an unintentional laugh. I'm sure it appeals to someone. Statistically, you have to.
