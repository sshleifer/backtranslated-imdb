It's as the title of this topic says. The only impression I got from this movie is that Marlee Matlin's character was always angry, so cynical and so pathetic. Their character's first encounter with the character of William Hurt, where they were dancing, was dumb. All in all, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and from the four times I fell asleep. I would continue to watch this movie with an intention ... to overcome my problem with insomnia, because all I do is put myself to sleep. Sweet dream.
