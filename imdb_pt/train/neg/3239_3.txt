Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I honestly have to say that I was disappointed at the whole series ("He Never Dies", "Mermaid in a Manhole", and "Flower of Flesh and Blood" being the exceptions ... and even those that are not good at all ...), but "Devil's Experience" just blows. There is nothing realistic going on here except the climax (or perhaps anti-climax, depending on how you see it). The victim does not seem to mind what is happening and barely grunts or whimpers while being subjected to "hideous" (more often sometimes "hilarious") torture. "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is a more violent and bloody representation of fake "snuff" material, but this film also falls flat on the level of realism. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the limits, and they have really come a long way over the past two decades to use the crown in the production of "extreme" movies, but "The Devil's Experience" simply does not hold. It's worth taking a look if you're stubborn, if for no other reason, besides seeing what it's all about, but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's just for the needle-through eye scene ...
