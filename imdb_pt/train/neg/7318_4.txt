This is a depressing, superficial, naive and bland look at a highly improbable relationship between the psychotic movie editor Brooks and Harold, his insipid girlfriend. The two have ZERO chemistry together - mainly because Harold is unable to do anything but look beautiful at this stage of his career; but also because the character of Brooks is not interesting or pleasant. There are 15 static and excruciating minutes at the beginning, where Brooks, having just broken up with Harold, stumbles into his apartment in a depressed and drugged state - unbearable. <br /> <br /> Joe Cocker's book "You Are So Beautiful," there simply is not enough material here for a feature film. There is almost nothing happening at the periphery of your relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world. I'm sure Brooks's intention was to shine a white spotlight on the case and, in a way, deconstruct it; but if you do that, writing and acting need to be much better than what is here.
