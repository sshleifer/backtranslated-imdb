I'll have to disagree with the previous review and stay on the Maltin side of this. This is a second-rate, over-cruel Western, groaning and groping trying to get its central theme of the Old West tamed and kicked aside by the constant march of time. He would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid," but he does not have the poignancy and charm of that movie. Andrew McLaglen's direction is flaccid, and the final 30 minutes are a real flaw, with an incomprehensible strategy from the heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Somebody give me a shout if you can explain why they burned this slope.) There was something insensitive about the treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction afterwards certainly did not seem true. Coburn is very unpleasant, since the half-breed escaped convicted of revenge, but all his companions of escape are underdeveloped (they are like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story throws). Michael Parks gives one of his typically evasive, lethargic and grumpy performances, but in this case it was appropriate, since his modern-style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring.
