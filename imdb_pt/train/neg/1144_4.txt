Recap: Dr. Markov has developed a new theory on how to produce energy, knowledge that can unbalance the world. He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants to leave the Soviet Union. The KGB on the other side desperately wants the new technology. So they put a schematic in motion. During a rescue attempt to free Markov, the KGB intervenes, takes Markov to a secret location and pulls him in to reveal his secret saying they are in Sweden and working for the UN. As a substitute, the KGB kidnaps Markov's estranged daughter. The CIA now sends its best agents, a team of ninjas (Swedish?) To thwart the KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: A cult movie that, although not very good, needs to be seen. The film is quite ambitious, but lacking in many areas. First of all, it is very dark, probably to hide places and bad effects, that some scenes are difficult to understand. You can not see what's happening. The second thing missing is the martial arts, despite being a ninja movie. Of course there are some, of rather poor quality, but mostly the ninjas fire automatic weapons or sets of explosions. Automatic weapons are also a problem as they seem to have an infinite supply of ammunition. And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets, while Soviet guards die like flies. <br /> <br /> What do you have to say about it? The idea and ambition above all else. Some, in fact, and especially for a Swedish film, decent action scenes, though not martial arts. Some nice slow-motion scenes and a lot of blood and blood. And some very interesting new weapon technologies that make the heart or brain of the victims explode. Mostly all the parts you're looking for in a B movie. <br /> <br /> Because it's definitely a B movie, no mistake could be made there. But if you wait, and watch it as a B movie, it's fun. But do not forget, it's not just a B movie that is set in the eighties. Some girls, for example, in addition to wearing ... say "interesting" clothes, have lethal doses of shade and makeup. <br /> <br /> In all, we see the status of worship and ambition. Enjoy and then forget it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
