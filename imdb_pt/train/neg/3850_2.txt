I saw this movie on SXSW with the director present. Many people left, and the public barely got polite applause in the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at this festival, Frownland is among the worst. <br /> <br /> At 106 minutes, they are at least 95 minutes too long. You can watch the frustrated and prolonged communication attempts of the main character in real-time extended. The same masks, deliver mouth movements, words and kinetic syllables and frantically repeated over and over again - WE CAN POINT. <br /> <br /> A website actually compares this work to the beginning of Mike Leigh. In what drugs would you have to be to make that statement? Since Frownland is a song by Captain Beefheart, you may have to take advantage of the Trout Mask Replica in high rotation to enjoy this movie. Unbelievably, this won a jury prize at the festival. You can bet you did not win an audience award.
