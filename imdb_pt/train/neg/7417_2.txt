This movie is so bad - dialogues, stories, actors and actresses - everything! "It's hard to imagine we'll see a worse movie this year or the next." "Love's Brother" has nothing but superficial clich√©s about Italian culture to offer, and it is quite revealing that even Italians in Italy speak English in the film. The message of the movie - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is truly uncomfortable. Giovanni Ribisi is very good at films like "Suburbia" or "Lost in Translation", but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Trash as trash!
