Words really can not describe how bad this movie is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least that had good pictures and occasionally a good chin stroking moments here and there to keep him from napping. This is laughable! Terrible script, bad direction, acting horrible and you know what? I can not think of a single thing to recommend about this other than the fact that it is not too long. If you want 100 minutes of entertainment, book yourself at the dentist and get some root canal work - much more enjoyable and much better value for the money (assuming you have to!). Incidentally, I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. THIS IS TERRIBLE!
