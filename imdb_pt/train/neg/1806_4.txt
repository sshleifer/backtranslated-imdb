Antonioni's films did not age well. What has always surprised me about them is that, beyond unquestionable plastic beauty, there is a tedious and didactic "psychology" of the characters and situations. Remember, for example, the conversations between Mastroianni and the "perverse capitalist" who wants to call him "La notte," or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants flirting on the train in "La aventura," or Ferzetti dropping the ink cup at the end of the same movie. <br /> <br /> I reviewed yesterday "Zabriskie Point". In this film there are many cool and elaborate photos of the Rod Taylor office, the streets and highways of Los Angeles, commercials, deserts, etc., which show the author's fascination on his American journey, the same as Wim Wenders years later . Unfortunately, there are a lot of hippie-leftist cliches that spoil the movie: - The kid leaves the meeting, steals a plane, and flies over the desert to break free and find "something different." "Gray suite executives talk about speculation all the time. - The girl looks at the "object women" in the pool and leaves because she does not want to be like them. - The middle-class fat couple in the caravan speaks, in the face of the beauty of nature, to build a hotel and make a lot of money. Last but not least, many couples make love in the desert. What a hippie platitude! <br /> <br /> Sorry, today, half a century after the "revolution" of "La Aventura", we can see that the king is naked, and his films (except "Le amiche" and maybe "Il grido") are just a handful of aestheticism and commonplace.
