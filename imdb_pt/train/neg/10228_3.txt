To be honest I had heard that this was pretty bad before I decided to watch it, but I'm never one to let others influence my visions, in fact I'm more likely to watch something by challenge. Bullwhip had something in my favor before the sight anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were in him interested me immediately. The image is not very good, and in fact it is very morally dubious, all the characters are corrupt and clever in a way or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, this is good if the movie around can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a shattering picture of climax. Unfortunately that does not happen, and when the ending fills your eyes with sugar, you can not help shouting that you were cheated to watch a very bad movie, no one in the cast leaves with no credit, with actor Guy Madison painfully wood in the extreme. <br /> <br /> Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10
