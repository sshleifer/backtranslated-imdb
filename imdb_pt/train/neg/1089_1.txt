What about Robert "pretentious" Altman? Was he saving on lighting? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable. I mean, have you ever seen a law firm where everyone works by candlelight? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, do not waste time on anything that Altman does: it's all a pretentious waste of film.
