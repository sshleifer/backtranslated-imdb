The ALARMIST is so abysmally scripted that you think to yourself why a promising actor like David Arquette has agreed to participate. It has to be one of the weaker plots I've ever seen and without any humor, it borders the brink of boredom. He comes to a terrible conclusion that seems only to happen because the director was bored and just wanted to finish quickly to get home for dinner. To stay away!.
