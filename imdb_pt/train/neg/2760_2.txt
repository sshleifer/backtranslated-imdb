I knew it was not a fight between me and D-wars from the moment we met. First his title was lazy. D war. As it was written, Dragon was too much for them. Also ... you really can not be so glaring at your title unless your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever he wants. <br /> <br /> The second sign of a complicated relationship between us was the insane progression of history. Here's the movie, the dreamy reporter reports big tracks of snakes, flashes back to a time when he and dad got in what must have been the store dispute in gremlins and the dreamy reporter boy finds a box that shines. The old store reveals several terrible truths. That Bauraki a supposedly evil snake was deceived by his chance to be a god. tells the boy that he is a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in Los Angeles is his reincarnated lover and gives him a piece of jewelry. The store also reveals that, despite its obvious whiteness, it is a 500-year-old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, the dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half-crazy trying to find this random girl. Following are cgi hijinks and in the last ten minutes my brain melts from my nose. Because? Continue with the dear reader if you have the Balls. <br /> <br /> So Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own flashbacks. I have the benefit of having a best Asian friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and do a lot of posters with Asian characters in them, he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what they are doing. It is a Korean legend and reincarnated of a Korean princess, but everything is in Chinese. Later that night, her dragon tat starts to ache, she calls the police because it looks like she is having a heart attack. See, in this crazy mixed world they apparently deal with heart attacks differently, because the next time we see her, she's locked in her bedroom with a guard outside and a nurse claims she's crazy. I have a new phobia now, and that is that if I'm in trouble, lifeguards will simply assume I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another point of contention with my hard lover, Dwar. There is a scene in which Patrick Dempsey Jr (dreamy reporter) is at a cafe with a daring black friend. In previous scenes Miffed Near divinity Bauraki killed an elephant, slid through a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. You see, people were scared to leave after September 11 happened, but we must have hardened after the decisive coffee and pastry were worth risking our lives. As usual, no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine. If I stay in and fear for my life, the serpentine terrorists and deities will win. <br /> <br /> After receiving a suitable dragon in a helicopter battle, my cruel lover Dwar treats me with a scene full of pi $$ and vinegar to end it all. Bauraki has a fortress of his own and his right under LA I think. They do not really say, but Dreamer Reporter and Sarah are knocked out in a car accident that would kill smaller men and when they wake up, yes, dragon palace. some delayed dialogue after a good god snake dragon appears out of nowhere and the snakes fight / make love whatever. And I'm not joking good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think I'm blowing out of proportion, I'm no mention of this thing in the movie, suddenly ... there! A few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god, puts Baurki on fire, Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with the dragon-god, dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits ... thank God <br /> <br /> Now our relationship as rocky as it was has had its good times. There was a face that looked like a turtle grinder and spoke exactly like a star war invader. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, could never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where this was not useful. He could go on in his dreams, when that did not come, and he could light up ten soldiers randomly on fire, but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touching that garbage thing. I like him because he got hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic noises. <br /> <br /> The actors for the most part were great ... if they somehow meant something terrible. Jason Behr, whom I found incredible in Roswell I slowly discovered that I can only act in a way and this is pretentious, spatial and Patrick Dempsey "ish". <br /> <br /> The only thing I love about this filthy prostitute is Dwars. his lead actor, Bauraki. That giant snake acted with its heart out. I would dare to say that he was better at playing a demigod of evil CGI serpentine, then John Barrymore was playing Richard III or Hamlet. There was excitement in every scene, stealing the thunder of his least supporting cast. When he ate an elephant I felt as if no one past, present or future would ever eat an elephant with so much feeling. He was more than an actor, he was a force of nature and put his heart and soul in every second of this cursed project. Yeah, damn, my favorite actor in this movie was a cgi snake. I dare admit it, do not I? <br /> <br /> I hope Bauraki has more work and is not the type of cast, that Jason Behr finds a variety of emotions besides looking dreamy, and this I never have to watch Blue Monkey again. <br /> <br /> So, D-War is over. I want my CDs back and we'll just be friends.
