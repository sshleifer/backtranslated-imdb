The Danish film "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me to be the worst film I've seen so far. I did not think it was possible to top my list of bad bad movies, but this one deserves the gold. It's not funny. It's bad acting, it's badly filmed and the plot is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has three girls. I really believe this movie has the potential to hit the other Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the most evil Danish film ever made! And that's really something. Congratulations in advance!
