Nothing positive to say. Meandering nonsense, snorting and snorting with a "message." New Russian (post-Soviet) films may be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind), but many have the cardboard bouquet and the residual taste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a kind of empty "dozor". To act would be horrible if it were not for the saving grace of an extremely unpleasant direction and an incompetent edition that is sometimes so terrible that it diverts attention from the impotence of the actors. Special prize to the cameraman for making sure every shot is unstable (could anyone please understand that Blair Witch had his 15 seconds of undeserved fame?) And the takes are aimed at attention-deficit pre-teens that decline in CounterStrike and masturbation. The female protagonist poses and tries to appear seductive all too often, the male anti-hero needs a diction trainer (although the genetics are not bad: rather expressive eyes). One finger (middle) to that irrelevant stack of non-art. Anyone who reviews this positively better will be a (distant) cousin of the "authors".
