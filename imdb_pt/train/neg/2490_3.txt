What a sad sight these TV sitters do, exhausting the clock on their careers by stumbling on a rusty little boat on a ship may be more appropriate. All production seems cheap and routine, and is not aided by a "big name" star who barely cites the few lines he reliably gave. <br /> <br /> support the cast above the material; they are clearly watching the clock here. Knock off the scenes, get the paycheck, go home, and try to forget all about it. <br /> <br /> It's not particularly badly scripted or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's totally nondescript and filmed in a very limited number of tight sets with a small cast of extras. The pace is a bit bizarre; an embarrassingly hesitant romantic sub-storyline is only started after the main action, which makes it feel irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Maiden Voyage scores two points for being punctuated with competence and for being a fun game of "detecting Kiwi bit parameters"; the majority of the cast is formed by Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The saddest thing about this production is that this movie is probably a great chance.
