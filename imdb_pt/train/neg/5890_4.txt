This romantic comedy is not so bad. There are some funny things going on here and there, and there are some memorable characters. <br /> <br /> The acting, however, is amateur (with the exception of the banker). While some scenes are a lot of fun, others are just embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the story poor. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies. It's not really a bad movie, and the ending was really good. Just do not expect anything out of the ordinary. It's fair if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
