A drama that is not capable of making any real sense. So she became an actress - so what? She learned to love - great thing. There is a certain eccentricity between the characters and in the dialogue and situations, but the kind that is bad for the movie, making it look absurd. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix, interpreting leadership, talks and behaves. as a semi-retarded person, then there is no choice but to watch the movie as a retarded girl who succeeds in the theater world - clearly not the intended goal. We are told from the very beginning (in that narrative similar to "Barry Lyndon") that she learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone face, but the film suffers from it. She basically walks around like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not creditworthy, given her lack of emotions. Occasionally, the film had that somber, sleepy feel of a Dogma 95 movie. Is it a? I would not be surprised. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late River Phoenix. Nepotism rarely works. <br /> <br /> If you would like to see my Hollywood Nepotism List with over 350 photos / entries, please contact me by email.
