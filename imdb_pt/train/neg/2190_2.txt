** Possible Spoilers Ahead ** Jason (aka Herb) Evers is a brilliant neurosurgeon who, along with his wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the faintest car crash on the screen of all times. Leith is beheaded and the doctor takes his noggin cut back to his mansion and rejuvenates his head in his laboratory. The exterior of the mansion was allegedly filmed on the Lyndhurst estate in Tarrytown; the lab scenes were apparently filmed in someone's basement. The bandaged head is kept alive in "laboratory equipment" that is almost enough for Ed Wood. Some of the library's songs - the highlight of the film - appeared later in Andy Milligan's THE BODY BENEATH. Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical discourses with another of Ever's mistakes, a mutant chained in the closet. Meanwhile, the good doctor rounds the joints looking for a body worthy of his wife's gabby pasta. The ending, in uncut prints, features some splatter and dismemberment ahead of its time when the zucchini head monster comes out of the closet to bring the film to a welcome finish. This thing took three years to be released and then the audience gave the bad reception she deserved. Among these, PLAN 9 OF THE OUTER SPACE and some others, 1959 should have been declared The Year of Turkey.
