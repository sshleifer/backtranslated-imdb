I can not say that I am so experienced in misty Mundae movies having seen only a handful but it is obvious that this was done with little money, and although it may have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a Tomb Raider rip -off within a garage, it's not because it's completely obvious that this is what they were doing. The movie only lasts forty-five minutes, and that's definitely a good thing, since there's almost not enough room to stretch it any longer. It has something to do with an evil Nazi scientist (who looks as evil as a porn star playing a Nazi scientist), a mummy, who is clearly a man wrapped in toilet paper and Misty - the version of this Tomb Raider movie. , who keeps her top for much less time than Angelina Jolie did on the big budget version. I have to say that despite their shortcomings, this movie could have been better. There's Misty Mundae to start with, and even better than that, if you ask me is the fact that Darian Caine is also starring even hotter. The couple begins to get involved in all the lesbian sex you would expect from a Seduction Movie movie and this at the expense of the non-existent plot, although this is not really a bad thing. Obviously this is a junk movie - but the fact that it is short is to your credit, and if you are after a bit of lesbian sex, you could do worse.
