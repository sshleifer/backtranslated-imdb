You know what kind of movie you're getting into when the main character serial killer is being transported to the electric chair (in what appears to be a bakery truck), only to have the prison vehicle colliding with (and I'm not doing this above) a genetically engineered tank truck. Goo soar it melts, and blows its DNA through the snow, creating our protagonist, the snowman's killer. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie, however, is an over-the-shoulder dose of the snowman struggling in some poor pitiful, in which his hands look suspiciously like a pair of white gloves of kitchen oven. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, schlock ...
