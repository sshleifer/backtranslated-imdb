argh! This movie hurts my head. and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just my growing hatred for the genre of action, but even as a kid, when I swallowed tripe like Navy Seals, I still saw this movie with dislike. now I absolutely despise it. <br /> <br /> Give a good story at a fast pace. Hold the title and throw the rest away. instead use a gladiator plot that is half-full of holes and so full of tangles that they risk collapsing (why is there a rebellious base in the middle of the arena? and the cameras? in the bakersfeild in an unprotected room? ) <br /> <br /> The whole movie screams from the 80s, from the horrible truley to the bright and silly costumes. ugh <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. I know some people like it, but some people do get it done and I do not understand it either.
