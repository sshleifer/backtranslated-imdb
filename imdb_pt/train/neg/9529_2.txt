This 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), hoping to help in locating a residence they do not seem to find. But these two have other plans in mind, when they discover that George's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, tying George, killing a deliveryman and destroying the place all in one night. Bizarre and disturbing movie, but the two arrive there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends. Most do not like it or get caught up in this ridiculous movie after about 30 minutes. Anyway, some even consider it a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
