This has to be the cheapest film made in the 21st century. It's all the way low quality, but in the end it drops down ... everything. All cheap tricks - like flash and darkness - are used to hide those low-quality computer effects. <br /> <br /> All the actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene where Anne is asked, "Why do you look so careless?" The correct answer is because it can not act. No matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid smile on her face. <br /> <br /> It's not just the movie, it's B-quality. It is also the description of the back cover (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray -Vessel, Capital -Vessel and main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like a different movie, both with characters called Fletcher and Sea Monsters
