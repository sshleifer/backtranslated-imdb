The fact that this movie made it all the way up to the rentalrack in Norway is bizarre. This movie is just awful. This image quality is just a little better than that of a cell phone and the plot is soooo bad. The main character is simply boring and the rest is a drug. Every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this movie put their name on it is extraordinary. And distributors; they saw that!? This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. To label this, a comedy is an insult to humanity. Please do not support this movie by buying or renting.
