This was shown on the biography channel and was as informative as a children's comic book! I gave him 2 out of 10 for his attention to detail because mostly he had a 70's feel and the three women who played the original three angels looked like them, so the make-up was good. <br /> <This should be a biography on the biography channel, but it was empty of everything normally seen in one of his biographies. There are no interviews with surviving cast members, team members, production team members etc., or your friends, family members and any biographers of these people. In fact, I know as much about the program as I did before watching this movie based on the (supposedly) biographical book. As for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and it was not well known that it never happened.
