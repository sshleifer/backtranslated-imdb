I'll put it here, this was the worst sequel to a classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney launched what I consider to be one of its greatest films of all time. Now take out the great songs, add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. "Put it all together and what do you get?" the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After I saw this, I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should have ended with "and they lived happily ever after." not this rubbish. This movie did not deserve a sequel like that. I thought it would be like "a turnaround in time" which was moderate but better than that. Also, what do we take care of Anastasia? She switched sides like Iago, but she did not help anyone.
