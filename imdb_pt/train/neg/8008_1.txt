For Daniel Auteuil, "Queen Margot" was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, `Paris, Texas' was much better. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges ("Crisscross" and "A World Apart" can not be compared to this one), and Goran Bregovic for using a version of the same musical theme of "Queen Margot" for this film (Attention to the end of movie). If this was an American pop movie, I would not be surprised; but for a European film with more independent actors and director, a similar common approach on child abuse without any original perception is very simplistic and disappointing. There are those thugs who kidnap and sell underage people. There are those poor children who hate people selling them and waiting to be saved by someone. And finally, there is that great hero who kills all thieves and saves those poor children of bad guys. Each character is shown in simple black and white terms: good versus evil. Besides, from the beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I believe the difficult issue of molestation of children and pedophilia is much more complex than the way it is portrayed in this not very original film. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.
