pokemon the movie was a terrible movie. Unlike the first, this is not a good movie. the graphics were decent, but the story was flat and no real drama was built into it. in the first, the interaction between the characters was decent. the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was poor. Tracey does not really have much to say or do, and unlike Brock does not offer any comic relief. The only good point is that you get to see nebulously, in fact, get furious with ashes, and your initial concern at being called girlfriend was fun. Overall, this movie is not worth rented and the short before did not do anything for me or my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans. Oh well, maybe the next one is better.
