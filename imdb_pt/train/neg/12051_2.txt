This movie is "fascinating", but in the same way that a car accident is fascinating. It's hard to look away. Overall, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and a futile and biased experiment. The filmmakers are manipulators and seem to have no problems at the lowest possible denominator. The way money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intermediate steps that the filmmakers forced Ted to attend (meeting with the so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's later years and further exploit Ted's situation. The worst part is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months; and apparently are totally excluded from the subject they had followed so closely months before. If they had cared, they would have found better "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do then they should let him spend the money without any intervention. This film is, at best, a feat of Jackass and not a documentary. It's sad to think about how much $ 100,000 really could have changed the life of a homeless person if it had been put in the right hands.
