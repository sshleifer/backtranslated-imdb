I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she only has a smaller part in it, and her character is not very nice. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and a perfect treat to look over the film. This really is nothing but a showcase for your looks and talent. She does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is, in fact, meaningless. After a car accident, some friends are possibly dead but continue to live their previous lives while all sorts of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are behind them, but we never really find out who they are (possibly they were the ones in the other car, but we certainly did not hear anything about why they are after them). The final scenes, especially, seem cinematically ambitious, but I can not get anything coherent out of it. The opening scene, where bandits (wearing strange masks) cut a girl's wrist blond and collect some of their blood is never explained or followed. Unless the thugs are a representation of the surgeons who are trying to bring Cassie (Sagemiller) back from the dead ... but no, that does not seem to work. Bandits are just villains; they really only spoil a story that could have been interesting. In a supernatural story about death, love, and sacrifice, who the hell needs thugs? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
