I'm completely shocked to see that the average rating for this movie is 5.2 / 10 For what affects me, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I still keep wondering why I watch it through. First of all, the plot is totally hopeless, and the acting is really awful. I think any totally unknown actress would have been better at the role than Susan Lucci; Regarding the Kings of Mr. Kamar Del, I think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his "Doll Valley." In short, it's a total waste of time (and I'm trying to stay polite ...) to avoid at any cost. My rating is 1 and I still think it's well paid, but since we can not give an O ....
