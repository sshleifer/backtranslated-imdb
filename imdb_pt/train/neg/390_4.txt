I loved the Apprentice in the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now with Season 5? (or are 6?) things are getting tiresome too. <br /> <br /> I used to like the show, but it became Donald Trump's own ego fest. Granted your company, you will be working for, but come on! some of the things say "You're FAREWELL" is just an insult. <br /> <br /> After watching the show, I would not want to work for it. not because he is arrogant, pompous, or such. It's just that the show is unreal and the way it handles things makes me just squirm. Good entertainment? YES, but tiring how back pain gets so tiring .. it's not teamwork, it's not personal, it's just a business. Watch your jack back.
