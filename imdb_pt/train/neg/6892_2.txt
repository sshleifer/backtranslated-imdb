O my God. This was a real big mess that simply could not help itself. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29 year old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and does not plan to go anywhere. Until his mother finds a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) with whom she can marry. <br /> <br /> It would have been an OK movie if Heder had not played his Jeffrey so annoyingly, from the start getting started there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse. In the end, we should like him, but there was no reason why he had not changed the selfishness he was at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not even seem to be trying and is in horrible shape after 2007 because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where did they supposedly believe their mother and son? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, though they do not seem very interested either. In addition to some smiles, this movie really does not deserve to be called comedy, simply because there is nothing to laugh about! If you're in the mood for a recent Diane Keaton movie, check out Mad Money or Smother, which are far better than this abysmal endeavor.
