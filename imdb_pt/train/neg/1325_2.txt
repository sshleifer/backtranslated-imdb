Richard Dreyfuss is, in fact, in this film, but in a very small part. He is NOT the filmmaker "obsessed" - he is the business manager / group accountant. Even the box describes the film loosely. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as advertised, unless the term "erotic" is used rather loosely. I would not have considered watching the movie without Richard Dreyfuss as the main character. I could, however, have realized that the famous 1960s anthem, "Suzanne," by Leonard Cohen, was an artistic influence. In addition to the short recitation of James Joyce's final words from "Ulysses," and an interesting visual reference at the end of "The Seventh Seal" by Ingmar Bergman, I found a poor attempt to fuse symbolic elements and humors immortalized in films such as "Year past in Marianbad "and" Un Chien Andalou ". If you like the idea of ​​the eccentric art troupe, there are many top films, from "Bye, Bye, Brazil" to "Cecil B. Demented."
