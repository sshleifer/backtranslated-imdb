Liongate has yet to prove himself. All of the lionsgate movies were awful. I've tried and tried giving them more opportunities and they keep hitting me over and over again. And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception. <br /> <br /> I could not even pay attention to most of this movie, it was so frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. Guy cuts dog dead for some reason. It gets infected by a random virus, transfers it to children in a camp, children begin to get infected and die, the city finds out about it and instead of helping them, it kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. the end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely retarded, you do not care for any of them, and the boy should have been stuck with the boy meets the world. Me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitch our only classmate was to be so much nicer than paying attention to that movie. We managed to get to the end while screaming $ @ t bulls, because this movie will make you do it. <br /> <br /> And I'm still confused by the random slow-motion karate moves of the only random boy and how seemingly everyone in the country is completely retarded and hickish. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? Why did the boy the kiddies try to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him? Was that part of their two plans? Wow. best plan ever. I can not believe this movie has a theatrical version. I could hardly bear the DVD, let alone have to sit in a theater without moving for an hour and a half. It was not scary, funny, or legal, or anything. it's just a waste of 90 minutes you could be using for ... I do not know, plant a tree or something. is more productive than this piece of junk. The acting, the special effects and the script are a joke. Never take this. <br /> <br /> The cabin fever has an unpleasant scene of shaving the legs, in 10
