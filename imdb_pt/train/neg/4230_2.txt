Ok, I like B movies ... I know what B movies should represent. But that's just awful. I'm amazed to get such a decent overall score. The only redeeming qualities of this film are the (mostly) marginal effects of splatter. Do not get me wrong, the movie abounds in this movie - but few effects really jumped at me (like the "probe" anal ... that was great!) <br /> <br /> I believe this movie was filmed in a video camera. Come on - at least a Betacam, I've seen pornography with better production values ​​(and better acting too). <br /> <br /> Acting - sucked! But not in the way of the Troy or the Full Moon. <br /> <br /> History - planned! But that's what you get with movies like these. Very loose! <br /> <br /> Sets & Props - Sucked! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Dubbing and dialogue - sucked! Horrible voice-over (I should not even call it acting) and all other words are "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are many good classics and B / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track. Do yourself a favor by not wasting your time on this crap!
