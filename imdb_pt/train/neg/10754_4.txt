Waiting to enter the theater with tickets in my hand, I was hoping for a science fiction fantasy movie that could finally fuel my appetite for movies about robotic technology, instead I was disappointed with every aspect of it, again tasting that awesome special . effects can not help a boring plot, which in my opinion was the worst this year. Acting on this film also dissatisfied me, Will Smith did not show anything new in this movie, but I have never seen his acting to change from "Men In Black" which was his only success by my opinion. He has had to retire since then, not spoiling his name with titles like "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4/10
