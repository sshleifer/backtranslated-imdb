I've never finished this movie for a reason, it was terrible and that's just acting. I was not sure what the movie was about, it did not make much sense and the violence was horrible. I mean usually I like some nudes in a movie (lol), but I was just sick because of what was going on. ALL the characters bothered me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking in parts and it seemed like a sequel to the blair with the design but without good qualities. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time and would like my time back please. I do not recommend this movie to anyone or even consider it. (N)
