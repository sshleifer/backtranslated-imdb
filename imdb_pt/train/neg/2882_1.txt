This movie is the biggest steam pile of you know what, being from and growing up in Wichita Kansas, I know in fact 90% of the movie was fake. Besides the names of some of the victims, nothing else was correct. The film seems to have been made with the father's camera. He had pictures that, I believe, came from another film, along with footage from a slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for fun, but due to poor acting, poorly prepared or non-existent sets and a very annoying and short end. It was a fight to watch the finale. I recommend that you do not waste your money on this movie or you will regret it. Crunch
