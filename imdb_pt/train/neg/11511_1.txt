I had the (mis) fortune to see this movie at a screening in the USA. Having reluctantly sat through the whole abysmal thing, I am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but interesting. It fit in the early seventies, after the 1969 revolution; this movie just stinks of ......., well, nothing really. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Imagine a poorly made perfume commercial - see what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna could never act, and has been a big-screen embarrassment for years. She looks worse and worse with each of these years, increasingly resembling a meerkat. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who built his "reputation" in Lock Stock, could never drive - his films are shallow, poorly cut, fashion shows. He also does not disappoint here; he wisely chose his wife as the star of that disaster. <br /> <br /> Please people, pay little attention to the good reviews that this movie received from other posters below. They are obviously business plans. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to humiliate you even more by giving you money. <br /> <br />
