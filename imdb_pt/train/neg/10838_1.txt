The minute you give a 1/10 'art film', you have people barking at your ignorant, half-tormented, artistically retarded blood. I'm not going to try to justify how I'm not an aesthetically challenging retarder, listing all the 'art cinema' I liked or mentioning how I gave an unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10. All I ask is for someone to explain to me the purpose, purpose, and message of this film. <br /> <br /> Here's how the film would summarize: The setting up of three unrelated urban legends describing almost absurd levels of cooperation. incidence. This is followed by (in a nutshell, to save 3 hours of pain) the following - A presenter of a children's game dying of lung cancer tries to fix things with his daughter addicted to cocaine, which he may or may not have raped when she was a child, and who is being courted by a clumsy cop with relationship problems while the game show star decides he does not want to be a failed child prodigy, a fate that hit another competing game show from the 60s, which we see now is an unemployed homosexual in love with a bartender who uses orthodontic braces and needs money for "corrective oral surgery," while the program's producer, himself dying of lung cancer, asks his nurse to help him mend himself with the son he abandoned years ago, and who later became a self-help womanizing guru, even when Mr. Producer's second wife suffers from guilt for cheating on a dying and eventually rains frogs (you read correctly). And I'm saving you the unbelievably long and meaningless, literally wandering monologues that every character seems to invent on time with no rhyme or reason that possibly to ensure that the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern epic' . '. <br /> <br /> You're probably thinking that I could have done a better job of summarizing the movie (and not confusing you) if I had written the damn thing a bit more coherently, maybe in a few phrases instead of just um ... Well, now you know how I feel.
