I saw this movie years ago, and I was impressed ... but again, I was only 12 years old. I recently re-watched it and want that time back. This movie is really bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980) if you'd like to see a good movie in which he was ... from Meatballs (also starring Bill Murray) for a few laughs), and Burgess Meredith, that role Does not do anything for their careers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Lee Majors character Franklyn Hart is a former rider who plans to drive his race car (which he had on deposit) across the country to California. One problem: the government has banned all private transportation. I thought the concept was OK (not the worst I've ever heard of), but the execution failed horribly.
