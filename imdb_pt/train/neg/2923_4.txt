The plot was quite interesting, with the background of the Russian revolution. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest as the movie was partially filmed there. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry between the two main characters, so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The scenes of love were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirkland was really stiff, almost icy. Rob Stewart was quite charming and childish, so she looked like her older sister than her girlfriend. The end, when we finally discovered who was really behind them, was very weak and made no sense at all. I think I would have liked it a lot more if the relationship between the two actors was a bit more believable.
