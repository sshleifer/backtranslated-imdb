I'm an actor, producer, director and what I'm about to say are facts. This project was the worst movie in film history. From producer to director and the editing of this movie called is a joke and I mean a big joke. Why would Blockbuster launch this crap? I take my job very seriously and this movie is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad movie? I think not. I've seen bad zombie movies, but that takes Coffie's cake and everything on the damn table. THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!! I really hate to speak badly about other filmmakers because I am one of them, but please consider taking on a different profession. I respect the fact that you completed a movie, but I have to ask "YOU ARE SMOKING CRACK", I mean the makeup on your girls, the scary zombies, what you were thinking. To the whole nation, if I could have voted Zero, I would have. WORST FILM IN THE MOVIE MAKING HISTORY !!!
