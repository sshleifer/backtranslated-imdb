I just saw this movie and decided to see what others thought about it. I wonder if those people who make brilliant reviews saw the same movie! This is potentially a very good story, but it does not reach the mark. The script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that would make a great dive network for the fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the plot jumps so much that I caught myself asking the question "How did we get here?" at least half a dozen times during the film. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of chemistry among the cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's antics during filming. It became clear that they all showed up and did their job, but they did not commit to their roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie worth seeing ... take a walk, play a board game, take a nice hot bath and save your money for something worthwhile!
