The plot is simple, an old man living off a main road in the forest witnesses one day a man killing a child in the forest. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempts to try to convince the police that what he saw was not an invention of his imagination. However, there is a problem every time the old guide the police as far as the murder happens. No corpse can be found. Soft For Digging has a miniature dialogue that reflects most scenes from the movie, an old man living alone in a house. During the film, I discovered that I was scared twice, that is, when the murdered child appears abruptly in front of the old man. The rest of the film I have to admit did not involve me; I found the pace of the film a bit too slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, took a lot of time. I feel more could have been made out of the relationship, ghostly encounters, with the child and the old. Alone in the woods at night, unsure of their own mind can lead to some scary situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.
