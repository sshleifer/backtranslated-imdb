Man to Man strives to be a good film: he has the heart in the right place, aspires to be epic and has a message that no doubt everyone will appreciate. But there are also some of the problems of this image. He strives so hard to be good and convey his message that sometimes the viewer must feel indisputable. So it is only fitting that the images used by this image are simplistic - Man To Man does not allow the viewer to decide what he thinks is right, but he is hammering his message in his mind. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to appear preoccupied, genuinely moved and with all the other emotions you can express with the only facial expression that his repertoire has to offer. Add that the movie is too long and loses its speed until the end you would easily be led to the conclusion that Man to Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend him: it's fun, there are some funny scenes and Kristin Scott Thomas, who steals the shows. Of course you should not compare him to humanist works like The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you will be leaving the theater satisfied. He tries to get his heart (even if his brain thinks it's too obvious) and succeeds most of the time.
