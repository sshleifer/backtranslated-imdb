I must admit that I do not have much of a New Age notion. When people "exchange energy," I always wonder how much KJ really is changed and how it can contribute to solving the problem of global warming. When energy "is applied," I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and are still without Nobel prizes. When people feel how instinct allows them to navigate smoothly through the complexities of life, I wonder how they can not do a simple thing like finding the train station. <br /> <br /> But again, this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them I find perfectly acceptable and fun. If this were the case of "The Celestine Prophecy" I would not burn this movie, but unfortunately it is not. Every actor seems to be bored and unable to understand what he should be doing on the spot. This results in many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s," as I usually do when I talk about quantum physics with someone who really knows what he's talking about and pretends to understand. <br /> <br /> The direction is also not inspired. You can expect something more from the guy who did "What dreams can come", but, hey, I think he was well paid for work and adopted the attitude of a taxi driver from New York: "It's your money, my friend .. "only one who seems to be having fun is the evil JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, he is one of the few actors in this movie who may have some wise cracks in this age-old and terribly boring conversation of the New Age. This film is very much like one of the movies. these dinner dates when you discover that your date is really a horrible boring that seems to be unable to shut up. At one point in time, it seems like the words turn into little ping pong balls that are thrown in your head incessantly until they hurt. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun and choose between this movie and Colando safety pins on your eyelids, take my advice: choose the latter.
