This film was strongly marked by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or how should I say Steven So-dull! As before, Seagal is either too good or too stupid to redefine his own lines, leaving someone to personify his voice in the scenes where sound needed to be repeated. Some movies before that was that he did it too, but I do not think so! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script could use some work, but parts of this movie looked like a real movie! Of course, all said, this movie is very bad. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better without Seagal becoming a drawing of himself. Do not bother yourself. Anything above a dollar for this is awesome! I honestly think this is the last time for me and a Seagal movie. What took me so long to realize this?!
