I give 3 stars only for the beautiful photos of Africa. The rest was ... well, very annoying. For about 50min, we have the outline of the plot ... In War of the Worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? So it was real action! This is something like: "Let's take a walk on the savannah and sigh at the beautiful sunset!". And maybe deliver a message, like "Do not kill elephants!" Very eco friendly. I would have expected this from a "new" Steven Segal movie, not because of it ... The lead actress makes me think about tanning, dyed hair and a lot of base! And I have not seen a scene where her hair is messy, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. She just does not look like a woman of the 19th century! And at the bar, where they seek our hero, Swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and became famous in the following years. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action occurs between 1896 and 1900, Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a good impression .. like a nutshell - hard on the outside but soft and cuddly inside. Not that I hugged myself with a nut, but you understood. He really succeeds in getting that dog beaten on his face on several occasions. The film stinks. Very long and increasingly boring. do not watch! Do not buy! It's a waste of your money!
