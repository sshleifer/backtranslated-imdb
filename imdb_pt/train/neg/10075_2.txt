I'm sorry, but even Adrian Zmed, from TJ Hooker, could not save that sequence. I spent half of the movie thinking this was a parody of the original. Then came that wild, crazy motorcycle scene (note that this is the only movie Patricia Birch directs); and unfortunately, I realized that they were trying to be serious. I was shocked by the fact that the opposing gang, having lost their "wheels" due to their gambling habits in the original Grease, was forced to use bikes in the second film. Being embarrassed by that Carrington putz character, I would hate to see what they resort to later: maybe Mopeds? <br /> <br /> I also never bought the banal theme: hunky-australian-boy-can-fit-in-outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-to-face-with-stupid-biker- look. It was the story of Disney that went wrong. <br /> <br /> So, it looks like you can ruin a good thing by putting a chewing gum that hits Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I took from this movie was an idea of ​​how many ten points to give.
