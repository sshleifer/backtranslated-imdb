I went through this on the shelf a few times, looking at the myriad of great positive quotes (with small names) at the front and wondering if I was missing out on anything. The other night was on one of the movie channels, and I tuned in. I lost nothing. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes. Maybe the movie will become a golden comedy after that. Given the slow, heavy pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 years, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The main character starts the movie in the classic "I do not know how to start my movie" style. , with a long and tiresome monologue about how he does not want to be sued. It's not funny. It's not even remotely funny. Others commented on the "San Francisco"; Okay, a little laugh the first time he says that. Then he grazes it on the floor, smiling at the camera as if it were the funniest thing ever written. Overcome yourself. In fact, I think the conversation with the camera was the reason why I did not immediately like the movie. Do not assume familiarity with your audience. Familiarity is gained, as is respect. From there, you basically have a fat whiner talking in a very effeminate way about his monotonous life as a temporary. I did not realize he's Jewish; is a disgrace for Jewish comedians to call this "Jewish mood." It's just a bland humor. Just because you're Jewish does not mean you have a way for comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the things I saw had worked, I could have stayed around. . But a bit of schlub talking about how much he loves the names of the women he works with, then listing them for five long minutes, does not make a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious attempt to capitalize. about the popularity of "Office Space". Do not let yourself fall prey to targeted marketing. Say no to the "Haiku Tunnel".
