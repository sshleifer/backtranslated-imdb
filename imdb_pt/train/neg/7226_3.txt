I love comics. Although I have trouble understanding the stories completely? the visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew what I was doing. Surprisingly I understood the main plot? but some extremely bad decisions were made for his visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - very poorly looking "CG human actors" in close ups? ??Because?! Nothing worked !! Horus - and the other Egyption gods - were successfully made in CG and very close to the comic book. <br /> <br /> I think with real actors this movie could have been a cult movie. What a shame.
