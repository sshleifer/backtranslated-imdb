Trying to compare or represent this "swill" as anything "Hitchcockian" is an attempt to trick Hitchcock fans into wasting $ 7 on this movie ... Weak Performance Weak Story Weak script. <br /> <br /> No real suspense, no emotions. You wait for all the weakness of this movie for the great reward or even any reward ... You kept thinking, what the heck was that all. <br /> <br /> And please enough with the move to make "alternative lifestyles" HIP and politically correct !! ... I can not recommend this to anyone ... Did I mention how weak the acting is? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and "Mork". But those were MUCH more innocent times ...........
