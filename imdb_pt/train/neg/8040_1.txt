In a college dormitory, a guy is killed by someone with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. It is institutionalized. A year later, she's out, has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other foolish friends in a beautiful condo in Florida. Of course the killer appears (for no apparent reason) and starts killing again. <br /> <br /> A slasher thriller - a classic example of how NOT to make a low-budget horror movie. To begin with, large portions of this movie are INFINITE FILLING of these six idiots filming themselves, having "fun" (more fun than the public), getting drunk, acting stupid etc etc. Also there is NO nudity here at all. I'm not saying that a horror movie needs nudity, but ANYTHING to cheer it up would have helped. None of the deaths are actually shown (you hear them), they're just a little bloody and there's no blood. There is a REAL horrible - but it is not until the end. <br /> <br /> With a few exceptions, the acting sucks. Dorie Barton is terrible as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is lousy as Oz. Chad Allen appears as Brad and he is terrible. Lawrence is really very good - handsome and handsome and giving that crap about everything. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role doing a good job. Logic lapses abound - after they realize that a friend has been killed, two of the girls talk casually about sex; Baston's non-reaction to seeing a friend get killed is kind of funny, and what about Lawrence? Your character disappears without a trace in the end! Stupid, stupid, no blood, no nudity - skip this one. <br /> <br /> Rated R for violence and some Graphic Profanity.
