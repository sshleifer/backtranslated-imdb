Chris Kattan is a great actor on Saturday Night Live ... but he should probably leave the film industry alone unless he has some kind of creative control. He plays an annoyingly animated character who is basically a little retarded and at speed. Want to know the only funny parts? The things they showed in the previews. Yes, your interpretation of me is funny. Nothing else is. ESPECIALLY when you can say that he is trying very hard to be a physical comedian, that he should not have to try because he is one. And yet, the fact of "demolishing the vet's office" is a bit painful. This film made me develop a contraction in the eyes. Avoid at all costs, and keep watching SNL.
