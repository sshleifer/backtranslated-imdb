This film often extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify meaningless ideas, limited by statements like "we all create our own reality." <br /> <br /> Sorry, people, reality is what is true for all of us, not just for the gullible. The idea that "anything is possible" is not supported by a closer examination: if anything is possible, contrary things are possible and therefore nothing is possible. This leads to a postmodernist absurdity, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all well-grounded and stupid ideas are equal. To quote science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who puts it so well: "Reality is what, when you stop believing, does not go away."
