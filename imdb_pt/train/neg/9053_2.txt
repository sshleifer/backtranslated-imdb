Simply, I found the TV program "Mash" banal, preacher, oh always so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and biggest sin of all, and that's it? which is (was) incredibly annoying. You have Alan Alda as the main protagonist, "(star)", who is so passionate about himself and his cunning, that actually made me uncomfortable even trying to go through an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, whom I would gladly admit to having a certain style and style in the character's presentation. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both singularly and compositively together, are like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also found dull, was not her fault either, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the movie, looked tired and acted as the show went by. Watching a show a year showed this to me. Jamie Farr was just "low level comedy" and not even worth mentioning here. The reason I did not give a rating (one), which anyone reading this now would be asking, is that classifications of any kind are not just a subjective but a relative call. Television, except for relatively few exceptions, is so gross. That relatively speaking, Mash had some quality of production, (by television standards) of that time and today, and therefore is deserved of a two. Rob Ritter
