I took this movie from Blockbuster on one of those shelves where you can get 5 movies for $ 20. I have to say I have the value of my money on this one. I expected horrible dialogue, bad monsters and unstable cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two of the three are not bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad, though not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've watched so many low-budget films recently that I lost perspective. There are some parts where acting is absolutely terrible, but for the most part it is at least at the High School Play level. <br /> <br /> The CG for Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought of when I saw (and noticed another reviewer agreeing with me) was that a man in a monkey suit would have been better. The awkward stop-motion animation would have seemed better. <br /> <br /> So you may be wondering why I call the CG the second worst part. That's because the worst part of the movie is the sound effects. They are tall, irritating and constant. I have camped, I know how insects sound in the forest at night, and although they may be noisy, they are not deafening like the cacophony of the movie. Usually, when the "background" seems to stifle the dialogue of the film, it's a bad thing, but from what I realized from the dialogue in this movie, I was not missing much. <br /> <br /> The action was infrequent and annoying. The tension was non-existent, as was any sense of empathy with the characters. Speaking of the characters, they were all cookie cutters and bland. The only moderate interaction was between ... actually, I can not think of anything. There was a line or two that made me smile a little, but that was about it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was decent, one or two steps above what you would normally see in a movie like this. However, he still had that quality of "home movie" you get with movies made in exchange for coins and a prayer. <br /> <br /> If you're like me and like cheap genre movies, and you see the one in the dollar box, think about picking it up. Otherwise, stay away at all costs.
