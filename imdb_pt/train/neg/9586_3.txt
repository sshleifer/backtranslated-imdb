After the disastrous revolution, this film was practically the last nail in the coffin of Goldcrest and therefore the British Film Industry. The film is absolute pants, it is full of music from the 1980s jazz revival attempt and based on a book and author that was briefly popular at the time and deservedly sank back into the dark. Temple searched for eras trying to find Suzette and appeared with 8th Wonders Patsy Kensett another person who was briefly popular at the time. When the film came out of post-production, the Jazz revival ended, as did Kensett's career and the film met a totally indifferent movie audience. <br /> <br /> Mediocre would be an exaggeration for some of the worst / camps. / more tacky acting forever to adorn the British silver screen watching almost 20 years later and the film is truly coarse.
