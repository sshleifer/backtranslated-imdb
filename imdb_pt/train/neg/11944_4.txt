I rented this movie thinking it was the sad 1959 version I saw as a child. Was not. I was therefore very disappointed with what I felt was marginal acting, poor character development, and, most of all, failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... the "Dog of Flanders" is just a cute "aside" for the film. Get the 1959 version!
