I am proud to say that I have seen all three films Fast and Furious. Of course, the plots are kind of silly, and they can be a bit cheesy, but I love them car chases, and all the cute cars, and the clandestine midnight races. And I'll gladly see a room. <br /> <br /> Want to know the difference between these three and Redline? Decent actors, a little thoughtful, even though they are potboilers, and last but not least, directors who All three were made by very competent directors, they all took the films in a different, equally exciting direction. The red line looks like the producer chose a dozen women with whom he slept on the casting sofa, and made them the extras. , then picked up his leads from the Hollywood unemployment line. And the script. Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad. That's 70's made for bad TV movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie had some cool cars, but you really can not see many in action, and the action is so badly driven that you can not get excited with the chases, one If the cars are not So excited, why go to a movie like that? <br /> <br /> I'm in the audience with a bunch of teenagers, and I can not stop laughing out loud. this was just a disaster. <br /> <br /> Rent the F & F movies. Go to the Nascar Race. Go to a kart track and run to yourself. Whatever it is, avoid Redline as bad cheese.
