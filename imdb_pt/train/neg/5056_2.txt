*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie - the useful performance of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is horrible (this is not helped by the atrocious script). The worst culprit is villain Buntao, head of an Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I was laughing when he was expressing his "fury" for having lost a lot of money; horrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his line "is a hostile takeover" (which is the rest of the title of this film) was delivered as badly as if it could be done. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress has stood out in this film. Then we got to the plot. That should tell you everything you need to know: in the original "Rage and Honor," Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a downtown teacher. Now she's a C.I.A. agent (or was it some other government agency - sorry, but this movie was so bad I can not even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what this C.I.A. application process was like. Interviewer: What previous work experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: OK; You are hired! I only give a "2" because of a decent acting and a good turnaround at the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, will be caught).
