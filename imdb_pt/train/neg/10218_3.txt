** Spoilers contained ** I heard from various sources that this movie was controversial and that the particular ending was horrible. What I did not expect was the complete change of course with about twenty minutes ahead. What begins as a typical Western cowboy / Indian suddenly descends into a very somber romantic "comedy" about Honus (Soldier Blue from the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen), who escape a cavalry attack by Cheyenne. Most of the film then focuses on these two incompatible people, hence the romantic comedy part. Donald Pleasance then appears and kidnaps the two for no real apparent reason. They then escape and both appear (separately) at the base of the cavalry on the eve of an attack at the base of Cheyenne. Since Cresta used to marry one of Cheyenne's bosses, she escapes from the base of the cavalry and joins them. So far so common. Then comes the end. After enduring well over an hour of bad acting involving a clich√© they will not join the story, the film then turns into superior exploration involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head. Similarities can be drawn with Wild Bunch at this point in the movie, but Wild Bunch has kept the same tone all along and has not resorted to extreme and gratuitous violence. In a way, Soldier Blue reminds me of the last summer of Frank Perry, which also completely changed the course of a shocking ending. I did not hate Soldier Blue, nor did I find the ending particularly disturbing, but I thought it was pretty annoying with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see a movie with a truly disturbing massacre of the innocent, I would recommend Come and See, by Elem Klimov.
