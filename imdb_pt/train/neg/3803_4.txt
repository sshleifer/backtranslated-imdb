The film seems disconnected and, in general, poorly written. The script moves as if 10 different people had written it, and none of them were communicating. Apparently, they wanted to take a page out of a Miracle on 34th Street movie (the original), but this is done so badly that the movie falls apart. This movie is only for the very young, and even they will see the fact that whoever wrote the script knows little or nothing about baseball. Such as: <br /> <br /> ?? When the Angels are last, does the owner seem to care, nor does he bother with the fact that his manager had quarreled with his pitcher? NO AMOUNT ?? or that he punctured the team play by piece broadcaster on live TV. However, when the team is a division winning game, it gets out of shape throughout a story (originated by a 6 year old) that the manager is getting help from a child who claims to see real angels. What seems worse? A violent control loss manager whose team lost 15 in a row? Or a winning playoff coach who's acting a bit eccentric and helping foster children? The owner's reaction does not make sense. And he changed his mind to Maggie and his speech "straight out of the clich√© place" during a press conference. <br /> <br /> ?? The angels should be playing for the division in the final weekend series against the White Sox, however, at the end of the game, the announcer goes on to say that the angels' have won the pennant. "The pennant is not decided until someone wins the league championship, not the division's regular season title. Whitt Bass, the bobbin thrower is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the losing streak of the Angels, then is the pitcher Mel Clark (Tony Danza) said that in the ninth round he threw 156 pitches in a low-scoring ball game. Typically, in low-scoring games, the pitch count is VERY lower than that, usually around 80-90 pitches. "AL" the angel says in the end "Championships have to be overcome on their own," even though he and his angels have manipulated and repaired games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on r, as there are many other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10 years), this movie can be fun. Is very bad ?? done right this could have been a classic. Done wrong like this and it's a forgettable mess that's going to live forever like a UHF / Saturday Morning cable washout.
