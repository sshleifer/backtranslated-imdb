I saw this movie in its own time period, when having a baby out of marriage not only ruined his life but stamped his son like a bastard. In these days of "single mothers", this may seem very forced, but it was quite true. And I'm not crazy for laughing at someone who's stuttering. Between these two problems I found it difficult to find this movie funny. At that time I did not know who had run or what a wonderful reputation he had. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and she only made me nervous because she was so frantic. I loved "Bringing Up Baby," but I find this movie just embarrassing. I'm sure the punch in some church functions was probably spiked, but I was the one who needed a drink after watching it again. The idea that the girl would have to be drunk to get married and become pregnant only added to the misery. An entire city could turn against you under these circumstances, so the outcome of that movie is really the fun part. Of course, shoot me, I also do not like "It's a Wonderful Life".
