"Show me your breasts!" not funny, and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where I come from. I do not want my 6 and 7 year old daughters to think so or listen to this. I think it's sad that Nick has exaggerated so much and so that's what we have, stupid little girls acting like stupid adults. I know it's to be humorous, but consider that we have there innocent girls in K and 1st grade who can hardly wait to see this. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw him. My daughters will not be watching. I'd love to block Nick, but I do not have the heart right now, but if Nick keeps putting that kind of crap on me, I'll need it.
