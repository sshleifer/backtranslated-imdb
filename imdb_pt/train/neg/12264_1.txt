You get 5 writers together, each writes a different story with a different genre, and then you try to make a movie with it. It's action, it's adventure, it's science fiction, it's western, it's a mess. Sorry, this movie absolutely stinks. 4.5 is giving an incredibly high rating. That said, it's movies like this that make me think I can write movies and I can hardly write.
