"The Screaming Skull" opens with a notice and offer for free burial services if you die watching - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a rather intriguing premise for a horror movie: conspirator husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then tries to convince her that she is going crazy with raucous noises, mysterious beats and skulls that appear at inopportune moments. Add to the formula a sufficiently chilling gardener who still nourishes the memory of the man's first wife to whom he has dedicated himself. Maybe it's just because the 1950s did not have the technology to take some of the scary scenes needed to complete this movie, the techniques used here seem artificial and lying. But then again, when I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" when I was nine years old, he gave me a scare, just as I'm sure this movie did for young viewers of the same era. <br /> Do not get me wrong, the movie is not terrible, it just seems boring at times. But there is great atmospheric tension in Whitlock's house, usually huge but unfurnished, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me, the best scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) maniac on the lake trying to recover the hidden skull, he just dresses well in clothes and everything, in stark contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a Double Function) . That makes you wonder who the real idiot was. <br /> <br /> In his own way, perhaps the most shocking thing in the movie: how about the roadster that Whitlock makes his first appearance? 1958! That at least made me jump from my place!
