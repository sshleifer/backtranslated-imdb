I'd like to write about the story, but there was none. I would have liked to quote some hard-hitting dialogues from the movie, but "hinglish" is just funny for about 5 minutes, after that it's an exaggeration. I would have liked to faint with the suspense 'keep-u-guessing', but it was as predictable as ... ummm, a Yash raj movie (?). I'd like to talk about the bank's cutting-edge action, but I do not really like drawings. <br /> <br /> * sigh * <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. People attempting suicide - I promise it will push you to the edge of the abyss 2. Sado-masochists - This film is much more effective than the barbed wire that Silas' face in the Da Vinci code wore. 3. People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the public that left the hall seemed to be in the mood to kill someone. 4. Pirates of the movie: More power for them. If any movie deserves that the public does not spend money to watch - that's it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton and green algae - Because almost all other living things require a slightly higher IQ factor than what the film offers. After thinking: the director of the film, obviously, is kind of him. (And I hope God is the only one of its kind ... enough) Things that could have made a better movie: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. The Screenwriter 4. A coordinator of stunts 5. A story (Have I already said that?) 6. A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who has been challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic Plague - Avoid all costs 8. Legal notice - "Watching Yash Raj movies is harmful to your mental health"? Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 The sub-titles in English - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" become - "My heart is in a void", "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" becomes "I am a flirt, I am a lover, I am a vagabond" ... no price. In short, Tashan to me, it's like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube should increase the player's IQ, Tashan promises to lower his IQ, and that ... in just 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. But that's just me. I could be wrong You were warned anyway.
