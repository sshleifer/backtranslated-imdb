This movie looks like it was made for TV. For years, I had hoped that some movie would be made about Rubin Carter, because I loved to see it in the old MSG box, and seeing that movie was very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for mr. Washington, but he was horrible and annoying. There is nothing good to say about this movie except that I liked the song.
