I now watched all four Bo Derek vehicles driven by her husband, John; all are pretty awful, of course, but that's certainly the pits. Featuring the usual fragile plot, bad script? by the director, of course? and acting, not to mention the free nudity of the star, it is about losing the much older husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts the suicide of his shotgun saying that he always admired Hemingway !!) but who still appears and talk to her . In fact, he wants to get back into another younger body, but actually only does it in the last scene! Derek is adorable as always, and still playing naive (!) ?? especially during a confusing middle section that haunted her by a rental killer at a spa. Quinn is also typically larger than life (read: hammy) here, but this easily constitutes his nadir; Plus, for most of the duration, he acts behind a shiny piece of plastic (presumably suggesting he's in some sort of limbo)! His 'substitute', then, is obviously a handsome stallion who does not have a talent for talent or even personality. Also featured are Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife)? plus an astonishing appearance of billionaire Donald Trump (who presumably needed it on his resume)! Needless to say, John Derek was his own director of photography in the film, that the final credits are filled with useless (and cheesy) expressions of gratitude to the many people who have lent a helping hand, and that GHOSTS CAN NOT MAKE sweeping. the plate at the 1990 Razzie Awards!
