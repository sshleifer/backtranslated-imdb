Space Camp, which had the unfortunate luck of being planned at the time of the Challenger crash, deserves such luck. The "stars" scoff at acting, Lea Thomson, actually being turned aside, when asked for more than the usual wide-eyed innocent smile, presumably to mask her laughable attempts. The movie is sometimes hilarious, when it starts to ask a lot of you. A small boy holds a multimillion dollar robot in his closet, which breaks down when he receives many commands from the hordes of dorm roommates clich√©s. This banal and unloving machine, "Jinx", is one of the main protagonists of the ridiculous premise of the film, which seems to be part of the Short Circuit, part 2001 of the Airplane team. I will not bore you with that, suffice it to say that you can only laugh when you come across it. Having said all that, it is nice to watch, on a SeaQuest, saved by the Bell way. Romance and technology, care, are as unbelievable as the others. Also, if you're a crazy eighty, it's a must for the fun presentations of Kate Capshaw (Willie of Temple of Doom) and obviously Lea Thompson. In addition, Joaquin Phoenix makes a dishonest turn as a kind of aspiring goonie who befriends Jinx. Do not come close to this movie if you're not a fan of junk.
