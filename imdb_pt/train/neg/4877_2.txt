Frank Capra's creativity must have been spent by the time he made this film. Although it has some lovely moments and many wonderful artists, Capra's direct recycling not only from the script, but also from considerable scenes from his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is absolutely of poor quality. It is understandable that he reuses images of the climax horse racing, which is exciting. But he uses entire dialogue scenes with smaller actors, then brings these actors back and apparently hopes we do not realize, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's last appearances, skip this and watch the Broadway Bill.
