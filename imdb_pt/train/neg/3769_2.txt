There have been a lot of movies with Bigfoot, most of which are not good, but at least they have a goofy charm for them. Sasquatch Hunters does not even have that. It's just a hole. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters is about a group of paleontologists, primatologists and rangers who venture into a remote part of a forest in the Pacific Northwest. Bones belonging to some kind of abnormally large primate were discovered in this region and as the monkeys are not natural to North America, for starters, this leads to a scientific expedition. Sure enough, they soon discover a whole graveyard full of skeletal remains of these huge monkey-like creatures. I think we all know what happens to people who disturb ancient cemeteries in movies. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of uninteresting and interchangeable characters who ride their equipment, walking through the forest, stopping to rest. Walking through the forest a little longer, stopping long enough to investigate and discuss some discoveries along the way, further walks through the forest, looking for a member of the group who disappeared, even more walks through the forest, digging the earth, randomly theorizing, and gathering around a campfire to discuss the little they did that day. When Sasquatch finally appears, it turns into people stumbling in the dark as they get caught one at a time (done in a heartbeat and you've lost fashion and murder happens off camera). This is all terribly boring. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to create suspense, but there are none to be found, so we are left with scenes of people wandering through the forest just to get somewhere and stroll through forest at night trying to act in fear. I'd be lying if I said I did not use the fast-forward button liberally to speed up those scenes. <br /> <br /> As for Sasquatch himself, like any other character in the film, he does not have much to do and has no distinct personality. It sounds like a more disjointed version of King Kong, which is not so bad except in the scenes where they used CGI instead of a man in a Bigfoot costume, which is painfully obvious during the monster scenes of the day. A part of me can not help but feel that even using computer effects to bring Bigfoot to life is sacrilege. If there is some movie monster that I believe should only be brought to life through the situation, it's Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that does not have as much plot as a premise. . That's all it really is, a premise, that the people involved have stretched to make a feature film without worrying about adding all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie.
