What made the original Killer Tomatoes fun was made by people with no budget who were just being crazy for a few days ... <br /> <br /> This was something on a budget, but it just was not as fun. Adams's John Astin is actually making an effort here to be comical, but he's backed up by lame actors, cheap special effects and bland jokes. <br /> <br /> The plot. Gangrene (Astin) escapes from a French prison and decides that he will put a pretender on the throne of France ... The hero, his French girlfriend and the "Fuzzy Tomato" resembling the Gizmo decide that they will stop him. .. <br /> <br /> Unforgettable, straight to nonsense video ...
