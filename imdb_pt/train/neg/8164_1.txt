I saw this movie in a movie theater (probably at $ 2.00) with my cousin and uncle. We were around 11 and 12, I think, and really into horror movies. I remember being so excited to see it because my cool uncle let us choose the movie (and we probably could never do it again!) And then he was disappointed! Just annoying and not scary. The only thing I can remember was Silver Spoons' Corky Pigeon, and that was not so good, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before and this always stayed in my head as the worst. That was from what I remember, one of the most boring, not scary, wasteful of our $ 6 collective and a waste of film. I read some of the reviews that say it's worth a watch and I say "Too each his own", but I would not even bother. It's not that bad, it's good.
