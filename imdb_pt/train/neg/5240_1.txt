Once it reaches a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms! But on behalf of its producers, I must say that it does not fit into any category of films known, deserves a new name of its own! It's a "neurological drama"! It saddens and depresses every single neuron within a person's brain. <br /> <br /> It's the closest thing an individual will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one. That leaves you speechless, all limbs numb, your mouth opens and it stays that way, and the strangest thing of all is that you feel like going blind and deaf. a kind of "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to mind after I have finished my ordeal is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
