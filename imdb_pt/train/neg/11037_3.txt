I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. That's great! When Jim throws that little person out the window, the look on his face is invaluable. So when does he begin to address the priest on behalf of his wife only to find out that she has become the pee-woman? Great writing and great cast along with great acting makes this must see. I'm trying to find a certain photo of this episode. I'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as Greenman? Can someone point me in the right direction to find such a picture?
