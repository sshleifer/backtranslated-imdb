This is not a commentary on the actual movie, but on the launch of the DVD RUSCICO for North America. I do not know if there were any different releases and updates, but the albums we rented had 2000 copyright on them, if that meant anything. Anyway, the sound mix on those DVDs was absolutely horrible. Levels usually go up and down; when the scene cut through the panorama of a battlefield, the orchestral band thundered so loudly that I did not know which would be the first to come out - my eardrums or my speakers. When it came time for dialogue, the volume used to fall to something almost inaudible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley-work stood tall while the dialogue was superimposed on a much lower level. My wife and I discovered that the only way we could watch this movie on these DVDs was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continually modulate the volume. And, as another user commented, when we selected audio in English, the dialog box alternated between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track, the dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL if you do not understand either. Finally, we gave up watching after the first record. Before shelling out over $ 50 for this DVD movie for your own library, I highly recommend getting a rental copy to see if you can really enjoy this epic movie when overwhelmed by such a bad sound especially if you never read the book and really want to understand the plot.
