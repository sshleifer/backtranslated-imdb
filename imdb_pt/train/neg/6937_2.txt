The subject that the latter filmmaker turned film tries to address in his debut venture (ad) is an old topic of discussion by almost all cultural standards - the timeless romance (pun intended). <br /> <br /> However, exploration (and exploration for Desi auds) falls woefully short as usual slopes for 'pepper, seasoning and sugar' above the usual masala mix of b / g punctuation, dialogue, dance, drama, etc. creates a nice looking package with little from within. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene was repeated at least 8-9 times. Other replays follow through the film (after all the main character is a cook). But there are problems - no history! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a screenplay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh puts a lot of over-acting on Cheeni Jyada (more). Really, when does this guy stop? How many people in their sixties and sixties come around like this, even when provoked by a man in his mid-thirties? Timeless mind yes, but surely what about the not-so-old body? And alone Excuse me, soul? Reasonably good performance by Paresh Rawal, who has the only sensible role in the film. The director has no sense of realism, getting caught up in his new discovery of a new idea. Nowhere are we introduced to any real-life issues or issues that a couple might face, other than actually marrying, which is just the initial hurdle. The sub-plot of a little boy with cancer (the first love of the bachelor boy) gets nowhere and whatever pungency that insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly eliminated along with the girl's character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, nice try, but it still has not gotten there.
