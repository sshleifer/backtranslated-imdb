As a veteran of many, many pretentious French films I thought it had taken the worst the industry had to offer and able to handle anything. But not that. Useless, ruthless, violent, nasty, senseless ... The film has nothing to offer and it is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.
