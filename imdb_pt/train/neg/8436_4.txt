David Mamet is a very interesting and very unequal director. His first film, "House of Games", was the one I liked best, and put together a series of films with characters whose life perspective changes as they face complicated situations, as well as the perspective of the viewer. <br /> <This is "Homicide", which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer for the usual crime drama. The main characters are two policemen, a Jew and an Irishman who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be a veteran of Israel's War of Independence unleashes Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> This is the flaw of the movie. are the most obvious. The awakening process is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective walks to the last violent confrontation is pathetic. The ending of the movie itself is as clever as Mamet, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy make strong performances, but the flaws in the story are too obvious to be easily compensated. .
