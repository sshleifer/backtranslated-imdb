The first part, Che in Cuba, is about this part of your life. It contains many indistinguishable battles and the fact that Che ministered to many indistinguishable wounds (remember that Che was a doctor). It ends when Castro wins the revolution; Che never arrives in Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, is about guessing what. It contains many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to many indistinguishable wounded. <br /> <br /> When I realized that this should be an "epic" (I never knew <br /> anything, but the title before I started), I naturally thought of the greatest epic of all, Lawrence of Arabia, by David Lean . More than that later. <br /> <br /> Do not be racist, but beyond what I've already mentioned is the fact that there are many characters who are, well, indistinguishable - unknown Latino actors who look equally, considering that everyone uses beards of "Che" and wear Che's uniforms. This makes the viewer unable to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very small role). While del Toro is fantastic, think of "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character: not Alec Guinness, not Omar Sharif, not Anthony Quinn, etc. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> Because the other characters are interchangeable, this results in a loss of reference. When Che's top aides are killed, you do not feel remorse, since you do not know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I do not think it's a spoiler), there's no empathy for the audience - he's just been killed. <br /> <br /> He is very one-dimensional to relate to as a human being. In addition to being a revolutionary and losing only to Jesus in moral righteousness, the only thing we learned about Che is that he is married and has five children (he tells another character that is nearing the end). What was your motivation? A complete puzzle. <br /> <br /> Maybe Soderbergh is purposely imitating the Lean. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence, the mysterious man from Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness, Quinn). He was as brave as he was insecure-that is, he had human qualities. Che is like a machine, as hot as The Terminator. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year there was another war epic, the Mongol. Che makes the Mongols look like a wonderful life.
