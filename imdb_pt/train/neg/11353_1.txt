Today, I visited an Athenian cinema with my two children (6 and 8 years), paid 3 x 12 euros (about 45 US $ total) not to mention gas, popcorn and soda, was invited to return my special 3D glasses after to leave the theater and was "forced" to watch what could have been a great 3D movie masterpiece, but only proved to be a sick propaganda film like "Cold War" like none I've seen in the last 20 years. .. AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN ... IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN! <br /> <br /> PS 1: The average Greek work does not make more than 850 Euros per month (approximately 1050 US $) <br /> <br /> PS 2 My kids liked it ... but they did not either are more than babies> in Greek: lives, idiots> as the one who wrote the script and the others who made this "3d doom" happen. <br /> <br /> The 3D animation of PS 3 is fantastic, but who gives a ....!
