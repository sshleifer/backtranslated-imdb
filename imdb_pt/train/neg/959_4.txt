I would have given this movie 1 out of 10 if it was not for ms. Performance by Claudine Barretto. and I take this moment to forget that Kris Aquino is here. and ... end. <br /> <br /> I really avoid watching Pinoy horror movies because the stories have no originality and I really think (some) writers do not give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their films. stories (redundant ??). it was as if they 'pushed' the film forward when their stories stank. and my God, creative exhaustion led them to steal other movies. because?? Why did this movie have a good review? I would not give so much merit. the movie was KIND OF, but the movie looked weirder as it deals with Filipino folklore ... it comes on my list of "most likely to happen" category. I just wanted them to spend more time improving the story lines and fixing those flash back sequences, no matter if the lighting was a drug, it would not matter much if the contents would blow you up. SAYANG.
