When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well-made horror film, but this was quite different, representing what I would describe as an early science-fiction effort. Both Karloff and Lugosi are scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to some extent, until Rukh beats Benet with a demonstration that proves his grand theory. The science here was - to put it mildly - a bit rough on the edges (so science fiction, with an emphasis on fiction), but somehow Rukh takes advantage of some sort of Andromeda ray that allows him to look at the land "several billion years ago." At that prehistoric time, a huge meteorite struck Africa, leaving deposits of a substance that scientists call "Radium X" - which can heal and destroy. A large part of the film is made tediously in Africa in search of meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and uses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting itself with some kind of disease that makes it a great weapon as well. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both very good here. Lugosi takes a role in which he is the good guy, although I frankly found it a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes in Africa. The story also dragged on a bit, and although it caught my attention, it did not captivate me. Given that this is really a science fiction movie, not a horror movie, and that science fiction was in its early stages, I suppose the movie needs to be hacked a little off. All right - nothing more, but nothing less. 4/10
