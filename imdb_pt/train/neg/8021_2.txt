Visually disjointed and full of himself, the director apparently chose to seek false depth to expand a 5-minute plot into an 81-minute snore. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this movie are VERY limited, and the characters do not even feel real. How can you feel invested in a protagonist who has been made surreal? <br /> <br /> Substantially and stylistically, everything looks like a sequence of peculiar dreams. Doing an uneven camera job, strange silences and gaps in action, and what about the little spider image crawling across the screen? Anyone who has thought about it needs to go back to film school. It added no meaning, just cheese, and did not even stylistically work with the rest of the film (assuming the film even had a style, which is pretty close). What a failure
