Well, it's not often that we in the UK do a film about life in cities from the perspective of the Afro-Caribbean community, the last example I remember was the understated Babylon in 1980. So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a movie that was presented as the British version of La Haine! Well La Haine is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives this film an authenticity that has been lost in other British films lately, but my concern is that this film will probably end sadly. <br /> <br /> The film cleverly deals with the film. Black's growing problem about black violence that unfortunately is common in London, but I'm worried that filmmakers will now use modeling in the plot as opposed to the characters which is equally detrimental. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspiring for all of us but unfortunately lost and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black man in London the only future is violence and tragedy
