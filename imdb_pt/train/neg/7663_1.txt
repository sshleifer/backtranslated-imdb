Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well, it's STEPHEN DORFF TO GROW !! I personally just want to thank the brilliant casting directors for the work and effort. You are connected. Here's an idea, just my humble humble opinion as the movie go public, but it goes straight with your previous choices, a movie about the most brilliant neurophysicist in history inventing a pill to cure all the diseases known to man and get this , heres the decisive argument that they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you would love it. Seriously, you owe me $ 7.50.
