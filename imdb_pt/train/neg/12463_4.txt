OK Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> Obviously, I'm lying because it is. I'm a conservative, but politics will leave out my opinion of the film. This movie was anti Bush, anti Middle East, anti big oil advertisement, but that's not why it was bad. <br /> <br /> Fist off I will give credit where credit is due. I saw this opening night of the movie because I like these types of movies and I'm a political science major in collage. The cinematography was excellent and the acting went as far as I could say very good. <br /> <br /> The plot was impossible for me to decode however. I have been tested and I have an IQ of 138, but no matter how much I tried, there was no way to put the story of the movie together and the characters who were doing what. <br /> <br /> The story and the scene The sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless this is one of those movies that must be watched many times to get the full depth of the story, which may well be, I do not have Idea exactly what was happening. <br /> <br /> What makes sense, because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism, then make your argument impossible to criticize! If you can not dazzle them with brilliance, confuse them with Bull S.
