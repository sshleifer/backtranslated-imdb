First of all, yes, animals have emotions. If you did not know that, then I believe you're an idiot. But suppose none of us are stupid. We all know that animals have emotions, and now we want to see how those emotions manifest in nature, right? <br /> <br /> What we have is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that tries to show how animals are "human." Filmmakers seek high and low for filming animals involved in human behavior, and when that happens, they say, "That monkey is almost human!" (this is really a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is in human terms. They waste time theorizing about what makes dogs "smile," but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even show chimpanzees dressed in human clothes and wearing a cowboy hat. I was expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms. I wanted to learn how animals behave in their own languages. But, instead, researchers continue to resort to pedantic and anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add a soundtrack and pictures of chimpanzees "celebrating Christmas", and that was enough to turn my stomach. <br /> <br /> But it does not end there. Half of this documentary is filmed not in nature, but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All camera images of chimpanzees are made through steel bars, and we see how these monkeys are crowded into their barren concrete cages. A particularly disturbing moment happens near the beginning (although you have to be quick to notice), where a captive monkey says in a sign language: "Wanna go out, hurry up." <br /> <br /> Obscure references are made to "stress tests" and psychological experiments that I shudder to imagine. Babies are separated from their mothers at birth and receive wire dolls to prove that the pups of monkeys yearn for a "maternal figure." And after 40 years of experiments, the researchers have convinced themselves in the back to come to their brilliant conclusion: the monkeys have emotions. <br /> <br /> A chimpanzee named "Washoe" has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for this purpose. and to this day it remains so. We have a brief glimpse (again through bars) of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather dull expression. Personally, I do not need to see more experimental data. Washoe, I apologize for all our kind.
