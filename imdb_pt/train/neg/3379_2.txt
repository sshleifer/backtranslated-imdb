I recently bought the DVD, forgetting how much I hated the film version of "A Chorus Line". Every change director Attenborough made in history failed. <br /> <br /> By making the director-cassie relationship so prominent, the whole set-premise of the musical navigates through the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the musical numbers are accelerated and rushed. The show hit leaves all the broken meaning when it is given to Cassie's character. <br /> <br /> The general scenario is very self-conscious. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give a 2 is because some of the big numbers can still be enjoyed despite the movie's attempt to extract all the joy and spontaneity from it.
