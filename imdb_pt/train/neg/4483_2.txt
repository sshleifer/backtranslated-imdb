I admit I liked the first, and I was really looking forward to the sequel. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. Of course the special effects were technically amazing - but they were not believable. It looked more like a cartoon. Okay, I admit I like 80% of the chase scene - but the fight with all the Smiths? He was very obviously excited. <br /> <br /> I can accept all this. What I can not accept is that the parties without action were crap. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was in a speech that lasted forever and meant nothing. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed by the little plot that existed. What this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first film (except about the existence of the matrix). This movie was a bit like watching the episode of DALLAS, where you find that all previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want my $ 7 back!
