Personally I think this show seems very cheap. Some of the actors are terrible. They do this and look fake. I can always tell you how this will end in the first 10 minutes or less of watching, because they make it transparently clear. It's not very well written either. I love watching this to laugh about it. You know the saying "Is it so bad that it's good?" Well, that saying applies to this show. I also like to watch just to see if I am right when I think everything will end. So far I've been right all the time. It's like a little game I play. It's good when you're bored and you feel like laughing at something.
