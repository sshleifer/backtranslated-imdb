I agree with the previous review, what a disappointment. He rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie from Mira and Olivier. I was surprised by their performance, I expected more because they are good actors. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a slow start, but it got worse. I even laughed at some more maneuvers !! when it's supposed to be a mystery movie. You can even guess who the killer is beforehand! <br /> <br /> Really what happened? <br /> <br /> Sorry to say, but do not even bother, you will waste time and money. boring
