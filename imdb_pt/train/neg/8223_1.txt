Definitely definitely the worst movie I've ever seen, no questions asked! Contradictors of this opinion may argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as the others, since it is an independent, low budget film, but is it coming? the amateurism and the thinness of innovation are horrifying. <br /> <br /> Agreeing with everything that has been said about this movie, for example, the dimly minded mind (when that is bad, you make another attempt to film the scene, damn it! the thing that I found most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script, assuming that such a thing existed during production.There was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for viewers, girls changed personality several times and they seemed to show absolutely no corner of rationality or even even brains - five girls relatively in shape against a slight female psychopath? Join her, why do not you? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered as an achievement for this title is the camera do not leave the van at any time, thus, the viewer seeing everything from within it - which is, like the rest of the movie, a good idea performed exponentially terribly. And by the way, this movie does not it's NOTHING with The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a handheld camera? this is an effect and not a trace! Used smartly can be breathtaking, but in this case it's an excuse for inadequate cinematography.
