Life in some fascist or near-fascist state that severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurring theme in both modern literature and filmmakers. Such works post warnings about undesirable trends in our society to be observed; but to be effective they must also be fun. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective at posting the notices than having fun enough to become really widely read; while with the movies the problem is usually the opposite. The first such work to become widely known was probably "1984" by George Orwell (first published in 1948), and this is still readily available in both book and film form. Watch or read it: and then, when you're feeling a little depressed by the inhumanity of man, hit Cinderella 2000. This is a low-budget comedy based on the same theme that provides a vision without effort, but without reward; and as in 1984 the calendar now passed beyond its previous period. Most of the comedy is put with a spatula, although there are only a few genuinely funny moments. To exercise your mind in the long intervals between them, you can focus on the question of whether this movie will gain a new extension of life being released as a DVD or if it will finally disappear into oblivion, since tape copies deteriorate past redemption . There are many worse movies appearing like DVDs these days, and frankly I do not care much about what happens anyway. So far the best of the films of this genre has probably been "The Iron Lady's Tale," but I would be very happy to trade them for a well-made movie from the novel "The Iron Heel" by Jack London. As ambitious as it may be, it still seems incredible that no modern filmmaker has dared to try (the IMDb only lists a silent black and white version made in Russia in 1919).
