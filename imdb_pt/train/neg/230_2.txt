That was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wooden that it makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that turn in Four Weddings, equally painful. Another film portraying England full of chocolate huts and greens of the village. I mean that school, how many schools other than maybe Hogwarts look like this? The police station looked like the Heartbeat set (a nauseating British series set in the 1960s). This movie simply could not decide what it wanted to be - a comedy or a serious examination of the trends hidden in women's friendships. If he had stayed with the first, the sex scenes of the cemetery and the very stupid assault of the marriage could have worked (I say only). But these scenes simply did not work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate would talk to Molly again after her terrible behavior. One final note - what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in that pile of poop? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell must be careful to announce wrinkles.
