When I first chose this movie, I was intrigued by the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. I'm a fan of animation and I love it when it's successfully merged with live action. However, the animation in this movie was about everything I liked. Although it should be said that the performance of the actors was excellent. The visual visual - including the animation - gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the play. However, this was the quality of discomfort was lost between the exaggerated images, both visual and in the script, that you were practically hammered in the head with. The most annoying of this was the relative lack of importance to the plot. It seemed that the plot was shod with horns at irregular intervals, giving a stuttering effect that massively hampered the flow of the piece. Felisberto's over-voice-especially that of the end-seemed a desperate attempt to fill holes in the plot that had been ignored in favor of parallel issues like the ant's whole thing (and even that was not properly addressed). I'm afraid the whole play was, at best, a "first reasonable attempt" by a teenager who spent a lot of time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from seasoned filmmakers.
