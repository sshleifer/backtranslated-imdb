The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was his appointment to the original music and costume for the Oscars. I must admit I was less impressed by this movie. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (by the way Glen Close plays this role very well) is released from the hospital because of her good behavior. She likes all kinds of animals and locks all her fur away. From there, we just wait until it starts to have crises. In a short time, she does and tries to make the best cover in the fashion world, of course, for herself and Dalmatian skin. In addition to Glen Close, I found the whole cast a little silly but funny from a child's point of view. That's fair, since your target market is, I suppose, children under 12. It is good entertainment for children and families, but did not do much for me. * outside of *****
