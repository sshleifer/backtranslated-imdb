Woody Allen did "September", proving that even a genius could ruin everything. This is Mel Brook's "September." Monumentally stupid, annoying and boring, I must confess I did not watch until the end. The movie is among the few disgraced (eg, "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") who put me to sleep or forced me to look for the "rewind" button. And I say this, unfortunately, as a devoted fan of Mel Brooks. He should keep the comedy straight and leave the social commentary alone. As the same guy who did "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" could create a dog like that is beyond me. To be avoided at all costs.
