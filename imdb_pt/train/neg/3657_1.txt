Whoever did this nonsense has completely missed the point. Jane is a comic strip to excite without being despicable. <br /> <br /> This giant mess tries to be funny and exciting, but it's just a mess. There is not a decent performance on it ... even the normally dependable Jasper Carrott is painfully bland. <br /> <br /> The American guy whose name escapes me is as ridiculous as he was in flash gordon. <br /> <br /> Maud Adams tries like a villain, but she's a little long for that kind of thing. All these things would not matter if the girl were sexy or funny or nice. She is not. Kirsten Holmes disappeared into obscurity after that and so much the better. <br /> <br /> I ran more fun stuff in the bathroom. Avoid
