This is one of the worst movies of all time. I like cheesy movies, but that's just awful. Where are the movie images that are in the box? I think more money was spent on the illustrations of the DVD box than on the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Why would a company release a DVD claiming that the cover is so misleading? I feel like an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box. As much as I explore IMDb, I should have done a little research and made a list before visiting my local video store. I have no one to blame except myself. I want my money and time back. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity is motivating you, stick umbrellas in your eyes. It will be much more enjoyable. You've been warned!
