Come on folks some early reviewers almost wrote a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old TV show from the 60's! This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the more serious baby (Yeoman Barrow) already used in Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series, they were totally confined to the sound stages. <br /> <br /> This use of an outdoor (and cat) rental gives proper depth and an almost cinematic quality to a very common episode of this now dated and very familiar show. <br /> <br /> Except for some notable exceptions namely "The city on the verge of eternity", "assignment of the Earth" and "Tomorrow is yesterday" The old Star Trek series needs to be seriously traced -balled and Put out of your boring misery. A half dozen good episodes of '79 is a very bad bounce average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the boring things that Gene Roddenberry produced at the time, contrary to the popular belief that some people worshiped the ground on which he walked, he really did a lot of crap! He does not deserve to be spoken at the same time as Irwin Allen, for example. <br /> <br /> Just look at the whole of the Enterprise Bridge from a modern point of view. They wore unstable plywood on the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard over the dashboards. You can clearly see the folds on paper! Every expense spared or what!
