Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a cook of a pirate ship who takes the rank of captain after he kills the previous one. Although he has witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins to lose his memory and the treasure map he gets goes blank. So Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you put an ad for it?) And help lead a path to treasure. It is incomprehensible how anyone could have funded this useless movie. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as a director, and given Medak's talent in The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the grainy, dimly lit scenes Milligan had in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the first 10 minutes of the movie as the condemned pirate captain. He is probably very grateful that the young Frankenstein was released the same year it was filmed and canned, so he can keep it off his resume. Franciosa looks bold as the handsome power-behind-Scratcher, but he and the salesman seem very desperate, with Sellers' makeup and hair looking rather awful. They had to know that this movie was bombing while they were filming. With lines like these, I can understand any possible discomfort: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (about to be hanged) You will pay for it. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I won. t. I'll do it for free. <br /> <br /> And that's one of the good jokes. It is incredible to me that much of Sellers' prolific material is still in the vaults, but that has been available on VHS for over 15 years! How about someone performing and launching in the United States the well received British TV show "A Show Called Fred," starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester?
