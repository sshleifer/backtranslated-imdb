Frank Sinatra plays an ex-soldier and a frustrated, tough and hard-drinking writer who returns to his hometown in the Midwest and reunites with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the city with a selfless wife and stubborn daughter . Frank gets involved with Dean Martin, the ignorant Shirley MacLaine, and has some disagreements with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. A simplified drama about the novel, with a role for MacLaine who is sometimes "colored" and embarrassingly sentimental (his drunken belt in "After You Gone", however, is the highlight of the film, and is cleverly treated). Director Vincente Minnelli supervises him directly, but he is surprisingly sad and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The image looks incredibly beautiful in widescreen, with a good eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the slag. ** in ****
