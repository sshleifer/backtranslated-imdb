Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I'm a cyclist, but okay, it's full of fun little technical details with some ingenious ideas scattered among them. Trying to follow in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a laid back and cheerful tale, which is a radical departure from his usual morbid food. Hardly anyone to be criticized for his ambition or his vision, is genuinely unexpected, so to see all of Park's effort add up very little. <br /> <br /> I am a CYBORG, but this IS OK seems to surprisingly subtract from itself as it progresses, with the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, the jokes are plentiful and eccentric humor is plentiful, but everything fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the public. The characters are cute and quirky and played with enthusiasm by the cast, but as hard as I try, I could not care less. SYMPATHY FOR THE LADY OF REVENGE was a false step, indicating perhaps that Park was exaggerating a bit, but still managed to show a little of the director's unique brilliance and, in the wake of an impressive filmography, was promptly forgiven. None of the assured confidence that commanded the COMMON SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. REVENGE is evident here. I'm a cyclist, but it's okay, it left me so completely uncommitted that I caught myself instinctively, advancing from time to time (more regularly as the movie progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10, and by that measure, that probably deserves no more than a 3. For the love of old times, I will be generous: 4/10
