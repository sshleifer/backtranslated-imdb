What a horrible and horrible movie. The worst collection of cliches I've seen in a long time. Not that I've seen much. I left the theater screaming after 40 minutes in search of a strong drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many expressions injured and tortured can 1 person have? The talents of Aidan Quinn were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be politically correct, this film further reinforces racial stereotypes. (Bravo solitary music teacher inexperienced teaches disadvantaged violin children in poor neighborhood school). The children were not at all cute! Just written to fit the shocking script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me shiver for once. Real horror this!
