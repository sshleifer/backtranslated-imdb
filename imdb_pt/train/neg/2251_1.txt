Really an incredible pile of pap! A predictable, slow-moving, soul-destroying, numbing film for which, cutting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife looks ... well, almost necessary. <br /> <br /> The acting has ended the dialogue, each scene is at least twice as long as necessary, the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that the career is on the rise is simply very monotonous and worldly for words. The music would be good if you did not have to watch the movie, but in fact, three good songs are not reward enough for the effort needed to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie I prayed to God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me. <br /> Never, never, never again.
