I do not recommend this film because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story should be in Algerian Berber territory, this was filmed in the desert of southern Tunisia, (completely different culture, I know I am from Tunisia and Algeria), the other shocking element was the character of his aunt companion, speaks in the film with a very eloquent French academic French, while the character she interprets should be disturbed never left her kind of mountain, then living as a Bedouin with such education in this context is impossible, The most disgraceful and disrespectful scene especially for the people of the region is the segment "femme repudiee" that is pure invention of the writer / director, things like this will never happen in an Algerian society ever !!!
