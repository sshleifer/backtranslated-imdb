There seems to be a bit of a curse when it comes to gay movies. That is, happy endings are not very common. Beautiful thing excluded, gay movies tend to end in broken relationships or premature death. And some, like Come Undone, end ... period. <br /> <br /> The creators of this horrible nonsense have one or two things to learn about plot, direction, and timing. In the first ten minutes of this movie, I was a bit confused, and even more so after the first glimpse of Jeremie Elkaim's character having a small psychological session. It seems that this movie was randomly assembled without the slightest attempt of continuity or consistency. There is no way to know when you are seeing the gift or some kind of ethereal flashback. I could only put up with it so much before it became really nasty. Stephen Holden of The New York Times called this film "... shimmeringly beautiful and absolutely real." Well, it looks like Stephen invested in beer glasses before you see it, because it's really far from beautiful. Due to all the praise that this movie received, I expected something worth watching. Unfortunately, the film lived up to its title. And at the end of the movie (which did not provide any resolution, I must add) it is evident that the writers, the director and the movie have all Come Undone.
