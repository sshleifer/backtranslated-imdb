Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was thrilled when I bought my ticket to Syriana. Having seen the trailer and being a lover of suspense movies, I expected to see, first and foremost, a rapidly moving film that wisely plunges into global policymaking and the relationship between oil, power and corruption, from a new angle . Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The rhythm was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotyped, the interlaced editing made the understanding of logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, in the end you do not care. Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
