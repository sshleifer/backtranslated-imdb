The film begins with promise, but takes a long time in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We hung, but nothing more, except for languid shots of serious and thoughtful male faces to savor. Certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb. It's a shame, because the concept is not without merit. <br /> <br /> We wonder why a loving couple - no less than father and son - should be so far from the real world that their own world is preferable. when claustrophobic beyond any imagination. This loss of presence in the real world is, in a very obvious and unnecessary way, contrasted with the fact that the son has enlisted in the military. Why not the circus, so we can at least enjoy some color? We get a painful sense of loss but unfortunately no lighting, which is disconcerting considering that the film is apparently about some form of realization that is not available to all of us.
