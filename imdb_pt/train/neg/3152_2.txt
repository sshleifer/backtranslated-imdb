Badly structured, poorly written, laden with clich√©s and simple dialogues. Not a single scene shines. The actors fight with a painfully monotonous scenario that manages to avoid completely surprises, twists or conflicts. You know it from the first ten minutes to where you're going. <br /> <br /> For a movie set in NY, there is almost no feeling for the city. There are a dozen other independent films that can make it look magical on a small budget. This seems to have been filmed in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you blow Natasha Henstridge, why dress her in loose sweaters? Why make Vartan look boring and monotonous? Where's the attraction? I felt like I was watching a sub-par Christian movie of the week was so asexual and moralizing. <br /> <br /> The great success of Steven Feder is that he convinced people to make this movie bland.
