I came to the conclusion that when watching the Euro Horror, especially films made by cult star Jess Franco, you can not expect a plot that makes a lot of sense. However, Franco went overboard with this movie; and despite a surreal atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the director's best - Succubus is, unfortunately, a truly horrible movie. I have to admit that I saw the American cut version, which runs in about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring as it is. The plot has something to do with a woman looting; practicing S & M and talking trash, and it's all very annoying. There is no gore and sex is monotonous, and most of the time of execution is taken by a boring dialogue and despite the fact that it is a short film; I had a hard time getting to the end. I have to say that the locals look good and Franco did a good job at using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who did some classic trash movies - but it looks like he was made for money, and overall I recommend skipping and seeing some of the director's most interesting work.
