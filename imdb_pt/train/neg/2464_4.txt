I loved the first part, The Impossible Planet, but whoops, what a deception part two 'The Satan Pit' is. The cliffhanger of something apparently coming out of the well was - nothing coming out of the well. As the ages passed crawling around the air vents to fill the story, the Beast was a noisy thing void of intelligence, so no confrontation between the Doctor and the villain I was anticipating. The TARDIS is somehow inside the pit, although the pit is not open until long after the TARDIS has fallen into the crust of the planet. And finally another ready solution that existed for no logical reason - I mean, why not plunge the Beast into the Hole as soon as the hole opens? Why not dive in all those years ago instead of imprisoning him anyway? Why not - I could go on, but I lost interest ...
