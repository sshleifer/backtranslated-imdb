This is not a horror movie, but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie, to be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot, horrible acting and annoying music. If you watch only the trailer, you'll know enough ... It's a shame that such a thing is available on VHS or video while there are so many good movies unavailable. If you like vampires, try Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic by Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti. These are masterpieces if you compare this to this garbage. Rating = up to "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with that opinion.
