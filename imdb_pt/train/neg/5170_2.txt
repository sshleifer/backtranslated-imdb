Wow, it could have been such a good movie, It starts with Brittany tied Daniels, I'm thinking cool, let's get a flash back, but nothing, the movie starts again with the filming of the boy. This movie would probably have been better if it had not been for acting. I mean, the acting was mostly horrible .. Although with the lines that the poor actors had to deal with I think they did the best they could ... Still really screw up the movie for me .. The twins were the only ones who seem to have some acting skills .. The film ventures in time for the supposedly shocking conclusion .. All in all I have seen low budget movies worse but considering this was hype with the 8 movies to die I was very disappointed .. By the way, there were some critics who said there was blood and stuff. I saw the same movie .. Well, that's 4 out of 8, and so far only one was good ..
