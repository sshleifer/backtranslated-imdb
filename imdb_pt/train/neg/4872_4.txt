Collection of production line of fart jokes pretending that 'Babe' was never made; the writers clearly hoped that the trick of watching the animals speak would be enough to keep the movie running. It is not. Eddie Murphy sells himself once again as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift to understand the incessant and unusual talk of guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. The cast of voice is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens and Brian Doyle-Murray) but the script is so unimaginative, bland and depressing that the whole thing balance bin kick very quickly.
