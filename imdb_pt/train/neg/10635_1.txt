There is an observation that one of the heroines was raped by "drunken soldiers" by Russian soldiers, which is completely false. This movie should not be shown just because of it. <br /> <br /> There is also a statement from someone that the KGB has prosecuted "Jews, Gypsies, etc.", which is "worse than Nazis." The KGB sought the so-called "Zionist" agents, who were imperialist (KGB) agents. This is totally different from targeting Judaism as a whole nation, as the Nazis did. Gypsies were never prosecuted. The KGB was a political tool and used politically, but from the internationalist point of view. Communists did not really distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole movie stinks like a fake. The main hero does not speak Russian, the signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, the KGB general seems totally false. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are totally invented, and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies and false things. Go to "Good Shepherd" instead.
