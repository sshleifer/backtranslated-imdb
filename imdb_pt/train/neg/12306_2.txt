This movie is a pure failure. I'm a fan of Steve Martin, but even he can not save the tired idea and script of Swiss cheese. Think of "Police Academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. Yuck. <br /> <br /> I do NOT feel that other reviewers' comments have reflected the poor rating that this movie received (and it rightly deserved!). It is extremely misleading. I have often seen this movie marked for $ 3.00 at the grocery store and now I certainly know why. <br /> <br /> If I could have my 90 minutes back ...
