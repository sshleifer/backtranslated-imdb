My first attempt to watch this ended in 8 minutes, approximately after the TV news scene, which I could not handle. It was about like this: Reporter 1: Hmm, there's a pyramid in our skies. Reporter 2: I think it's aliens. * awkward silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... A few days later I watched until the end, and it was not as horrible as I imagined, but there are serious problems with that. About half of the plot can be easily discarded. And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something. <br /> <br /> What good is the detective, the people of eugenics, and the monsters that are momentarily discarded by Horus? More fun was the monopoly scenario. "We are all powerful" gods, "who have lived for ages and, of all the games of the multiverse, we end up playing monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken seems coherent compared to that. <br /> <br /> The other half is terribly missing. What did our protagonist do to freeze? Why was not there a big event when he was released in the end? He had those annoying followers, remember? What happened to normal humans? What's the matter with the masked guy? How did the blue-haired girl show up? What about her vision? Etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> Visually everything is fine, more or less, if you disregard the Egyptian gods looking like rotting rotweiller heads.
