I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival with the great Dr. Uwe Boll in attendance. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply, really, really bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Boll "so bad it's really fun" way, but simply bad. The plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life (because of a past criminal history, apparently), does not get a job, and with a horrible 900-pound cheating wife. This man turns to his cult leader uncle on a plan to steal a truck full of toys containing the bird flu virus. Al Qaeda also has plans to steal the toys, and what follows is just under two hours of sex and violence completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible (except for Dave Foley, who really tries, though), the jokes never outweigh the kids being shot in the chest in slow motion, and people taking a poop. It's supposed to be satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think of "Airplane!" But made by the creators of South Park, and without jokes.
