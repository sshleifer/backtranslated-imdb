This idiot excuse for television is the most horrible garbage that has ever hit Australian television. The housemates are dull, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent and are chosen based on the fact that you would probably try to kill them if you had to live with them. As far as I'm concerned, Big Brother is the downfall of Western society, showing us how, as a society, we're on a steep slope to become brain-dead idiots. What happened to television that did not target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? This can not be classified as entertainment. I think it's true that Channel Ten can remove your soul. It happened with Rove McManus, who was once a respectable comedian and, once he moved to Channel 10, became horribly bland. With the exception of The Simpsons, which is done cleverly.
