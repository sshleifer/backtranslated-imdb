Yes, The Southern Star features a rather forgettable title song sung by Matt Monro. This pretty much sets the tone for this bloated and rather annoying feature, unbelievably miscast with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a great diamond. Add Harry Andrews (in a strange accent, no less) chasing an ostrich, tons of wildlife footage, and ragged, boring photographs of Raoul Coutard, and you'll end up with a wholly uninteresting joke in the jungles of Senegal.
