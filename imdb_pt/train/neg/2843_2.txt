Oh yeah, Sakura Killers is a nasty, goofy ninja movie, make no mistake about it. But it's also incredibly enjoyable. This is due in large part to the incredible presence of a Chuck Connors, who is considered the main actor of the film, but who really shines in some scenes. I suppose he should be a type of Obi Wan Kenobi ("The hard ninja-buster", the copy of the box exclaims), but his "wisdom" is laughable. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says that this is the sign of mental retardation, not supreme concentration. <br /> <br /> But really, his two helpers, Sonny and Dennis, have such a horrible dialogue that 'Brooklyn', as we call The Colonel, tends to shine in comparison. Especially watch out for Dennis's logic regarding the 'genetic splicing' with which Sakura is involved. If you know anything about cloning, you will die of laughter. And yes, this is a big point of the plot, guys. <br /> <br /> A very entertaining movie, Sakura Killers is a gem difficult to find. I'm not going to ruin the final 'trick' for you too, except it's a perfect set for a Sakura Killers 2. Too bad Chuck Connors died. :-( Because he has one of the mildest ways to blow ninjas.
