How cynical are the writers, to assimilate. I may be an American citizen, but I do not need to see other Americans slapping my back for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I am surprised that so few have commented on how extremely jingoistic, sentimental and banal the dialogue in this film really is. The film's historical inaccuracies are not as rough and offensive as in "U-571" (which changes British divers to Americans), but you still walk away feeling a bit slimy. Indeed, the Germans in this movie do nothing but admire the Americans among battle scenes! How sad, unnecessary! I'd just like to tell the writers: It's obvious to many of us that you can not capture real people, with real problems, under real pressure, and you've taken some well-tested shortcuts. Lucky for you there will always be nationalist nutjobs to enjoy your sugar coated gut.
