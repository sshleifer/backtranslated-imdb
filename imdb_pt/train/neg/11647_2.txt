CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; an Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg, Germany. An easily forgotten film. Even in spite of a good sequence of car chases, this movie seems to be almost aimless. A new Don assumes a powerful mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. The unwritten laws and ethics of the Mafia code make it difficult to trust someone, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence generate the same in return. This can not be put on a shelf with the true gangster epics. Just the look of the movie brings back memories of the American drive-in passage. Even popular American actor Telly Savalas can not increase the caliber of this criminal drama. Antonio Sabato also stars with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
