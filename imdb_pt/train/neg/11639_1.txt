SPOILERS: I'm always surprised how many people gave this game good reviews. It was terrible. The script and the voice acting only ruined it. Gabriel and Grace are the most unlikely characters in the game. You almost pray for their deaths. And worst of all, there are fewer vampires in this game than werewolves in The Beast Within. <br /> <br /> The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing. If you're expecting some kind of Anne Rice-style vampire story, forget it. The story of this game has very little to do with vampires. You will not see anything until the end, and yet you will not be able to face them. <br /> <br /> History has radical and almost blasphemous visions of Christianity. I'm surprised you left the drawing board. I'm not even a Christian and I found it offensive. Mainly, the story revolves around a quest for the Holy Grail and buried treasure. The abduction of a real baby, which should have been the focus, is really left out. There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the baby. In fact, he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first blocks of time. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very bad. The characters move in the rhythm of a snail, even in the best systems. They are robust and outdated. And it's hard to go from FMV to The Beast Within for that horrible gameplay engine for Blood of the Sacred. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace also gives a terrible turnaround. I do not really know why it was so horribly rushed, but they sleep together. And it's not fun. Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as another sister and he does not think she's the one for him. And he seems very upset that they slept together. But he's so nasty throughout the game, you hardly care at this point. His dialogue was the worst of the game. And he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendoes on anything female throughout the game. At the end of the game, Grace leaves him with what appears to be a Dear John letter. I think she was as fed up with him as most of the players. <br /> <br /> I found the story annoying and annoying. I was hoping to play a story of a real baby that was kidnapped by vampires. And I was waiting to see and fight vampires, maybe even Gabriel or Grace would turn into one. But not. Instead, history focused on the distorted view of the author on Christianity. What a pity. Here they had the elements for a great adventure, and instead we got it. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting parts of the game were really in the end. We got some action-style puzzles in the end. But it was not worth suffering throughout the game to get to them. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this game. I got it back when it came out years ago, and I hated the gameplay so much I filed it for years. I just recently took out the dust to see what I was missing out on. And now, I'm sorry for that. My favorite characters have been ruined. I hope there is a fourth game just to rescue the series. And I hope they get it right next time. It would be a shame to end the series with this plot.
