I would not recommend this unless you're interested in David Copperfield and want to "complete the set." There are some good performances (eg Uriah Heep) and well directed moments (eg beating) but overall it really pales in comparison to the BBC version of 1999 as well as earlier versions. <br /> <br /> There are inexplicable changes in the story that really do not serve anything except possibly for simplicity (stolen jewelry being an example). The American cast was poorly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she's wrong as Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is just a little better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr Micawber; however, it leaves it a little too much and becomes irritating. He also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond the eccentric and becomes simply absurd. Anthony Andrews is menacing as Mr. Murdstone, but he is almost expected to wear a black cloak and tie David's mother to a train line (though perhaps this is partly because of Dickens). <br /> <br /> I bought this for free with a newspaper. It helped to spend a Sunday afternoon, but I felt more disappointed than delighted at the end of it
