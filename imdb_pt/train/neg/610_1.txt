I bought this movie on the cheap on a sale, after reading the back of the DVD and assuming that anyway I can not lose, if it was rubbish, then no loss, if it was good, then bargain ... <br /> < So I watched ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this film he commanded a very small screen presence, seeming to not do much, even the death of his friend near the The beginning that triggers the "action" in the plot seems to affect him very little, and his eventual revenge is just boring and non-dramatic. Normally a movie that has such grandiose themes as revolution and revenge is able to capture the audience and capture them to feel something for the characters, however, watching this movie looked like another series of confusing and almost random events that came together for their eventual conclusion ... At this point I cried ... <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was the most terribly painful part of seeing that I had Eve's scene in which the pilot sacrifices himself, refusing to jump out of the truck loaded with explosives for not wanting to kill civilians, is not as tragically sad as it is annoyingly painful, though not as bad as emergency surgery on the injured girl. The performance was poor in all respects, the script and story were weak, the "action" was even weaker, and the "visuals" were not so clearly so visual. To summarize, there are movies that are good, movies that are bad, movies that are so bad they are good, movies that are terrible ... <br /> <br /> And then, on a whole new level, it's "McBain ".
