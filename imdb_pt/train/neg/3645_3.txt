A young man gets a bad hair day, goes out on a hill and falls where he can not escape. Then he knows MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" face of 2,000 years ago as his best friend, and a sound-like Arnold Schwarzenegger. His Herculean strength helps the boy out of danger and then adjusts to modern life. So what's the big deal? This is the worst idea for a "family" outing! Anyway, this should not have been tried, really! Our fictional character of power and strength is nothing more than a typical stranger who seems common to the rest of the universe. To increase blasphemy is the lack of something new or attractive, and before you know it, there is some attempt at violence that does not qualify as "family" entertainment. The scene in which Atlas complains about his undershorts is shocking, however. Just spend a nice quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
