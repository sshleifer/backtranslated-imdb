As a former teacher (!) I must confess that I shrank into many scenes - though I kept watching until the end. I want to know why ?! (Boredom, perhaps?) :-) <br /> <br /> The first opening scenes seemed to me incredibly miscellaneous and confusing. The plot, too, though there were some good ideas - the situation of a care teacher, for example - was not focused enough in any direction for 3-D development. <br /> <br /> None of Mr. Nolte's best. moments. As for the young Mr. Macchio, does he talk like that in all the movies? <br /> <br /> Draw and complain side, only the hairstyles were a nostalgic (nauseating) trip. <br />
