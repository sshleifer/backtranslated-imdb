I did not expect much from this TV movie. You have to set the bar lower than you would for the dwarf limbo of any TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr. Still, he managed to disappoint, ceasing to be a good movie. Each scene was colored, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and TV shows dealing with conspiracies of big companies in the script, leaned back and said, "My job is done". It's all clich√©, all predictable, and, even worse, actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously (even when plot developments are laughable). Do yourself a favor. Watch "The X-Files" if you are in the mood for paranoia. They deal better with that. Also, let someone know that sitting down through "Fatal Error" is just that.
