From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another part of the film slime. Supposedly based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only resemblance he has to anything that Haggard actually wrote is that it occurs in Africa (though an Africa that has dinosaurs - which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes!), And some characters with the same names. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) set off for a treasure, armed only with a medallion, and end up just where the treasure is, purely by chance. Along the way, they find a heterogeneous assortment of extremely lame monsters, choose a French chef, and McCallum has an affair with the Queen of Phenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so ridiculous, it's a joke. That's the only reason I did not give 1.
