By all flattering people are doing more than Miike and his work. I sat in this movie tonight. I realized, if it's as good as Ringu, as I assumed with those comments, that it will be worth my time. <br /> <br /> I'm not that lucky. <br /> <br /> I'm all for finding the next great director (or writer), but I do not think Miike is the chosen one. I do not have a Masters of Fine Arts from NYU, but I know this: a horror movie has to have rhythm. He also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this movie made me shake my head. Some of the scenes near the end were so bad that I went to the refrigerator and stood there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end, eyes wide and gaping. A famous director once made the claim, and I'm paraphrasing, a movie could be done by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll. Kou is not an actress good enough to do that job. She looks paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than I'd like to remember. And she's not the only one doing an imitation of a deer in the headlights; other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance. The script gives them little space to do much more for a long time. <br /> <br /> I like Asian cinema. The Hong Kong action movies of the last 30 years, the Korean horror as "Phone" and "Koma," Ang Lee's work, some of the bland but fun Filipino movies with free sex and fighting as well as others. Chakushin Ari I could have done without.
