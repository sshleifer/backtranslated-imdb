The film is about a young man, Michael, who takes care of the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of his clients' relatives. At the same time, he decides to model his death after the Zodiac Assassin of the 60s. He contacts the author of a book about the Zodiac Killer and they form a friendship. Michael has a weapon (apparently the only weapon, as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors, but not portrayed as the same weapon.) And he leaves killing. Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like B movies. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but the editing and acting really drowned the plot. I thought the 'blood' was too fake, the lighting was awful in some places, and the dialogue was very normal. The movie was filmed on video, which is fine, but the editing of the movie just made for some strange scenes 'Plan 9'. It's not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something with a little more care, move on to something else.
