I was loyal to my respect for Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. I watched the whole movie with my family and some friends. I have no idea what the movie was. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their best efforts. <br /> <br /> It does not fit very well. It is very hectic and there is little comedy. I'm disappointed. It could have been so much better. <br /> <br /> I waited months to see this movie based on the notes on the booklet. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money unless you are an expert and just want to see all the movies of Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend a night.
