This movie made me go. The title was perhaps the biggest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and its mission to dominate the US and a group of solitary survivors together, and they plan on killing the zombies. COMPLETELY WRONG! It's about a psychopathic cop with a weakness for killing his female prisons, which comes to him when a bunch of zombie women rise from their graves to take revenge. As you can see, there is nothing about the nation or a county involved. Where to begin with the gravity that this cinematic disaster caused to our nation. <br /> <br /> First, zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with a black eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies, but intelligent, debatable and intelligent cannibal killing machines that eat as a result of their most primitive basic needs? These zombie women walk like prostitutes and catwalk models, they talk like they're in a poor movie noir and do not act like real zombies. Of course eating and killing are there, but where is the lack of attention and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of this genre and asks the question: "why can not zombies be beautiful machines to kill vixen?" I would say this movie would be considered a very bad indie film that was produced and made by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who really loves zombie genres, it's an insult and as much as scary - not even.
