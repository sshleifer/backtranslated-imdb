was enjoying this movie until Ed Norton's facials editions. Without revealing details of the plot - one afternoon he wore a light beard, but that night the beard had disappeared and a very lush mustache was in place. It was much fuller than the mustache that accompanied the beard. Later, during a dark night in the open, the mustache disappeared and he appeared clean refuge. This was on one occasion when stopping shaving would not be an option. These discrepancies in continuity distracted me completely from the rest of the film and ruined whatever credibility they once had. Also, I found the long scene of the cowboy alone in his room was very reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver. Even if it were to be a tribute, it was put too much for this viewer.
