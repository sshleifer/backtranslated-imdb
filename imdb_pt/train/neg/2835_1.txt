The Dereks seemed to struggle to find scrolls for Bo after "10". <br /> <br /> I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys. One day, the "Ghosts Can not Do It" script circulated among the "fish house" trainers, where food was prepared for dolphins. There was a scene in which a -dolphin- supposedly propositions Bo (or Bo the dolphin), asking to "go make eggs". Reading the script, we laughed -... <br /> <br /> We did not end up making any part of this movie at our facility, even though our dolphins were in "The Big Blue!" <BR> <BR> This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he had fun in this movie, as he certainly did nothing for his legacy.
