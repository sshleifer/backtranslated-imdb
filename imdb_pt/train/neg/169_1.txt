I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from NYC. After 30 minutes, I told him, "You gotta be kidding. Is this some kind of joke?" He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the dumbest movies ever made. "What should it be?" I asked. "An advertisement movie made for kids?" The plot is stupid. The acting is the worst of all for most directors and, frankly, people who look at that kind of crap and think it has something to do with life, love or even the afterlife, which offers an incredibly stupid vision. .. Help. Please, if someone tries to get you to put this on your DVD or video player, consider it as a virus introduced to your computer ... it will not destroy your player but it will destroy your night. If they had made Razzies in the 40's, that would have won in all categories. (PS, also under the dubious nickname "Stairway to Heaven").
