This 'movie' has to be the biggest pile of fumes I've ever seen, what else can I say than bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. There is NOTHING to save this 'movie' and I pray they NEVER talk about doing a continuation. If you are thinking of seeing this, then you should know that the plot is that two garbage collectors are dragged to save the land. Films like Men in Black were ripped to pieces and put together to make this 'Comedy', but they failed COMPLETELY. Please, avoid this movie, (save yourself).
