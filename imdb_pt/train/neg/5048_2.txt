I tried. I really did. I thought maybe if I gave Jo√£o Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy his movie. I know that after seeing THE GHOST I felt bad and almost disgusted to the core, but some of the reviews were very good and in favor, so I was like, "What the heck, at least you did not pay $ 10 in Give it a chance. "Sometimes it is better to go to the dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to relieve the horror of so much pain. I often wonder if it would be better to go back to my childhood and demand that my ex-bullies really let me have it. At other times, I often think that the world is really flat and that if I travel far enough, not only will I forget everything, but I will also be free, and that something wicked and lovecraftian will snatch me with its 9000. tentacles and squeezing life - and some 1995 fries, still lingering inside my esophagus - out of me. <br /> <br /> Is there a reason for Odete? I'd say no ... except maybe her Creator thought writing a story centered on her madness (which makes Alex Forrest look like Strawberry Shortcake) seems not only chilling, but completely sick to the bone. First of all, she decides to leave her current boyfriend (in hysterical screams) because she wants a child and he believes they are too young. She later falls into a funeral for a gay man and-get-to approach him, she pretends to be pregnant while insinuating herself into the life of her mother and the dead man's lover in the sickest way. Oh, of course, she screams like a banshee and throws herself not one, but a good three times in her grave. And there is this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes "Peter," which sums up an explanation of weak tea as love knows no gender. Or something like this. <br /> <br /> I'd say she's as crazy as a tin of cashew nut, without salt. But again, the director too. And me, for taking a chance on that. At least men look good. Other than that ... there is not much else to see here.
