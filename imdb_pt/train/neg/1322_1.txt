.... because if I were, I could have wished that I were being crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie - and I'm being "generous" that there was even a plot to start. As mentioned earlier, it is a misconception on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss is really the star. He was barely in the movie. And if he was indeed "frustrated," as the back cover indicated he was, well, it was probably because he said YES was in that disaster of a movie and could not get out of it! The film really seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and what his role in the film should be, in addition to extreme close-ups, was not as big as what Gene Barry's role really was - or was not. And speaking of "great" ... whoever has had the brilliant idea of ​​fitting into Gene Barry in the Humpty Dumpty suit, which displayed his leggings pulled up to the chin, should be condemned to a difficult time when watching this stoned film . I could keep talking about how horrible this movie was since the dialogue did not match the mouths of the "actors" (think of the Clutch Cargo), up the erratic leap from scene to scene (again, be generous even to call the pictures "scenes") for the lack of a plot .... However, if you are in bad genre early 70's and if you are in a cottage in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid & cat photos, I recommend having a good bottle of wine before embarking on this strange journey of a movie, because you will be grateful for not remembering the next day!
