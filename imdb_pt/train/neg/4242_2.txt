Men, I love cop movies full of action, shootings, chases, etc. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed after watching this short and unsatisfying movie. We've seen that before, the hostages, the bank, the outskirts ... However, two thugs who knock down several police and innocent people who simply stand in the line of fire - unbeaten by some Kevlar. <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Returning to the bank, where the idiot hostages did not lock the safe or the doors when the bad guys left. How dumb the director thought we were. <br /> <br /> Okay, the shots between a fake and good documentary were good, but after watching the movie I just had an idea: why the police could not? a decent shooting course? And why where so many cops and SWAT were on a really long break. Truly bad.
