This movie really has no beginning or end. And it really is VERY unbelievable. Mary-K and Ashley are trainees working in a matching room for an Italian fashion company. But for some reason, they are placed in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Colosseum), and all the other trainees they work with are as abnormally like models as they are. One thing I found obvious in this movie is how one of the twins does NOT end with the guy. I think they tried to twist their usual plot a bit. Good try.
