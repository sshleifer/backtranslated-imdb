As a big fan of just the first two seasons of BSG and the stand alone BSG Razor feature I was hoping that this version would return the franchise to its original glory days. Usually I have no problem with science fiction which is mainly directed by dialogues as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is restricted to some original ideas presented by good actors, one can create a deep movie with little CGI money spent. This prequel does not have any of the above mentioned requirements. The virtual reality world created by teenage terrorists was at once ridiculous and unbelievable. This scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to Restricted. Not that teens do not like virtual reality, full of sex and violence and heavy dance music. It is the part about those same teenagers who have the intellectual depth and reason or political and religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that baffles me. These children are definitely not from this planet. The film goes like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being a bit interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a devine consciousness by updating the student's firmware was fun, if not fun. But this old concept was far better portrayed and much more convincing in the brilliant and classic original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica draws its only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror movie. No surprise there! Overall, this movie was bland and not original and cheap, using recycled CGI from BSG's Caprica. I doubt I'll watch this space soap when it debuts on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless, of course, I'm suffering from a bad insomnia attack, when that show would definitely cure. Zzzzzzzz
