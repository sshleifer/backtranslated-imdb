Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet. <br /> <br /> The acting is unbearable and the history is basically absurd: only two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses. . Instead, it was a major city right now, the best days have passed. Secondly, Hamburg would never have been the city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the largest city at the time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than all this: the direction! How can a dilettante like this guy handle a movie like that? Impossible! There was not a single believable scene, the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter in the most severe scenes. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how a big television station can be so incompetent.
