Unbelievably bad performance, not a good story, unclear, flashy images and slow movements where they are less needed: Adrenaline is everything a movie should not be. Georgina Verbaan (so-and-so of Dutch soap actress who has not attended her English classes) plays the rich girl Freya, who has the habit of "looking for emotions." Which is basically doing dangerous stunts, breaking things and bothering people. And not in a fun Jackass way. Then there is the Dracko (Rivas). He sort of leads the group, but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there is the father of Freya (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. And in the end, we got Jason (the rookie Fyall), Freya's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> One day, Freya disappeared and everyone seems to be involved, but we, the viewer, do not call anyone. the cast is either sympathetic or believable, and the story does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Why was this done? 2/10
