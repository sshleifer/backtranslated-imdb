Basing a television series on works by a popular author is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learned this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title "The Racing Game." Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, an ex-jockey who turned private detective after an accident in which he lost his right hand, only to replace it with an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played the annoying Chico Barnes) made me think of a ponytail whenever he was on the screen. For six weeks, this less-than-dynamic duo charged the field, thwarting nefarious plans to fix races, usually by the same methods - blackmail, hijacking of horsemen or doping horses. Yorkshire Television played money on the show, but to no avail. Violent, sexist, forced and repetitive, he was quickly taken to the yard.
