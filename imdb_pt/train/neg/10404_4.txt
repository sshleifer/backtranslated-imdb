This, the direct death rattle of the Tremors series, features sixty seconds inspired (sawblade: you'll know when to see it) and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick. Tremors 4 was obviously shot at an extremely low budget. That means they only had enough special effects for three or four minutes of precious violence against human worms at the most. The mediocre cast of cliches and banal writing ensure that the remaining hour and half of the Tremors 4 experience is at least fifteen thousand years in length. Only the Tremors' unconditional fans will be able to watch, much less enjoy this movie. If you are not among them, do not bother.
