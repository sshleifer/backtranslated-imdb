This movie has little to recommend it, although little is the breathtaking scenery, cinematography and wildlife direction, it is difficult to bring your weaknesses in the company of such complimentary criticism. It is precisely these things, however, that make the lack of a satisfying plot and its execution so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched this with my children and none of us was impressed by the end. Yes, the photos were great, the expansive landscapes on the other side of the forest and the mountains were magnificent, but what was happening in the foreground? The rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns very slowly a very basic lesson about becoming wildlife friend - and leaves easily, given the history of this sort of thing. It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely new about how it is told, and we have all seen this before, and indeed, more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. <br /> <br /> The only thing really to be gleaned from this movie is a feel of how to work with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.
