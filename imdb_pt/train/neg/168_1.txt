Despite a decent first season, this series never came close to realizing its potential. Defined as a prequel to the original "Star Trek" series, it was almost condemned from the outset by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt compelled to limit and artificially restrict the definition of what might be a "Star Trek" series made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic point of view). The current show-runner, Brannon Braga, did not help at all because of his previous Trek episodes and oversight of the franchise's inner mythology (it was painfully obvious from an early age that he was just paying). I've never seen a series that consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors (except for Jolene Blaylock) for so long. It is as if the whole series were produced in bubbles existing outside the contemporary television scene, where the audience (even a Trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic needs and desires. Unfortunately, it seems that Berman and Braga were able to convince the upper echelons of Paramount that "Enterprise" suffered from "franchise fatigue" and that its main audience did not leave but was expelled. Produce a quality offering that meets the high ideals and standards of your predecessors and they (the audience) will come. Put simply, in a TeeVee universe where we get programs such as "Battlestar: Galactica" and "The Shield", powers should give the audience a "Star Trek" that increases and is dramatically competitive. It's so simple and easy.
