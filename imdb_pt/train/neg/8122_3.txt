Painful to watch, and not entirely out of empathy with the character struggles. Two of the main characters, Cynthia, the mother, and Monica, the acknowledged daughter, spend most of the film pathetically crying and bitterly crying respectively. His characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable. Not worth the wait. I would like a speech worthy of honesty among families to be less of a headache to see.
