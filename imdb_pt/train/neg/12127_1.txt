Sorry for Fulci fans, but I could not get through this. The soundtrack was as annoying as they came, the acting was puerile, the story was made and made, and the direction was non-existent. The massacre looked honestly like a children's movie project. But I've seen some of them, and they actually look better than that! It seems to have been so underfunded that they could not afford ... ANYTHING! It's not a DoP, not a director, no one who has, even remotely, an idea of ​​what acting was. It was a very poor cinematic experience; one of my worst. <br /> <br /> This was the worst sucking festival I've ever seen, alongside Terror Toons, which loses only to Killer Klowns of the Outer Space. I have nothing more to say about it. <br /> <br /> He ranks a 0.1 / 10 of ... <br /> the Demon :.
