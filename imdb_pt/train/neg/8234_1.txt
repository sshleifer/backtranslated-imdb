The writers and producers of this little excursion have plunged new depths of depravity. The writer's block was so wrong that the ideas had dried up so much that they were forced to include a disgusting scene in which a young woman defecates in the back of a van and then immediately throws the excrement into the car (mind you at least that sums up what this movie is worth it). We had already been treated with one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once would have been enough ... we got the message! This really is taking bathroom humor to another level! If the script and acting had been better, I could easily forget that I was watching a movie shot entirely on low-budget video. This was a rather original storyline, with a clever (the only) bit of direction where we could only take the vantage point from inside the van; making it look much more real. We never got to see inside any other places such as the shop or the field where several women disappeared, and this could have added much needed tension. <br /> <br /> The script was terrible. Lines like: "I do not feel very well ... I want to go home" after one of the girls was chased by a psychopath; subject to rape by a screwdriver and shot, looks a bit undercooked. <br /> <br /> The acting was diabolical (besides the maniac). Did all 5 leading actresses learn this by performing a correspondence course during a long postal strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the whole movie with the subtitles. The director seemed to have an easy job on it. It seems the only direction he should have given was: 'Scream girls'. <br /> <br /> AND TO SHOUT ...... If you watch, please make sure you have some acetaminophen ready!
