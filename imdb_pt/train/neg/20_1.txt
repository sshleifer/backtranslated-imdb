This movie was terrible. At first I read the plot summary and it looked OK, so I watched it. The acting was TERRIBLE. It was as if the actor was almost timid with the camera. everything seemed false. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .. I watched it at least 20 times .... <br /> <br /> The plot was crap too. the screenwriters were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you watch just to see how much worse it can get, so that later you can tell other people how you can not believe how horrible the movie was. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should watch this. , then we could better appreciate other REAL movies.
