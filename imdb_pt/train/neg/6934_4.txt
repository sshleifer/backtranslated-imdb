Okay, so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955. I pity the fools who still think so ... Their absolute rubbish. <br /> <br /> The story is fair. .. ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this movie is not intended to satirize, I'm sure it's a serious drama, is not it? <br /> <br /> Dean and others are too old for their parts. People say Dean is great in this movie, and well, maybe he did his part as well as he could. Your character is to be 16 or 17 or more. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he made this movie. Watching him dying and throwing little tantrums like a 4-year-old boy ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is beautiful, but the first scenes at the police station where she's crying and whining are very unconvincing. This sets a bad precedent for the movie ... and for the rest, you feel like shrinking every time one of those misunderstood emotional scenes pops up. <br /> <br /> It may have been good for the movie. But, in fact, it's just a suspense. <br /> <br /> It must have been just an exaggeration over Dean's death that inflated the reputation of this film too much.
