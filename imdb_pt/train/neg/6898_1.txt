Avoid this crap at all costs. Bad script, bad directing, bad acting, poor editing, bad sound and bad music. Get the idea? This movie tries to be Western-flavored, is not it. He tries to be tough on the violent core, is not he. He tries to present a new look to an old genre, it does not. The actors try harder and my heart stays with them. But with this cute material to work with, it's hard to make something sparkle. To me, this has all the appearance of a "first attempt to get out of film school that will set the world on fire." Fledgling filmmakers often bite more than they, or their budget, can chew. The best thing they can do is take a few steps back, reassess what is possible and work within your limited budget next time.
