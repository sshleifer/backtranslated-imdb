<br /> <br /> There's a parallel universe out there where Gone In 60 Seconds is a dark, edgy, controversial independent film. Unfortunately in this dimension Gone ... is a flashy, empty flash filled with testosterone, starring Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons that are not really worth entering, he and his large number of comparsas have four days to steal fifty expensive cars, of which only one has an alarm. This crew is composed by the guy with funny-shaped ears who claim to be the new Superman; a guy who drove electricity in X-Files; a former professional football player and two black men. <br /> <br /> His enemies are cops, rival car thieves and Cracker Bilborough, his Manchester accent appropriately flattened and enlarged for the American public who is now accustomed to this sort of thing since Daphne in Frasier. There is also Angelina Jolie, who does not receive any character; save to be a receptacle to the sexual desires of men. She and Cage are supposed to be old, which is strange, since they never approach a normal conversation in all 135 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> In fact, the characterization is so bad that always anyone has a "moment" in which a violin touches the background to accentuate the "emotion". It is not a spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones (who recreates his famous "hand ball" maneuver of Paul Gasgoine and is quite menacing when in silence) only receives a line; not because his inability to speak is an integral part of the plot, but because his eloquent summary of the dubious morality of the film after appearing dumb all the time is funny. Allegedly. After he struggles in his "not-much-act-but-will-do" London accent, Cage jokes, "I always thought you were from Long Island." My ribs, as you can imagine, were well and truly pleased. <br /> <br /> In fact, humor is the least developed aspect, from the untrained comedy cop until the two black characters. This means that the greatest aspect of Hollywood takes over; Why can not a black man appear in a big movie without constantly being aware of his skin tone and referring to it incessantly? The younger man, who, like his eldest, talks for the whole duration, proclaims: "We Negroes do not like the cold ... we are tropical people." He then goes on to express a desire to smoke a joint and watch Roots. He is, of course, parodying the image of blacks, but how funny is that? Its older counterpart can not speak without referring to itself and thus its color, in the third person. "My black ass" that, "my black ass" that. Does anybody know some nigger who talks like that? I thought not. The movie's soundtrack is played almost non-stop and with increasing volume, some of the tracks - especially Apollo 440's "Do not Stop The Rock" - are so loud that they are actually more audible. than sound effects and dialogue. The surround sound system separates the two to a level that makes them sound like two different movies working together. No concept of background music here, is the aural equivalent of trying to watch a movie while someone in the back of the movie has their sound banged. "Keep the music down, young man!" <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie in the world and in many ways I liked it. It's just that it's predictable, lazy and bland, with the least effort in its construction. Apparently, box office expectations are pretty low for this movie. After being forced to eat junk for several years, it seems that the general public is beginning to wake up to the fact.
