Do you know how sometimes you can watch a low quality movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well, that was beyond that. I bought the DVD on Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard this was a movie you could laugh at. It's really nothing short of pathetic. About 30 minutes after the movie, my friends started asking me to turn it off. About 45 minutes they begged me. After an hour, we committed ourselves to move to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and why we were watching Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, do not watch this movie. It is beyond painful.
