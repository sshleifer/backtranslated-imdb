Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a small series of cartoons with lots of fun (but repeated and exaggerated) jokes from Bush. Apparently I should have lowered my expectations even more. <br /> <br /> The writing was absolutely pathetic. Beyond the joke of Eating Chicken Cheney, and a few pranks, it was really boring and bland. <br /> <br /> The animation was as sophisticated as the 13-year-old Flash Project. It's a disgrace that they used Macromedia's product for this because it is capable of so much more. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush so much, and I like both a Bush joke and the next one, but this was just a half-hour blow to the President with several painfully unfunny moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did a lot more with That's My Bush. Do yourself a favor, skip "Lil 'Bush" and buy a copy of the short comedy "That's My Bush." You will thank me.
