Some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen, and I understand where they come from, but I've actually seen worse. That said, the movies I can remember (that is, the ones I did not block) that were worse than that, were so bad that they physically hurt all the senses that were involved in watching the movie. Movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to pluck your eyes, or stab sharp objects in your ears to prevent another piece of your soul from being ripped from you in horror. <Br />> War Games: The Dead Code is not that bad, but it comes pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but no, I did not expect miracles from this. Let's face the fact that the original was not really as good as a movie in the first place, it was basically just an 80-year-old teen romance movie with some geek appeal. <br /> <br /> That's all I expected for, something bad, but this could have pulled my geeks ropes. Was that asking too much? Is not it really possible to do better than the original War Games, even for a direct launch to the video? Well, apparently, that was asking too much. Stay away from this movie. At first it's bad, like "Oh yeah, that's bad, but I'm enjoying it, maybe the ending is good as in the original." And then everything gets worse and worse, and in the end, trust me, you'll wish you had not seen this movie.
