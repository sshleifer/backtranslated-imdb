An extravagant, compellingly horrible (and NOT in a funny way) C-series movie. Everything screams "amateur" from the crumby script (bizarre premises, limited coherence and predictable endings, bloated lighting, swaying camera angles and sound; the timid and unrelated sexual pass and references, the unequal and unbelievable dialgoue to the Z I saw on DVD and kept waiting for Edward Wood to appear All is forgiven - his Worst Movies are works of art, and more coherent than this buzz. But still, preferable to warbling 'Every night in my dreams I hear you' - are you sure that the crew of the Titanic was not involved in this on the side?
