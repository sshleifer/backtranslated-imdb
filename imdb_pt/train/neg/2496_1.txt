I would list this movie under the horror movie genre. I did this because I'm not aware of a genre called horrible. Since the horror genre comes the closest to horrible, I decided to put it in this category. The performance was amateur. You know who the villains would be in the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. Film students should take this movie as an example for class, not what to do in a movie. It's so bad. Man the bad word is a euphemism. The villains kidnap a transatlantic and want $ 10 million. They want the money to be delivered on a Rose Island inhabited in the middle of the Pacific. They would be sitting like ducks after they received the money. There is no escape plan. What an ass. The Female Cruise Director is a former police officer, Navy Seal, kung fu I'm scared. The hilarious part is the way you turn off the time bomb. He says he knows what he's doing and continues pulling all the wires one by one. He then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place. Is he crazy? How crazy we who watched this RIDICULOUS. If you have an M-i-L of whom you do not like. To bore you rent this movie and pretend you like it. I assure you that she will definitely tell her spouse that you have so much bad taste and that your son / daughter has married someone below the family standard.
