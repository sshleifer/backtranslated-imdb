There were some funny movies about spirits coming out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in "The Bishop's Wife" (1947). Of course the best were the Topper movies in the late 1930s and early 1940s. And more recently Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), which was a remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" , from 1941. These were well-written, funny and entertaining comedies, all centered on supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now comes the scriptwriter and director Jeff Lowell, making his film debut with an unlikely story. A malicious young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who is killed on her wedding day and then returns to harass young spiritualist Ashley (Lake Bell) who is in love with Kate's fiance Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing is clear at the beginning: Longoria Parker is not Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two films of "Topper"), which is the standard against which all female ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> A line early on, when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) tells Henry, "You do not smile." This described my situation throughout this film. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that the script is not very funny. But it got worse with the presence of Longoria Parker, who only disturbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen. Just to begin with, combining her lack of comedic talent, she's covered with so much pancake makeup, who knows how she really looks? Kate is dead as she prepares for her wedding by a frozen statue falling. She is so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about her life after death abandons her (well, she actually just disappears), so Kate sees herself back to Earth like a ghost without knowing what her mission is. Chloe wants Henry to take off the funk to which he came down naturally after Kate's death (from what I saw of Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief), then she introduces him to Ashley, who does not really do it. I do not know what she's doing as a spiritualist (she's also a cateress to make ends meet), to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate. There are a lot of knits that happen. <br /> <br /> The emptiness of the film is summed up by a "B" story that revolves around Ashley's assistant Dan (Jason Biggs). This is played near the end, but the way Ashley handles it indicates she's as dumb as Kate. Since Dan is apparently attracted to these two severely flawed women, he deserves whatever he has. <br /> <br /> Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun must begin. No, and it's more pity because in other hands that might have been pretty funny. As it is, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co. must be rummaging around in their graves to see that this is what their brilliance in the first two Topper films produced.
