Not that I wrap myself in joy with the vision of realistic blood, but when I put a DVD waiting for a bloodbath, and what I see is a bloody scene (the eyeball) at the tip of false asinine tapa, and turning a chair, I ended up thinking "well, it's 43 minutes of my life lost forever". I would not consider this or "movies" as much as an exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. Flower of Flesh and Blood had some tough spots to watch. The devil's experiment does not. It was at best stupid, and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Maybe my expectation was too high. I put the DVD thinking "oh man, this is going to get sick". After watching them pretend to hit the girl a thousand times, I was watching this quickly. <br /> <br /> Two types of people would be interested in this movie. 1) People looking for science fiction movies just to see what it really is like, or 2) more complete horror. I searched for this and the other guinea pig movies for the last reason, but even if I fell into the first category, this movie would not float on my boat. In fact, I could imagine this movie increasing blood lust ... as in "YOU WOULD KILL B * TCH ALREADY !!" So in conclusion, the only reason to own this movie is for collection purposes. If you want a carnage that traditional terror does not offer, get the Traits of Death. Of course, that sucks too, but at least you'll have the blood and courage you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they should. No artistic merit that I can understand, no reason for this is notoriety, nothing. Just a weak attempt to be shocking.
