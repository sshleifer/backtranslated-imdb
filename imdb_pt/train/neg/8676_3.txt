Avoid the US version. It's with more filming in the US and the worst voiceover you've ever heard, probably made by amateurs from New York. The dubbing is so bad it sounds like the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black guy from the Bronx makes Chiba's voice. I could not watch the whole movie was so bad. Instead of this Americanized version, see other big names of Chiba, like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
