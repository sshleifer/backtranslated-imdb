Stupid boys, sexy women, a lot of profanity, and an unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake. You'd think "Monster" would be fun ... but it's not really. He starred Tony Eisley and John Carradine, however, and in my book it's worth seeing at least once. In an interview with Fangoria in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed most of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who only directed the filming with his sons Andrea and Glenn (playing characters named Andrea and Glenn in a particularly inventive turn) - received full credit. Considering how horrible the end result was, Strock was probably glad he was not credited! "Monster" has the look of a TV movie from the mid-'70s, and that's why I like to let it down from time to time. As entertainment, it falls flat on the floor, but as a reminder of another era and a type of missing film, it is very effective. The only thing missing is a car chase.
