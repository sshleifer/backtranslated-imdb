I hate even wasting the time it takes to write 10 lines about this atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is lucky that poor film production is not a capital crime or he would face death twice for writing and directing this disaster. I'm surprised that this movie has a budget of $ 75 million, but fortunately in the sense that it was a tremendous failure, that Shim hopefully will never make another movie for the rest of his life and therefore will not lose any movie. more of the time of the spectators. I think the actors would have joined and lynched him now. <br /> <br /> With the effects features available to them, a great movie could have been made with this budget. As usual, failure should have been discovered at the beginning with the terrible script and story. "Transformers" was another visual feast with a weak script, but that makes it look like "Citizen Kane."
