Much like Orson Welles thirty years earlier, Mike Sarne received the world's largest train to play with but unfortunately he did not have the ability to do anything other than watch his train become a train wreck that is still spoken with shock and a strange kind of admiration. In spite of the postmodern interpretations that somehow intend to see it as a gay or even feminist tract, the fact is that it was a great disaster in 1970 and is still one today. How could anyone who has the resources at Sarne's disposal have spoiled everything? So richly remains a well-kept secret. Only Michael Cimino came close with the political and artistic Armageddon that constitutes "Heaven's Gate". Both films seemed to be ego trips to their respective directors, but at least Cimino had made one of the big hits. films of the 1970s before squandering the generosity of the studio while Mr. Sarne had just the fairy "Joanna" in his closet. In addition, "Heaven's Gate" could boast some memorable and well-managed scenarios where, tragically, the "Myra Breckinridge" closet was empty. Simply put, it's overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds Hollywood's history.
