Model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) of his sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is brought to trial, but is totally free. He then rapes Kathy! <br /> <br /> Convicted and sickly rape film. This film was announced as an important drama that deals with rape. What is a poorly written and (most of the time) misunderstood drama. He intends to be in solidarity with the rape victim, but he pushes the scene in our face. To be totally honest, however, Hemingway's acting is so bad in this sequence that it loses any real impact it may have had. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the film went too far when Mariel, 15, is raped (fortunately, that was not shown). I admit that this led to a great ending when Margaux took a gun and killed Sarandon. But seriously - having a young girl raped is simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> The acting does not help. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She certainly was a beautiful woman (and a real model, I believe), but her acting left a lot to be desired. That slows down the movie. Mariel was just OK, but this was one of his first films. Sarandon does what he can as the rapist. He was not bad, but the terrible script worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing that at a screening of this in 1976 some women stood up and applauded when Sarandon was killed, so maybe this works for some people. I found it boring, simplistic and really sick. A 1 all the way.
