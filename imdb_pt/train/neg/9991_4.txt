First, I'm not here for this movie. I find this totally enjoyable despite the poor quality of the production. The acting here is as abominable as the monster chasing them, although the monster itself is well done ... impressively well done. He really looks kind of out of this world, like an alien vacation family landed in the Himalayas and while Dad was taking off ... At the call of nature, Spot broke loose and they just did not have time to hunt him down. That, or he's the Wishmaster's Caucasian brother. I did not decide which one. <br /> <br /> In fact, this seems to have been filmed somewhere in the snow country, yes, but Canada is more likely to be somewhere than anywhere in China. The trees and the panoramas tell Canada to me, and it's okay that the defined area never has the look or feel of cold you'd expect to find in the Himalayas of China. It's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of location. <br /> <br /> Moreover, apparently (as we have just established), science fiction directors do not travel often, as they are not aware that commercial airplanes fly above time like the one presented here and the would not have happened. But like I said, it's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we must forgive some things. <br /> <br /> The film is very graphic at times, and alternates between "Alive" about the Donner Party, "Predator". about the alien in the forest, and any bad wushu movie in which they fly in wires. The Yeti apparently can jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember? "Run faster! Jump higher! Live more!" <br /> <br /> In addition, the Yeti lost his teddy bear. He searched high and low for this, but he can not make a corpse work. Poor Yeti! You can not help feeling sorry for that. He survived and evolved thousands of years just to succumb to the serious loss of teddy bears. He missed his bear. Or maybe you want to mate, but that thought is banned! Do you hear me? Well, it seems to be an unmixed male. RESTORED! <br /> <br /> And it's superhuman. Well, it's not human ... it's super-Yeti! But again, what is normal-Yeti? I do not know, but he has a definite quality of Michael Meyers that is completely unsettling. And he has this fabulous way of cleaning his skin. FABULOUS Dahlink! It is impeccably white sometimes when it should not be. He is fastidiously superhu -... super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> In all? This was a lot of fun to watch, it has great killings and some honest plot elements. Despite the horribly gravel-like production style, this is actually a lot of fun. I can not help thinking if they are planning another one? <br /> <br /> The rate is 6.0 / 10 on the M4TV scale. <br /> <br /> The rate is 4.4 / 10 on the Film Scale of ... <br /> <br /> Devil:
