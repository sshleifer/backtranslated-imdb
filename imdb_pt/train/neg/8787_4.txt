I first heard about White Noise when I saw the TV ad. Before that, I did not even know it existed. I watched the trailer online and decided that I would see it. Now being a fan of films like The Sixth Sense, I thought this movie would give me everything I wanted. There's Michael Keaton, and he rocks. Unfortunately, the movie was not delivered. He tried to be another sixth sense or shake the echoes, and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the medium only risks repeating itself and ends with a completely bad turnaround that any monkey could have discovered. Unfortunately, like most "Scary" movies these days, it relies on loud noises and bangs to make the audience jump. This movie could have been so much more. Too bad it was a good idea.
