This film did not have something I could not put my finger on at first: the charisma on the part of the lead actress. This inevitably resulted in lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leader. Even the romantic scenes came as being merely the actors at stake. It could well have been the director who misjudged what he needed from the actors. I just do not know. <br /> <br /> But could it have been the script? Exactly who was the passionate chef? He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits, than of anyone or anything else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this movie. But, do not forget that you were nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
