This is the worst crap imaginable. H. Rider Haggard's novel is very entertaining and dramatic. The creators of this worthless film do not follow it closely. Well, old novels are not sacred and making free versions of them is good for me if we have our own ideas. If all you can do is change things and replace them with uninteresting and diluted cliches, you should keep the original. Had they done so, this movie would have been at least twice as good, even with worse actors and filmed inside a studio with huts made of cardboard. But there is no imagination, only tiredness. This should be bought or watched only by collectors of Victorian novels made in films. <br /> <br /> Just a tip, not a spoiler, I think, to make those of you who read the novel understand what happened. and what you can expect if you decide to watch it on TV or - God forbid - spend money buying it. Gagool an old evil witch in the book and a forerunner of Gollum has been transformed into a cool girl!
