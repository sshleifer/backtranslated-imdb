I gave this show (I only watched seven episodes) four stars because most of their jokes / set-ups seem to fail. Some are not funny, but some are fun - in a 12-year-old boy. It reminds me of the New York painter who throws paint on a canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws away what she has, including the kitchen sink, while she prays for some things to stick to the wall in her effort to be funny, but different. <br /> <br /> However, what she "catches" often is not enough, as if she did not have the kind of accompaniment a good comedian needs to succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole company is like a sloppy potato.
