How did it come into being? I usually love sci F / Bigfoot any movie etc. . but I still hope they are written without as much cheese as that. The effects were sad, the lines were sadder. Avoid at all costs. I just ended up renting because I was in the wrong case (I was looking for the Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson - I have not seen that yet). The idea of ​​the movie is really good. There was a lot of potential to make a great movie here. I just do not understand how something like that ends like this. Go talk to students interested in film / arts / English at any school and you'll find people who can write a better script.
