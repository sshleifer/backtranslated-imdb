OK, as everyone has pointed out, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this is because it was a bloody film of sexploitation that had a lot of material excised (or darkened to almost invisible) to escape the X-rating of the censor; but the film has many other flaws as well. To begin with, the screenwriter seems to have mixed up his werewolves and vampires. The villains in this movie are hairy and do not like silver, but in all other respects they behave like vampires. Now you can not do it with a fucking movie, you have to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get confused and angry with the suspension of disbelief at the wrong thing. In fact, the whole plot (confused and poorly presented) is something that has already been done for vampires, but it does not make any sense in a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the werewolf costumes are the most terrible ever seen. Anyone in the werewolves movie industry should know that werewolf costumes and transformations are something that fans value critically, but some of these werewolves are simply joys. <br /> <br /> There are some rather good parts. I really enjoyed the score. Others mentioned Sybil Danning's breasts. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER, if that can exist) <br /> <br /> I also really liked the plan to attack the fortress of the werewolves. There are so many horror movies that are based on characters who behave stupidly, but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and kill the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have some very powerful firearms nowadays. Should not be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? But in typical style, this movie is overdone and adds some other very funny and funny anti-lycanthropes.
