The muscular ape-man in the jungles of Africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team; the graceful daughter of the team leader meets him first. A very crazy version of Tarzan's tale has an OK production, but it is hampered by the worst direction of a movie I've ever seen. John Derek is devoid of inspiration beyond slow-motion action scenes and glimmers of spasms of his naked wife Bo Derek; he has as much talent behind the cameras as Ed Wood. Attempting sexuality with irony, the Dereks lack subtlety, agile timing, and good taste. They have a sense of self-parody and bravery of abandonment (they play caution to the winds), but after a promising opening everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who may have had balls in his mouth all the time) plays the lead role, but plays a minor role in John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's sense of importance. * in ****
