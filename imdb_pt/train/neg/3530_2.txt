When Ritchie first appeared on the film scene, his films were considered funny, witty, well directed and original. If one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal disgust that his last two releases had created, one must consider - Ritchie was discovered? Is he really that talented? Does he really have any genuine original ideas? Or is he simply a pretentious and selfish director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone, all in a colossal and disorganized pile? After watching Revolver, can you apologize for thinking that everything went wrong? What happened to your great sense of humor? Where did he get all those mixed and complicated ideas? Revolver tries to be intelligent, philosophical and succinct, tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. Ritchie makes a gigantic effort to fulfill all these goals and invests large parts of a script in existential reflections and countless twists and turns. However, in the end, all that serves is to build a severely disjointed, unstructured, and ultimately hostile to the public. His plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although Ritchie at least tries to give his own spin, he should be punished for even trying to get through it as his own work. So what the audience gets is a terrible script, interwoven with many pretentious designers and awkward pieces. <br /> <br /> Revolver is a bland and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like Fight Club, Usual Suspects and Pulp. Fiction. He aims high, but inevitably shoots blank shots. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves to be criticized, is a really poor film masquerading as an aspiring masterpiece of an aspiring author. However, he falls prey to his farce and simply fails at everything he wants to be and achieve.
