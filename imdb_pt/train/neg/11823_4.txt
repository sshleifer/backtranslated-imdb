TOM BROWN SCHOOLS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> At the end of the 19th century in England, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the public school in Rugby, where he undergoes the reforms of a new radical director (Stephen Fry) and faces the resident bully of the school, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). <br /> <br /> It is already the subject of countless screen adaptations - most notably the 1951 Gordon Parry top version - Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel receives early 21st century treatment courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV " Where the Heart Is ") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It is pleasant enough, and watchable, but it is also quite sober and monotonous, distinguished only by Fry's sincere performance as the new director determined to sweep some of the school's most dubious "traditions," and the introduction of a possible new star in 14 Pettyfer years old, a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and good looks that should take you all the way to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is the UK's typically televised raw material, the kind of stuff most executives are eager to fill in with "prestige" products, even if they are not as notable as that. The British publication 'Radio Times' described it as 'delicately strange' and raised a disconcerting eyebrow about 'all that vulgarity and brutality and a beautiful and rude villain who tortured the lives of young sweethearts.' Enough.
