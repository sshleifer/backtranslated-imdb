Actress Patty Duke has written an insightful, funny, and rude book about her acting career, her love life, and her depressive manic episodes and suicide attempts that have almost driven her away forever. With this rich material to draw (and Patty playing in the final act), one would think that a TV director like Gilbert Cates could bring it all together in the film, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of Duke's autobiography. . For those who have not read the book, the outlined narrative (advancing in time) is not absorbing, we are never allowed to orient ourselves with what is happening, and production seems atrophied by a low budget. The actors are wrong, and the value of having Duke herself finally showing up is not worth it - the false reality of the film is so thick that Patty can not bring stability to the stage. It seems the producers were sincere enough (and conscious) to eagerly orient the film toward Duke's final diagnosis and mental freedom, but left out many dramatic opportunities in the process.
