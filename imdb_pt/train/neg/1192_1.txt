I completely agree with jamrom4 .. this was the only most horrible movie I have ever seen .. holy crap was terrible .. I was warned not to see it .. and foolishly I watched it anyway .. about 10 minutes to the painful experience I completely gave up seeing the atrocity .. but sat down to the end .. just to see if I could .. well I did and now I wish I had .. it was disgusting .. nothing happened and the end was all pregam .. in the bad movie has the right to survive .. I beg you all to spare yourself the terror of greasy drives of the bus .. if I had heard the same warning .. please save yourself of this film .. I have a feeling that those who rated him highly were involved in the production of the film ... and all should be erased from the face of the planet.
