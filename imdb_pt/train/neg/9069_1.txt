The (David H. Steinberg) script initially seemed to have some clever spots that could have made a good romantic comedy, BUT BUT, oh dear! What happened on the way ??? ! <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what happened. Originally it is (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). Although this has been a long time, but these are the pioneers, the godfathers of the new genre: the raw teen comedy. Then the 90's came. After important instances that became great successes (repulsive I add) like (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996), and (There Something With Mary - 1998) that I think which slackers is affected by, there was the top of the era and the next-era prophet, the first and only: (American Pie - 1999) who is undoubtedly and incomparably a gender icon. After that, I think every comedy of this type has to be so filthy, cum laude unpleasant, to be admired by the youth, otherwise it may be out of fashion! <br /> <br /> I believe that (Slackers) had a first as a script, so its creators were able to add a very large amount of: rudeness, filth, strangely shameless sex to be made - in those days - as easy as pie! As they had to fill all the scenes with free elements such as: masturbation, oral sex, urination .. etc just to look at the 'mode. They are totally unnecessary elements to the story, but they are certainly so necessary to make a profit, and to catch the latest fad in making teen comedies. The problem is how all this has replaced any possible comedy. <br /> <br /> Some of his moments seemed literally horrible and, as you see, is the point. It's all about the looks and performance of (Jason Schwartzman); memorably disgusting to the max. Then ambition turned from being that romantic comedy into doing what was not done before pure skin images. To be more like a horror where you're asking all the time; What more nasty would happen? (vomiting, farting, etc.); these are the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadays. <br /> <br /> Although, even if you hated it, you have to love something (especially for being daring), for me it was just the Gina Gershon scene. Either way, they designed it as a whole to be outrageous by outrageous, like the perverse dream of a teenager. Although most were close to anyone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> What made me sad was that this at its core was a real potential job, not another cheap, another stupid comedy that eventually got to be. Remember well the details of stealing the exam (the first 2 minutes) then the main plot of the movie (weird trying to get a girl blackmailing cool guys) through the pattern of (girl loves girl and girl loves girl) because to save this, it's nothing more than a slock candidly. He dealt with the material in the tacky way of dirty college kids, who had nothing to do but make grumpy jokes about anything. It turned out to be, and I'm sorry to say that, a fucking smile! <br /> <br /> In the end he said something (you can imagine!) about how is the time and place also for the impostor or the slack to win, totally like this comedy itself. It seems good finale yet for another better movie; which could guarantee my opinion on this as a clever .. Once! And it does not take much to understand that the producers of this movie were the real lazy! Maybe being stupid is a way of being smart in Hollywood, but even if ... The end result here was not at least witty by any sense of the word. PS: Your screenwriter (David H. Steinberg), who wrote the story of (American Pie 2) also has a main page in IMDb, where you will find under the heading "Additional Details" your usual "Plot keywords", which are: Sex / vulgarity / Gross humor / ... They just forgot to write urine while showering or discovering women in their 70s!
