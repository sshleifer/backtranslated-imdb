What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant director, a trail blazer ... is now scraping the bottom ... Is this the same man who directed "The Last Picture Show"? Here he takes a rather interesting (though unlikely) premise, and turns it into chewing gum that loses its flavor the moment you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is mischievously like Chaplin, and everyone else actors seem to have been chosen for their "looks", not because they were right for the role. What a pity. I'm renting "Paper Moon" again.
