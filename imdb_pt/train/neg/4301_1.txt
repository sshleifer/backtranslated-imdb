I was staying one night and got extremely bored around 2:00 in the morning, so I turned aimlessly through the canals and found H.B.O. where this "classic" was playing. Initially I was glad I got something at first, but my happiness disappeared about two minutes into the movie. The whole movie revolved around an unattractive man who was afraid of women, four beautiful but empty-minded women who worked as waitresses in his uncle's restaurant, and his extremely fat and extremely unhappy cousin who also works at the diner. There are some weird twists in this movie that make it interesting, but it's certainly not worth watching. Basically, if you have nothing to do some night or just can not sleep, the medication works much better. However, guys have a lot of skin so it can be nice to watch without sound, but even this can get annoying
