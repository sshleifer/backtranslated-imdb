There are plenty of comments already posted telling exactly how I felt about this movie so I'll keep it short. <br /> <br /> "The Grinch" I thought it was wonderful - Jim Carrey is a truly talented physical comedian as well as being a versatile intelligent actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers, on the other hand, gets his laughs by being annoying. I really liked him on his "Waynes World" days and "So I Married an Ax Murderer" - but I never liked Austin Powers and "Cat In The Hat" just ran out of me. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible - the jokes were horrible! unsuitable for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated that they did not amuse anyone for 50 years! The plot was confused, confused, confused! It's a shame really because the kids were very friendly as was "Mom". They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have achieved it if it were not for Myers's ugly, outrageous depiction of Cat's exaggeration. <br /> <br /> I mean - will the Myers even look at a script? Was it a writing? The other actors seemed to have one - but the cat seemed to be steep! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would like to mention that the sets and accessories were wonderful !!! But unfortunately they can not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr Seuss - the man was a genius! Do not ruin your reputation by adapting your work in such a lazy and confusing way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
