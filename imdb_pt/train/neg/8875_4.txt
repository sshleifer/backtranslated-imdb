If this is someone's "favorite" movie, they need serious help. There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. I have not seen the original movie, this is the remake of (some 1950s movies), but it simply has to be better than this new bastardization. <br /> <br /> A major is expelled from the army for being a fringe element, and ends up teaching children at a ROTC school. Unfortunately, the major is Daman Wayans ... so the kids are in a world of irritating asinine, without humor. Can the Wayans whip those losers? Do they get him to become a little more human? The film bombs like most Wayans movies, with only a few brilliant moments. William Hickey gets about a minute of screen time, very little. This charming old man (known as an actor from "Tales from the Crypt," known as Uncle Louis's "Christmas Vacation") shines every moment that he is on screen, which is not much here. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a motorcyclist, which fits him perfectly. I would not mind a bit more of Bam Bam, but I think he took the role of "biker" as far as it could be taken to a military movie. <br /> <br /> And then there's the attractive teacher, that somebody falls in love with Major Payne, although he treats children badly, has no social skills and it's simply impossible to become someone you'd like to spend more time with . She must be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure which one (though it sounds "stupid" since the movie makes it clear that she leaves home quite often). Wayans had a brilliant moment: a dance sequence where he presents himself. a series of moves (including a very good "robot"), and with the help of 2 Live Crew's music. This scene was fun, but it was hardly made for anything else that made this movie spit. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to see a movie about a loser who helps losing kids become heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he's a kind and really funny loser. Maybe if Major Payne had fought with a badger, I'd feel better, but he would not. Forget Payne, forget Wayans ... you can do so much better.
