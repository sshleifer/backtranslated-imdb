Welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. This horror tale meets a newly married husband (John Hudson) and wife (Peggy Weber) haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout his empty mansion and pond of lilies. Is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious fiancee mad? Or is it gardener Mickey (Alex Nicol) who has learned to deal with the mansion since the death of the original owner of the house? This low budget movie has a plot that keeps you involved until the end. The special effects are pretty bad, even by the 1958 standards. I swear at times that the screaming skull looks a lot like a Godzilla movie. Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the gardener on the prowl (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can take this as part of AMC's Monsterfest.
