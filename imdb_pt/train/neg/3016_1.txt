I'm, like many, a fan of Tony Scott's movies. When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like 'Man On Fire'. To find out that the movie is the furthest away from it! The story was relying on water from the start, and Mickey Rourke's choice was not a good idea. And the whole 'arm'scene' was very free! <br /> <br /> The film is centered around Kiera Kinghtly, and this movie reveals that she will never become a movie star! The film has brought some of the worst performances ever. <br /> <br /> I like the direction of Tony Scott, but it takes all the cake! Sorry Ton, 1 of 10!
