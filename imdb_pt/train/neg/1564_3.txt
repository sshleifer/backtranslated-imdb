... was so that I could, in good conscience, tell everyone how horrible this movie is. I barely managed to spend 20 minutes before I started thinking to myself, "Wow, this is too bad." And to be honest, I would have given this movie 1 star if it was not for Esai Morales (although he had very little time on the screen). He is the only well-represented role in the movie, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought so. As I watched, I began to think about her role in "Shawshank Redemption" and realized it was not as good as I thought it was. Problem: your prison / tough act seems to be just that, an act; his dialogue sounded as if he was making a very bad impression. Has he met someone who talks how his character was supposed to be? I doubt it, but maybe he should have. <br /> <br /> And to make things worse, they managed to inject a philosophy of the little chain and make it look nothing less than artificial, especially when one considers that the rhetoric was being provoked by a "rasta" whose accent it was so strong that it seemed unnatural. <br /> <br /> I would not normally hit a movie like that, but when I saw the movie it had favorable review. I felt like I had been cheated and lied to, and I thought I should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
