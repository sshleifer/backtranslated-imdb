It should not be a shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a low quality movie. To be frank, it's as if a monster of manure would defecate, eat the result, and vomit. The final product would still overshadow this film. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on an old (!) Atari video game, the movie has something to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons and ancient civilizations. Something about having two worlds, the one of the darkness and the one of the light. (Guess which one is ours). Oh, and 10,000 years ago, an advanced civilization actually super-duper opened the portal, demons approached and exploded, then exterminated civilization. That is why we have never heard of them properly. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater, perhaps yearning for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher for whom Something Bad happened. when he was 10 years old. It is in the wake of one of the artifacts of advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to find out what happened to that ancient civilization. But Carnby believed that he would not be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group. But behold, these beasts are out, and they take their prey in various ways, such as destroying them, dividing them in the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into murderous zombies. Yeah, it's another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> This is so distilled that I can make the plot. It is very complicated and incomprehensible. In similar movies, one can see the intrepid researcher / adventurer imagining things one step at a time, and when the audience is mentally with the researcher, it's a lot of fun. But when the scenes change from attack to attack without perspective or context ... not much fun. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, with the exception of Slater, who (although almost sound ashamed of being in the movie) showed that he was able to carry the load of acting. He had to; get this - Tara Reid is climbing as curator of the museum! Honestly kind, I thought I'd seen the cast of a life when Denise Richards was rocket-propelled into nuclear physics in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here combines with Richards, you crap crap. Hightlights include Reid pronouncing "Newfoundland" as "New Fownd Land," Reid delivering most of his speeches in an obnoxious, guttural monotone (kind of like she'd been in a night last week before filming), Reid - a museum curator , remember you - spend a lot of the film in a high-necked blouse and low-waist jeans. Oh yes, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes. Oh, why should the handsome be so stupid? (Note: I do not think Tara Reid is that good looking. She seems to be always in need of food.) Almost everyone in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps by Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders. of 713. The character of Dorff was not very well developed, but nothing in the film was, from the sets to the personages of Tara Reid. But I digress. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the bewildering and totally absurd plot is hard enough to keep up with the movie moving at such a fast pace, but director Uwe Boll shoots a deafening soundtrack; is so loud that you can not hear what the actors are saying in some scenes! That can not be right. Given the level of performance, however, perhaps the thanks go to Mr. Boll. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a fun note. The opening moments of the film include narration ... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard this familiar Star Wars theme as the prologue dragged on. Certainly there was no need for narration; Why do I need some idiots to read what's on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking for blind people? Perhaps this also explains why the soundtrack was so noisy - they were also looking for people with hearing impairments. In addition, the narrator inexplicably had a hunch in the first few lines of the trail - and then lost it. Bizarre. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark is a noisy and doped mix of terrible acting, an incoherent script, and awkward directing. Hardly a note sounds true. There is so much chaos that the public simply gives up worrying about the characters and the roots of their death. Even in the dark, demonic creatures seem cooler and far more developed in comparison. <br /> <br /> Ironically, as there were only three other people in the theater, I watched Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I can not give the lowest rating because I had little hope of getting started - and because it never appealed to me enough for me to get involved with it. It's atrocious, though Slater is redrawing a little.
