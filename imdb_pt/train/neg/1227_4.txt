Even though many people here commend this movie, I have to warn you. It has no logic whatsoever. I think Basinger does a decent job at acting, but you can not do a thriller if there is a great lack of realism. <br /> <br /> This scene paints a good picture for you of the film: while Basinger She is chased by murderous thugs and decides to sit down and contemplate a photo that she finds in her pocket. The photo is from your daughter and reads "we love you mama". Who does something like that? What the eff? And believe me when I say you're not as dumb as some other scenes in the movie. Someone said that this is a "hidden gem". Well, I have to disagree strongly, this movie was hidden for a reason. And it's not a gem. Oh, and please, I do not even want to start commenting on the red toolbox. It hurts my brain: D Usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small quantities, but this film is basically only possible because of the lack of logic. But, I still give a 4 because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic, it has a certain humor that kept me watching until the end. <br /> <br /> So if you choose to watch this, you know you have been warned.
