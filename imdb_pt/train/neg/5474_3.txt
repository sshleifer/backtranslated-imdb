To be fair, they did the best they could with a budget of five shillings and six pence, but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9 pounds of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat now. maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly carved in granite, it would have made the film a little better too. To say that this was horrible is to make this movie a bad-service, if you want to see something that is totally execrable, you have to sit down and waste a couple of hours of your life watching 'sickle', this is soo mind- It's really good, (several great alcoholic drinks are deriguer though.) Any road, I liked this movie and have to take a look if you have not seen it, just do not expect anything like the 'jurassic park, the lost world' or 'apocalypto'.
