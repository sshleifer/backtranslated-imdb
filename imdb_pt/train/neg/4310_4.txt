This movie is about a star of the very sexy Olympic track that is contracted to train a basketball team for high school boys. Similar to Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, she stars Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and she does as much as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice, but given the film's apparent budget for TV, they probably could not afford it. Cathy Lee looks great in every scene, but we never see her completely naked. The story is pretty predictable, to say the least, offering no surprises. A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the male lead role. He is the star of the team and also the love interest of Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some fun scenes like the rich old man who runs the sports program and does not think a woman should train sports. This point is raised throughout the film and, needless to say, is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not put her team into practice sessions unorthodox; she does not do anything that a male coach would not do. There is a funny subplot involving a tall, not-so-bright player who undergoes hypnosis to pass his classes and play as professional basketball player Sydney Wicks. It seems everyone had fun making this movie, but the only real reason to see this is for Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not such a good actress, but she has a gorgeous smile, beautiful hair and a very tanned body.
