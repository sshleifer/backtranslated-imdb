I'm afraid you'll find that the vast majority of people who rate this movie as 10 are highly Christian. I'm not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I highly recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you need to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I was bored with the characters and their illogical behavior. The premise of the film is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was Jesus who is the basis of morality is wrong. One scene shows the main character telling a kid that it is wrong to steal, and then the character goes on to say that it was Jesus who taught us that. I think this is offensive: should we believe that "you will not steal" came from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? And stealing was acceptable before that? I rented the movie on Netflix. I should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments. Oh well.
