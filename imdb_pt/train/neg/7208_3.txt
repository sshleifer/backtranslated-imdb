I grew up watching the cartoon of the Inspector Gadget as a child. It was like getting smart for the kids. Clumsy Boob can not solve any case and all the work is done by the talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard that the live action movie was decent, so I checked into the library. I rented this movie for free and felt I should have been paid to see this. <br /> <br /> Broderick does not even come close to the caliber of acting that Don Adams had as the voice of the gadget. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penny did not look anything like Penny's drawing. She is brunette, where the cartoon version was blonde with braids. But she does a decent job, given what she had to work on. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy never hid in any strange place or had bursts of messages accidentally released by Gadget. <br /> <br /> The cell phone was wrong. He never talked about the show and everything went well. Why did they do this? <br /> <br /> The gadget was too clever in this movie. At the show, he was a complete idiot. Here he had a decent intellect. It would have worked better if he had been an idiot. <br /> <br /> Also completely dismembered the slogan. Borderick says "Wowser." It is and should always be "Wowsers". Sounds lame without the 's'. I was upset when they showed the previews and they did not have the correct phrase. <br /> <br /> The only decent jokes were during the credits. Claw's footman is in front of a support group to retrieve henchmen / helpers. Sitting in the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil, also known as Jaws of Bond, a similar Herve Villacheze, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is the only part I laughed at. <br /> <br /> The other is at the end, where Penny is checking the gadget clock and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams gives voice to the dog saying "the brain is not in this moment. Please leave your name to the sound of the plot. Of course this is not a funny laugh, just a good nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should have at least said the stupid car. <br /> <br /> Children will like this, anyone over 13 will not. <br /> <br />
