I had the pleasure of watching this movie early and I have to say that I thought it would be annoying and wondered how they could improve the 1984 version of Bachelor Party starring Tom Hanks which I found very good ... I was right ... In all honesty I thought it could have been better ... Of course there were some funny moments, but it does not seem to have hit the mark with me ... The acting was good and the plot very well follows the original, but I I think it could have been a lot better ... This movie I would say is for teens and young at heart; full of feminine bodies, alcohol and sex ... It's just another typical run of the factory festival movie that has been made over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this.
