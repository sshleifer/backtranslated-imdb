I really have no clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all. The clothes are completely ridiculous and the people who touch them also seem completely silly at the same time. There is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers. This is just a higher-priced television commercial designed to sell extremely extravagant plastic trash to innocent kids around the world. From the notes, I can see that he was banned in New Zealand and from what I saw, I can agree to their decision. Avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.
