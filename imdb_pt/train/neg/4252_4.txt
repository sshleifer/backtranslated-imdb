*** Spoilers Possible *** When I saw this today, I had some expectations of how it would be, not too loud, but not low as well. However, this was nothing like I expected, it seems to me that the filmmakers could not decide what kind of film to make. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it is somewhat mysterious. and kind of exciting, but that will soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I watched more, I almost fell asleep a few times. <br /> <br /> The ending is the most ridiculous of all though, almost splatter / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it does not have good scenes, it's just that the movie never becomes "everything". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Movie Man
