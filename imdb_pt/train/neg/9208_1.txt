If you did not know better, you would believe in the Christian moral majority in your preaching, witnessing the sins of the young, their pursuit of Satan, and that hell was filled with fans of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. <br /> <br /> None of these items has a grain of truth, personally. This work does nothing but give Southern Baptists a chance to breathe as the film continues to cast its errant and alarmist views on a creative and original game system. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks contributes stellar performance to this work, but even that was not enough to save him. It's crap. It's under the crap. It is ignorance fueling ignorance and, as such, does not evaluate ANYTHING of ... The Devil.
