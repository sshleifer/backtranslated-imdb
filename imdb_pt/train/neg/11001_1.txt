I've never seen a comedy that was such a big chore to sit down ... or a laugh at it. Okay, maybe a little laugh for Michael Clarke Duncan as the big, bald, black gay virgin. But the rest was shockingly not funny. Aside from being free of any laughter, the "sketches" continue forever! Avoid this if you value your time and money. TERRIBLE!!! Worse!!!
