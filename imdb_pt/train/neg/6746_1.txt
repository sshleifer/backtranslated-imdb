* SPOILERS INCLUDED * With a title like "Bleed", you know that creative fluids were not on the rise when the puppy was conceived. The film is your basic low budget horror film. Oh sure, he tries to be creative with the "murder club" premise, but we've learned that it was just a joke anyway. Okay, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that the new girl in town starts dating her co-worker. He invites her to his circle of friends, and at a party, they tell her how they have a "murder club" and they kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we learned that it was all a joke, but not before our heroine killed a lady in a garage. Now the "members" of the Murder Club are being killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win and the movie ends in a downer. At that time, you would not mind. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first 10 minutes of this movie make no sense. The motivation for the deaths at the beginning of the film is never explained. I'd say it was a way for the director to fill the film, but on the DVD there are deleted scenes! I do not know why anyone would want to see more than the "Bleed" version, but apparently the people behind the DVD thought the viewers would scream for more. In the box, says there are Easter eggs, but why the hell would I want to waste my time looking for extras in this movie is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie and "Bleed" delivered on that front. It was not a bad fun movie though. Everyone looks good in the movie, and there is a lot of nudity, but the acting is horrible. My least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer ... I think he should be funny and fun, but he comes out as a tool. I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the girl in the garage in a hilarious and unconvincing death. The heroine pushes the women to the parking pole, and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing, and she spits her mouth full of blood and "dies." <br /> <br /> For those who think making movies is a complex and creative process done by professionals, check out "Bleed". This will change your mind, and you will realize that any trick can be done by a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not waste time or money on this.
