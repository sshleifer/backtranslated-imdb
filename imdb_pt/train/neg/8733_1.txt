*** Possible Plot Spoilers *** I love Dennis Hopper. I question why he accepted the role of a police detective in 2000, The Spreading Ground. This movie sucks and I'm about to tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is a small town that is about to get a contract for a sports arena. A hitch: there's a killer on the loose and that's bad for business. The mayor makes a deal with the Irish gang to find the killer and make sure he never gets to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy to get caught too, but he's on the level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system do its work. <br /> <br /> This could have been very good. It could have been fascinating. It was horrible. First, they label this guy as Serial Killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of them fit here. The thug killed 5 kids on the first day, and I think it was 2 on the second day. This entire movie stretches over a period of 48 hours .... Action of a serial killer. I do not care about the distorted motives they give you in the end, Serial Killers do their actions for a long period of time. They do not just suddenly kill seven children in two days. This is a Spree. <br /> <br /> Ok, that annoying aside, the acting was atrocious. The only name here was Hopper, and he's the one who came close to taking his part. Unfortunately, he is kind of molded for me and I think he does much, much better. This was simply not a good vehicle for Hopper. He did not allow him to do what he does best, which is to act in a chilling way. It is not that he has gone wrong, I have seen him do much better. <br /> <br /> The Irish mafia guy Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus) who is in charge of their investigation is a bit harsh. Contradiction? Not really. He's trying to play the guy kind of cold and hard, and he does it to the point where the character is just wood. Boring to the max. He did not scare me. He did not inspire any emotion but boredom. I can not tell you how many times I checked to see how long it would take until the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing about it is that it had the feel of a movie made for TV. . You know what I mean. Low production values, low budget, reuse of scenes to save costs. Just eh. Yanno? But I feel that comparing that to those is an insult to those. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was the Director and the Director of Photography on this project. He bit more than he could chew. I can not help feeling that Hopper must have taken on this role as a personal favor to a friend. This is the only rational that I can invent. This was Vanlint's first job as a Director, third as a cinematographer. I hope this was a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the end if you decide to torture yourself with this, but I want to say that they all lost the ball here. even Hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally distressing to the detective, it was just ... well ... blah. I did not see any of the anguish that would accompany the total gear change that guy did. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> This 100 minutes of exhaustive duration and Rated R for violence and language. No child under 13 will have any interest in watching this, so do not worry. Not suitable for anyone anyway. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. You'll thank me later.
