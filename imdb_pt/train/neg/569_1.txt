Thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks so many levels that it's pathetic. The first VAMPIROS was fun, but this low-budget retread makes me yawn. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (poor Kevin Bacon) drives Mexico with a surfboard that houses a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing equipment. Banderas guitar case in WASPED. He picks up some "hunters" along the way (including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to not turn into a vampire), and they decide to stop a master vampire that is not given in the past and so we could care. less about her or her mission (walking in the sunlight stealing the Black Cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so). If you've seen the first vampires, you've seen it and done so much better. John Carpenter has been responsible for many bad movies lately. Quite frankly, I think he's overgrown and unable to do another horror classic. The only decent movie he's made since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else sucks, up to the incredibly cheap and delayed GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this waste of celluloid. Where are they bigger like MURDER ON PRECINTO 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE OF NEW YORK AND THE THING? Carpino compadrio Wallace proves that he can not write his way out of a paper bag with his paper - script very full of yawns, groans and recycled jokes of the original. Did I mention that I hated all the characters in the movie? There was not a single memorable character throughout the film. How does this happen? This movie has nothing to recommend it. Not even the DVD presentation is good; the menu looks awful. <br /> <br /> In comparison, JASON X: "Friday the 13th in space" was a masterpiece. Now this is how you make a sequel and (re) energize a franchise, girls and germs, and create an exciting DVD menu.
