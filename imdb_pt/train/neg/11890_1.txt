From the first time I saw the film cover and the photograph stretched, I thought that this guy, this friend of the 'Scwarz' should be about 6 feet or 6 feet. <br /> <br /> It is not 5 feet high. Not that this is his fault. <br /> <br /> At any rate, I called the movie on a cold night in Tucson on the second floor of the story with a good cigar and let it roll. At that time, my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill, so I needed some good fun. But as bad as the movie was ... I enjoyed it a lot, with a bottle of Merlot too, I must admit. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have watched this movie many times. It always makes me feel good !! It's not that 'trying too hard' to be cool or 'so close' to the target for an action movie ... It's frantic. And then truly clueless. Then frantic again. He's the best of the best when it comes to a low-speed chase scene. Wow!! I've never felt safer in my life. Hot and happy too. I was grateful that they kept gasoline during the chase because of the lower production in the summer months ... anywho <br /> <br /> The direction was 'uninspired' and the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed , or re-choreographed and tight, the sound was out of the delivery did not hit you, he just kept going to the other side. The "locals" from that village where they were, the city instead, were "Off the track", they also did not seem to follow what was going on very well, look and even "look" at the camera lens. Like a deer in the head lights kind of thing just some of them with a smile, a smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because 'Columbu' I bet you have a good heart and a caring spirit for the people in America as well as for your own countrymen. <br /> <br /> However, "Baretta's Island" is very lethargic and unbelievable. I still like that a lot. My now x-wife hates it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funniest thing is that I'm pretty discriminating when it comes to movies that I like or even 'love'. All in all, I like Franco. Then that's it. Like a movie adding an addendum to it, if you enjoy killing a few hours with the fun of watching, straight to B-movie or "bad" movies for your little library collection, you can find Check 'The Big Sweat' (1991) with Robert Z 'Dar ... you know the big one of' TANGO & MONEY '. 'The Big Sweat', a bomb of a cop story with no real plot finding and such idiotic acting, could very well be 'with crutches' and at the end of 'The Big Sweat', I think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and only burned it down and let it burn during the credits. -Good fun. <br /> <br /> But after all, not as good as Baretta's Island, I gave him a '1' and a general rating of 'awful' for a really good B movie. I'm waiting for the continuation, perhaps as 'revenge of Baretta in Montazuma' (Franco takes Mexican vacations and gets sick in the water then, declares war in the water co.) Or 'the Baretta Powder War' where he would go a big dealer of drugs in their country and chemically combining genes and creating a hybrid super bug that would be created and dumped in the cocaine fields and ingested the coke and, upon passing through the insect, forms a chemical reaction that turns coke to pure sugar into powder. Then another sequel that he would have to get the young people rescued from the excessive addiction of sugar and so on. He could get a large toothpaste company to endorse and partially fund the project with a careful placement of the product on the resource. Right?(*)
