Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who, with the guidance of a respectable agent, has a lot of potential. Obviously, the person who guided you in this farce is not someone who cares about your career. I sat in the movie theater surrounded by teenagers going out in bulk to find another movie and wondered who thought this movie would attract anyone. It was poorly written, the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort on the characters and the director obviously did not care.
