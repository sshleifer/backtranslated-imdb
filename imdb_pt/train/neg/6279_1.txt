No, basically you're watching something that does not make sense. Not to ruin the movie for people who really want to take a look at the movie I'll explain the story. <br /> <br /> A normal day-to-day woman is walking down the street and then finds herself driving around. your own car. She follows her and many events take place during this period that include her and her family. <br /> <br /> I specifically made an account to comment on this movie, about how it was horribly written. The performance was great, the events were great, but the story did not lead to anything - it could be added to a tremendous magnitude and be transformed into a worldwide epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by doing this, usually at the end of the movies most of his questions get answers, but this movie has asked: what just happened and 1 hour and 20 minutes just went through nothing. <br /> <br /> They had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would enter our world and kill us. It was not drawn at all during the movie, and you never know how it's going or why it was or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the movie. The main character should not even be the main character. At the end of the movie, the guy who finally discovers everything and runs away (his sister's boyfriend) must have been the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, I played soon after .. do not waste your time. I really hope nothing like this is done again.
