The movie begins with 3 people meeting at the bar. IT'S OK. They are talking about their imaginary lives, lying all the time for no reason. Still OK. From time to time, they still make you laugh. Interesting. First 30 minutes you really like it! But then ... things get worse ... Nothing is happening ... a long time ... and then, when something happens, all you can see are old naked "ladies" touching each other! It is not alright. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top of the movie, but that's all except that! The movie has no meaning, it's boring and sickly! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) at the FEST (film festival), this movie was the most popular according to surveys, of course, before people watch! I even thought (before watching): "Hay, that might be interesting, even though it's a Russian movie!" But, God, no !!!!
