... but the key word here is "usually". I'm known for loving movies. EVERYONE thinks they're dumb. But in the world of B-rated movies, THIS is rated Z. Absolutely ridiculous. The thing I respect about most of my favorite movies is that they do not take themselves too seriously. Movie makers like this treat the movie lightly, even if it's a heavy subject. I have the impression, however, that the producers of this film took themselves seriously, as if they were putting together a ten-star classic, complete with bad attempts at stinging lines and stupid camera shots. However, despite all this, I still gave 4 out of 10 stars, as I'm inclined for movies like this. If you are a fan of B-rated, however, I would try very hard to find this one.
