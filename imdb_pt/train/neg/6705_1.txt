This movie is just a shame. Orlando, Fla., Seems to become a more recognizable movie area (such as Vancouver's rise to prominence). The siblings were filmed in Central Florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area (which took great strides with Indie, Walking Across Africa and HBO's big miniseries From Earth to The Moon). I'll try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to shoot the brothers. He had the potential to give a new twist on the 'Boy Band' mania. After all, both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from that area. But, The Brothers falls short, probably because of a weak script. Both main characters are simple, almost without development (part of this could be the amateur actor, but part of it is certainly the way the script was written). <br /> <br /> Also a problem is the choice of jokes. Many of the jokes are very repetitive (they are funny the first time, but they grow a bit boring). Some of the 'show' scenes are improperly staged (and many of these scenes also do not seem to move the story at all). <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for this, but unfortunately a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the next feature based on this short. But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Figg is to switch to different genres (quickly). Comedy is not your forte. But, it is undisputed that he is definitely one of the most prominent filmmakers in the Orlando area (it is a pity that now he is infamous, not famous). <br /> <br />
