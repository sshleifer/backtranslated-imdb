There's a lot going on with Helen and none of this is good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds portray mothers of a pair of Leopold & Loeb as murderers moving from the Midwest to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, an aspiring star of Jean Harlow, opens a dance studio for children and Winters is his pianist. Soon Winters (as Helen) begins to crumble. It's all very slow and although there are moments of real shivers (unpleasant phone calls, a visit from Timothy Carey's wino), the film is devoid of any real horror. However, it is still worthy of entertainment. The acting divas are good and the production values ​​are great. A soundtrack by David Raskin, Lucien Ballard's cinematography and Oscar-nominated costumes make a powerful contribution. With that PLACE IN THE SUN and LOLITA to your credit, does someone make crazy like Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master at this type of film exploration. In addition to Carey, the eccentric supporting cast includes Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (as an Aimee Semple McPherson as an evangelist), Yvette Vickers and Micheál MacLiammóir (the Irishman Orson Welles) as Hamilton Starr, aptly nicknamed Hammy.
