Maverick cop with family problems and fondness for using his gun? Checks! Isolated location with valuable object that is begging to be stolen? Checks! Tasty looking for love interest? Checks! Assorted band of dumb school of cardboard cannon vandals with dishonest European accents ?? Checks! German sounding villain played by an English actor with a piece of tacky dialogue for every occasion? Checks! Corny a Liners? Check! <br /> <br /> Sweetheart me, does this movie take the wee wee or what? The clichés come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stands still, watching how bad the script is! <br /> <br /> In a blatant cheap and cheerful, straight to the video only to rip the Hard to Kill situated on a mountain (complete with a few lines cut from the above) we have all the cliché of usual cliche action is progressively ticked as we go along with some good old-fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake anyone in the audience who may have just <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is the entire cop on John McClane's way here, who even manages the time for you , the villain with a weapon used all his ammunition at one point. <br /> In the midst of this mess, there are some recognizable faces that I can only assume they needed the money and / or were simply playing for laughter from the senseless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot until the final implausible conclusion complete with the ropey dialogue and even more effe cts. <br /> <br /> When looking at this three pounds of the supermarket bargain effort on IMDb I am amazed to discover that this failure has generated not one but two sequences, I have to find these jewelry on DVD! It seems that the first sequel is a robbery of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, God knows! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor who plays Jack changes with each movie and even the character's name seems to change to the third. <br /> <br /> Still, blind shopping for cheap DVDs simply would not be the same if the studios did not keep up with the trout of this horrible quality stuff !!
