... through the antics of Eric Stanze. A not particularly talented director directed a not particularly good movie, but still I found myself sitting on the final credits, for nothing more than to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> A rapist escapes. from the prison and call his old flame. After capturing her (even if she has come willingly) and threatening her to have sex (another event she was also willing to do), he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who cheated on her in the past. He then decides to kill her (huh?), But is frustrated and dies instead. The girl's mind fits (or something) and she takes her anger away from the unlucky guys in the basement. <br /> <br /> All right, writing sucks: it's long, full of ten cents, and it's too much in that. <br /> <br /> The acting is a drug: what a minute, what is acting? <br /> <br /> Filming sucks: homemade video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of filming in the graveyard is just an insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: get ... 'budget', that was the joke. <br /> <br /> And there was still a charm to the thing. In the 1970s, these types of movies came out of theaters with real budgets and talents, but not today. If you want to watch that kind of violent and sexually exploitative junk (do not lie, some of us), then that's all you're going to get today. Some scenes of hardcore sex scene, torture with fecal material, fun with axes, anal rape by broom cord and a long shot of crazy girl masturbating with the same broom stick are some of the best items on the menu. <br /> <br /> It is not good and will not be remembered, but not since the heyday of Joe D'amato that people made movies like that. <br /> <br /> 4/10
