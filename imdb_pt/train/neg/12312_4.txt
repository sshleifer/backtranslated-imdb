For 50 years after World War II, the United States was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time, because of recruitment and wars, everyone in society had served, or was connected to someone who had. This allowed a minigram based on the notion of American cleverness amid an inflexible military machine. Sometimes this machine was military from outside the US, for example, in prisoner of war situations. Once removed are stories on other machines: science fiction and corporate, but they always make reference to this military genre and, in fact, the testosterone action takes even reference to his comic brother. <br /> <br /> You can trace this, I think, perhaps beginning in the comic, that is, Amrican, sections of "The Great Escape," which immediately spawned TeeVee descendants in "Gomer Pyle" and "Hogan's Heros." Then a second wave triggered by "Catch 22" and "MASH", both of which had been real life, then books, then movies, and in the MASH case, then TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But first of all, there was the "Phil Silvers Show" about a sergeant Bilko and this one followed by "Mister Roberts". A happy swindler who only committed harmless crimes and then only in response to an overly gross system that tried to limit his life. That was the day that TeeVee shows imported. You absorbed them instead of just getting them to work to talk. He was not particularly clever at all, except to find this rift between what we wanted in control and freedom. <br /> <br /> Its only large area where Americans have devised the way they think about forgiveness, even captivating, lies in a military context, an area that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here. <br /> <br /> <br /> Because it's great, it sometimes pays off in laughter. "Stripes" was very funny, I thought. It had the turnaround of the misfits defeating serious enemies, rather than doubling some "Dirty Dozen". And sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now this, well before the cultural wars intensify. He tries to play at this sweet spot, like other remakes that mistreated Steve Martin. It's so dull that you really hope the Army is the strongest player. Yet another way to keep up with how societies shape the grips in military power. <br /> <br /> Ted's rating - 1 of 3: You may find something better to do with this part of your life.
