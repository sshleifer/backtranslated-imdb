Not a bad start to the program - but what a slap in the face for law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it tries to present itself as reality - and it's anything but. Men and women who dedicate their lives to law enforcement deserve more than that. What's the next medical course in a minute? Charo performing lipo? Charles Grodin helping in a hip replacement? Come on ... show a little respect. Even the citizens of Muncie are publicizing the show as staged. Police Academy = High School Gym? Poor editing (how many times can they use the Taco Bell car-to-car photo in the background?), Tacky siren effects (the same loop added ad nauseum to each 'call' if rolling code or not), and lastly , but not least - more safety officer issues than you could shake a stick. <br /> <br /> If I want to see fabricated cops and fake wise cops, I would watch RENO 911.
