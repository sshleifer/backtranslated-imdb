Cedric Kahn's films have been based on characters, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges), so it's shocking to see this series of really specialized car chases interspersed with some attempts to give character to Succo . . I do not think Stefano Cassetti is an interesting actor; it reminds me of professional athletes who are persuaded in films such as Bret Favre. That empty look looks like a really cruel deer captured by the headlights. A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality rather than admire his ability to steal the car. <br /> <br /> The small performance there comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the needy student Succo takes to assault. The interview at the police station is a marvel of soft stubbornness with a little fear of the mixed future. Le Besco aside, there is little to recommend this movie.
