One of the most idiotic films of the 1940s, an unbearable house comedy haunted with music starring Kay Kyser. Kyer, an orchestra leader and radio star (and eternal collegiate college fraternity), was a kind of precursor to Spike Jones, preparing for his guests and voluntarily supported by his merry troupe of musicians. He is hired to throw a birthday party in a dingy mansion, the kind where the poisoned darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. The ball is surrounded by a scary judge, a scary teacher, a sinister swami, lots of laughing women and lots of bad jokes to fill three photos of Bob Hope. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to brag about, and neither is Kyser too confident, making a material with the elbow of the ribs that makes 1940 return ten years ago. * in ****
