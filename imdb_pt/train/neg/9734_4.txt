A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 1950s and that he now has the power to ... blow up in flames! <br /> <br /> I was really prepared for this movie, with the direction of the great Toby Hooper and the wildcard Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it did not rise above the average individual movie with violent powers. Spontaneous Combustion has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much. The special effects are not bad and help carry the film through to the end. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad, Dourif steals the show. <br /> <br /> It's not classic, but it's not the worst of its kind either. <br /> <br />
