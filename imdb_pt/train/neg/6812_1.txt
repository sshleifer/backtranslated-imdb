since the beginning of this movie you soon realize that the name of the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself of watching a naked woman being chased by people with very silly masks for servants running in the worst clothes I have ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice before you see and as the movie moves slowly you soon realize that the vampire is not a vampire you have to imagine where the title came from some parts of the movie. A bit of sense with Pierre and Dad but as the movie comes to its really silly end you have to think about why ending a movie this way and snotty they had a better ending if only there it was not a movie to watch
