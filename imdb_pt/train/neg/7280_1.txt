I will keep reviewing this program as soon as possible. Skip this. Low budget, not funny, bad script. Acting is not as bad as writing, but it's still bad. That is all you need to know, but I will continue to write more than necessary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with three segments, each parodying some other type of movie. A much funnier film, with the same idea, is "Movie Movie" with George C. Scott. Very obscure, but worth looking for. MM parodied movies from the 1930s, and did so with elegance, precision and wit. <br /> <br /> This movie does not. I parody three types of movies, supposedly from the late 70's, early 80's, but it's a parody of movies I've almost never heard of. The first is, I think, a parody of "Kramer vs. Kramer", in a way. Peter Reigert does his best with a poor and dirty script. The second is a parody of, I do not know what ... a Danielle Steele novel? I mean, can you see a story like this on TV in life, but in a movie theater? I mean, I remember the '70s, I was there. This is an opera-type parody about an attractive young woman who sleeps to power. These kinds of things usually parody, so I do not see how that was necessary. <br /> <br /> We are on easier ground with the third segment, "The Municipalians," which parodies the police films. I watched elements of "The New Centurians" and some "Dirty Harry," both almost 10 years old when the film was created. Yes, cool and current. Robby Benson plays the idealistic (exaggerated) rookie while Richard Widmark portrays the gray-haired veteran who drinks whiskey while sitting in the police car (OH! Stop! My sides! He's actually drinking booze on the police car! this was the first film after "Animal House" to have the name "National Lampoon" attached. Wow. To go in five years from that classic movie to this dung heap is nothing short of shocking. I could continue for hours on the sad decline that has caused one of the most innovative and original voices of American humor (which would be National Lampoon, the original magazine for about its first 10 years or more) to sell and start a long, slow slide in a crap world where the magazine is now long and only exists as a brand to hit low budget "comedy" movies for a fee. One more reason why capitalism (and cocaine) is so bad. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a very serious time. Do not miss your 90 minutes. I want mine back. On the plus side, Fred Willard is on it!
