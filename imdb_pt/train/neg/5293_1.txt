I got this video after reading the text in the box, the story looked good, and had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how horrible his acting was, he walks and talks so stupid all the time, it's fake and unconvincing. It does not end there, almost ALL characters act so badly that it's laughable, the only acceptable performance was by Alan Boyce (David), but the guy commits suicide early on and you do not see him again, you never know why he did that! Everything about this movie screams low quality, I can not believe how such a thing is released! I was often tempted to stop watching, in fact I did, in the middle of it I decided to stop watching and turned it off, came to the IMDB to check what others thought, I found zero comments (I was not surprised), so I decided force me to deal with the pain and come back to finish, so come here to comment on it. The only good thing (for me) was the theme of the high school rock band, the occasional guitar playing and sing parts, but this is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and direction ... terrible movie.
