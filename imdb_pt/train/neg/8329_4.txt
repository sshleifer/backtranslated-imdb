I question their importance to Cinema Queer, as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter through violent behavior than making any clear statement about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three stories are intertwined somewhat sloppily. I found myself trying to unravel the confusing narrative in the first 15 minutes, which in itself did not please me. Weak plot points were repeated infinitely, as if we had not achieved the first 10 times. <br /> <br /> There was a sense of padded dialogue throughout the film. More like a 45-minute short of Boy's Brief instead of a full-length movie. It had a certain erotic touch, masculine nudity and sex appeal, but in general the sum was not equal to its parts. <br /> <br /> The 1st part: Boxer / Stalker plot was the strongest and yet it looked like it had been pulled thin. Bob has been following Tim for four years now and just now is he confronting him? I felt as if his game of cat rat was not developed enough to merit its conclusion. We needed more information about them and less Parking / Locker scenes with Tim relentlessly saying "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> The second part: Danny wants his friend, Tony, to beat him while he masturbates. Tony does not seem to care, but he does not even seem interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby - not even after doing it naked. This tale does not have such an important transition from "I'm a direct kid beating my friend for fun" to "I think I can be gay and hit him because I would like to spread his ass and make him S / M style." A very important thing to leave out. <br /> <br /> Of course, these stories could have conveyed their points in half the time. The third part, with the man and the woman hitting each other, adds to this thought. Also, it was unnecessary and did not add anything to the movie. Yes, the actors did a good job under the circumstances and the four male protagonists were very sexy. The make-up (bruises and cuts), however, was on par with a primary school talent show. <br /> <br /> There was not enough meat for this story to have any impact on gay politics. The film made no statement, wasted time and is not engaging or dignified enough for a careful investment. His fatal flaw is his amateur approach, which makes it impossible to take him seriously.
