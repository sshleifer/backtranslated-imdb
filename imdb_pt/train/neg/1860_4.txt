The 1998 Michael Keaton children's comedy of the same title was totally condemned for its poor quality special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George invented for this horror comedy, they are positively incomprehensible. The killer snowman looks like Styrofoam and his arms look like oven gloves too big. Which they probably were. The cast puts him in the thick of this parody of dozens of other (much worse) movies and Paul Keith as the city doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.
