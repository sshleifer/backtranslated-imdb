I have this on the DVD 10 pack CURSE OF THE DEAD. You have to love these bargain packages. For even though they do not feature remastering, restoration and all that hoo-ha, and the films are usually in full-frame pan and scan format, there is no denying that there are always some gems included. And for "gems," I mean there's always a crap to be seen, especially if the 1970s movies like The Mansion of Madness is. <br /> <br /> My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the title screens roll, it's the Torture Dungeon of Dr. Tarr of Poe. No matter, really, how rubbish sucks, right? Yes! But to say that this film is completely useless is not true. There are some funky elements here and there, and obviously the film had a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The opening title sequence is cool, with its color negative run through a cheap TV look. Dialogue is always hilarious. Near the beginning of the movie, the horse and buggy driver leaves to move a stump of dead tree in the middle of the road. "STRONG!" says our hero. Funny, then, that this guy should no longer be able to fight the wacky footmen when they are madly amused. You'll completely forget that this guy was in the movie until he showed up again later in the end. This is how these characters are memorable. <br /> <br /> The best part about Mansion of Madness, however, has to be the crazy music and hijinks that the good guys have to endure. It's like a cartoon song that a three-year-old would find enjoyable. And why all this weird antics, anyway? I'd say my favorite moment had to be when the horse and the stroller are ambushed by the forest freaks as they pull a stupid homemade ghost up a piece of wood in the middle of the road and make the cart stop. What the hell? Ah, yes, there are many breasts to be seen also for those who like things like that. Boobies, bad dialogues and crazy music. That best sum of Mansion of Madness to me. Well worth at least one note, and it can be so much better if you've drunk a little or something. I can not say I was bored watching, but I can not deny that it's also a keg of poop. Kind of like Magical Mystery Tour, but with a plot, but no. Hmm. <br /> <br /> And Mr. Chicken PWNZ.
