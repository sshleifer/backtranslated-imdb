Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, without any moral qualities. He only wanted success in a society where all people, politicians, businessmen, journalists, women are corrupt. The only king is money. The hero of Maupassant, Charles Forestier, is increasingly high on the scale of society thanks to his seduction. He is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to scale the society's stench. At the end of the novel, he married the newspaper's biggest daughter, in the largest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has a fortune and more, he will become a member of Parliament and then a minister. The "useless" women are beside themselves, but he is always in touch with beautiful and useful women. The image "PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI" is a story of MORALITY. It's all, but not a story in Maupassant's idea. Why did they put "BEL AMI" in their title?
