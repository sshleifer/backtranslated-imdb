Warning: This review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Notice I said "almost." This is nothing more than many random scenes brought together in a loose attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CAN NOT call them "heroes") shoot innocents for their food, and also steal the same for similar reasons. There are also tons of homoeroticism, which was a detour for me. (SPOILER: It seems that the villain (who is topless and not naked as other critics claim) is killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of torture to the audience.) I can not get rid of the feeling of which animal abuse has occurred countless times in this cinematic abomination. If you are in an MST3K climate, you may find this assistive, but most of the time you may forget it. It will rent the original Conan DVD instead.
