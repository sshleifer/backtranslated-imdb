When a man who does not have Alzheimer's does not remember how many films he made, he is probably the most prolific director in the world, after all. This man is Jesus Franco, the king of the so-called eurotrash. His 1980 film, Devil Hunter, is so rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word (the movie title is misleading, to begin with) like any other Franco movie I've seen. That makes it look awful, and it's ... However, Franco has some kind of inimitable sensitivity, a generous way with the scandalous scandalous, nudity and violence, and even with his cheap stupid issue that tries to pave the extreme hastily with which all his films were made. Mixing all these elements causes you to take out your movies even when you are mostly waiting for them to end because they are very boring. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is almost incomprehensible to the first. half an hour. Abduction by strangers of a white woman who appears to be a model or movie star is interspersed with a lot of native action in South America. There are many twisted moves, dances and endless repeated zooms in an ugly totem. You need to get used to the repetitive zooms and the technique of cutting the same shot three times in a row, as those are Franco's main methods of stretching a movie by the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The monster that looks like the totem is actually a little scary. He has bulging eyes and his presence is always signaled on the soundtrack by cacophonic moans, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. At the beginning of the play he chews on a native woman tied to a tree, and it's hard to know what really happens here, but I think he ate her belly (or her genitals, sweet Jesus!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the adventure begins right when a studious guy and his veteran Vietnamese friend are sent to the island to retrieve the white girl from the kidnappers. The flakey has an accent that, as it is nicknamed, is half of the Brooklyn-American style, half English-liverpudliano and all retarded. All dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable, creating another layer of the film that may somehow hold your interest. <br /> <br /> Not much happens from now on, and it happens very slowly, filled with a bit of indignation like rape. The nebulous action is developed (haha!) By acres of 360 degree nudity of the natives and the two female leaders, and even the monster itself. That he walks around with his exposed penis makes him an unattractive prospect for the tough guy, but it has to be done at some point, and it's good to note that the director will show the genitals of anyone in front of the cameras. <br /> <br /> The best feature of the Devil Hunter is the shooting location. Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural aspects and history of filmmaking, but he does not enjoy the sets. You get islands, jungles, helicopters and real mountains, all in widescreen. This is something that is really cool to experience in these days of low-quality ad nauseam scenarios and computer graphics scenarios. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, recommendation issues regarding this movie seem irrelevant. If you're trying to watch all the Video Nasties, you'll have to watch it at some point, and you'll be just as restless as I am. If you like Franco, you'll see it anyway. If you do not fit into any of the above categories, chances are you will never come across this movie. Copies are not just lying, and I could hardly recommend the search for it. It's Franco. Lazy and crazy Franco.
