This is one of the worst movies I've seen so far, the best part was Christian J. Meoli "Leonard" trying to act jumping out of the bar, as I wanted to do on the DVD, to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shit movie. Sean Astin "Andrew" (played his role perfectly, did a great job, pity that was in this movie), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston " Chad ", Renee Zellweger" Poet "(they put their name on the cover, it has a total of 1 line and less than 4 seconds throughout the movie ...) If the cast had any dignity, they go out and buy all copies of this film and burn them together with writer / director George Hickenlooper and writer John Enbom
