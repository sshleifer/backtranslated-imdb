I do not even know where to start on this. "It's all about the family." This has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a "horror" movie, although this could not be a horror movie, even if it tried !!! Ugh !!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. He needs to stop playing the symbolic guy who dies in all the action movies (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man co-wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He has some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stick with indie movies. It has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no room to act legitimately for it. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.
