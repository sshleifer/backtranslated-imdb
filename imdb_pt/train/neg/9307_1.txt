I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is 'GARBAGE' The acting is so poorly done I've seen kids at school do a better job Every cast seems to be just reading their lines, no feeling, no emotion and no room for capture the viewer. On another note, the special effects were absurdly extravagant and the whole thing seemed to have been filmed with a camera, anyone could buy a radio hut. <br /> <br /> The clown himself does not look anything like the video cover. Heck he does not even appear in the movie until the end and all he does is sing songs and go around chasing some characters. There is no real murder shown, so this is not a real movie, since I've seen it, I've questioned a few things. 1. If it's 'Serial Insane Clown Killer' Would not this be a serial killer that kills clowns? 2. If your friend disappears, why would you go into the woods to have sex instead of looking for it? Really sad. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is it that the only REAL performance was in vain at the end, all of a sudden? The cast finally decided to show effort in their works? This movie is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid renting it so you do not waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming.
