I see what the director was trying to do, but he missed the mark. The lead actor was very good, but editing around his moments takes you away from that. The camera's work, that is, lighting and exposure is a kind of amateur I could forgive if the direction was more fluent, but it was not. The sound was a little off and that gets you out of the movie too. I see I could see this director doing a little better in the future, so not a total right out, but do not expect a dv movie almost as good as 28 days later or anything, keep your expectations low and you will get more of this. At least it was only an hour and a half. Ah yes and beyond the leadership, the acting was very bad if you ask me. But I'm a movie snob, so take it for what it's worth.
