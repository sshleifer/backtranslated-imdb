WOW what can I say. I like shity movies and I go out of my way to watch a tacky action movie, but Snake Eater would have had a nail in my pee hole while my grandmother would give me a dance in my lap. Lorenzo Lamas, pfft more like Lorenzo Lameass this guy has as much acting ability as Bill Clinton has self-control. It has all the assets to make a really bad movie even worse. Crazed Hillbilles YEP! unnecessary shooting tit (with a real strange scar) YEP! low quality soundtrack, yes! I wish I could give the movie -10 stars, but 1 is as low as it goes. Seriously, I think someone was playing a joke on me when I saw this, I can not be real ...... the worst thing there is 2MORE ENA MOVIES CARTOON! ...... guess in demand.
