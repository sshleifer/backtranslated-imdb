102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous part and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a silly quilted, terrible story about the acting of Glenn Close, who does all the scenes as if she was playing for her own fun, and incredibly charming and uninteresting main actors. Once again, dogs are the only "actors" that seem "real" and that is an exaggeration. Another wasted effort here. GRADE: D
