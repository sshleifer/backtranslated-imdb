There has been a lot of love that was put into "Fantastic Mr Fox" by Wes Anderson, unfortunately all love is for himself. Granted, there has been a lot of time and effort in making this universe ever so consciously peculiar, but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try to make it funny. The most troubling thing is that I think it was, and that's the best that Wes Anderson has managed to do. <br /> <br /> The animation is good in close-up photos of animals, but when the camera is further away everything becomes really hard on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks a bit confusing. There was really nothing special about the acting, with Wes opting to pick his friends and big names over more specialized voice actors who probably could have made the film better. I'm sure George Clooney's resume consists of two appearances in South Park, one of them where he played the dog. <br /> <br /> The film is very presumptuous and tries too hard to be clever. different and is typically, although the film is set in England, all good animals are typical Americans playing baseball, while bandits are English stereotyped with the most insulting English accents. I can not emphasize how much of a waste of time this movie is. I did not laugh once.
