This was undoubtedly the worst thing I ever spent on money. I feel dirty for admitting that I rented this 'movie' and actually paid money to see it. This does not even sort the bin. No, no. This is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumps located in particularly dirty neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer. Calling trash would degrade trash everywhere. It was so bad that I felt I had to register on IMDb and tell my colleague. This character from luvahire states that this movie is great. You have to question your understanding of reality. Let's take some of your comments and review them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a VERY good job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director saw his audience shrinking and shuddering at every phrase uttered by Ricky or alternatively bursting into uncontrollable laughter at a time when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did a great job. "I'm an aspiring actor taking theater classes at my school and I had to play a part where I had to cry and it's not easy being emotional in such a scene I support actors who have to make an emotional scene and can do that. "Wow. I must also support actors who can perform emotional scenes. Luvahire, you might want to look at another line of work there, buddy, if you think those giggles did it. Still, they can help you if you need to practice crying. Just watch the movie. there is. there is. there is. <br /> <br /> "BRING ON SEQUEL" <br /> <br /> If I were your theater teacher at school, I would fail based solely on this comment. <br /> <br /> I'm very disgusted to continue. Now I'm handing the film over to my colleague Bangla. <br /> <br /> Howdy! If you continued reading this far, I take it for granted that you have already seen the film, and now you are looking for one of two things in this review: 1) Additional corrosive rejection of what you agree with was an exceptionally poor film. 2) Additional vitriolic devastation of what you feel to be a good cinematic endeavor that needs to be defended against such defamatory scum as myself. If you want to help articulate your loathing or ammunition for a thought-provoking reply, if I say something good, that will only disappoint you - so, let me assure you, there is little chance of such disappointment. <br /> <br /> The other negative comments here on IMDb have already listed the specific flaws of the film (eg, acting, soundtrack, direction, dialogue, editing, etc.), however, all these failures can be readily forgiven, in and of themselves. Few people will rent a movie entitled "Hood of the Living Dead" if they require these elements to be top notch. The final failure of "Hood", however, is his failure to keep the abundant promise of his name. "Hood of the Living Dead" pretty much jumps off the shelf of the video store, with its implications for incredibly creative brutality and kills. Here was a chance to blend the melancholy of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto, to have bandit zombies hammering the living innocents while they wrapped up rags, to have undead pimps driving over everything. Very deadly lice on their walks deceived. The mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious. Instead, the movie is more like watching high school kids timidly hand over the lines to a play they are running but do not understand. To avoid a sense of betrayal on the part of your video rental audience, I suggest that the Quiroz brothers relaunch the movie with the new title: "Hood of the Living Dead: A homemade horror video we recorded on our camcorder with some friends over the past weekend because we were bored. " Or maybe they could cast it as a documentary. "The Day Creativity Died: An exploration of how a low-budget film may still be perfectly devoid of intelligent or original thinking, despite the lack of ties to a large film studio." <br /> <br /> The prospective tenant whose interest has not been overcome should find the following synopsis on the back of the video: "The Quiroz Brothers have proved once again that observing things you can do alone is not very interesting." - Mr. Bangla
