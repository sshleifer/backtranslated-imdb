I've watched this movie a few times and never thought it was so funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> It's about women who work in a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving you a taste of their own remedy, and try to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Dabney Coleman is one of those 80s stars that plays a good villain, is not really evil, it's just nasty. Dolly Partin is adorable and fun to watch in comedies and her southern wit really shines here. Jane Fonda is so and does little to me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times, I have to love her. <br /> <br /> I could recommend this to anyone who likes the comedy of the '80s. I like the movie, but there are things I do not like. It starts great and has a good flow and then it all starts to come together at once and made me care less about the characters. They all have little fantasies about what they would like to do with the boss and, though "cute", I just thought it would slow the flow of the movie. As the movie continues, it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down, just to finish in a quick way, that's too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try if you have not yet seen. I think, depending on the mood, it can be more or less enjoyable.
