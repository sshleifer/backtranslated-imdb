To overcome his wife's death, an elderly man does what anyone in his position would do naturally (at least in a Peter Greenaway movie): he and his son occupy the house with eight and a half (one has no legs) women and Embark on a sexual odyssey. Being this a Greenaway movie, there is a lot of pretentious and uninteresting chatter and of course there is unnecessary male nudity. In fact, the father and the son divide the bed by sleeping naked. Gross. Also, who wants to see an old guy full frontal? For those who are not on the homo-erotic scene, one of the women likes to do the nasty thing with the horses. There is no story - just a random collection of bland scenes.
