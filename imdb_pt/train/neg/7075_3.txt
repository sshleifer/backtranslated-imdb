This is at least the third remake of this movie, so if while watching, there is a feeling of déjà vu, do not be surprised. All they did was change the story story and tell it differently, but the differences are not significant. And it does not improve because the plot is flawed to begin with. This never works. And like its predecessors, the acting is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that will amaze anyone who has never seen the movie before, but the ending does not fit the story. If this movie had ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and would have been very satisfying and I would have thought it would be worth it. But here is the spoiler and that, in the end, the crime pays because the criminal is not caught. I never liked this message from a movie.
