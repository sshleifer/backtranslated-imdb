This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, although for better reasons left to the constituted powers. Much seems to have been made of the fact that it is the first Thai-language film, made with Thai actors and crew, but directed by a Westerner. You do not have to bother to be honest, because this movie is monotonous, monotonous, monotonous. Why suggest something, why cover up an idea in mystery, why subtly invoke a feeling when you can hammer the point at home with terrible voices, obvious photos and on the upper scenes> Nothing is left to the imagination as a director instead and again Spurrier awkwardly produces endless clich√©s. No hints, no guesswork, it's all on the screen, no need to use our imagination. Wonder when the 'scary' part is coming? No, you will not, because the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating, rising to a crescendo of menacing. Hell, I'm inventing words to describe how bad that is. Want to know if the demon conjured is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - it really is a snake, and yes, it really bites your crotch, and there's blood spattered all over. It's a strange and uncomfortable movie for several reasons. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the bumps are flagged and obvious. It could be a blitz on the weaker side of Thailand, but the director has a sloppy, sloppy style when it comes to showing almost pubescent teens. Maybe she was launching like the virgin virginity that sowed the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe the whole thing was just pants. Uninspired, insipid, repetitive, banal - all candidates for better description but bland, seem more appropriate and honest. Everything has been seen before, probably better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or flare. Excuse. Thumbs down on each bill. Really terrible.
