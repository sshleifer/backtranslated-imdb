After Disney's witty live-action, George of the Jungle, I had high hopes for this movie. Big disappointment. Plot in a plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. This movie was based on simple headlines, placement of idiot (and nonsense) products and the most annoying side kick in that toy car thing. I took two young people to see and they got bored. The only laugh I got from this movie was the bad wait when you need a laugh to show a guy in the groin!
