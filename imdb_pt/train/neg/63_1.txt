Holy shit. This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. All the performances are good, but there is no plot. Same! No plot! A lot of clowns talk about this and that and this is your movie. Ug ... Robert Duvall's character is senile and continues to ask the same people the same qestions over and over again. This gives you the same answers over and over again. I'm sure that this movie reached six because people think they should like it. Good performances with well-known and well-known actors, but the real work is a steaming shit. Well, maybe that's a bit misleading, since the steam coming up from a fresh pile sounds a bit like something going on and in this movie NOTHING HAPPENS! Bag
