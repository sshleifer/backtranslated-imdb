What a piece of crap this movie was. The premise was fine, but even at the beginning, with bad effects to mingle in a giant with normal-sized people (even the effects on Hercules was better) I knew this would be bad. But the really horrible part of the movie is the dialogues. It's completely incoherent, silly and stupid. I felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a D-. I want to slap on Casper van Diem and the other actors for watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I've had my share of bad and bad movies (I love the series of tremors), but this ... I do not recommend anything. It's silly and the totally stunned dialogues will make you cringe.
