It follows the same path as most sequences. First was great. The second was medium and this, full of bad acting and some stupid dialogue and much suspension of disbelief, this movie was weak. <br /> <br /> Very predictable and I just could not bear that Henry Wrinkler Like the boss with that stupid eye, there was so much more that they could have done with it. I really liked the first one. I wish they had gone below those lines, rather than what they did here. <br /> <br /> There was very inexplicable that needed to be explained, in what period of time this was and why, why is there an old-fashioned phone in that room? <br /> <br /> I know there's another one in progress. <br /> <br /> Blah!
