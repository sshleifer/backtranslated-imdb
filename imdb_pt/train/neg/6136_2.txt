Buck's role as The Kahn reminds us of Bob Barker (of The Price is right) running a country the same way he runs his show. But there is much more to laugh and snore in this turkey. Kurt Thomas, as the baby-faced "hero," exhibits some considerable acrobatic skills, but not a performance talent. There are some scary moments (in the Village of Crazies, mostly) and some slightly impressive martial arts sequences. But any "Ninja" movie will give you a lot more entertainment, and you will not feel so guilty for laughing.
