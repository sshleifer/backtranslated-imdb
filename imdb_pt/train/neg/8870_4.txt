Stefan is an x-con who five years ago married Marie. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan's past, and he volunteered to do a messenger job. Stefan's work is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden, which should go easily. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan meets Elli, a girl from Bosnia who was sold to a stripper. Stefan does not like what he sees and decides to help Elli out of his misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fled to Sweden, Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up for the past, Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father no matter what. Finally back to Sweden, the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever imagined. This film does not seem to fit the common class of Swedish films because it has been Americanized a lot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist do everything medium, the effects make the film a little too much. See and jugde for yourself. <br /> <br />
