I was not expecting much from this movie - a fun little fun. The Hill of the Howling Winds could be transformed into a plausible modern story - pleasant and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. But this movie decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a similiar version so diluted from the source material that it is incredible that they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights. He ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are essentially unfriendly, often unfriendly, and often cruel to one another. It changes the very nature of certain characters - Isabelle, for example, in the novel, did not have a conniving bone in her body - they took away her blind idealism and turned her into an intriguing prostitute. Heathcliff is a terrible person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. The dialogue is banal and we wonder how the actors managed to deliver anything with straight faces. Instead of depth or real emotions, we know that they mean something when they scream on someone's face. I read critiques of the early 1990s version, "Emily Bronte's Howling Windy Hill," which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, claiming to have turned an intensely dark gothic story into a corpulent ripper. Slightly valid comments, but the MTV version goes one step further, using the basic structure of the story to deliver the chipper beach rockers to a very bad song.
