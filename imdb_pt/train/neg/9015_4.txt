The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are totally acceptable and surprisingly watchable. The characters are believable and interesting. The cloning lab looks really high tech. After that, everything collapses. The characters begin to behave stupidly, and a new subplot is presented out of nowhere about a fusion reactor (and this is supposedly "current day") getting critical, the only justification is that it is necessary to kill the dragon - only he does not t. The finish is incredibly weak. One wonders what made a movie that started so well become so wrong. <br /> <br /> All characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians. This results in some strange situations and details, such as the character being played by Vessela Dimitrova being called "Bailey Kent", despite her strong accent (and despite her, on one occasion, inexplicably change to * Spanish *!). <br /> Because of the decent start, I considered rating this movie as 5, but it really was more disappointing than that, so I only give 4.
