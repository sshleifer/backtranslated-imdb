This film features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. He also owns the always pleasant Larry Miller in a very small part. Despite this, I found it almost impossible to find. Michelle Monaghan may be beautiful but she is almost free charisma and the reasons for Downey's character obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way it is portrayed. The ending looks pretentious and although the intention seems to be that the audience joins the nod and blinks the film, not being able to put us next to their protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so. <br /> <br /> Film fans say that those who disagree simply "do not understand". I do not think so. The plot was not complicated or beyond understanding. It was simply not enveloping and clumsy and obviously fabricated. I Went Down, "by Guy Ritchie," Snatch "and" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, "are much better examples of the kind of footage the director Shane Black can not reach. <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but a look at his credits (mostly as a screenwriter) makes me want to disassociate myself from any other connection.
