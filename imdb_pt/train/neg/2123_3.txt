I go to UCSB and do some lessons with the executive producer, Alison Anders. She is an excellent teacher and principal, so whatever she put her name on, I thought it should be very good. This movie as a screening at the Santa Barbara film festival seemed like a good choice. <br /> <br /> Although this film included some cool and cinematic scenes, the lack of history and coherence really took away everything it was trying to do. accomplish. My main problem was that this was someone's first movie and you could obviously say it. Bad acting and an even worse script prevented this movie from getting off the ground. The soundtrack had a good song that gave a feeling that the main characters struggle to deal with the sadness that led to their departure and now returning to the place where he grew up. I just have to say that despite some of the best work in the movie, the lack of story and performance really did not make it any good.
