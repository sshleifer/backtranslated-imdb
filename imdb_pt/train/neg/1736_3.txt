Let me start by saying that I really liked Betty Grable, particularly "Down Argentine Way," but when she came to this disaster, she also had "round" and frankly the whole movie was an embarrassment. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been quite desperate) the story was bad, the colors good and the movie long. He had some of the old features like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try to stimulate interest, but to no avail. The score was unfortunate, and I have to say that no music was memorable ... as I was a fan of Miss. Grable, I've always wished I'd never seen this one!
