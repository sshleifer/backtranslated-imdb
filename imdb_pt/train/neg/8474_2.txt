The opening scenes move with the same fluidity of the frozen velveeta. The dramatic dialogue attempt only makes me want to have a better control of the fast forward control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexually intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost cub. I usually count a count of bodies, so there was a cat (which does not count) a tramp, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword in it (whatever it was) and then in the plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting an apple for a vampire to bite a victim is simply silly. I liked Warlock, but this movie was so bad we turned it off, and it was so forgettable that we rented it a year later to turn it off again.
