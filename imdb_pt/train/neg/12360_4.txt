Why would a person go back to a person who would kick her in the teeth, not once, not twice, but over and over again? <br /> <br /> This movie teaches us that in order to find love, we must accept abuse (not only forgive it but totally accept it). Shit! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. I was obviously not hugging my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> As the premiere of Bucatinsky's writing, there are many wonderful aspects in this film; however, to justify the meeting of Eli and Tom, further development of character would have been useful. We are never familiar with Eli's masochism; in fact, we are led to believe that he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is highly evident.
