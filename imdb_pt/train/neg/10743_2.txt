This movie is really bad, with a script full of 'memorable' lines and incredibly bad performances. The special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen too) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to believe it. Only two short themes (30 seconds or more) are repeated constantly throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In all, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
