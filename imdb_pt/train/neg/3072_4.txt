Margret Laurence probably did not intend to have any of his adopted novels for the movies, much less the Stone Angel. Hagar, as a character, was someone who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay who dares, anyone?), And ended up almost sacrificing his humanity in the process. The symbols in the book (the Stone Angel, Silver Wire, etc., etc.) are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and the new and the carnage (so to speak) along the way. <br /> <br /> While the film is fairly faithful to the plot of the book (but it's not really a kind of plot storytelling, is it?), I think it missed the point in capturing the spirit of the movie. Hagar's challenge (as a matter of challenge) was not there. Bram could have been much grander than portrayed, and Hagar's father might have been played more "traditionally", so to speak. If the filmmaker insisted on stronger portraits, the film would take the matter directly home. <br /> <br /> In the same vein, why should we see cell phones, organic products and other modernizations? We are trying to make some points to make some points (for example, the Muslim girlfriend and the native people). Agar and co. are all but politically correct in the book, so why should we see this in the film version? Upgrading may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using this as an excuse to send politically correct subliminal messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel (and the movie) seems to punch beneath the intellect. <br /> There is also the public. It seems that we were conditioned to see old and bitter people so cute and lovely. Why do you laugh every time Hagar has her tantrums? I doubt that Magaret Laurence wanted his readers to laugh, or with, Hagar. These people are frustrated and full of anguish, and all we do is laugh at them. I do not think Hagar and other people in your situation have any justice.
