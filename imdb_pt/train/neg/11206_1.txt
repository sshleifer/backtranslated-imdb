No one is more a fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser's papers than I am. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see now that Richard Lester directed the Royal Flash, since I also saw that he had done the Three / Four Musketeers. with Fraser that I thought it went well. <br /> <br /> Not so real. <br /> <br /> I was 12 when the movie was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since I had read all Flashman articles published until that time and was intoxicated with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel ( I still am, but he never had a chance after that). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment (I saw it again when I was about 20 on television and it looked even worse). <br /> <br /> None of the sharp dialogues in the books is transferred to the screen. The comedy of the Flashman character seemed to me to have been mismanaged in the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody that it would. The duel and fencing were terrible and not dramatic. Looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed to complete the possibilities of direct satire from earlier versions of the Prisoner of Zenda movie. <br /> If you have read the book and have not seen the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming friends and playing a game that Rudi has just invented: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about. <br /> <br /> My comments would be more direct if I had seen the movie more recently, but I'm glad I did not. If by some chance Fraser has read this, I can only say that I think he is a genius - perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but, based on my appreciation of this corpus of work, it is so hard to believe he wrote the screenplay for this movie, as he did all those terrible films of Roger Moore James Bond.
