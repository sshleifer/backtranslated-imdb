I have no idea what, on earth or beyond, could have made Sam Mraovich believe that this would be a worthy project. Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, I see no reason not to be in Bottom 100's # 1 position. For although I have not seen, for example, SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (# 5 at the time of this publication), I would venture to suppose that this movie is considerably better than that exuding injury, because even in its insipid desolation, at least Baby Genius 2 was done professionally. In contrast, everything, and I mean everything, in this movie is completely unprofessional. <br /> <br /> The film claims to be an attack on Christians' supposed intolerance and hatred toward gays. And I emphasize "intended." Not only does it fail completely and completely in its purpose, it also leaves an ugly scar. Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrayal of a gay couple's struggle against a society that largely opposes them, this creates weary and coarse stereotypes of each party involved. Ben and Arthur, the eponymous couple, are portrayed as two raw, sex-starved and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts that marry when laws change to allow them to do so. This is met by the opposition of Ben's brother, Victor, a Christian minister who, like all Christians (as this movie would make us believe), is tall, curious, stupid and violent. He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations with them expel him from the ministry. Just like in real life. And if you think it's terrible (it is), you have not seen it all. <br /> <br /> The actors (?) Here they can completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this film by saying their lines as if they were narrating a domestic comedy video from YouTube. But even Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando, like the title characters, could not have spared such a commotion, for there would still be the question of the completely empty, laughter-inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie. Each scene has at least one awkward or wrong citation. For example, in one scene, Victor tries to complain that he can not have nephews or nieces because of his brother's homosexuality. But instead of portraying this idea clearly, he spits out the stupid line, totally confused and sonic, "You know, I'll never have nieces or nephews, okay, because you're so f *** ED UP!" <br /> <br /> <br /> Even more glaring is the complete lack of production values. Yes, I know this is not the Dark Knight, but even amateur filmmakers should know some basics about special effects and editing. For example, six dots of red cake tincture are not enough for realistic bullet wounds. People do not teleport through a room between sockets. And objects do not fall forward when I shoot! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on Ben & Arthur. I do not care if you're 7, 17 or 107 years old. I do not care if you're gay, straight, bi or undecided. I do not care if you're "just curious". I do not care what pathetic reason you have to be tempted to buy this dung heap. Stay away, far away. The only redeeming quality of this movie is its ability to be used as a Frisbee.
