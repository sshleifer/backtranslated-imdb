This should be re-titled "The Curious Case of Unscrupulous Filmmakers Who Misrepresented a Non-Terroristic Snoring as a Shock Film." It's a long, boring story of a trot of brotherhood, a joke so transparent that even Flounder from Delta House could see through it. Jeff East, an actor in the debt repayment stage, can be forgiven for taking whatever job he could get. The same can not be said of Charles Martin Smith, who previously acted in heavyweights like George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape but fortunately it does not come out on DVD. The garbage misrepresented like this belongs to a landfill and nowhere else.
