Daraar got off to a good start. The first scene really left me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Other than that, the first half of the movie is a total of BORE. The first half of the movie is about Rishi Kapoor falling in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think he's a little old for her? <br /> <br /> Things start to spice up the middle of the movie, when Juhi tells us about her former husband; and wow how lunatic is it! He was a super-protective, pure freak with a really HOT TEMPER! He used to beat poor Juhi without a good reason! One of the reasons I really do not like this movie is because I can not stand to see Juhi (my favorite actress) be so abused. This movie in general has a lot of abuse and bloodshed; I think it's so sick !!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, all I'm trying to say is that if you're thinking of renting the Daraar, you should put it back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else!
