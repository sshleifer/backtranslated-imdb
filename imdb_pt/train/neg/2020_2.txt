This looks like two movies: a long, dark, pretentious saga about an actor who is taken by the parts he plays; the other a brilliant social commentary on a middle-aged divorce that is picked up by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business next door. She gives heavy advice on the need for connections, her certificate in massage and her desire to get into the modeling game. I love the glimpse of his decadent apartment with a kitchenette behind a curtain and his hideous and seductive outfit of a crocheted top with snubby sleeves revealing a belly button. <br /> <br /> Do actors get Oscar for Shakespeare? We know they are the Oscars for impersonating people with disabilities, using many prostheses, or pretending to be insane. The scenes of Shakespeare (which are ON and ON) are embarrassing and dated. And so are the scenes of 'going crazy', where Tony seems distracted while he hears his own voice. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, Anthony John is not aristocratic. He makes it very clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy. When he quotes his father's advice, he goes into a cockney accent.
