I watched this movie last night in anticipation, but I really was not too impressed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of 'Combo', I thought the acting was bad and the narrative was limited. It was like a drama "made for TV". <br /> <br /> I felt the film was very invented. The whole set of hammering in context at the beginning (yes, we understand that this is Britain from the 80s - you can stop now) was tiring, and gave a very one-sided view of what life was like in Britain in the years 80 - Poverty, war juxtaposed with royalty, Margaret Thatcher, but nothing between the two? In fact, there were middle classes that existed at the time - just ordinary workers, with a decent salary and a mortgage. The Falkland clips also seemed to be randomly added at the end, by "dramatic effect," I presume. The sequence of events seemed a bit disconnected, as the characters moved one action to the next without us seeing how their mentality could have changed so quickly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' was to bend the fingers. I could not even look through the mess scene. I find it very difficult to believe that she would have been attracted to a boy who was not only much younger but also seemed much younger. I know there were only four years between them, but four years are nothing when you reach your twenties, but it's a huge difference in your teenage years! In my experience, this kind of difference between teens only occurs when the girl is the youngest, since girls mature much faster and are longer in the wavelength of boys a few years older. Sorry, but I did not buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for the shock value. <br /> <br /> The ending was rather abrupt and, again, planned. If the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic, then it fell a little in my eyes. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that British films only concern themselves with the higher classes or with poverty. Do not get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charms, but can not we Brits with something different? Why are our movies always so disconnected in the class system? I was born in 1973, so it was not much different in age to 'Shaun' would have been in 1983. I grew up in a single parent family on a board estate quite trodden in a town in England. However, my childhood experiences were very different from those portrayed in the film - I do not even remember racism being a problem (although I'm not saying it did not exist). "This is England"? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The point is that I felt that this film had no substance, and I was completely bored and unimpressed.
