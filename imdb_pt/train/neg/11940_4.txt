Well, I would be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spider-Man or Batman movies. Still, it was more appealing to me for its moral value. I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and since he used credit cards to fund his first movie, "Hollywood Shuffle." True, he needs to harness the talent and expertise of technical advisors to make movies more believable, but his films are still fun. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man offers a hero with a contemporary urban air. I always felt that if there were superheroes, they would not provide the same scenarios described in the comics. Meteor Man is a realistic hero with real problems: car invaded, bad neighborhood, local drug trafficking gangs that use children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission remained practically within the community. What I considered truly entertaining, out of James Earl Jones' "youth forever" performance, was how the neighborhood responded to its newly discovered powers. It was not long before they had a full schedule for him, without his contribution, of course. It was hilarious to hear them volunteering to lend to other communities where their families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was weak, the film was predictable, there was poor acting and continuity was rotten, but it ranks first with my kids. Robert Townsend works to bring home movies, so to speak. I doubt he is truly recognized as the talented actor / producer / director he really is, but there are and will always be those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> One point to ponder about the film, which I find amusing: Throughout the battle with Simon, no one bothered to call the police ???? Also, what mother and father do you know will watch your child fight from a window? My mother would be right there, crawling by my side, equally. Dad would be carrying his pistol. lol <br /> <br /> Rent and check. Worth seeing at least once and good for those who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Great job with the special guest roles Robert!
