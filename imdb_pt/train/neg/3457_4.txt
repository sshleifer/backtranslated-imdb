This movie was made and released from my hometown. I remember the scream about it and all the turmoil about Molly Ringwald being in town ... <br /> <br /> Plot ... <br /> <br /> Essentially, 20 years after a film has been released to rest "unfinished, a group of film students decided to complete it - with dire consequences.It seems that someone does not want the film to be completed. <br /> <br /> The plot is fragile. I need to remember that this is a comedy and therefore needs to be touched a bit on the cheek but it had no real strength.The characters are mostly transperant and the little information you get about them that you do not care about seems irrelevant. to hear Kylie's accent as an Australian again and good to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role.Â But that does not redeem the movie.Â God knows why the makers thought they would get into Molly Ringwald.Â Maybe due to nature of the movie (it's a kind of man act to the movies of the 80s / bad horror films), but in fact an Australian actor would have done well. <br /> <br /> With regard to the cast, many the acting seemed constipated. Some of these children (especially the two main chic - they played "director" and "producer") seemed to be trying to act. This is never a good look. In addition, the shots had an unpleasant feel about them. Brighter perhaps? Just not as smooth as one is accustomed to. <br /> <br /> The killer. Sir. Could it be less scary? There are some shock factors, and some coarse scenes. I liked the movie, but it was not great. It was for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. Maybe if they had tightened the script, it would have been better. They killed many characters - but there is nothing real for them to be killed. Maybe if they had killed fewer people and really focused on a scary atmosphere, it would have been better. <br /> <br /> Now I know it's a comedy and the elements are funny. Or so unbelievable that they were funny. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
