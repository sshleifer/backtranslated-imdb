Did anyone read the script? This has to be one of the worst writings and direction of the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson, could not do that. About two-thirds looked like Giamatti's eyes were saying, I can not believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the very bad list of Christmas movies. There are not enough lines, but what else can be said? Okay, the movie just does not move with Vaughn's dialogue, your character is just a scary guy you just can not get through. It was just a dull ride, which no one seemed to be able to get into.
