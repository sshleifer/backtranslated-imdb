After reading another review, I thought this movie would be really good. I like the "B" movies, but this could not even be classified as such. Photography is probably the only decent thing in the middle of the movie. But the edition left a lot to be desired. It was very busy and staccato. Whoever chose music and sound did a terrible job. The music was horrible, especially anything atmospheric or scene scenery. If the acting had been better, they could have taken the film. Unfortunately, I've seen better acting in porn movies. If you want to see a vampire movie "B", check out "Blood Ties". You will be much more entertained.
