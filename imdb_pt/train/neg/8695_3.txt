Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all the ADA Law and Order and her acting is even worse here. His Texan accent attempts are amateurish and unrealistic. Nor can he properly summon the intense emotions necessary to play the mother of a kidnapped child; Sometimes, while her daughter is missing, she may sound vaguely annoyed, as if she can not remember where she left the keys. <br /> <br /> This is a true and important story, so it's a shame that the terrible actress of the main actress distracts so much the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they just can not get over Rohm's tendency to simply impose a particularly thick imitation of a Southern accent whenever real acting is needed.
