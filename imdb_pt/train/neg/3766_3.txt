I went to watch this movie knowing that it would not be great. but what I witnessed was terrible for words. I do not want to be hard, it's just the movie was terrible. on the whole it was bad, I mean AWFUL special effects, the acting was not so bad, but it was not good either, and Sasquatch himself was like ... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion, the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Henderson. is not violent or horror, but has the best representation of sasquatch. at least it's a little cgi suit and not a bit-off rip-off. just watch this movie if you are desperate, or really enjoy someone in the movie. or go and watch the saints boondock, is MUCH better.
