This movie looked good - good cast, evergreen theme and an explosive opening. He went down the hill there. Why was it shot by hand camera? It shakes, shakes, captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. A bad choice, in fact. As if that were not enough, the worst memory edition assumes a stoned spectator - mandatory if you want to have some enjoyment with it. And then you commit the worst sin of all. After taking the viewer to all kinds of improbable and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they issue credits without revealing the outcome - the end - the reward - what the hell was the motive? How can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an end? Doh! This film was very promising and ended up making a plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. Bad effort by writer and director.
