This British / Spanish co-production full of stars looks great, which you can see. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly cut, so badly it looks like the buildings are having conversations with each other. Few films suffer as much pan and scan as this one, since director Robert Parrish seems to have become so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once, neglecting the medium. Another user comments that we see all the inhabitants of a church slaughtered at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles, a Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrate, and that's it. We never find out why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas), although I suspect he has been called to live in Kojak, since his departure seems arbitrary. And there's a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing in a felt hat and barely dressed in the grand old tradition of the English music hall to the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here, but with some lyrics that I've never heard before. On the positive side, the location is great, a huge, ancient ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs leading nowhere, a pleasant setting - Robert Shaw and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I really did not like this movie, but I did not exactly see it. I'll look for the widescreen version and make my decision then.
