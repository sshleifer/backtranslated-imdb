This movie is not devoid of charm and also shows a little warmth, but ultimately this effort is very vain and strongly focused on leads. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen time, but she takes much of the limelight from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the overload of the script with clich√©s. The daughter who secretly leaves college, an older woman finds it difficult to get a good job (and first ends up with a rather humiliating job), the despicable network executive with his executive toys that prefer the shine to the substance, the journalist who adheres No there is nothing really wrong with any of them, that is, they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are too much and leave us with much deja-vu and few surprises.
