If I had checked the IMDb before renting this Netflix DVD, I would have a few hours of my life back. I'm frankly suspicious when I see that the director of a movie also wrote. In this case, according to the credits, the same face was "writter and director" - unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (for example, Judy Tenuta's scene reminded of her old comedy routines announcing Judy-ism) that led me to classify these two stars instead of one. Those moments, however, were few and far between ... and I could hardly see them because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in their violence. I admit that I came back to watch that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me find out once I had seen the whole thing. No, although I at least recognize who the characters were that would become important later. The "rotating camera" technique was overused and essentially meaningless. I found myself talking on the TV screen: "What?!?" or "For God's sake, keep it up!" Not recommended.
