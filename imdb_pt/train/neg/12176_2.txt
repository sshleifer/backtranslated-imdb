The original Trancers is by no means a great movie. It had huge holes and very little in terms of internal logic. However, it was fun, better done than most low budget B movies, and could be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, Trancers II is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Trancers II suffers from many of the same problems as most flop sequences. The plot is thin enough to see and the writing is insipid. It seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces from the first movie back would be enough, and did not care about anything else. Not even veteran B-level actors, like Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs, have managed to get this movie out of the trash. <br /> <br /> A brief overview: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a future cop who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of the members of his government. Trancers II occurs six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), the woman he met in the first film, and both live with Hap Ashby, the man Deth was sent to the past to protect. It turned out that Whistler's brother (the villain of the first film) traveled back in time to create an army of Trancers, people turned into irrational murderous zombies, to kill Ashby. Complicating Jack's mission is the fact that his first wife, who died long before Jack traveled to the past, was also sent back to stop Whistler's brother, and now Jack finds himself working with her. <br /> <br /> Two real problems with this movie. One is that the method of creating Trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie. What makes it annoying is that, in a rather poor example of Soviet Revisionism, they act as if it were always the technique. <br /> <br /> Another thing that bothers me is that the love triangle between Deth, Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) gets very little time on the screen. This particularly bothered me because it was so much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie. It looked like it was just something that was thrown to fill the space in the movie. Alice's character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to discover that he has remarried, making her very shallow or very poorly written. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think to watch this movie is if you are interested in watching the entire Trancers series (currently totaling six movies). Otherwise, even if you're a fan of the original Trancers, stay away from that warm sequence.
