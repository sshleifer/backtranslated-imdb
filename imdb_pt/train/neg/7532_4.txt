Something I really love about the short films of this woman was the blurring of the theme - especially in "Living with Happiness." This movie has some good beginnings - unusual location and potential for a strange cinematic treatment, but it can not succeed with clumsy expository dialogue, jagged performances and lots of TV coverage. <br /> <br /> It is again lovely television and very ordinary cinema. The ideas are so deep that they almost look like a television commercial. But the feeling is good so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I would really love to see this director do a complete animation and try to work with a producer who does not demand too boring. clarity.
