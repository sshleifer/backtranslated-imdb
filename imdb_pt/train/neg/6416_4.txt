SOME NON-SPOILY SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> Why do people, when they are disoriented or sick or scared in a club, cut the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in their right mind would hide under the bed when someone invaded your room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a stranger's door, and when you do not answer IMMEDIATELY do you open the door, come in, yell some hello and then start to examine their stuff? <br /> <br /> If you were being chased by someone you just discovered was a killer, what would you do? Silently sneak and hide under a wooden platform or between metal instruments? Run, silently, to an old barn or other decrepit structure? <br /> <br /> I could be talking about almost every thriller that has come up in recent years, but since this is the "Return" page, obviously I'm talking about "The Return". I saw him for free because I work in a movie theater and I make a point of showing all the "scary" movies. I thought this was tolerable ... beyond the clich√©s worn. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really monotonous and looks kind of "Huh?" during most of the film. The details of the plot are slowly spreading as the movie progresses and it's almost enough to make it interesting except that there was not enough explanation as it moved and so I was almost lost until the last 2/3 of it. <Br /> <br /> If you are a thriller fan, it is worth seeing at least once. If there is nothing better in the theater and you really want to watch a movie, I think it's worth a matinee ticket. If you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can not wait ... wait.
