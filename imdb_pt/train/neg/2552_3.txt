This is listed as a documentary, is not it, is filmed as a documentary, but I suspect it was only because they fled with a shaky camera and filthy filming. This has just been released in the UK on DVD as an "American-style comedy Pie", not that too. <br /> <br /> Basically follows a group of teenagers on spring break as they go to Mexico for cheap drinks and with the mission to get there virgin friend finally placed. Throw is a dwarf couple, also on the same type of quest, and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunken teenagers trying to get some girls. <br /> <br /> Considering the 18 rating this has very little nudity, and virtually zero sex scenes, mostly I think the rating is for profanity of which there are plenty. <br /> <br /> If you like raw Jackass behavior without the humor then this might be your thing, if you have brain cells left then I would probably avoid it!
