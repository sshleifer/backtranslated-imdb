I grew up with scooby (mean the reruns of where you are) I hate scrappy, I love Daphne, and feel like it's not complete without the whole gang. But that's sad, Scooby Doo is mystery solving comedy-it's not bad Japanese spy anime. I like "what's new", they had to give Daphne some danger at some point :( and try to lose the * sex * drug jokes of many generations, but this "get a clue" is flat out crap and should not have Scooby's name attached They even tried to do something punk with the theme song Now I'm going to watch my Scooby Doo DVD Where are you to wash away the dirt from this new series of my eyes?
