The script is cool.Although the cast is absolutely unusable.There is no style. the costumes do not look like some of the High Highbury society. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale, I can only say that Beckinsale speaks British English better than Paltrow, although in Paltrow's acting it is the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam is undoubtedly the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all clever and callous like Mr. Knightley in the TV version. P.S. The viewer can not see anything Mr. Elton-Ms. The development of Smith's relationship as it was in the motion version, so it can not be understood where all of Emma's attempt to make a departure from Elton-Smith (beyond the picture) was.
