Ok, I will not criticize this movie in depth. I take note of the many complimentary critiques that preceded me, and, as I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I hesitated for a long time to make a disparaging comment - and thus almost a year passed. But every time I see that DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner moan. Anyway, let the complimentary voices overlap with me! But for other moviegoers like me - be careful. <br /> <br /> Expressed in the simplest and most gentle terms, here is my position: <br /> <br /> The political turmoil and the collapse providing the background for this film also served as a setting for one certain period of my life - through the daily newspapers I read in my local Central European pub. At that time, I followed the news, but I never understood what was happening. Reporters tended to report on non-partisan terms, or with a conservatism that disapproved of any groups that disturbed peace or fomented rebellion against the establishment. These were the times when other winds of uneasiness spread through Paris, Berlin, Prague, and several places in the United States, all of whose problems I clearly understood at the time - but dictatorship or not, my newspapers tended to treat the government of Portugal simply as the establishment - not as an "evil empire," to use irreverent Star Wars terms. <br /> <br /> So, week after week, I read about riots, but I never found an intelligent editorial that could provide the story behind them, or evaluate the socioeconomic practices and impacts of the dictatorship, etc. <br /> <br /> So when buying this movie, I had at least two hopes: to finally understand the details that have led to social unrest and enjoy a well-designed drama. This movie did not give me any. <br /> <br /> The film assumes that viewers already have broad knowledge and deep emotions about historical facts. And the drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the film industry of Portugal, but - was banal and superficial. <br /> <br /> I got my copy of the DVD from France - "Official Selection Cannes 2000 - Un Certain Regard". The box shows well shaved actors smiling, the lead giving the victory signal in a way that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny. After seeing the work, I wondered what the French might have thought of him - although, as a superficial piece of "verite cinema" with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand his natural inclination to praise him for his "honesty" but ... <br /> Look at the back of the box: "Un consider chaleuruex sur la Revolution" - a warm respect? Try to describe Allende's downfall and murder with a "fondness"! Experiment with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Experiment with the whole line of felling and civilian rebellion! <br /> <br /> Another comment: Maria de Medeiros a renoue 'with the son paid, son enfance et son histoire. In Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities, but my love for a city and a country does not give way to an empty movie.I'm going to grab the old VHS tapes of Capas Negras and The Lisbon Song - meanwhile, I'm stuck in a zone 2 by the title above, which may well go to waste.
