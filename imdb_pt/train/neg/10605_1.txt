This was a heinous waste of my time. No plot. The performance was so below average that it should be used as an example in acting classes than NOT to do. It is merely a commercial steal from the previous Universal Soldier, who also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel. It is sad that you need to assert your ego every few years, and even more sad that people pay good money to sit through it. This type of schlock gives a bad name to martial arts films. By comparison, it makes Segall, Norris, and Arnold seem almost talented. <br /> <br /> Maybe you should get the Leslie Nielson track and reminiscence of your genre. At least then we could be laughing at him instead of him.
