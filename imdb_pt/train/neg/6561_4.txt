The opening sequence should show the Legion arriving in Paris on November 13, 1918. Troops piled the train - wearing the uniform in which the French army, including the Legion, set out for the war in 1914! This is a sure sign that the war movie you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French army realized in 1915 that the war in red pants and dark blue overcoats was not working. French metropolitan troops were placed on "blue horizon" and colonial troops were placed in khaki.) Claude Van-Damme (sp?) Remake at least it has the more or less certain uniforms. It really sucks when directors make that kind of mistake when they struggle to get things right.
