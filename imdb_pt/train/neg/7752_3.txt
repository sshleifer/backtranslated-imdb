The movie is about a sabretooth about losing at an amusement park where teens are on a hunt. As there are no rules, they enter a building and begin to be killed. The killings are cheesy and dumb. But at least it had better effects than the sabertooth. I gave three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth. I thought everything was fine, but some deaths were off screen. There was a stupid scene in which the two teenagers kiss and the head of the saber goes out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind, leaving her with a totally false red appearance. Then the saber rises in the openings and bites the children. The final death with the owner was totally false looking for charts. Even that death was stupid because the tooth of statues went through his mouth and hangs over how it will support it and there is a scene when a gothic girl loses her contacts does not find them, and it seems like she does not need it. The movie is stupid and a waste of time.
