I loved the original horror movie. I'm a big parody fan, it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes considered as the most intelligent form of humor. Wayans' boys seemed to perfectly understand this concept in the original film, and then temporarily forgot about it as they continued. I think the Wayans are a family of comic geniuses. Even geniuses make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with promise. I liked the parody of "Exorcist", especially the joke "Come out, ma". Now, this is Wayans quality material. But besides, I can only think of two other times when I laugh: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, she gets sticky and starts talking about marriage to him. Meanwhile, he's saying, "It was just a loot!" That was kind of funny. 2) The parody "Save the Last Dance", where the character Cindy inadvertently beats a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the short-lived laughs are no match for the laughs of the first horror film. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pure junk, full of cheap gross jokes. Jokes from the first film that were subtle or implied are magnified and exaggerated. For example, in Scary Movie I, several insinuations are made to suggest that the character Ray is gay. That was hilarious. But in Scary Movie II, the whole scene of Ray's strangulation under the bed was numbing and incredibly bland. This is the standard of the whole movie. Shock humor * alone * does not take a movie too far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> As much as it hurts me to rate a Wayans movie so low, I have to give this one a 2 out of 10.
