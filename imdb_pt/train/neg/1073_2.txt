I can not believe how much talent can be wasted on a movie! The Gingerbread Man begins on the right foot and manages to create great expectations for the end. But at some point the film turns into one of the worst stories I've ever wasted my time. It's as unbelievable as the spellbound Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branagh's character through his nose. The movie's climax is as unattractive and boring as a beer, which has been left in the sun for a long time. The Gingerbread Man is probably Grisham's worst movie of all time and this is not altered by the fact that talented stars fill the film. Do not waste your time here!
