STAR NOTE: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The long-time prisoner Twitch (Kurupt) is transferred to a prison more difficult than the reopened Alcatraz. He claims to be closer to his lady, but his real motives are a little grander. There he crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg), a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is so open-mouthed and almost the same. But there is a gang war between black and Hispanic prisoners who explodes in a hostile takeover of the jail when the leader of the black gang is killed and the finger points to Burke. But what really impresses the fan when the real killer and leader of the Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes to Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter as a hostage. Steven Seagal does not make sequels (supposedly much opposed to the idea of ​​Under Siege 2 and only agreeing to do so under the condition that the film company he was at the time would leave his own film), despite to be a DVD sequel, the lead role this time goes to Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear on some of the filming of the first movie that appears at the end.) But there's a reason he has not done much work since Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor, and he's also not much of an action star, managing a character who starts out as too somber and gloomy, but without subtlety he turns into a standard action hero clumsily making fun of on one side. Support wise, veterans of the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, simply grabbed the chance for extra work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that tried to copy the original style very well. dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing a lot. It does so well, unfortunately it can not compete with an uncompromising hero, an equally cardiac villain and an apathetic storyline that the makers seem to have invented throughout the process. **
