Before I saw this, I had seen some very bad Christmas movies. But once I saw this, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a cheerful film about Santa Claus helping some kids, but he almost feels like watching demonic. Santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is replaced by a malevolent, demonic chuckle that sure has taken a lot of kids out of Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits in with all the performances and dialogues. Santa lives high on Earth at the North Pole, where he and children from around the world prepare for Christmas. But Santa Claus has an enemy named Pitch or Satan. Pitch tries to ruin Santa's Christmas by making three disobedient boys and creating amusements, like tinkering in the chimney and letting the knob warm. When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog, it is up to Santa's helper Pedro and Merlin, the magician, to get Santa out of that pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie, besides being absolutely bad, is so bizarre. Satan dances a lot and he seems much happier than Santa Claus. Santa Claus talks about delivering gifts to all boys and girls, but he seems to deliver only 5 children's homes in Mexico. Reindeer are toys for the wind, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm amazed that it does not bring tears to the child's eyes ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are simply Santa Claus playing the organ while the children sing to him. Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa throwing Pitch in the butt with a mini cannon and loudly laughing about it while Pitch dance of pain. I think it's better for parents to tell little kids where babies come from than to show them that. The only good point is that you will laugh hysterically if you can enjoy bad movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 min.
