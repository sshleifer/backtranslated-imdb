The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to catch up with "The man who went to death," "All over the house," and "Dig that cat, it really is gone." <br /> <br /> This episode is about a couple who have just married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for his money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandoned mansion. Charles soon discovers a secret from Peggy's family ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you should watch this episode, but do not expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes of the first season.
