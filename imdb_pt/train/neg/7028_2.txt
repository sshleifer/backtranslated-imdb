Somewhere between Food Court and Zip's, the mall in this movie has an explosives store. This is the only place where the title character <br /> <br /> can buy the bomb he plants in the mall in the gloomy end. <br /> <br /> A fictitious town has a new mall, built on some land. this was condemned. Cute Girl (I did not get her name) got a job as a waitress there. She lost her boyfriend in a fire where the mall is. The evil owner of the mall hires the arsonist responsible for the fire as security after his first security guard ends up dead. Rob Estes, eons before "Silk Stalkings", is a photographer / reporter trying to find a story. He hooks up with Cute Girl, and his "funny" friend Pauly Shore, and tries to find out if Eric is still alive. He is living in the basement of the mall and traveling through the air ducts and pushing different people who upset his ex-girlfriend, including the arsonist. Eventually he kidnaps her <br /> <br /> and the end involves the bomb and everyone running from the scene <br /> <br /> before the big kablooey. Morgan Fairchild is on the walk <br /> <br /> as mayor ... yes, she is the mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course you probably did not need a plot outline since the full story <br /> is in the title. Someone named Eric is taking revenge on people like a ghost from a mall. It also means there is no suspense. We know that Eric is behind this, but we still have to see <br /> <br /> These and Cute Girl go through a silly investigation. <br /> <br /> Watch as Fairchild, who we know has been in collusion with the owner of the mall all the time, pull a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of a crowded party, but no one says a word as she takes them to your office, and your eventual death. The fictional city is huge, even though a police officer has never been called, everyone relies on the safety of the mall to ask. <br /> <br /> Eric has been hiding since the mall was built, but I'm not sure <br /> <br /> where. He seems to live in a basement area, but you'd think some construction worker would have found him. He also provided his love block very well, and found some outlets, since he has electricity. It may be better than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Pauly Shore fans, you two, take note. He tricks a security guard out of his booth while dreaming about the camera. Yes, stop scanning <br /> <br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl is where you can see a grainy black and white photo of Pauly's south coast, though there are none. <br /> <br /> This is just rubbish, and a positive proof that I'm willing to rent just <br /> <br /> about anything in the store to stay in the horror section. This movie is not Eric's revenge, it's the revenge of the filmmaker for me being stupid enough to watch it. Here is my revenge: I do not recommend it. This will show them! <br /> <br /> This is assessed (R) for physical violence, armed violence, violence, <br /> <br /> some profanity, female nudity, brief male nudity, and some sexual content.
