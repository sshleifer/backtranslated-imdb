Endings Twist can be really cool in a movie. It's especially interesting when the turnaround is right in front of our eyes, but we just do not pay attention. This kind of finalization is what makes people think. So we have twists and turns like this movie has. Twist so that even if you pay attention, you have no idea what's going to happen. When they reveal this kind of random twist, rather than shock, it is somewhat a dumb reaction. This movie starts off as an interesting horror scene, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing more than a boring dialogue and a stupid twist. <br /> <br /> Three young women go to a concert, so they get lost traveling through the forest and crashing into a tree trunk. They end up at the home of a scary old woman, who hates men, and are greeted by her homely daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange occasions happen when these girls stay home for several days, instead of trying to get out or get home, and suspense turns into an idiot. <br /> <br /> This movie is very involved in dialogues, and is always between only a few characters. We have the three main girls, the chilling maiden and the old lady, and the conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything of interest to say. It's really maddening sitting in their conversations. We want to know what's going on and instead they just talk, talk and talk (about nothing). <br /> <br /> The holes of ground are abundant here. The house these girls stay in when they get into the car crash seems to be three miles from anywhere ... wow, three miles! A walk of two hours or less will kill them. Why did not they take a ride with the worker to this house that was driving to the city? Did he have a seat? How come these girls never ask to leave and simply go willingly, rarely even checking each other? Why does this have to have so many twists? Maybe the answers are in the boring script. <br /> <br /> Having a horror movie with five characters is really a bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary, and the end is definitely out there, but undoubtedly dumb. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 79 min. R for nudity and violence.
