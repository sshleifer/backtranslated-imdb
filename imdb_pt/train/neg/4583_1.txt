If you want to see a philosophical and intelligent discussion of human possibility and potential, look at "Waking Life," which is brilliant. "What the # $ * We We Know" is everywhere in its focus, misdirected, poorly written, misinterpreted, totally devoid of any art direction and completely boring. It was neither thoughtful nor amused at all. The inclusion of this "Ramtha" aberration in this film is reason enough to avoid it. Is not it strange how filmmakers choose to look at the fact that this woman loves some 2,000-year-old Atlantis god or something? What a flake that old girl is, and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. The people responsible for this movie should not be allowed to do another movie again.
