Could this be from the same director as Do not Look Now or Bad Timing? Evil, agitated, clumsy. You just need to compare the various accident scenes with other similar ones in Do not Look Now to see how much Roeg has lost its touch. Even the generally trustworthy Teresa Russell (looking a bit heavy nowadays, I'm afraid to report) can not save that. The plot is pure pseudo-religious hokum, the acting is wood and Roeg's attempts at his trademark of time shift are regrettable. <br /> Avoid this like the plague.
