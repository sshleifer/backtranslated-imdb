Lolita is a rebel and will share with our eyes open some small stories of sex, between science fiction and fantasy ... Well, this production of Surrender Cinema is not very good: very bad acting, horrifying music and a plot without any story and any line. BUT, the sex scenes are very well done, many lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax, offers us a great and final hot strip show. Just for Lovell fans.
