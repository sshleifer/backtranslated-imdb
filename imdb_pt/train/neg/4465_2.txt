After the overrated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films have spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror films. The result is all in films like El segundo nombre, a production similar to that of badly written TV, but acted and directed even worse. I did not read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I am sure that the author of The Doll Your Mother Wants Had Not Much In Common With This Terrible Production. Avoid at any cost unless you are looking for a quiet night's sleep in a new movie theater. 2/10
