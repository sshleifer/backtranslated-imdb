I saw this last week after getting the cheap DVD. I wanted to see him for centuries, finding the plot to be very intriguing. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought the lead actor was very flat. This kind of play required a performance like Johny Depp's in The Ninth Gate (of which this is almost a complete rip-off), but I do not think TV budgets often extend to this kind of acting skill. <br /> I also thought the direction was confusing and monotonous, just to remind me that Carpenter did not make a decent movie since In the Bouth of Madness. As for history - well, I was disappointed too! There was no way to satisfy my expectation, but I thought the payoff and explanation were bad, and the way he finally got the anti-climatic film to say the least. <br /> <br /> This was written by one of the main contributors to AICN, and you might say that he loves his cinema, but I would have liked a better result from such a good premise. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD back to the store. same day!
