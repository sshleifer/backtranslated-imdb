Considering that the original version of the movie 'The Haunting' is in my ten films of all time, I approached this adaptation with fear. I was right to be cautious because this movie is a poorly written and poorly executed work. The original was terrifying to me as a child for a reason! You do not see anything. Robert Wise used innovative camera and superb lighting to generate fear and that's why it works. The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to go from A to B, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different.This film should be seen just as an example of studio butchery!
