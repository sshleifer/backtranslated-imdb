If you ask me, the first one was actually better. Look at Sarah M.Ge, she's a cruel and cruel girl, look at Amy Adams, she's just an idiot out there. She is nothing! People do not love it! Second, Sebastian was cute and hot in the first movie, now he is "baby face". The story is not so good, and I do not understand. Why they did not do it first, is the beginning. Loose actors, nothing with history. This is not cruel, that's playing. The first has better actors, better story and its average. I think music is better at cruel intentions and music is better at cruel intentions. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but compared to the first, it's a big, big, nothing big.
