While the 3-D animation (the highlight of the show) did its job well, most of the other elements dropped. It was as if the filmmakers thought "well, it's going to be 3-D, so we do not have to work so hard on plot or character development." And the fact that it's a children's movie is absolutely no excuse. The audience is attracted to three-dimensional characters (Shrek, the father of Nemo) as much as they are drawn to three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that any of the main characters has shown was two-dimensional Scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? The appearance of Buzz Aldrin at the end (after watching a very robotic comic version of the same historical figure for an hour and a half) appears on the screen and spoils the good time of everyone calling the main characters of the film "contaminants" and announcing that the situation on the screen was really an impossibility. <br /> <br /> ??? ??? ??? You just want to tell the kids that the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus do not exist while you're at it?
