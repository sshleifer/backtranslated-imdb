I should put up an alert saying that the movie should not be seen. He fails in an adequate tribute in such a magnificent way that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect was horrible, I did not expect the director's total failure to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun that normally fire at a rate of 600 shots per minute at 1/10 speed? How can soldiers fall when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells from a distance of up to six meters? How do artillery shells fall only on both sides of the road and not on the road itself? <br /> <br /> Not only did this disrespect for armament disturb me, it was the clichéd situations and the incongruity of the dialogues that made me scream murder. There were the standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan for Hindustaan ​​ha ha and LOC cross mat karo ye mere hukum hai. Stupid to say the least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De wrote is true. The director worked without a script and shows. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It's just a gunfight after the next, with no connection to the general scheme of war. The explanatory scenes are terrible. The army chief seems unconvincing. To make things worse, the theater staff had indiscriminately cut out the footage to fit the four-hour film into three hours.
