Grumpy directing, bland comedy that supposedly fakes the "classic" "alien invasion" movies of the 50s, but in fact is no better than them, except, of course, in the purely technical department (good makeup effects) . And any parody that is worse than its target is doomed to failure ("Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" is worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours listening to the strident voices of the aliens, you will be begging for some peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
