How unfortunate, having so many of my "a" list, and good list of "b" actors agree to make this movie, but they did, and that's what sucked me in watching it. I had never heard of this movie, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. on the cover of the DVD, and James Woods deep down how bad can it be? In a word too! This movie starts o.k. has some twists and turns, so just lay an egg. The ending was so weak, it was as if the writer was called and his 4-year-old son sat on the writer and cut the end. How ironic for a movie titled "The End Game" to have such a poor one. These are the types of movies that can move "a" list of actors to the "b" list in a hurry. I hope Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods do not make it a habit.
