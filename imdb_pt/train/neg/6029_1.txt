If you're wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas come from about the UN, Israel and international affairs, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not a supernatural Hollywood movie based biblical passage. Instead, this film was made by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. As a film, the end result sometimes looks more like clips from a televangelism program (complete with familiar prayers and light breaking through the church windows while the harps play). <br /> <br /> For most important viewers, it may be. It's hard to believe, but many people believe it literally as presented in the film. And that, perhaps, makes the movie important. You probably will not find a more concise exposition of the bizarre visions of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So if you visualize it, visualize it as a social / cultural document. If you are a media expert, you do not have to be warned about any serious propaganda and manipulation attempts in the film.
