I was also intrigued by the high rating (8.5) for this movie, and I was very disappointed. I had just watched two good foreign films and was eager to make three hits, but it was not to be. I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same way. There is not much of a plot, if there is one. I do not necessarily need that in a movie, but it needs to somehow entertain me or bring me. The best I can say is that it aspires to be an Altman movie, albeit with an extremely small set. Of course, there are moments, but some moments are easily reduced by 97 minutes slow of nothing. I do not understand the high rating for this movie. I give a 3. <br /> <br />
