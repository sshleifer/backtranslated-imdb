It's hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best science fiction series ever, topping the spotlight. Nine years later, he is almost forgotten, and his attempts to do so on the big screen have failed miserably. I can not even explain why, he's a fair-minded actor, but probably his moment of fame put him in an eternal role that takes great talent to break. <br /> <br /> At the same time Angelina Jolie was much less known and she was very lucky that a film like 'Playing God' did not lead her career to a dead end. Fortunately for her, 'The Bone Collector' and 'Girl, Interrupted' were waiting around the corner, and when Lara Croft arrived, her career was launched. <br /> <br /> There is not much to be said about it. movie. It's Andy Wilson's only big-screen movie, and there must be a reason. Everything is banal and most of what happens on the screen is expected in this story of a former doctor who saves the life of a victim from shots in a bar and finds himself working for the mob. The off-screen voice is especially bad, with a moralistic text that kills any cinematic experience film tone. You probably will not know the movie, but in DVD rental or on TV. Try to look for something better.
