I just finished this movie ... I saw it on the video shelf and being a fan of Nick Stahl I just had to rent it. In all honesty, I probably should have stayed on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were several pretty smart twists, but somehow I guessed almost all of them before they showed up. And the movie went a little too far after all, in my opinion ... if you have to suffer from the preview, you'll see what I mean! <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Nick Stahl's performance was great (especially considering what he had to work on). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same type of character ... very Paul Finch, from "American Pie", to my liking. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst part of this movie has to be the emotionless performance of January Jones ... I think a pretty face is really all that matters in Hollywood.
