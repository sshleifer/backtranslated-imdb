What kind of documentary about a musician does not include a single track of the artist himself?! Unlike "Ray" or countless other films about music artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is to relive the great songs themselves. Here, all tracks are covers of uninteresting characters, and these interpretations do not capture Cohen's slow, jazzy style. More often, the covers are poorly sung folk versions. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures, and not with Cohen himself. Only rarely does the film feature Cohen reading his own work (never singing) - such as letters, poems, etc. The film really did not capture much about the artist's life story, or about its development over the years. A big disappointment to a big Cohen fan.
