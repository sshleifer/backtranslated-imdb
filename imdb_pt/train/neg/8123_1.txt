(spoilers) Wow, this is bad. I took a double take while watching a Star Trek episode the other day - it was the one where everyone got infected with that space sickness and then got a little crazy - and there was Stewart Moss, also known as the nasty 'hero' of It Lives. In the evening! He played the first infected crewman, who dies of terminal depression. All I could think about was that he watched his own movie many times, that was what caused the depression. This movie is full of really nasty people. There is no redeeming character in the film, not one. It's very difficult to feel bad when Dr. Beck is turning into a bat (or what he really transformed) because you just do not like him. And you do not like your strident, bony wife, or the sordid nasty sergeant. Ward, or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest some time or energy in this movie? Where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to worry about it. Not to mention horrible cinematography, which made them look like they had filmed the film through the urine, and the special effects of the five-cent bats, many of which seemed to be pieces of paper thrown in a fanfold to simulate hordes of flying bats. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but deep down, definitely.
