This is a German film from 1974 that has something to do with some women arriving at a castle and moreover, I can not really tell their purpose or even what the purpose of the film is. I can tell you that there are several women who also work like moonlight in this particular castle, who take out body paint and spin for bongos as if they were in the Goth Kit-Kat Klub, and that seems to be a good part of the execution time of this movie. Yes, there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires, and there are some girls with girls' things, etc., but the main focus seems to be the girls spinning in the basement. I quite liked the watchful eye of one of the devil's chief devotees, who lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil. Wanda, who was the lesbian of evil (as was said in the credits)? Does not matter. If you're not too picky about your lesbian devil loving movies, you might like this, otherwise it's very annoying thing and I could not even finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10.
