Priyadarshan - Whenever a person heard his name, his first thought would be "comedy." That is why this man is known, or rather, was known. After giving stupendous comedies such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train derailed slowly with films like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I can not remember for the time being. Now, with hideous movies like Dhol, the first word that would catch our eye after hearing his name would be "torture." <br /> Dhol is a mix of bad, bland jokes, somewhat dramatic, bad suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes that were funny though not witty, and second, except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandmother, the acting was decent. Speaking of acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and the last two idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was tall in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandmother in the first place looked like a ghost, and she was not funny, but rather silly. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with some twists. There is a "bad" man who is absurdly stupid and dumb. And finally, good overcomes evil and is alright. The idea of ​​having a Dhol with a tone full of money is not simply witty. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its duration. After an hour, you get exhausted and want to leave the theater. But being a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerate the whole two-and-a-half hours of the movie. The film continues and the same kind of jokes are repeated several times and situations are perennial, just in a different place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law came to your house and starts mocking you at everything, send her to this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.
