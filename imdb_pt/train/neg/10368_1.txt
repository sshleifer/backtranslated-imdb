This "movie" is such a bad job! Nothing seems to be trying to be realistic. The plot is weak, acting - unfortunate, actors who wonder there as in a first year production, striving hard to act without any possibility from the beginning. What a failure! What a waste of time, money and effort for all concerned, including the public. Well, as in any suspense, here too there are murders, corpses and blood. Just imagine someone who five minutes ago, committed a murder with a knife, and left calm and smiling, not to mention clean as a whistle, as if cutting the throat were done by a virtual agent. Besides, this murder should have been done by a frail little woman in a strong strong man, and she cut her throat !!! Did she ask him politely to bow down to her? Much more stupidity of this kind is happening and leaving the audience wondering if that meant a joke that turned out to be bad. The continuity is another big problem, for example: the hungry groom is lying in bed, waiting for his bride to leave the bathroom and, after a long time, falls asleep (!?!). The next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area, asking for orientation to the landscape points! Is not that a word about last night ??? It's a waste of time to even try to write about that low-low "movie" supposed to be.
