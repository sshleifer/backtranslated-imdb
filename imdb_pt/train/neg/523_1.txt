It's amazing to me what entertainment is all about today. maybe I'm a dinosaur from the fifties, and I'm out of touch with the current generation of movies, and apparently that's the case with this movie, since a lot of people loved it. I found it dirty and vulgar. I have not said that about many movies in my life, but this one fits the bill. The humor is sophomoric and crude. I'm not a politically correct person, and even I found gay jokes, not just not funny but downright offensive (I'm not gay). The main character of the film is not even a nice person, just pathetic. When the movie finally ended, I overheard several people commenting how disappointed they were at what they paid to see.
