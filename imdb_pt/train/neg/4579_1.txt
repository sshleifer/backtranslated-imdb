"What the Bleep do we know?" It was one of the worst moments I spent at the movies. It was less of a movie and more of a special after school, but at the same time nothing special. The attempt at a narrative on which they grounded their ideas was pathetic, which almost everyone will say to you. Marlee Matlin's panties just should not happen. I'm not going to dwell on that. What I will reveal is a criticism that many can not formulate. This film, although tedious, also suffered a tremendous failure in reasoning. It was terribly contradictory because he was so manipulative, he became a creator of his life, a manifestation of abundance, advertisement without shoes. Interconnection is explained as a large part of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our surroundings with our minds. He completely neglects that there are other people with minds who could be controlling us, which seems to be more the case. Or at least the structures in which we exist limit us greatly. In this way, the film was inappropriately solipsistic. Solipsism and interconnectivity simply do not mix unless you are God Almighty. If you are, you will be impressed (?!?) For all the cool things this movie will reveal that you can do. If not, you'll be very disappointed, an idiot, or maybe both. Also, the title is so ridiculous that I find it difficult to warn people not to watch the movie because I feel retarded by mentioning it by name. Shame on everyone involved.
