This movie was a little disappointing. After the very slow start, very intense (and quite bloody), the film begins to lose it. Lots of lot leaves very little time for explanation, and coming out of the theater I wondered what that was. The characters remain shallow, the story is not at all convincing, most are deja vu without parody insinuations, and there are some very cheesy parts ... like, the young cop has to dig up a body. Of course it's night And it rains And he has to do it alone ... yawn! Or the Manifestation of Evil being "Nazis" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, that's really original. However, there are some nice chunks like the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) jokes, but (though Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can) this is definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)
