One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, laughable 'action' (of course the cars are traveling slowly), atrocious script, horribly unsatisfactory ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie. We know that Judge Reinhold is a good actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is no great tension inside the car, and when the characters are faced with moments of hope, they laugh like futile banshees for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered! <br /> <br /> In addition, the chain of events that leads these people to share the same credibility of car strains. Apparently based on true events, though? If that is the case, the truth is obviously stranger than fiction! Unfortunately, he was portrayed so ineptly.
