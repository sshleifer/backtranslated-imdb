Gayniggers of the Outer Space is quite summarized by its name. Running only 27 minutes, it depicts a spacecraft of gay blacks who come to Earth to free men from women. Although I see a bit of meaning for the plot, it's also really illogical. Granted, its meant to be a comedy / spoof in society and science fiction. I've found myself laughing several times, so this succeeds. <br /> <br /> Special effects are horrible. When the spacecraft is floating above the Earth, you can see stars for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown at first seem false, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several misspellings in the text, the actors are not convincing, the characters are confused; in general, the whole thing is not taken seriously. If you go through all the aspects that make it a bad movie, it's very accessible and easy to see until the end. Some parts are hilarious. But overall, the only thing you keep remembering is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts of all time. Seeing that it's a short and has some funny aspects, is not the worst thing to see. But it is illogical and has little value in the long run. I can not really recommend it; if you watch, do it for the unique concept, not for the quality.
