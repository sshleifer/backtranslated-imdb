This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. It was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not fun. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar went to her old book of empty expressions of shock and shock. She could not sell her character or anyone else in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought Grudge was "right," then do not go and see it unless you have fun wasting your time and your life. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for free, so I do not want it to be seen as a speech from a guy who lost $ 8 in a terrible movie. I was free, I still sucked, I hated. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
