I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to settle up front, and the ones I found made this look a must-see. How I felt cheated! <br /> <br /> Firstly, it is necessary to point out that this is the daytime movie of a housewife. The performances are made of wood, each sentence is a 'moving' attempt in the way that the daytime movies and the housewife's novels are always, and it is based on this predictable, well-trodden premise that men (particularly soldiers) are essentially violent incompassionate. The whole movie is about the apparent 'drama' at a time when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If this sounds tolerable (or even pleasant) to you, then be warned. Linda Hamilton's German accent, though very good, is a painful distraction - just like her face, for some reason. The other presentations are undoubtedly a permanent source of embarrassment for their authors, with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day. There are few surprises, but be aware of the endless supply of food and drink 'Monty Pythonesque' that miraculously appears from the backpacks of hungry soldiers! <br /> <br /> I was not expecting action, but I expected pretty or textural or emotionally charged. What I got was a particularly bad story of 'feeling good' about Christmas that will have a smart audience shrunk with the amount of everything. <br /> <br /> Watch in the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing left. 2: You are a fan of predictable TV movies 'housewife picks on men and wins'. 3: The only way to appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You have absorbed enough that your emotions are easily stirred by an unsophisticated narrative.
