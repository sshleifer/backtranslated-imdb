A woman's nightmares feed her fear of being buried alive. The traitorous husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of his phobia by locking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement. Of course, horror queen B Brinke Stevens turns into a heinous ghostly creature. The only reason to see this amateur junk movie is Michael Berryman in a small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last twenty minutes Bleeding from Brinke are a lot of fun to watch. The special effects, for example, laughable decapitated head are really horrible. Better watch "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course I'm not expecting elegant entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too dull to be pleasant.
