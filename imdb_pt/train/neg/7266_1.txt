... and yet we were told, there was another hour and twenty minutes to go. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why was not there a publisher to tell the screenwriter / director to snip? Apparently, this writer / director has already made short films; as a short one, this would have been fine. But the lack of dialogue begins to crackle after twenty minutes. The lack of a lot of music shines. Background noise (talking, traffic, and especially an omnipresent helicopter) age very fast. But the worst failure is in history. There is very little other than a short period. After an hour, we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. I almost screamed at the screen: "We understand, we understand !!!!" It's amazing that after we left the theater, we could drive home, watch the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report, pack up to bed and know the audience was still stuck in the theater. <br /> <br /> It's not enough to satisfy your vision. You have to give the audience enough to share your vision.
