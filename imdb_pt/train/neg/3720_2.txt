Is this a joke? It's a comedy? Surely not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion of any intended humor, but on some occasions the bad acting, the bad direction and the shocking script made the audience laugh loudly in the movies. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist, who has just reached his peak, is killed by a murderer in which he walks by mistake. The killer sees the portfolio of young artists he is carrying and decides to watch an exhibition of his work. In the exhibition the killer finds the sister of the dead artists and they end up falling in love. It's all very predictable and the end will not have anyone guessing, because it's so poorly scripted. The film takes place mainly in Vienna, Austria, and shows how beautiful a city is. Do not waste your time on this movie unless you are studying how NOT to act, direct or script a movie!
