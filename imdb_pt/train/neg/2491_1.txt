The maiden voyage is just that. I would like to immediately say that I watched 5 minutes of this before I just could not take it anymore. As has been said in another review, this movie does not fit the whole "so bad is good" thing, it's just bad. The acting is horrible, the SFX is poor and the story is bland and stupid. Even the extras are awful, the "pocket guards" and others seem to hold their guns like water guns. <br /> <br /> Do not bother watching this movie, the only special thing about it is that, no matter how low your expectations are, you'll still be disappointed.
