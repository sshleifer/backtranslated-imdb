I had completely forgotten about this movie so far. This was the blatant and worst attempt to demonize a hobby I've ever seen. The message seemed to be, "Teens do not use their imagination; they can take games seriously, drive them crazy, and hurt people." I can only imagine that the unimaginative writers of this play thought that D & D style games are a form of malicious ritual or arcane worship.
