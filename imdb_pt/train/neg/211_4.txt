Hilariously obvious "drama" about a lot of high school kids (I think) who like hip-hop nonstop, dance break, graphite and trying to become a DJ at Roxy - or something. To be totally honest, I was so bored I forgot! Even the people who love music agree that this film is terribly represented and - like a drama - it has failed in its own right. We should find these kids nice and cool. I found them insipid and annoying. What I really hated was Ramon. It graffiti on the subway trains and this is considered great. Excuse me? He is defacing public property that is not his to begin with. In addition, these "great" children take advantage of the city's electricity to be able to hold a large dance party in an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we should find a lot of lawbreakers kind and amusing. <br /> <br /> I could forgive all this if the music was good, but I can not stand hip hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre and went on and on! They are always playing! It got to the point that I was rapidly advancing through the many infinite numbers of music. (Cut the music and you'll get a 30-minute movie - maybe). There are some imaginative numbers - the subway dance fight, a really funny Santa Claus number and Roxy's climactic. If you love hip hop, here's your movie. But you're looking for a good mixed drama - forget it. Also, how did this get a PG rating? There's an incredible amount of swearing at it.
