Williamson's accent is hard to navigate. He talks incredibly fast, as if in a hurry to get past the lines. During soliloquies, he acts as if he were talking to someone, when he should be talking to himself. All this and his bald head only annoyed me. He was too old for that role. When reading other reports of Williamson, perhaps he got that role because he was crazy and the director decided to do some of the imitation of life or forced method. When the actors declare Hamlet crazy you believe! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and could play the role of Ophelia and still get a pass. The scenery is somber and sinister, but it looks as if it had been filmed in a royal castle, especially in the scenes in the tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines like a great light in the sky.
