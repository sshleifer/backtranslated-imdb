A low-budget Texas effort at least filmed well, but that's little consolation. Bad performance, or, I must say, a bad super-action, a very lame story that is nothing new, bad, bad, bad, bad special effects. It seems like a bunch of youngsters are setting up a haunted house for Halloween, which is made every year, but this year things are different. It has an extensive long lesbian theme that is not only boring, but definitely fills the empty places, of which there are many. Putrid, puerile, definitely avoidable, at all costs.
