Wow!! This movie is really awful. I can not imagine how anyone could have read this script poorly written and given the green light. The cast is uniformly second with some truly horrendous performances from virtually the entire cast. History is disjointed, fragmented, and incoherent. The count, lead and predictable. Bland, no charm, no humor. Not sexy at least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There is also a strong current of misogyny that has become increasingly difficult to bear as the film continued. When your lead (Carrell) is bland and bland, it's hard to climb up from there. Despite being a fake twist where love triumphs over lust, I got a sick feeling in my stomach. If this is what goes through humor and social comment, then we are definitely doomed.
