An Avent-garde nightmare, an extremely low budget movie that has delusions of grandeur. Difficult to sit down. I get the message that child abuse is wrong. Our great revelation. I had no idea I was wrong before I saw this. Yes, that's sarcasm. DO NOT watch this movie if you are offended by male or female nudity. Do not watch if you are a little less sensitive. Do not watch if you care. Second thought just did not see it period. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: make the movie, premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, stills from movies, director's comments, two versions of the teaser trailer, The Azoic video clips and a video in the classroom
