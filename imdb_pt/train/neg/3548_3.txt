For those who like depressing movies with despicable characters and a sordid plot, this one is for you! From the dark atmosphere of New York City, which presents itself as an extremely gloomy and almost hopeless place, for two main characters, devoid of a great sense of morality, this film is a real misfortune. <br /> <br /> Why it won the Oscar was because it was so shocking back then that Hollywood, brand new in its freedom to show anything it wanted with all the abandoned moral codes, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers were then like a six-year-old immature with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. Hollywood then gave theatergoers (probably for the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, childish nudity, the existence of homeless people, and other wonderful sights and sounds that only their twisted brain would find attractive ... jobs. <br /> <br /> I also hoped to shock the mainstream audience. Well, you were successful at that level. The audience was shocked by what they said and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display dirt and make money at the same time, could not fail to honor this piece of gold garbage. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this movie fascinating too. However, seeing it again in the 90's left such a bad taste in my mouth that I never watched to see it again. <br /> <br /> The performance was good, but so what? Acting is good in many movies. Nobody ever said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was particularly good in his youthful days when playing with exhausted people. He was like Johnny Depp of his day, playing guys like "Ratso Rizzo" in this movie and then being "Rain Man" later. Yes, "Ratso" is a character you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid that it overcomes good acting. <br /> <br /> This film is not "art" and is not worthy of its many awards; it was only in 1969 that it was very successful and that is why it is so remembered in the hearts of people and film critics. It's two hours of profanity and outrage, cheap religious shots, glorifying freaks (Andy Warhol even comes into action - not surprisingly) and generally despicable people. <br /> <br /> I liked the catchy song "Everybody's Talking," which helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was fake because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang better, before Nilsson did it .. and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is the loss of them). And - as mentioned - the name "Ratso Rizzo" stays with you! <br /> <br /> The film is a landmark, but in a negative sense, I fear: this marked it as "official" that Hollywood had gone down the toilet and remained in the sewer ever since.
