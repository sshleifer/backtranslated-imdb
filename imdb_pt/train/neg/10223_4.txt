I remembered the title so well. For me it was a film by Flora Robson with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And there was Vincent Massey's voice behind his mustaches. Well Flora Robson was great. His next signing, to me, would be "55 Days at Peking." The same role, but with different sumptuous dresses. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was a subtext. I like black and white movies. Was it all done in the days of Elizbethan at night? It was difficult and difficult to understand sometimes. I did not know what love interest was. Was it Spanish or was it Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe Elizabeth would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that firemen be sent against the Navy. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This may have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts. And I lost the light of day!
