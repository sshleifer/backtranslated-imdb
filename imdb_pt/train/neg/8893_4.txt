Celia Johnson is good as a nurse. Michael Hordern is good as Capulet, although it is his usual glimpse and neigh, and not a patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Friar Laurence, though he never takes him anywhere. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt, in the first of his "yuk" roles that would make him famous. Christopher Strauli's Benvolio is understanding. <br /> <br /> The scenarios are beautiful, if not impressive as in some of the other BBC Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The rest is weak to terrible. Rebecca Saire has completed 15 years in production, and has no idea how to act Juliet - she opens her eyes wide and weeps each line in exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is ill-treated with it and his self-esteem is inexplicable. The porch scene flows smoothly and uneventfully, with zero emotional or erotic impact. Your deaths are a relief. If I had a dagger, I would have offered them hours before. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews is indescribable as Mercutio, a big shock if you remember his beautiful work on "Brideshead Revisited". He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse into a thousand pieces of two or three words each, and then shouts the fragments in the most disconnected and unintelligible way possible. In this production, Queen Mab abdicates. Horrible. <br /> <br /> The director, Alvin Rakoff, shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening fight is remarkably incoherent. However, there is humor when in a later fight, Romeo apparently knees Tybalt right in the shoemakers. Tybalt then grabs the offended area. However, did this happen? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long game. This version is not recommended for classroom use or more.
