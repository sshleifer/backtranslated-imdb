I do not see why the filmmakers reworked this film. <br /> <br /> The 1972 film with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was a featured actor and Baldwin is just an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his game. Also the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It's almost annoying, despite the fact that film production in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the way that Baldwin imprisoned Mexico. I think this is a mistake in history. <br /> <br /> So I guess there was no need to redo it, or if they decided to redo a classic, they should choose an excellent actor for the first role, such as Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
