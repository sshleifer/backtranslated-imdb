I really have problems sorting this movie. It's brilliantly run, there's obviously a lot of money in it. Gere and the Danes are intense (although their screen personality could use a little more definition and seasoning), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it's one of those really sick films where we can not help wondering if the director himself likes to stage specific scenes, and yes, we can not help but wonder how many imitators such a film will inspire. <br /> <br /> In purely artistic terms, it's a 9, but I really have to wonder who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie ....
