This movie was awful. I swear they did not even write a screenplay, they sort of passed the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell. * Phht SPOILERS more like reasons not to watch * They sit and have breakfast for 20 minutes. he could have gone a long time. The ground was hard it would be almost impossible to locate him without puppies. And when the ICE-T is on that hill and uses the Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN as a sniper rifle (and then cuts a tree with eight shells? That would take thousands of shells to knock down a tree that size). and hand weapons are considered inaccurate in 100 yards. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light? I did not see a scope in this thing. Also, when he was shot in the gut and continued, which was retarded, he would have bled to death right there. Also, the end where he puts a stone or a cigarette in the barrels of the guys. It would not blow up and kill him. The bullet would still shoot would kill Ice T but it would jam the barrel.
