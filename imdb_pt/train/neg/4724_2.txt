This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it at the SXSW premiere and I was extremely disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even said it at the premiere. This is a drama, but people were laughing while the movie was tacky. This is never a good sign. The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommates / bandmates. They were funny while the rest of the movie took itself very seriously. The sound of Beatles music was simply absurd. The soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you're one of those crazy, rabid fans of Dominic Monaghan, do not bother with that one.
