I agree that although this story of Melville may be foolproof, this is hardly a credible attempt. Moving the story to the 20th century just outrages the intent and nature of the original story; possibly you may have been able to transfer it to England, but it should be a part of the period. Even our storyteller - the owner - counts in a flashback, going back even further, around 1800. By the end of the 19th century, a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without thinking. And the 20th century? Let's go! Give me a dirty word! Even around 1800, this behavior did not work very well, in view of the end. And the end of the movie? I do not know what it was because I did not watch the whole caricature - I had to stop. That was how to define "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
