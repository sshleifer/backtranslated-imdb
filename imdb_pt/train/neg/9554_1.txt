This is the worst, and I mean the worst computer-based movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The guy in this movie can actually talk to the computer as a real person. Now you probably think this must be a super cool hi-tech computer, well it is, but it also does it with another very weak and weak computer that has no GUI. <br /> <br /> The main idea how to supercharge the "super" computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid. My cell phone will turn off the lighting to conserve energy, but apparently this cool computer can not decide to use its features to deal with national security threats or to load computer games. <br /> <br /> things about it, but I just do not have time for it. <br /> <br /> I just can not believe that someone could actually shoot stupid movie like this
