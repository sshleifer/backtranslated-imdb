I tend to try to build reasonably well-argued reviews of movies, but I can not believe this is past the script phase. The dialogue is terrible, the acting is very dishonest, the accents are horrible, and the direction and pace are insignificant at best. <br /> <br /> I can not remember the last time I saw such a bad movie. Joseph Fiennes, as handsome as he is, could have ended his career as quickly as it began. <br /> <br /> Dr. Moreau's island was no worse than this rubbish.
