There are movies that are horrible, and there are movies that are so terrible that they are considered long forgotten and unacceptable. Also, a lot of violence and bad things (not just cheesy stuff; you know what I mean) add to the mix as well. What is the result of bad movies with such obscene content? Why, "Final Justice," of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of the film, and this was ridiculed by Joel and the Bots in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now, with Mike taking the place of Joel on Satellite of Love (but with the same bots), the trio made fun of MST3K's second movie, "Final Justice." Of course many of the bad things I mentioned were removed for the television release, but still, I want to watch this episode (and "Mitchell" too), because what does Joe Don "hate" more? Why, none other than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> Q. If you have a Big Lots nearby, check the store for the uncut ribbon! LOL This happened to another user!
