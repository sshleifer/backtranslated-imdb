This is not so much film as big-budget children's television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered coffee beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as "Insomnia". When it was first mentioned that a civilization had been destroyed by insomnia, I thought, "Wow, a nihilistic martial arts movie!" but without such luck. Although you should consider experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by the long white eyebrows of an old man. The Zu Warriors makes exactly the same sense, whether the subtitles are turned on or off. That's not a good sign. I found the special effects somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
