First of all: I love good Splattermovies and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero budget film is nothing like that! The picture quality is so low, the most annoying soundtrack I've heard (!!!!), and as for the FX ... well, the super low quality makes some of them not look as bad as in a movie real (what this junk here is not). No concept, a fine storyline, primitive act and rare dialogue - I think I counted about 10 phrases throughout the film, each repeated about 20 times ... even for many movie sequences (can be an indication for what kind The story seems to be that a boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother, have suffered psychological damage and, as an adult, go on tour, presenting a self-mutilation show. So far so good ... But to these pseudo-idiots-directors, this plot is just a line to put cheap shock scenes produced in a row that do not have a message or make sense (newly taken are thrown at a woman naked, tied in a hole in the ground ... why? and why is that the only time you see so much woman and sniper all over the bloody "movie" ??? Disturbing Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Required? Not! Artistically? NOT!!!!! Everyone confusing this cheap show with art should as soon as possible visit their psychiatrist or watch "The Wall" by Pink Floyd to see how a similar topic can be worked in a cunning way ... I hope this is his first and last (!!!!!!!!) movie, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all you gore-heads out there, remember: Not everything that looks cheap and obviously makes no sense is automatically "Art" ...
