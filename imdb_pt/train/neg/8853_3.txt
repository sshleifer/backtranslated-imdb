In the first Howling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. The plot in that movie made some sense; a TV reporter investigates this and tries to find out the truth. She ends up having to kill many of them, including her boyfriend, who becomes one. So she shows the world that they exist when they turn into live TV. The special effects were only laughable in the first film and they did not improve in this film. Whether it be the transformations or the bad puppets or the computer graphics that show the superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot is not so bad; they must kill the werewolf leader for some reason. This will not destroy all werewolves and does not really end the threat of werewolves, as they just want to kill her. I think there was some nebulous reason for it, but it really gets lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the movie "ends," we have a 10-minute montage of the movie we just watched and all the other scenes are where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her big breasts while a Devo-esquire plays for a crowd of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie be watched is Christopher Lee.
