Some of the less worst and least natural acting performances I've ever seen. Which is perhaps not surprising given the awkward silly dialogue given to the characters in a note. Add to that the cheap production values ​​and you will have a movie that does not even seem to belong to the television. Not much is expected of a Lifetime movie, especially one so old, but this is almost hopelessly bad. In terms of plot, it's a terrible cliche novel, the kind that even Harlequin would consider beneath them. . You can guess how the rest of the movie will go by simply watching the first scenes. Surprised, the only female character who gets some focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love.
