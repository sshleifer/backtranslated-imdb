This movie begins with an execution of a witch doctor and his lover. Your head is cut and buried separately from your body ... it looks like "The thing that would not die," is it? Well, it works a little like that, but once the body is reunited with the head, all the interesting and horrible deaths are made and the movie moves very slowly. I mean the movie has only 88 minutes and I kept thinking "When will this end?" The characters in the movie are mostly idiots and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very bad as he is moving slowly and really you wonder how he can do anything considering he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing to keep you watching after the head is replaced is the fact that there are so many breasts being shown that you really start to lose track of. I still want to watch a horror movie, not a soft core pornographic film and, like a horror movie, it's a way of messing with lots of slow stretches to be even nice. And do not read the back of the box while it appeared as if there were meat eating zombies attacking the city, there is ... only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled are not a factor in the movie and his scene is quite meaningless. So most of the time I say you should avoid this movie unless you find it for a very low price.
