Simply put: the movie is boring. Cliché on the cliché is confirmed and the stories never come together. It seems the director was not sure if he should make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is doomed to kill a prince of oil, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) And therefore some elements have been added to make the film more interesting. Thus a child dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: to freely advise the person indirectly responsible for the death of the child. The lawyer has a drunken "friend" and keeps him around because nobody knows. Some children become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship. <br /> <br /> In short, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. Neither laughed nor cried, got no understanding, or had to learn more or take a cause. It meant nothing to me, which, in my eyes, is the worst thing you can say about a movie.
