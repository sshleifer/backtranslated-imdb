I stole this movie when I was freshman in college. I tried to watch it three times, the second two because the friends wanted to see. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since it's so funny, it has to be funny." Wrong! I can not make myself see that pile of shit after boxing fight / insult the war where to burn the guy with a good zinger causes physical pain to his opponent. You'd think a terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but once you see it you'll know it's true. This movie is not worth the price I paid for it. I watched a ton of Steven Segal movies, and I even watched Crossroads twice ... but I still could not watch it.
