I just read a book about the work of Anita Loos and the photo in MacDonald's TCM magazine in her angel costume looked great (awesome wings) so I thought I'd watch this movie. I had never heard of the movie before, so I had no preconceived notions about it. I thought it was a cute start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald, since the secretary he does not know exists. The scene in which she appears at the costume party in her simple angel outfit, with an uncooperative halo and wings that do not stay in place, was really captivating. I was even with the movie when Eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a true angel. But after a while, it began to crumble for me. Eddy stays "asleep" for the rest of the film, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from there does not matter, because he is only dreaming. The rest was far less plot and tasteless. I had to force myself to stay with her. And the final number in which MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in some crazy hallucination was simply weird. <br /> <br /> If Eddy had "woken up" earlier and the original story continued, or did he really marry an angel? I think it would have been much more interesting. I wanted to see more of your real character. <br /> <br /> There were not enough musical numbers to call it musical. The first songs were good, but the number of jitterbug MacDonald does was like nails on the chalkboard. Completely wrong by his operatic voice. Even so, Eddy and MacDonald can still shine, showing what the real stars they were.
