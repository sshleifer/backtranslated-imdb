Having seen the first ten episodes, I must say that this show sucks. <br /> <br /> What bothers me the most is that the show was recorded in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have filmed in California so we could have had scenes in the desert. That would have been more faithful to the movie. The first scene in which they are outside in another world is in the mountains, with many pines where it seems cold. This does not look very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it looked like you were in ancient Egypt. Here it seems they are running around fighting aliens in a Canadian forest. And it is so bad that on other planets, the fall also happens. You can see the leaves on the ground in the woods where everyone looks like forrestres outside of Vancouver. It just makes the show even more unbelievable and idiotic. <br /> <br /> And then there's Richard Dean Anderson. He's not Kurt Russel. Of course he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russels' performance a bit, but he's not as cool as Russel. And he's not as good an actor as Russel. And Russells way of playing The Neill, well, he was much more cynical. Andersons Neil, it's too soft. I liked that the Russels version did not give a shit and had no problem detonating the bomb until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a good job as Jackson, although taking the place of James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a very annoying character. He is Jaffa. It is not a Jaffa. Only Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! A former bodyguard of a pathetic character of Ra, seen only in the pilot and in another episode so far. Teal'c speaks and acts like a robot. I've seen Jean Claude Van Damme's best performance. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and the character Ra and the people they saved in the movie, can speak English suddenly is also incredibly dumb. What made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, they are really good at the pilot. But the very rare effects in the program are poorly made and seem cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It is so obvious that they walk in a studio with a poorly made painting in the background. It is an insult to us viewers that they look so cheap. Especially when they could have done this in front of a blue screen with cgi backgrounds. <br /> <br /> The X files had better effects when they broadcast their first episodes in 1993. This was 4 years before the start of SG-1. And they did not have the apparent budget of two million dollars per episode, which SG-1 supposedly had. They must have spent all the money on catering. Because I do not see it on the screen. Incredibly annoying and nonsensical show, it could have been great if they had filmed the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
