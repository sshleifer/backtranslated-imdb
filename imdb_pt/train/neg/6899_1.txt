Have you ever wondered why the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands seem to automatically take on the American Blacks' sense of humor? regardless of their ethnic origins? Well, this movie will not provide answers to this often pondered question - but it will provide an excellent case study. From the outset, this film functions as a kind of "Old School" for New Zealanders from the Pacific Islands. , which immediately raises the question of exactly what the purpose of such a task is. Does it mean perpetuating rooted stereotypes of New Zealanders in the Pacific Islands? or do you want to explore this potential market? The story is weak, jokes are dull and the end is expected. This movie has done nothing for New Zealand cinema, as it is merely an appropriate romantic comedy and devoid of any merit.
