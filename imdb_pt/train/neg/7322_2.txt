I will give credit where credit is due, and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as an actress who drinks a lot and does what she wants. She is impetuous, bold, hard and very sexy; she is much better than this movie deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's it. This thriller is a fragmented mess, trying at once to be a stalking thriller, a murder thriller, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and a smoking erotic thriller. The movie, my friends, is nothing exciting. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought of climbing C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leadership man? He is not ugly, but to cry loudly, it seems that the goddess of the Fiorentino biscuits is getting on well with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority nor the presence on the screen to fill the starring role. <br /> <br /> The script is by far the worst aspect of the movie. There is no tension when Fiorentino's character receives mysterious phone calls, there is no mystery about his guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film, there is no sense of release, since Fiorentino becomes weak when Howell loses his inhibitions. Look for interesting but ill-made appearances by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and a very good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. Besides, my first impulse would be to put that piece of junk and go rent something else.
