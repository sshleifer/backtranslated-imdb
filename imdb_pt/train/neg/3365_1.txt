This poor remake of the 1963 classic begins reasonably well, then replaces suspense with confusing and pointless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the scariest moments occurs when Nell and Theo lie side by side on two twin beds, listening to the terrifying noises outside their bedroom. Nell tells Theo to release her hand because she is hurting her. Nell then looks at Theo, who is several feet away and realizes that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the last version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when she suddenly dives and slides across the floor. It is only when she tells the invisible force to stop pulling her that we realize what has happened. And someone can explain what Nell's last words mean - "It's about family. It's always about family"? <br /> <br /> The only feature left is the performance of Lili Taylor, but even that can not save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once more that beneath her handsome exterior there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. Zeta-Jones, however, has to explain it, for example, by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend - or girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Definitely one that should be consigned to the graveyard of meaningless remakes.
