On the way to a small town that lies out of the way (but that looks suspiciously close to a highway), a female reporter encounters a strange wanderer who agrees to help her head to her destination. The strange man then tells a couple of horrifying stories linked to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but ends up suffering a much worse fate when attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation interrupted when an undead outlaw is offended at the sight of his engraved tomb. <br /> <br /> The Chronicles of the Zombies is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes. in making a zombie-themed anthology - a good idea, but with only two stories, she's woefully short. And that's not the only way this low-cost movie does not work: acting is awful (with Joe Haggerty, like Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the strangest performances I've ever seen); the places are not inspired; the script is bleak; there is a zero-nude sex scene; and the end ... well, that's a beggar of belief. To be fair, some of Sykes' creative camera works are effective (although the enigmatic technique employed as characters running through the forest is a bit and Joe Castro's cheap spasm is enthusiastic: an ear is plucked , eyeballs are plucked, a face is removed, brains are crushed and there is a confused decapitation. These positive aspects make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles is not a walk in the park, even for experienced viewers of the trash z -grade. <br /> <br /> I give the Zombie Chronicles 2/10 but generously raise my rating to 3 since I could not see the movie with the benefit of 3D (although I suspect a dimension extra would not have made much difference).
