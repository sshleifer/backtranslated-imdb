Gadar is a really silly movie because it tells a fake story. It is very unrealistic and is a typical sunny film whose aim is to strike Pakistan. The purpose of the film is to divert viewers so they may think that Pakistan and its government are bad, but trying to hide their own shortcomings will not work. And all the songs and songs in the movie are all bad. More likely the Sikhs will Love the movie because they are being misguided. The movie sucks and sucks with power. I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10 I would, but the smaller is 1. Please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie. Disasters.
