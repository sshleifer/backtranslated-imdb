Being a fan of silent movies, I was eager to see this picture for the first time. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the film seems to be a long and long commercial for the Maxwell automobile. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the chase scene was about half the length, I might have liked the movie more. But it got old too fast. And while I recognize that reality is stretched many times in films, without diminishing the pleasure of a spectator, what happened to Mexican bandits? I mean, they're chasing a car through the mountains, a car that most of the time is moving at about a mile per hour, but they can not reach it?
