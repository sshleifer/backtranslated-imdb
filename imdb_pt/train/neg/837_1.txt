I saw it and I really enjoyed the first two, really. Especially because the second one is not just trying to make another as good as the first. And it's a story alone. You do not need to know the first movie. I also liked that in the "Free Willy" movies. <br /> <br /> But ... the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. The movie is fine, there are funny parts at all well. But for what? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. What the Lion King 1 1/2 is to me is: a difficult attempt to have even more fun with the first film than it already had, as well as telling the story from their point of view. But for what? I really would like to know. You know, the idea of ​​the two sitting in the movies watching the first one, is very cool. But what comes next is almost unnecessary. I think a lot of people liked Timon and Pumbaa, and so did I. However, for me many parts were very built with an attempt to be funny. No way, most of it was not funny, at least to me. Btw. What was the movie anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to have more fun from the first movie? I usually choose option b and am very disappointed in that. <br /> <br /> If you like to see stories like "the story behind xy," you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead" by Tom Pare with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. This is very funny and do not try to get more out of "Hamlet" then it has.
