The story behind this movie is very interesting and in general the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, direction, continuity, rhythm, action sequences, acrobatics and use of CG depress and spoil the movie. First, action sequences. They are all pretty uninteresting. Most are someone standing and being shot, making no attempt to run, fight, dodge or whatever, even if they have all the time in the world. The sequences look bland for something done in 2004. <br /> <br /> CG has very well rendered and animated effects, but they look cheap because of how they are used. <br /> <br /> Stimulation: everything happens too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the beginning can do back-flips, etc. Why is she so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the film. Like Lilith, she would not have to be able to back flips - maybe she could not, since she had wings. <br /> <br /> In addition, we have sequences like a woman being run over by a car. and getting up and just wandering in a deserted room with a sink and mirror, and then stabbing herself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the viewers really caring that she was run over by a car (and then I felt the effects of another exploding car) "Are you okay?" the driver asks, "yes, I'm fine," she says, bloody and disheveled. <br /> <br /> I watched it all because the introduction promised me it would be interesting ... but in the end the poor execution made me crave anything else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, to that vampire movie where Jackie Chan was a comic relief because they managed to suspend my disbelief, but that only made me want to wake the director, and give the writer a good conversation.
