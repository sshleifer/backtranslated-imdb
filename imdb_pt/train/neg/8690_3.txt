Everyone involved (and the public) should seek out "The Candidate" to see just how good this movie could have been. What happened to South American history? What Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw were thinking of allowing their papers to be cardboard cutouts. So far I've enjoyed every performance and / or film by Gene Hackman. He was either disinterested (which I can hardly believe) or terribly miscast. I also liked and advocated Richard Gere (and I was vilified by that). But here he had no "power." He was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive. After all, I was very disappointed. I really expected a lot more from this director and cast. If you can not find "The Candidate" watch "Wag the dog" again or even "Bulworth".
