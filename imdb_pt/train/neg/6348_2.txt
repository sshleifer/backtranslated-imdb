Totally absurd pretentious. The material is monotonous, tedious, monotonous and most of the cast would not even have done any secondary studies in Allen's earlier films. And having to listen to the disinterested Will Ferrell doing his Woody Allen imitation makes me hate even more the (though mysteriously popular) Ferrel. It seems that the melancholy Allen of 70 years should have left work when the clock touched a new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to get involved in the movie, but it was simply impossible; my snyapses could not fire so slowly. So instead of napping and killing the afternoon sleeping upright, I got up, left my wife and daughter at the movies, and got out to the car, where I had a very good book to re-read (George Bailey's large volume of 30 years ago, "Germans.") After all, the day turned out very well, no thanks to Woody.
