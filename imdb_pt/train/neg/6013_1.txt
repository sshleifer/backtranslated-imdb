I've read all the books so far in the left-wing series, and the film hardly does them justice. Of course, I've seen movies worse, but this was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good episode of MST3K. The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it looked like the actors were reading their lines rather than actually saying them. The characters were tough and unpleasant. The effects were cheesy and looked horribly fake. The ending was awful. First of all, neither was it until the first book. Secondly, it did not make sense. If you had not read the book, you would have no idea what was going on. It must have been the end more like a student movie I've seen in a movie. I'm annoyed that I actually paid money for this movie. If, by some miracle, he is released, they must reform him completely and let Hollywood take over. Those two aspiring filmmakers and aspiring director must leave the production of films to professionals.
