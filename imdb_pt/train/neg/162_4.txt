a film that tries to be far more intelligent than its creators are capable of producing. The movie rotates and twists through a "surprise" miriad in a desperate attempt to stop the public from guessing, getting out of the "plot" with steaming scenes they thought would help. <br /> <br /> James Belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and only sleep walks through the film. the same applies to other "actors". the plot is rather silly and tacky. which in itself is not such a crime, but in the end, the tremendous twists become very tiresome and boring. <br /> <br /> However, the film can generate some interest in the medium. everything is worth a sloth watch on a very boring day, but do not worry if you miss this. <br /> <br /> A little lame 4!
