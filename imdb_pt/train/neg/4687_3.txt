SPOILERS (EVEN THAT NO ONE SEES REVEALED IN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE MOVIE) Robin Williams is actually quite good at this as the friendly, lonely and emotionally fumbling loser Sy. He makes a psychopath very human, even sympathetic, and really disappears in character - not a small feat for such a recognizable artist. <br /> <br /> Too bad the rest of the movie is a waste. Support performances (and performers) would not seem out of place on soft-core porn (it does not help that all characters except Sy are made of 100% cardboard). Sometimes the director actually seems to be trying to thwart the suspense: we know from the first moments a) that Sy is a complete idiot, b) that he survives, and c) that he gets caught by the police at the scene. end. So all that's left to ponder is how and why, and the answers provided are not so interesting. <br /> <br /> The plot is laborious and planned, and features some absurd moments (for example, the husband reprimands his wife for his expensive tastes, even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount store. of two-thirds of the way, Sy does something so hopelessly stupid that it makes him think how much he really cares about his revenge scheme, and the final clichÃ© explanation of his psychosis, straight from "Peeping Tom," is a terrible excuse. /> <br /> The dialogue is of the worst kind.It is not overwritten, or strange, or unbelievable, or bad in any other way that can be considered fun, even for lovers of bad movies. purely, horribly functional - it's as if the director gave a script to a newspaper editor and said, "Hey, I need a practical script about that - in an hour." It made me want to scream, honestly. <br /> This movie seems to be a setback for the s thrillers of the '80s and' 90s (Beware of Cradle Stones) (The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, for example) and though it's certainly unpleasant, it's never really scary. Sy fetishism occasionally makes you uncomfortable, but by itself is not enough to make the movie work. In the end, the lack of ability of all involved, except Robin Williams, sinks this. 3 out of 10.
