This "movie" is a farce. No, wait - an abomination. NO, WAIT - this is undoubtedly the worst movie of all time made with loved characters created and created by other actors. I thought of "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers it was ridiculous and sacrilegious, but even daring to "redo" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy is asinine and greedy. Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy are dead, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. Why could anyone even begin to imagine that the proper upgrades for L & H would be in the person of Bronson Pinchot and that Gailard Sartain is beyond me. I tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and ashamed and I certainly was not disappointed. Everyone involved in this pathetic, idiotic misfortune should be banned from anything and everything associated with Hollywood and the production of movies. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS - YOU HAVE BEEN ADMITTED.
