As far as HEIST films are concerned, this is very weak. The continuity is very bad, there is enough character continuity to really feel that you understand some of the characters. Peter Falk is great, and he's one of the reasons why it's worth watching. Falk has some great lines, like "he'll be back, he'll buy some saugages" or something ... there are some nice scenes, though they are entirely due to the actors' efforts. Direction, script and editing are pretty bad.
