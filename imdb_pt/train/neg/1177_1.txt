This movie sucks! Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs, it is disconnected and incoherent. I pride myself on plumbing the depths of the 70s cinema of everything, from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like being shocked, but I need a coherent story. However, if watching Matt mate leaves you out of this movie is for you. The saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang. I mean, it's just hard to sit down, not to mention that the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly. Please, I know the cape is interesting (what looks like a gorilla's hand approaching a woman's butt), but do not waste your time or money because you will not return.
