I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she was making this movie, but obviously it had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> We read the romance of this past. Summer for AP English 12, and I watched the movie. During the periodic notes and the check of the clock, I contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning. Of course, the sky was completely clear, and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5-paragraph essay about it. <br /> <br /> Wright's novel discussed very real themes, the mind of a murderer and the psychology behind him. Silver's film turned a killer into a victim, which is not what Wright wanted (see: "How Bigger Born," page 454). <br /> <br /> I will make this short and sweet: if you want to let your conscience, in the words of immaculate Raphael Lambert, skip the movie and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not a thought-provoking material. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: Now I have to write the essay.
