A carefree and clich√©d thriller has a young couple doing research on America's most infamous murder sites, becoming road partners with a stupid young lady and her rabid boyfriend - who is a true psychopath. Arty and alienating, the film's tone alternates between pseudo-irony pouty and silly extravaganza. Very handsome, maybe, but finally laughable. Brad Pitt's performance as a low-rent assassin is wonderful. * in ****
