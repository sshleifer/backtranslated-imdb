Superhero movies are pretty much always bad, and that's no exception. Its only redeeming quality is the fact that the movie COULD have been even worse. I'd put 'Batman & Robin' and 'Steel' above this movie, so yeah, it's so bad ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a black superhero, check out 'Blankman', it's not a "serious" superhero movie, but at least it's fun.
