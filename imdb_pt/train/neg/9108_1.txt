This so-called prequel is just a poorly made remake for a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The graphics are identical, as is most of the script. I loved the book based on it, and I loved the first movie, but I will not even bother with the third movie. The useless joke between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and ... I just can not emphasize how bad the movie was. If you do not want to believe me, just watch, and you'll see what I mean. If you read a comment that says "If you like the first, you will like the second", the only reason is because it is the same movie! Although the plot is not so good. They took so many lines from the first movie, It's hard to tell which movie you're watching.
