I finally reached "Starlight" last night on television and all I can say is. . . Wow!! It's hard to know where to start - the incredibly mushy special effects (check out the laser beams coming out of Willie's eyes!), The atrocious performance, the heavy dialogue, the incompatible use of archive footage or the air of serious pretension that infuses the whole production. This is truly a unique experience, and we should all be grateful for it. I name Jonathon Kay as the true heir of Ed Wood!
