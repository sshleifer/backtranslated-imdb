Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space girls costumes. <br /> <br /> I love 50 sci fi, I even love cheesy 50s sci fi, but this movie is really, really bad. And not on an MST3K medium. <br /> <br /> Practically unassailable as a pair of bozos make their best "hip cat" impression of Abott & Costello. <br /> <br /> Chessecake can usually save sci fi cheese, as in "Cat Women On The Moon", but it can not in this case. This movie requires a mute button and a fast forward feature. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I could see Gloria and Dolores walking the spacecraft for about an hour.
