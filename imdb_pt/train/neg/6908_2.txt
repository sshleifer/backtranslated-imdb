This series had potential, but I suppose the budget would not allow him to see that potential. An interesting setting, not unlike "lost", falls after the first episode. The complete series, 6 episodes, could have made a compelling 90 minute film, but the creators decided to drag it and move on. Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and did not work in general. There were few characters we cared about, because the characters did not grow over the period of time - well, one grew a little. The end was as terrible as the rest of the series. The only compliments here are for the art department and set cabinets, they have created an interesting, very bad look the writer and director did not have the ability to do something interesting with this element
