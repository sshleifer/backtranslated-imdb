This movie does not show us anything original. Every idea or scene (action) can be found in many previously released movies. The fabulous Nick is completely clear here. Even Will Patton is calm and mean, not good. Mr. Duvall is fine, but he has a very small part. Just like Angelina, then how can we determine her newly acclaimed stardom? Overall, there are many characters, so no one and nothing is especially detailed. This makes the movie easy to forget. Too bad, do not you think?
