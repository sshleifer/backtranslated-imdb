For some reason, TV Guide gave this two and a half stars, plus Faye Dunaway, so it definitely seemed like something to see. My, oh, my, this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. From her horrible performance (every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him, I screamed at the TV "I can not act!" When she asks what he needs, I yell "I need acting classes! ") dialog (" Give me back my organs! "). <br /> <br /> And the end of Brian DePalma's wannabe was also a little more than horrible. I wanted to like it. Dunaway is one of the best actors ever. And the production figures were very good. <br /> <br /> But wowzers, it made me laugh, RIAR !, most of the time. <br /> <br /> Do not bother out of curiosity, that was my first mistake, staying with him was definitely my second and third and fourth.
