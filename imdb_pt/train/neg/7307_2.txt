This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The events are completely random and make little or no sense. The fact that there is a sequel is so disgusting that I can fall with a case of cabin fever (I'm so sad). I describe it as a bug being thrown in a newspaper because it seems like different parts of things are mixed up. For example, Kevin, the loving karate boy with pancakes is strangely freaky on his own, so there's the cop who's a little weird and perverted, so the drug addict, so there's the fact that they attack a random guy who clearly need help. so suddenly the main character is having sex with his girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane crashing. then, in the end, a good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on Kevin, the karate boy. It's really very contemptible that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this movie unless you love Eli Roth, even if it does not make me like this movie. Hatred is a strong word, but seeing as it is the only word I have permission to use, it will have to do. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
