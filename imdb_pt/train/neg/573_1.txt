The last reviewer was very generous. I settle down as the first movie, but I can not say I really like this movie. The beginning is bearable, but it descends quickly. I just do not see Jon Bon Jovi as a "grumpy vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. Many of the scenes just do not make sense. I mean, any normal person would suspect that something was happening when a strange woman suddenly appeared out of nowhere to seduce him, let alone an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing was explained in this movie, you would not mind if it was fun, but that was asking too much. This has to be one of the worst vampire movies I've ever seen.
