I saw 10pm showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the movies wanting my time back (since I do not pay more for the movies), I did not really find any redeeming quality. <br /> <br /> There were a few lines and things like that made me laugh but mostly the movie seemed to consist of a rampant fan service for the younger crowd (in mind more than the age as this movie is rated R) male. The fan service seemed out of place and quite distracting too. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous phrase, but let's be honest, it's a lot of advertising for very little pay. The only really horrible part of the movie was the CG, which looked very scanned and did not match well with the live action on screen. <br /> <br /> Now I am a reasonable man, I knew to go to the theater that I would not be seeing "Casablanka", and I am at least grateful that this movie is an original idea (albiet inane) and not some re-make or spin off franchise. However, to be honest, if you are not part of the following cult, it is probably best to spend your money somewhere else and watch the movie in a second theater in a few weeks or rent it out in a few months.
