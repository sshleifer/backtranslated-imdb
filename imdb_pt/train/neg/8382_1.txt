There was a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled "Baby Buggy Bunny" which was EXACTLY this plot. The baby-face pupil stole a seat and the money in the carriage rolled over and fell into the hole of the Bug's rabbit. He dressed like a baby to get into the Bugg's hole to retrieve the money. The scene in "Little Man" where he is looking in the bathroom mirror, shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon. This was a hilarious 5 minute cartoon; not so much a whole movie. If you're really interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original the first time (1954). In addition, you will have many more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons!
