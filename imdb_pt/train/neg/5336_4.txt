This movie is not very good. In fact, it's the worst Elvis movie I've ever seen. He has very little plot, especially parties, drinking beer and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I do not know why they made this movie. You could say that Elvis was also wasted, he's much, much better at "Follow That Dream."
