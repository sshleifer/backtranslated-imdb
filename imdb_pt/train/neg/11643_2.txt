This is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from Giovanni Bocaccio's collection of 14th-century "Decameron" stories. <br /> <br /> Situated within the peasant population of a medieval Italian town, it is a diatribe about the reality of sex consequences within this world and time. A realistic view of Life within this world sometimes seems like a journey back in time. Given the human element represented of his time, it is also possible to see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of life at times. Or it can also be seen as a general satire of the rules of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Nothing terribly special, but definitely interesting if someone has no expectations or assumptions.
