Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is slightly amused in this 1970's turkey, but the script is so stupid and insulting that even Goldie Hawn's youth (shortly after his Oscar win) can not begin to take that one out of the mud. As a chasing celebrity goes out in his 40s, Sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10. Better performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young type of study. <br /> <br /> I hope Hawn and Sellers have been well paid, because I see no other reason for this kind of joke in 1970 (a very good year for films - CATCH-22, MASH, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY SPARE PARTS and many others). You can not win all of them!
