In the name of Pinter, every knee should bow - especially after the acceptance speech of the Nobel Prize for Literature, which did little more than regurgitate canned anti-Americanism by numbers and in sixth. But this is even worse; besides being a tour-de-force of lack of talent, an excellent example of how to get rid of his reputation for decades, but also represents the massacre of an excellent piece. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of the genre. Yes, it was a theatrical work, and it's easy to see how the central device of the plot would work better on stage than the screen, but it still worked very well. This is a piece of Michael Caine's vanity, but let's face it, Caine is not an Olivier. Not only could he not fill Larry's shoes, he could not even fill his bathroom slippers. The aptly named Caine is, after all, a distinctly average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is his longevity in business. He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent at Get Carter, but that's right, mate! Give a very wide space and stick to the original excellent. This is another half pinter.
