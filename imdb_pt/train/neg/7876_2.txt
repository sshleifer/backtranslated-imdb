In a panel discussion I attended after watching this film, the filmmakers stated that one should look at it not as a film but as a thought-provoking. Well, the only thoughts that were provoked by me were the time lost watching the movie. The tricks of the film (documentary style, futuristic setting) served as distractions from what should be a careful examination of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political opinions - usually a very boring film that preaches to the choir.
