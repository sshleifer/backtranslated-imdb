Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose huge series of films includes both totally forgettable and repeatedly shown (for example, John Wayne in "Sands of Iwo Jima") experienced a major musical with "I Dream of Jeanie." Taking advantage of a main cast of singers with little experience in the cinema and, as it turned out, practically without future, he created a fictional offensive history and to a large extent on the great American composer Stephen Foster. <br /> <br /> Bill Shirley is the young and passionate Foster whose goodness towards slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the cost of the hospital for a wounded little boy. Her intention is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence), whose annoyed younger sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), is slowly realizing that she is in love with the almost inaccurate songwriter. Foster is infatuated with Inez, who is disgusted with the composer's number 1 on the Levee Hit Parade Tune, "O Susannah". Enter minstrel Edwin P. Christy (Ray Middleton) to help launch the profit phase of Foster's career. <br /> <br /> This is by the standards of the musical film of the early fifties, a great production. The sets are luxurious in that special Hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings. The singers are not at all bad and Foster's songs are almost impossible to destroy. <br /> <br /> But this is also a literal washing of the antebellum south. The greatest number presents the black face to all on stage, a historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of thoughtless racism. If these portraits of blacks were almost reality, the abolitionists would justly be condemned for interfering in such a beneficent institution. <br /> <br /> "I dream of Jeanie" apparently sank into the studio safe with only a whisper of death. Now revived by Alpha Video for a mere $ 4.99, it is a period piece with charming songs and repulsive feelings about the victims of the great American crime, slavery. <br /> <br /> This was what Hollywood was launching two years before Brown vs. Hollywood. Board of Education. It must have warmed the hearts of some spectators who wore bedding for the theater.
