I would not be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say this can be a good show .. This show is only good if you do not know what "talent" is .. I will not even say how offensive it is ( I know it can be offensive to many people) because that's not really what bothers me about the show .. What bothers me is that people watch this and find it funny. It makes me feel like our generation is getting to stupid and I'm really scared that one day will be run by people who watch this junk .. Basically, the plot is simple .. it's about an offensive, self-centered, spoiled women (Sarah Silvermen) going through everyday life .. <br /> <br /> That's it ... Since this was not done a million times ... In fact, almost all the jokes were made or are racist ... /> <br /> Sarah also likes to sing..I like her voice..that.not the lyrics..the lyrics are terrible..which she likes to sing about a lot of things .. <br /> <br /> If you like to see a hot woman put everyone down and make you feel like crap, while at the same time farting and saying crap about every race, then this show is for you ..
