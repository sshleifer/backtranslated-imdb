My nose is slightly out of shape as I write this. I had sent a previous review about this movie a few weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so I suppose it was rejected despite having met all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> I found this movie interesting for the first movie. thirty minutes, particularly the performance of Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who appeared in such great productions as "Blow" and "The Alamo". Leonor Watling is also very good. Unfortunately, everything eventually sinks under the weight of a truly horrible and melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of free nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or even give an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed work of art. <br /> <br /> A real day trip to the beach in Valencia is much less arduous than having to find these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime.
