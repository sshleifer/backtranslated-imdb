I was thrilled to see this movie hoping it was the sequel to the cult classic "Private Lessons," which portrays every teenager's dream. <br /> <br /> "Private Lessons II" has nothing to do with the title I mention. It's just a normal Cinemax movie that will not change your life. There's only one hot sex scene on a roof, but that's it. I've watched it for a long time, but believe me, this is just a simple, boring soft core movie. <br /> <br /> Women are hot, but that is not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to observe this only if it is transmitted by cable.
