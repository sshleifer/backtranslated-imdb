This movie was on the Romance channel, and I thought it might be a silly 1980s movie that would be enjoyable on some level, so my brother and I watched. Boy, it sucked. Boy falls in love with a girl - correction, his * dream * -girl (apparently there's a difference, and I'm surprised he realized she was the girl of his dreams - he was in love with her more than 10 yards away. I think it will only show the power of the dream girls), the boy ends up disguising himself as a woman to be close to a dream girl (creative in the sense that it is a long-term plan, but not creative in the sense that there is probably better solutions that anyone can imagine), embarrassing situations happen, a correspondence is made (all this seems to happen late in the afternoon - or the place was somehow responsible for this strange enlightenment, or the actors had to wait until they left your daily work to get to the set, I suspect the latter). Very clumsy, very pathetic. It's almost never fun * accidentally *, so there really is nothing to rescue it. Unless you're interested in seeing the early days of Chad Lowe, before he finally got his share with his role as gay-positive gay on the series "Life Goes On," or Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably managed to look at the buttocks of Dennis Franz). But these are improbable reasons - I would say that "systematic derangement of the senses" would be a more justified purpose. I'm surprised I saw it all. I think it's the kind of thing where, in the middle, you see yourself still watching because of some internal morbid, self-flagellistic problem, and you think you can finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you really sat in such a horrible movie, with the chance that it would bring some sympathy for the questionable state of his mental health. Can you * accept the challenge?
