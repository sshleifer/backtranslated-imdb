I read all these reviews here about how this is such a good movie. Eita, this movie was predictable and very annoying. The performance was below average most of the time, especially by Mckenna. I have not seen a more pathetic attempt to make someone "fuck" in a movie. Oh man, this movie was a disappointment. I also read somewhere this can be a cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just an average piece of film. <br /> <br /> The script was lame, most of the time the acting was lame, this movie was lame. Oh, and pray for the guy who used to be in Cheers. He looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably the guy in the office space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
