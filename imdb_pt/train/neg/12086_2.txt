... this person does not deal so much with the Bardo. It is still a horrible minimalist production, the Dutch uncle of Hamlet is inexplicably dubbed by a Spaniard (whether Ricardo Montalban or not subject to debate), and Maximilian Schell is overcome like never before. Most of the dialogues are unscathed and the fact that the MST3K version feels compelled to repeatedly point out that the speeches are long * duh * does not seem incredibly humorous to me. Mostly it's just bad acting, though.
