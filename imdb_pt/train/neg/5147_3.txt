'Blue Desert' may have had the potential to be a more plausible and pleasurable thriller if the lead character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not so stupid. When she falls victim to another raid on the streets of New York, comic book artist Roberts moves to a small town in the west. In her early days there, she meets Randall Atkins suspiciously crazy (Craig Sheffer, playing well that part) who will not leave his side. Fearing for her safety after having been in the situation already twice before, she attacks a friendship and relationship with city police suspect Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, a character who does not seem convincing enough, leaving disbelief among the viewers who should be convinced of the red herrings launched by the writers). Smith needs Roberts' cooperation because, as he tells her, Atkins is a former convict and guilty of sexual assault. But the cops did not have the evidence to push him away. <br /> <br /> The film had enough tactics to at least make an interesting movie, because soon there's as much confusion as Roberts should trust. However much of the intended suspense seems very forced because the Roberts character never seems to react to simple things as we think any reasonable person could. And their time-consuming responses allow much of this suspense to occur easily and unconvinced, particularly in the end. Maybe Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; also baby, staring in a way reminiscent of Kevin Anderson's personality evident in his character in "Sleeping With the Enemy." Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, that might be enough too. Meanwhile, the movie is not that good, even if it's a low budget B thriller.
