Firstly, there are some good things about this movie, but it's all clich√© slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the publicity of this film, which I saw, a great emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she is a poor actress, and not as pretty as people try to make her be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what does she give them all? Maybe it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting ... Still, the writing is fine. You know who you are all through the movie and you can almost predict what's about to happen, but not in an annoying way. I think the book is based is probably good, judging by the plot, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than see it.
