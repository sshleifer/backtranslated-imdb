Phantom of the Mall is a movie that fits best in the "easily forgotten" category. It is a very bad variant of the famous story of Gaston Leroux, the Phantom of the Opera. It's not a bad idea for you, but the plot and production of this film are weak to bring a decent tribute to this story. On the plus side, Gaston Leroux does not need to turn around in his grave yet. It could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> The Shopping Phantom has many useless flashbacks and many boring sequences to make it memorable. In addition, the writers wanted to give the story a lot more than needed. And even though there's a lot of mystery about the character Eric, the basic plot is common and déjà-vu. *** SPOILERS *** It's about a young couple who brutally shatter because the boy is killed in a fire. That fire was put in his house because he and his parents refused to sell their house in order to make room for a huge mall to be built. The boy survived the fire and he hid at the mall to get revenge. Meanwhile, he guards his girl, who now works at the mall and tries to forget her loss. **** END OF SPOONS *** This very simple - but quite effective - plot is thickened by many useless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. Although it should be just a fun horror movie, it desperately tries to be a smart thriller ... and that's not what fans are looking for. There are some groundbreaking murders, but they are not satisfactory enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. And furthermore, Phantom of the Mall could have used at least a little humor !! All this production - the cast included - takes itself very seriously. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with some positive aspects ... For example, it is starring Ken Foree !! Hardcore horror fans will surely recognize you as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! It is like the landmark of horror that has yet to find an equal. Even though his role in this film is limited and even completely unnecessary ... it was good to see him again. TV movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as the mayor, she is a great actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also at it, but I can not stand him ... so my take on him may be a bit biased. And finally, a little praise for the lead actress named Kari Whitman. She is an extremely beautiful girl and she has a little talent ... too bad she never made it to the top. In fact, this movie is his greatest achievement and he says enough about his career ...
