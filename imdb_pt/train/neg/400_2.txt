I rarely make such comments, but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured while watching this movie. It is so stupid and implausible in both general history and in the details that you simply can not suspend disbelief. The problem starts early when you see a government researcher working on a new Porsche and dining with his team at a castle-like restaurant overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington, DC This kind of life with a government salary ? Hah! It only gets worse. Towards the end, when the thug begins to kill the good guys, the last group acts so stupidly that you want them to die in order to clear the gene pool. The special effects are very good - the money of any producer can buy that - and the main actors have been great in other films, but the script and the direction here are idiots. Many people wondered if there was any deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's ("Showgirls," "Starship Troopers") stupid movies, but that movie should stop the questioning. He is simply bad.
