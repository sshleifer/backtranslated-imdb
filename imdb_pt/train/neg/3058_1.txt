When I was a kid in the 1970s, a local theater had Matinees for kids every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (anyone remember those?). They showed this thing for a year at Christmas time. Me and some friends went to see. I was hoping for a cool Santa movie. What I received was a terribly dubbed movie (you might say) and truly scary. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician (do not ask me what the two are doing in the same movie) Satan (some clown in a devil's silly costume complete with horns!). The images made me shrink in my place. I always found Santa scary to start, so this did not help. The guy in Satan's costume did not help. But what really horrified me was the wooden deer pulling Santa's sleigh. When he hurt them and the scary sound they made and the moves - I remember having nightmares about these things! All those years later I still remember leaving that theater more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends got scared too. I just saw an ad on TV and ALL of those nightmares came back roaring. This is a little creepy and disturbing Christmas movie that will probably scare any child who sees it. Avoid this - unless you really want to punish your children. This earns a 1.
