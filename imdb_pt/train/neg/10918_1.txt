Manmohan Desai made some fun, albeit illogical, movies like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he did some games like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him. Mard ko dard nahin hota but the movie is so bad that you shudder <br /> <br /> Brits are made of caricatures and the movie looks so strange The scene at the British hotel is very stupid <br /> <br /> film has many stupidity as Amrita attacking Amitabh and then the whole scene more towards the climax the movie becomes even worse There are more gems like the horse statue coming to life, The masks of Amitabh haha ​​and more <br /> /> Direction by Manmohan Desai is bad Music is well <br /> <br /> Amitabh does his part with style, nothing different from COOLIE, LAAWARIS type roles Amrita Singh is alright Satyen Kapuu is fine Prem Chopra is as always, Nirupa Roy is again as always auto Dara Singh is also as usual
