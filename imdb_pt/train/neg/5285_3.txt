Somewhere on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's works, one simply has to read them. I agree with that. However, we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers strike brings to mind that without good writers, it is difficult for actors to bring their roles to life. Jane Austen's current version of PERSUASION shows us what happens when you do not have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well represented and retained the essence of the era and the restrictions on the characters (with the exception of the bizarre parade and kiss on the street scene in Bath). The 2007 version shows an Anne Twitty who looks distressed. The other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen underestimates. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely launched, and Mrs. Smith, Anne's bedridden and impoverished classmate is walking in Bath - - kicking away as many of the characters seemed to do. Captain Wentworth's strength of character and intelligence, which made Anne love him in the first place, did not appear to be written in Rupert Penry-Jones's Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey much more with a look, than P-J was able to do with his poses. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel to a debatable melodrama, disputed by hand. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into Austen's work, they should have done what they do with Shakespeare adaptations: adapting it to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was taken from the historical and local setting and was fun to watch, as was "Clueless". This was not PERSUASION, but they did not know what to call it.
