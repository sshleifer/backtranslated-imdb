I should pat myself on the back for watching this movie until the end because it was really painful. An incapable painter becomes a fully capable shooting man? This movie was full of absurdities, of which, if I mentioned them, I would be giving the film. Norm Peterson, also known as George Wendt, must be really committed to having agreed to make this film. The performance was deplorable and the story was even worse. As a sensible and rational person, I could not understand where the writer came from or where he was going with this movie. There was ineptness on the part of all the main characters, there were a series of unfortunate and ridiculous events, so the movie ended. One absurd act after another with dialogue does not make a movie, it just makes a talking train spoil.
