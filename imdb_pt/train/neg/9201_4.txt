This is the film that synthesizes the D & D fear of the 80's (and even today). The fear is that people who play D & D (or any other RPG) are "sucked" and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and continue to kill parties, child sacrifices, suicide, etc.). Great movie for anyone who likes to blame societal problems on inanimate objects, but anyone who has played an RPG, a video game or even acted in a play will see it as an insult to their intelligence. It's for D & D what Wargames were for computers. Also, like a movie, it's kind of a drug.
