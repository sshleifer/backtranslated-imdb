Having heard so much about the Cracker series of the 1990s without seeing any of them, I was anxious about it eagerly. Certainly the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane could not go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> The controversy, backed by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, was overwhelming. The production tried to be super-modern, but the boxes flashing and even the infantile fountain irritated. Robbie Coltrane slept for two hours, presenting unexplained and improbable insights, and police portrayed as one-dimensional crooks. As a result, the tension never accumulated and the scene from the close to the end (no details for fear of spoilers) was as ridiculously bad a piece of TV drama as I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I do not want to see any more of that, but I'll go back to the DVDs of the 90's series to see if they match your reputation.
