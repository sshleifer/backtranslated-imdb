Having attended both the King Lion and King Leo II and thoroughly enjoyed both. I think Lion King 1.5 might be worth watching. What a disappointment! Disney must be desperate for revenue. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they have lost the deal with pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they just took some pieces of film that were left in the editor. (or trash can) and pasted them together to make a quick buck. Unlike LK I and II, both had a strong plot. <br /> <br /> This movie hardly has a story. While the characters and animations are always fun to watch, there simply is not enough material here for a movie. Some of the bits could have been good disk 2 fillers in the original offerings. <br /> <br /> Disney - What a shame for you to put this rubbish out to make a quick buck! <br /> <br /> Next time Enjoy the time and effort and put our enduring work.
