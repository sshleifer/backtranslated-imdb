This movie is so bad that it's funny. He is starring Scott Backula as a coach but that is not important, the important thing is the great black teammate who plays at 1st base. First he has to be at least 75 years old, but still plays minor league baseball, according to he starts the movie on the field despite not being able to walk, let alone run. The coach Backula motivates him brilliantly to first cite the fact that when he tries to run, he stays in the same place for a very long period of time. Backula shows a more brilliant coaching strategy at the end of the movie, (SPOILER) he tells his star "downtown" to hit a home run, clearly "downtown" saw this as a good move. He hit home run and won the game for his team, a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the movie majors. Now, if only Royals coach Tony Muser were as clever a coach as Backula and told his players to simply make a home run on all clubs, the Royals would never end up with an inning and much less lose a game.
