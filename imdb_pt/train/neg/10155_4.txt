I read several good reviews that defended and criticized the various aspects of this film. One thing I see, more and more, is annoyance with Megan, the idealistic political scientist, trying to change the world. I loved your character. Maybe because I'm a 23-year political science student and I think I'm going to change the world too, so I identify with Megan. Besides, she's cute. She is not super model, but more a beautiful girl next door. <br /> <br /> OK, so she cried and screamed a lot. It's very dramatic and it seems exaggerated but does not fit your character? She goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point. She thinks the people who like this show are sick. I think she made her argument very well. Of course, being a naive young woman, she is terrified of what she is about to face. I think her performance accurately portrays a young woman who shows moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. Also, I think she retained some dignity throughout the film, despite the desperate situation she was in. <br /> <br /> As for the film in general, apart from Megan, it was pretty much what I expected. He had excellent bloody scenes, by micro-budget standards. The plot may have led to a quick thought, hardly any contemplation. It's basically just a nonsensical horror movie, which the name suggests. I love the doctor's sadism. He was tearing Megan's shirt, not just for the sake of (but for the most part) carelessness, but also for tormenting her, before he killed her. The Chainsaw's hick was hilarious. For horror movie lovers, he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this film 4 out of 10. It had a good scenario, almost without plot, and a mixture of good and terrible acting. I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a rough diamond that is micro-budget horror.
