Easily the best known of all Shakespeare games, he was seriously disappointed here. Poor directing, stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a beautiful tragedy. In the city of Verona, the Capulets and the Mont√©agues have rivaled for centuries, but the tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet. The bloodshed soon erupts ... <br /> <br /> Studio work, especially in daytime scenes, seriously stains the energy of the play. It's a story that, with its energy, deserves to be filmed outdoors. Along with this, the costumes are hideous, with many tights and ridiculous pieces of code. The fight on stage looks awful, with a lot of stretching and racing to get involved. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is too light to be a truly effective Romeo. He manages the intensity of the character when the plot begins, but his imposing accent and his soft and often unimpressive eyes limit his reach. It is very difficult for the public to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Juliet - she captures the character's naivety, but a little more seriousness would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles do not do much better. Joseph O'Connor's Friar Laurence is well, but many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews's Mercutio belongs to the stage and not to the camera. He shakes and gestures excessively and seems a little ridiculous as a result. Alan Rickman, underplaying his role, has virtually no presence like Tybalt. He has developed an edge and intensity to present some fine-screen performances in recent years, but this is not in evidence here. The Prince may be a good role with his brief appearances, but actor Lawrence Naismith can not give the play any authority in front of the cameras. Only Micheal Hordern, probably his best role in this series, comes out of it with some dignity. His Capulet is well touched and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> See one of the other versions of this story.
