Audrey, I know you really appreciate the memory of your husband, Ted, but PLEASE do justice to his legacy and pay attention to your wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for good reason. We ask you to stop cashing in on your stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are being gutted by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. Tomorrow's children will be stuck with grotesque and histrionic interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of their books. <br /> <br /> It's really your property to do what you want. I just wanted you to listen to the advice of others for a while. Save what's left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
