(Dir-John Bianco): Pretty gangster movie about a godfather type family in Brooklyn who likes to say many four-letter words and kill people. The only interesting thing here was the attempt to show that the feds were very much like the gang. This is the only attempt to make a good movie. The rest of the film was predictable and cheap. The quality of the picture in some of the scenes inside bars and creep joints almost made you think there was a problem with your DVD player because of the bad contrasts and some of the actors were hard to hear sometimes because of the bad sound. The acting was a very handsome character of all his favorite movie gangster best with names like Vinnie `Knuckles' and Jimmie` Tattoos, and the plot also followed these standards. So go see a better gangster movie before you put your money to this.
