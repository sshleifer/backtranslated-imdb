It's kind of fascinating to me that so many critics consider this a masterpiece. I'm not a jerk when it comes to quality films, and I'll agree that, from the technical point of view of filming, as well as of several characters portrayed, the film is in a class worthy of prize. But it does not make sense (for me) that this movie really goes somewhere; I mean, take the viewer anywhere. It's a series of humorous scenes, perhaps striking, but I want more of a movie. I look for history and movement and an arrival greeting, none of which I have encountered in this film. Yes, it can be considered poetry on film. . . but there is a lot of poetry I can not live for the same reason: that he paints pictures without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Another thing to be said is that it documents a mid-century English childhood, which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally shocked by what a young British man had to live in that time and place. Having grown up in America just a decade earlier, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense. I can not help wondering if this contrast had any effect on those who reviewed the film so favorably. In other words, could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely by its "film magic" (which I acknowledge to be there) and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of the actual experience I have remembered?
