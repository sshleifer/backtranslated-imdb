the editorial staff of the journalists and the demanding press officer and the sobbing bitch were aggressive and clich√©d. <br /> <br /> I can not blame the actors, but surely someone must have said "you're kidding, I can not say that!" <br /> <br /> This episode had a press and perspective perspective while the police perspective was standard enough, the perspective of the press and the characterization were exaggerated and at insults incredibly unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I note that this was a co-production of HBO, if so, so maybe the sledgehammer stereotypes can be explained in that light, <br /> <br /> I was completely shrunk during the conference scene of the press. lacked credibility and did not seem remotely true. 40 minutes in the first episode and I'm still waiting for the suspense. <br /> <br /> Skip Five Daysthis. the production of 2008/9 with these characters is much better and more full of suspense, even if the crime is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> This story has unforgivable moments that can only be described as incredibly unbelievable. <br /> For a press aide start a press conference without a research official present to answer the questions of the press. <br /> <br /> So, unbelievable, it seemed like an amateur hour. <br /> <br /> I started looking for the journalists called "Scoop" and Perry White to make an appearance. <br /> I saw the 2009 Hunter before "five days" arrived in Australia, not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to Bonneville and McTeer walking again. Head shaking horribly.
