Common and flat suspense about a conniving woman who fools everyone she's supposed to love to raise her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays Tracey misleading, married to the passionate Andy (Bill Pullman). When a former friend of Andy's school named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) appears as the resident surgeon, the problem is not far behind him. <br /> <br /> The script fails as it does not carefully develop the promising premise. effective and tempting thriller, and the serious lack of character motivation, experience and development make the whole show within reach. No one in the cast is able to generate interest in their superficial characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe. <br /> <br /> Poor director Harold Becker is trying to resurrect an incredibly dead project, and is incapable of making entertainment of any of them. When the 'secret' of the plot is revealed, you just do not care. <br /> <br /> At least cinematography has Massachusetts with good looks. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
