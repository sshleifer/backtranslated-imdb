Basically a typical propaganda movie for the last good war. But there were some things that impressed me. First was the use of epithets in the mouth. In two cases, the character Scott mouths one, once in the beginning, when he drops his bomb off the target during the bombing ("damn") and once when he is trying to influence a bomber to be a pilot (" t "). I could be wrong about the second instance, but I've repeated it several times and that's what it seems to me. The third case is when the character of Anne Shirley wishes goodbye to O'Brien's character and good luck ("Give 'em hell') about the roar of the engines. She must have thought it was very different from a lady because she clearly says "heck." I also find interesting the character who has moral problems with bombing, specifically bombing civilians. The avuncular superior officer assures you that only military targets will be hit due to the accuracy of the bombing target used. Given what we know about LeMay's later strategy of bombarding Japanese cities in oblivion, this scene is not a bit ironic. I remember McNamara quoting LeMay in "The Fog of War," something in the sense that if the US did not win the conflict, he would be tried as a war criminal. The ending is very elaborate, according to the film. This reminded me a bit about the end of White Heat (I'm not comparing the movies, just the ending!). Maybe it's just because he's blown up. Exploded really good !!!
