The movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between. But the cast of women gave a pretty good show than males who were laughable. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really rocked in the movie. Her voice was so seductive and sexy. The scenes in the bed involving Krista should have shortened, but she was as attended and sexier than anyone else. Krista really is one of the best in such roles. She also promulgated pretty quiet as the villain in the last 5 minutes, which is the interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not so good and this was not his best as an action star. He could have chosen a better script than that. I really think he did it for money.
