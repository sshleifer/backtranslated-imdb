Usually, when a movie gets a vote of one, it's because someone just does not like it and gets annoyed by not having a lower rating, and decides to drag it down as much as they can, instead of just giving a low rating. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 movie. You do not do anything right and you do not have the chance because you do not actually try to do anything. There's a kind of bad plot of D & D that does not hold up and a complete lack of any kind of acting. Of course, no one involved in this project gave any kind of serious effort, because even a hard work of people completely without patents would be more than that. A truly horrible movie.
