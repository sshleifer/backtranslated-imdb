Not totally off the wall in a good way, but just totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is an uncomfortable mix of science fiction, horror and supposed comedy. This amounts to an irrational and totally incoherent film. There is very little dialogue, mainly due to the fact that the script, if there was one, is complete "lagoon scum". I would not even say it's strange, more like "total absurdity". This movie will certainly disappoint, and you've been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, the pungent smell will last like rotten fish ......................... MERK
