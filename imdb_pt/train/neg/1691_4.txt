This film is nothing more than a series of tense sequences admittedly well crafted, punctuated with an unavoidable "catch"! at the end of each. Really, there is no character development and no real plot to speak. There is only the skeleton of motivations for the characters to do anything as they advance to their inevitable dooms. It's all just an excuse to show a scary ghost boy (who seems to have gotten a bit of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mother (with long black hair hanging from his face like "The Ring") a lot of cutouts cardboard, two-dimensional excuses for human characters. <br /> <br /> This English version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying momentarily, but not really what you should be living. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
