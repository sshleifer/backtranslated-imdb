Aaron Spelling produced this feat for the western television that gets terribly entangled in a seventy-three minute movie. Plays as a likely failed series rider. Beautiful Clint Walker is the American Marshal Dave Harmon, who enters Yuma, Arizona, in time to kill one of the brothers of the local farmer who is off a car trail. <br /> <br /> Walker takes the other brother to jail. Walker also meets a homeless, "fluffy" Mexican boy who sleeps in jail. One night, Andres is dozing off when a villain and another man dressed in navy blue take the remaining brother to the street and kill him, assigning the murder to Walker. Not good for your first twenty-four hours at work. Walker visits the local Army fort and irritates the commander's chains. The big man hears the death of his brothers and returns to the city in time to pick up his chains as well. The local native population, which is reduced by the Army in relation to the beef, also gets angry in the area of ​​the chains. With all these chains becoming difficult, Walker still has time to win over the local hotel owner. The Army guy involved in the murder ends up dead, the local buyer of cattle is implicated, the Indians make many hesitant speeches, and the climax causes an unlikely confrontation, since Walker must prove to the town that the villain buyer livestock had a boss. Someone we suspect is very useful all the time. <br /> <br /> There is a semi-subplot involving the death of Walker's family in the hands of army invaders, and I think this would have been the force behind the series if it had been caught. Instead, the movie abruptly ends, and I've been waiting for scenes from the exciting episode next week. Because of the fades to the nonexistent commercial breaks, the rhythm is in all this and its history jumps. <br /> <br /> Walker is handsome, robust and has a voice deeper than a pit. The rest of the cast is full of television actors you've probably seen in other television movies. Much of the action is very bad and violence is tepid. The first dead brother gets a shotgun shot and falls without a scratch on him. I did not expect "Reservoir Dogs" but this is the wrong movie to teach kids about the evil of guns! Speaking of children, the Mexican boy here goes from "fluffy" to "aneurysm inducing hassle" very quickly. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the Western, then you will not like "Yuma". If you like Western, then you still will not like "Yuma". I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is not evaluated, but it contains physical violence and armed violence. <br /> <br />
