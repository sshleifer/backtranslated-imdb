B-movie actress super sexy has another small part as "Goodfellas"'s future girlfriend, Ray Liotta, in this box-office bomb. She plays Marion, has only one line of dialogue, well, a WORD of dialogue actually. She shouts "Joe!" as Ray's character is raping poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so bad that it becomes funny, hilarious sometimes. The guys at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this! Check out the hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the corny editing and effects they do to try to show how much Pia's character is freaking out. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. Pia Zadora as a writer? Okay, right. Pia can hardly speak, let alone write! Pia is absolutely and utterly wrong in this stupid role. But who cares? The real star is Glory Annen hot and fresh in her small part in the opinion of this cat! Rock on Glory!
