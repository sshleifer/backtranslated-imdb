Plot: The four-hour film covers in detail the events in the Kargil sector near LOC in 1999 when Pakistani infiltrators crossed the LOC and entered Indian territory and Indian retaliation. To learn more about the story, I would like to suggest to readers to read the news regarding Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: If someone is looking for a story about formulas in this movie, you can be sure that they are absent. LOC is a story of sheer sacrifice, patriotism, courage and many, many bullets and blood. The movie theater where I saw this movie was full of whistles and applause when the movie shows the Indian bravery. The audience of the film looked similar to the audience in a cricket match between India and Pakistan. Watch the film as a tribute to the Army's sacrifice and the characterization of the real heroes of the war (4 heroes awarded with PVC) who sacrificed their lives so we could see that day. The film made a brilliant portrait of the Army that fought against all adversities in adverse weather conditions. The negatives of the film are that it is very stretched and the songs are extremely boring.
