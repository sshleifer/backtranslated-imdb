This movie is faked in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think the MST3K was at its best when they ripped this movie. Terrible acting, bad makeup, poor effects, bad-tempered girl (1960). I give 2. 2. The villain is difficult to understand due to makeup. The wizard says things like 'not you' that sounds like NACHOO !! (think sneezing). It's just a poor prayer. Long eyebrows are hilarious in one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what 'The Projected Man' means in terms of plot. I missed a bit from the start, though. <br /> <br /> What is the minimum limit of 10 lines to post?
