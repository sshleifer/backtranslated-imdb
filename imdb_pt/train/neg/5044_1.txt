I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. Besides, I'm also a Shangri-la, so there was more than a passing interest in the subject. However, after watching it, I was extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the movie was terribly slow and monotonous. The director remained in certain scenes for a long time. There was no passion or chemistry among lovers. There was almost no dialogue. Dialogue was extremely necessary to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the movie, you did not feel any sympathy for the characters. This movie was missing at all. The script was weak, the performance was poor and the editing was non-existent. The director tried to imitate certain styles of noir films, but failed miserably. A good movie is one that captures your attention, maintains and succeeds in completing without you feeling that time has passed. This movie looked like it would never end. Do not waste your money on this movie.
