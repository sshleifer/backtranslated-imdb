I know that some films (I mean European films), which are very bad films, are being considered as a big cinema by certain "critics", just because they are non-American. I saw the score of 8.1 on IMDB for this movie and noticed the fact that this was being selected for certain big festivals. Do not let this fool you! Unless you're one of those people who likes such mind-bending movies and call it great art then skip it! The film contains one hilarious scene after another (a similar film in Italian popped up in my mind, the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not just boring, like some other oddly praised movies, but that they almost play like a camp. I mean, let's face it, the acting is horrible (I mean: novel level), the story does not have a surprise (this was done endlessly before, connecting several plots: SHORT COURTS, MAGNOLIA, PLAYING BY HEART, only much better) , not a realistic character in it (some real crazy along the way, watch the hilarious zombie daughter), and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, the film is 135 min. (count!) for a long time, and in the end the director opens his can of sentimentality. After a movie with such a hilarious dialogue and scenes that made the audience in the preview laugh so much of incompetence, well ... This is an insult to the cinema, and only gets high rates because it is in another language, in this case Spanish. Strange world in which we live ... 3/10
