Let's go! End Pakistan knocking guys. Bollywood can not only make brilliant movies but can seriously affect a generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Bollywood, but anti-Pakistan movies only make me shudder too much to like script, cinematography, action. I am very happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that they did brilliantly not just because they deserved it because of the quality of their Bollywood masala - but also because he tries to say: give a chance to peace and show that there are fools out there both sides that do not represent the masses.
