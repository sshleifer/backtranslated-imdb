I'm a guy who loves movies guy ... I was anxious to see a dragon fighting with the army with cool special effects. All of this happened, however, this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was normal, but the picture of the story was terrible. The scene transitions were the worst I've ever seen. Why would you go out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger? The snake dragon's own actions were very poorly written ... and the snake dragon's attacking abilities varied greatly throughout the film, several times the main characters should have died. The director tried to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times, this film was obviously not watched after it was done, I love movies, but I had to force myself to finish watch, thank god I did not buy this, I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this, do not rent it, just watch the discovery channel ... much more exciting.
