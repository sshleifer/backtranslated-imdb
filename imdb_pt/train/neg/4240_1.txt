As we all know, Hollywood likes to change the historical events to our pleasure, and 44 minutes is one of those hollywood films. For example, bank robbers never returned to the bank when they started filming in Los Angeles police, but in the movie we see them coming back in twice! Another example is the number of LAPD cops who were shot near the end of the movie, this is far from true! But of course Hollywood must have a good ending so they * add * more blood and courage. Some events were combined and many of the leading actors played a lot of different people, but that's what Hollywood always did, so why complain? I think the only sad part is that I watched some one-hour documentaries about the North Hollywood shootings on TLC that were way better than this!
