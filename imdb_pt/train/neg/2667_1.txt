Kalifornia is disturbing. I believe there is no reason for this story to be told. It is not fun and has no social value. Technically, the film is very well done, the performances are first class and first class. The story unfolds in an intriguing and interesting way. But in the end this movie gets sick and is repugnant to decency. I would highly recommend Kalifornia to anyone.
