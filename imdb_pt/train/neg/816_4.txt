In the 1970s, WPIX hosted "The Adventures of Superman" every weekday evening for a few years. From time to time, we got a surprise when they tried to anticipate neighboring programs to broadcast "Superman and the Mole Men." I always craved these days. Watching this recently, I was amazed at how bad it really was. <br /> <br /> It was not bad because of the special effects, or the lack of them. Admittedly, George Reeves' Superman suit was too bad, the edges of the foam filling used to make him look more imposing, clearly visible. And it is true that Mole's dress was even worse. What should have been a skin cover would not have fooled a ten-year-old child, since the zippers, mango sheaths, and poorly stitched fabric badly sewn into loose-fitting clothing were all painfully obvious. But these were pardonable faults. <br /> <br /> No, what made it bad was the plot's intended devices. Time after time, Superman could not do anything to stop the situation from deteriorating. A crowd of lynchers are looking for creatures? Instead of surrounding the hysterical crowd or looking for the creatures themselves, he stands by to explain the dangers of the situation to Lois and the PR agent. Are the creatures cornered? Again, he keeps watching and talking, but does not save them until they are dead. Luke Benson, the city agitator, shoots him? Attempted murder for any reasonable person, but Superman releases man over and over to cause more trouble. Superman had some opportunities to eliminate the problem, but never took advantage of them. That said, both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters, seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles. . If only they'd been given a better script to work on.
