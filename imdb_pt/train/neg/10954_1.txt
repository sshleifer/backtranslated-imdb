If there was a 0 star rating I would gladly deliver it to this absolutely horrible pile of waste. The fact that the actual summary is perfectly good and that, had it been done differently, could have been brilliant, would only make the situation worse. The basic task of locking up a group of people in an experimental chamber is good, but WHERE THE EXPERIMENT? All I see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes talking about music and culture that I do not know or want to know about ... The challenges are pathetic and silly. The main point of reality TV is to show REALITY. If you set a 'challenge', do not make them play with overdone food props and stereotyped cultural elements in 'Friday night games'. make them make a real challenge. And as for winning cash prizes, fine, if they really win! These people are crazy. If only they made the show better, the real idea would be glorious. But that will not happen!
