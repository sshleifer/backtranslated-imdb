I just bought VHS in this movie for two bucks, I lost my money! Hey, I like Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise, but hello! This third rate of production is a repetition of a dozen other motorcycle movies; crazed group of motorcyclists, psychopaths walk in a hick town, beat everyone and everything, and then are defeated in man by a dashing hero. Adam West looks like the hero, but he's missing the cover and his Batman uniform. Sorry, it's not the same. Tina L. looks very nervous and scared the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" when she was rescued from the island ... LOL! The motorcyclists are a heterogeneous group, and the acquaintance of them has already acted again or at least it should not. Hell Riders is hell to watch!
