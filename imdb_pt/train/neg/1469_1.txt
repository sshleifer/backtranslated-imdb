Like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movies, "Indian Summer" is a sleep-inducing sleep. Eight alumni campers are poorly introduced, when incredibly boring flashbacks begin for characters about whom we know nothing. Fine actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this movie. A camper's remark that "everything seems much smaller than I remember" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make him squirm. Early pranks are neither funny nor original, unless you think short sheets are a real "howler monkey." This film was a big disappointment considering the ample talent involved. "Indian Summer" did not make me homesick, just sick. - MERK
