In the first place, it is a very old film, not focused on its exposition of the left political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to stop being intellectual (which in itself is totally meaningless, since the answer was obtained precisely because it is intellectual), this reduces me to despair; as if we should all be monkeys again in the name of equality - it's just ridiculous. Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but that does not mean that we should not educate ourselves to the highest degree possible. But undoubtedly this non-educational message is linked to the use of rock music by Godard; hence the Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song 'Sympathy for the Devil', whose creation we witness, and which the film bears the name, is nothing special. The chord sequence, which is not especially original, was used with much better effect on Ledky's Led Zeppelin (Led Zeppelin II). In addition to the way that, "Sir" Mick Jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner (much like Bob Dylan) - notice how the first melodic phrase is repeated without imagination to form the verse. Besides the fact that the Black Panthers portrayed in this film do not seem to know why they are fighting, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that actually harms the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today (in fact, a message that belied the Rolling Stones' behavior at the time the film was made). <br /> <br /> No wonder, the DVD came for free with the Sunday Times! For a truly profound historical exposition of the sympathy of the left, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, "Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore".
