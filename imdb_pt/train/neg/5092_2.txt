Shocking! <br /> <br /> In 1965, I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and gentle, he was at ease and seemed a well-educated and intellectual person. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and imitation. They made a cartoon! The real Gagarin was someone else! Do not believe this movie! I saw this movie after the films like "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading the books "Rockets and People" by Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and Facts" by Golovanov. I was shocked by the tiresome scenery, poor acting and production, and a lot of inaccuracies of "Space Run." <br /> <br /> The film is the tedious performance of well-known historical facts in Russia. A lot of interesting known facts of space projects have not been demonstrated. Some facts and details were perverted. For example, in 1945 Korolev was no longer a prisoner (released in 1944), and in 1940 he was no longer in the gold mine of Kolyma prison but in a special prison designing agency. Korolev was the designer in the design department of the prison and he was not buried the dead prisoners. But in the film Korolev worked as a digger after 1940 (because the jailer has straps in the uniform). IMHO, the film's authors have no in-depth knowledge about this part of the story and can not make interesting films.
