The saddest thing is that this was supposed to be the biggest budget that "Halestorm Entertainment" had to work with. Everyone involved should be fined for throwing garbage, since all the celluloid they have wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash. Not only is writing atrocious and the jokes horrible, but the camera work and movie quality are amateur at best. The soundtrack looks like it was created on some expensive PC laptop. The worst part of it all is that I really sat the whole thing down. I guess just because I could not believe I had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I was watching had actually agreed to show the "movie".
