I saw this movie first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply edited by the censorship committee. But then, in Poland, in 2000, I watched it completely. And then what? The plot is incredibly imprudent - two men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of strong, straight and fundamentally severe feminists. Men now try to fight it, and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clich√©s follows - sexual desire, constant masculine desire for sex, feminists who are shown as complete idiots (you can agree with them or not, but idiots certainly are not), and so on. Even star Jerzy Stuhr's performance here is wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls up dull faces and repeats saying phrases like "I'm in the elevator with a naked girl and I did not do anything to her!" This was meant to be a comedy, and it turned out to be an insipid farce, full of predictable jokes and hints below the waist. Do not waste your time - this is bad.
