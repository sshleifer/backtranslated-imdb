I like British humor, I believe it is one of the best in the world. I like almost every British comedy (okay ... maybe not Monthy Python, some of the jokes were great, but some of them I did not understand.) But this Gentlemen's League is just something good to make you sick. This show was good somehow; helped me lose some weight because seeing this piece of junk makes me feel like I'm not hungry any more. This is really just disgusting, sick and not even funny TV show and I wonder who is really laughing at these things. I watched for about 10 minutes and hung up. It was so disgusting, to see men clothed with the woman with yellow teeth and to pee in the car ... I mean ... what's so funny about that? It makes me want to vomit. No humor, just disturbing images and cheap, bathroom laughs ... I do not know ... if you like these things ... go ahead ... watch ... but to be honest, people watching and enjoying this should have some emotional problems. Garbage.
