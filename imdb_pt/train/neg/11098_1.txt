Like most people, I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film, especially the aspect of "filmmakers were then attacked" that the case seems to emphasize, with the image on the cover of the filmmakers being chased by an angry mob. <br /> <br /> So to watch the movie and find out, oh, what they mean by "the filmmakers were attacked," some children threw stones at a plate and a number of people complained loudly and said "Someone should beat the two children. "The image on the cover," the chase "as if it were? Total manufacturing. What I think relates to the theme of the film, lying and manipulating to satisfy vain and stupid children with more money and time than sense. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what great truth the viewer should do. away from this movie. It's like Michael Moore's "Roger & Me," but if "Roger & Me" was Moore mocking Flint's people. It's completely misdirected and totally futile. Wow!! Do you believe that the people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited about having markets full of food? What idiots! And it's not much, "Look at the effects of capitalism and the Western media, blah blah blah," since it was not just their fake market that had prices comparable to competitors, it was that as many people in the movie say, the prices were absurdly low, someone mentions that they should know it was false how much they charged per duck. This is not proving anything, except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices, way to put people in the background. <br /> <br /> Way to play a stupid joke on the elderly. You should be very proud. How about for your next movie you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people will get really excited about a house without bullet holes on the walls and then say, "HAHA! NO HOUSE EXISTS! ITS SO STUPID AND LOVED TO BE DEAD BY THE MEDIA! ". Morgan "Please Like Me" Spurlock has released this wet fart from a movie and it's no surprise, since Spurlock as the prince of the world documentary One Hit Wonder seems to throw his weight behind any concept silly to stay relevant in a world that does not really need it. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
