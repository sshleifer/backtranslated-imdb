I know the people and I did a bit of animation and graphic design and the show is horrible! They are small, rich kids who have no talent, and probably begged Nick to accept them! Alex played drums for a year, I played for 4 1/2! The movie is terrible and so is the show! This is the craziest, most confusing comedy I've ever seen. It's so stupid that it makes me want to vomit !!! It's so crazy that Nickelodeon would accept something so stupid! They are so stupid and strange! I hate them and their show and I think once Nick realizes how stupid he is, they'll hopefully get him out!
