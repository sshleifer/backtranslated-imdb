My favorite memory of this show and the band was when I met with a lot of friends who are enemies of NBB and we made a big bonfire and we took a CD with their songs and the DVD of the movie and a lot of photos of the movie. band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead." That was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a god capitol this show sucks. I hate it so much. Get rid of low quality car. You really suck! You really ruined the whole channel! No offense or anything, but you guys have to have a life, I mean, really, who does a stupid show with a stupid vocalist who does not even know how to sing! You really look awful and need to have a life like hobos or something, except Roselina. She is very beautiful. But still, you reak!
