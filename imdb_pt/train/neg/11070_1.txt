This was a really bad movie. The character "Cole" played by Michael Moriarty was the biggest reason he failed, the actor thought that invoking an incredibly clumsy southern accent would make this character more evil, but did not. After about 20 minutes I wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance, that would have added some sincerity. <br /> <br /> 1) acted badly - 2) insensitive characters - 3) thin razor plot line <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
