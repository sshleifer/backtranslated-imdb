As I watch this movie, it's interesting to see how much that marginalizes black men. The film spends its time showing how impotent the most visible black man is (except for a heroic moment). For most of the film, the other black men (and dark-skinned black women) in the film are deep in the background, barely visible. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams' character was strong and friendly. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with it. There are also some very visible, three-dimensional support characters that are light-skinned, and some White characters of some warmth and dignity. But 99% of the black men in this movie are nothing more than invisible men. Shadows without voice in the background, without consequences. Such a horrible failure, but nothing unusual in the mainstream media.
