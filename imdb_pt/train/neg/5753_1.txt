... although for a movie that seems to be trying to sell itself as a horror, there was a clear lack of blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a distinct lack of targeting, interpretation, editing and writing a script. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London did one of the most dreadful performances I have ever seen - his "descent to maelstr√∂m" from madness is painfully self-conscious and awkward. Oh look at him squirm! Oh look at him drinking spirits! Oh look at him raise his eyebrow and lift his head at a happy angle! Oh, look at your dirty, greasy dark hair! Oh, hear your voice hoarse! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh, yes, here comes the poet's shirt - it's another boy who thinks he's Byron. (Or Poe.) Oh, for the love of ... Someone gave this guy a handbook on "How To Act Good" or they just took it from a cardboard box somewhere, the little plastic toy extinct on a discontinued brand of cereal bargain-bin. Okay, that was a stupid line - but that's only because the London performance has melted my brain with its horror. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is cute, and very briar rose, but has yet to grow in her acting shoes in this film - she delivered her lines as if she were being held, in fact, her entire performance was a lot of wood, her poses as rigid as her lines - who knows, maybe she was just reacting and trying to counteract, jeremy's bustle of excesses, but if so, she takes it too far. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy is Arie Verveen as Poe - while the role of your character is confusing, it offers the best performance of the piece. It just seems right, but it's more than that - it has some kind of depth, I believed he had a life beyond the two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. Huh, maybe it's just because I like Poe, and could thus let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen - anything, he had an otherwise absent interest factor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are a faceless blur - there are all the usual caricatures: the best blonde friend who is a bit annoying; the wounded local cop who is an idiot; the old protector who may have a lot of nonpaternal interest in our heroine; the intriguing old witch, etc., etc., yawning, yawning. As with the 'distinct lack of blood for a horror film', none of the themes they mention (and which the London character mentions - so gravely - in his attack on Poe's writing ) is followed by em. As another critic said - there was potential here: murder, incest - genuinely shocking things, but instead they escape trouble and cut off violence (a raised candlestick swinging through the air - closing the victim). This is good in a traditional Noirish horror, in fact, is expected, and is warmly received when it happens - it's a darling convention, especially when accompanied by fake lightning and intense Siouxie eye makeup - but in 'Descendant' it just seems clumsy, or as if the editor felt sick at the last minute and interrupted him.) This could have been a very tense psychological suspense - the horror of palingenesis / illusion / madness - or a simple (and fun) horror movie: it tries be both, or neither (something new and exciting!), but fails miserably anyway. The only element of horror in this movie is its epic stupidity. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if there was one) must have gotten drunk when he / she cut this thing - there is a clumsy shrinkage. scenes; scenes that seemed to be out of order (but that could have been just the poor script). Similarly, the director and director of photography - there were some very strange scenes and frames that I think should be tribute to Hitchcock or Browning, but they ended up looking silly (again, great in a noir, but this was trying to be something else. ) <br /> <br /> The whole thing might have been funny (so the previous analysts mentioned - "OMG how was it done?!?") if I were in the mood for some crap. bagging, unfortunately for me I had settled on the couch, with the lights down, with the express intention of scaring me - this is a really bad movie, and I can not recommend this to people, not even for laughs. <br /> <br /> Please, please do not waste your time or money on this - borrow a real horror / suspense movie, or find a copy of Poe's fantastic tales, anyway, you'll get a much more pleasant and frightening night than you could hope to get with this crap.
