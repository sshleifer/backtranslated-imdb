When Rodney Dangerfield is on a roll, he's hilarious. In My 5 Wives, he's not on a roll. The timing of one-liners is wrong, but they are the best thing for the movie. The five women who play wives do not add a whole actress to each other. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is very weak; There are some jokes about having multiple wives, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the film could be played in the same way, even if Rodney's character had only one wife, so the premise looks more like an old man's fantasy than a fundamental part of the comedy. Another old man's fantasy: we must accept that Rodney's character is an athletic skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to be calling in his role just to do a favor to a friend, and the rest of the name the actors should simply be desperate for work. <br /> <br /> The strange nods to the politically correct later in the movie do not really do anything for the movie. For those who enjoy their politically correct movies, non-PC humor is still there, and the apparent apologies for it still do not understand the subject. For those who hate watching a political invasion of the movie, PC add-ins are just annoying digressions. <br /> <br /> This has to be the lightest movie I've ever seen. There are some funny jokes, and the scenes from the rooms would have made a shocking TV 40 years ago, but that's all. Maybe they were topless men (joking). <br /> <br /> The DVD features interviews where cast members seem to find depth and importance in this film and in their roles. I wondered if they were serious or joking. They look serious, but I kept thinking, "They must be kidding!" There is also a peculiar statement suggesting that since the film never names Mormons or the Church of Latter-day Saints, it somehow is not about them. It does not matter that the film has a polygamous religion in Utah and refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, My 5 Wives was a disappointment. I was waiting for Rodney on a roll, but the best I can say for the movie is that Rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time.
