I was not really expecting much when I went to see it. After JasonX's Mst3king with some friends, I was hoping for a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film took itself very seriously. Do I worry about Jason's problems? I'm sorry, no. There are legion Ft13th films that cover this anyway. At the end of the day, he's an undead serial killer, I will not be so sympathetic. Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the film with the hallucinations and what not, but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie they had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch ... just not funny. <br /> <br />
