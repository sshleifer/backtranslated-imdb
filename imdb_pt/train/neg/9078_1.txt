Would not it be great if Not Another Teen Movie really put an end to all these stupid, nonsense, am I making more sex than you are to teen movies? In a perfect world, yes. However, this is even worse. This is not demeaning to the stars, it is humiliating to the distributor. All jokes are basically college students exposing things that people are probably not interested in seeing, but it's "funny." Devon Sawa, who was really good at Final Destination, is simply bored in this movie. It makes you wonder if you're being bad on purpose. Grade: F
