A movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a husband Mountie that she loves ... but she also loves sex! Throughout the film, she gets several men in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also a lesbian (tamed) sequence. <br /> <br /> This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I believe) the first critically acclaimed X-rated film. It was a big hit when it came out. Unfortunately, it does not go well. <br /> <br /> Well run and Erica Gavin is great (whatever happened to her), and it was very colorful ... but by the current standards it's extremely tame. . I'm surprised that it has an NC-17 rating now - there is no hardcore sex and it only has topless females and no male nudity. It is also (sadly) very annoying and the policy addition at the end was confusing (and very silly). Worth getting to see what was considered very shocking in 1968. Supposedly I saw the cut version (which has an R rating) but I only heard a few seconds here and are missing. <br /> <br /> Meyer's upcoming film, "Beyond the Doll Valley," is much better and dates VERY well. Take this instead.
