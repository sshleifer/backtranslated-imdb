I will begin by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms "filmmaker", "movie" or "movie" in relation to it, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a bit harsh. <br /> The writing: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The direction: pathetic. <br /> <br /> The acting: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: too inept for words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills used to ride this atrocity: NO WAY. <br /> <br /> This piece of junk could hardly be called cinema. Most family home movies are closer to earning this distinction than Revenge Quest. No, this is just a stack of 10 cars captured on video. <br /> <br /> Let's ignore the plot in this review because there are many holes to be covered in one go. Let's just say that this is worse than the rest of the movie. To call the one-dimensional action would be to give them credit. What little there is, it's atrocious to begin with, and it got much worse with the awful video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this atrocity, beyond plot, would have to be the effects. ... or rather, the disturbing lack of it. There are no gaps in the guns, no flashpots, and few sound effects existed or were "guns" sounds, or they were generated by the mouth (yes, you read them right). The filmmaker really had the audacity to record a "shh" sound for the elevator doors; I think he felt this sounded more futuristic. This is supposed to be set in the year 2031, after all. This does not explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist fight scenes, however. <br /> <br /> If it was not bad enough that the sound quality is terrible (he just used the microphone that was mounted on the camcorder, and shows), the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than using no sound. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack as a drunk drunk on a flock of sheep, and they are so clumsy. Imagine this: the thug enters a building looking for its prey. A lady starts running in fear. He raises his weapon (an uzi) and shakes it. We hear a sound that clearly is not an uzi. The woman runs away from the camera and suddenly a single pack of blood (only 1) explodes on her back (looks like she was hit by a paintball), and she falls flat on the floor. <br /> <br /> Remember that my description does too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, one that almost - but not quite - makes the movie funny enough to watch, happens on a staircase. . The thug chases the good guy and the girl he's protecting by the stairs, wagging his plastic uzi all the way. You may want to lower yourself; there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place. <br /> <br /> I assumed that Alan DeHerrera could not be locked up for conceiving this train accident, but he followed it all the way up to edit it and release it. . If there is any justice, there is likely to be some karma out there with his name. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch that piece of industrial junk - and I strongly advise against it - be sure to watch for the entire scenes taken almost literally from Bladerunner, and the AM radio that doubles as a walkie -talkie. Try not to focus too much on the plot; it will only hurt you more if you do it. <br /> <br /> 0 stars out of 10. And that's being generous.
