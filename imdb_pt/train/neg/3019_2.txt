how can you take your tough, glamorous and violent bounty hunter story seriously with * that * accent? It's absurd In addition, the director's visual style is nauseating and enigmatic, the plot is a shallow, boring, confusing gangster movie and the acting is not convincing. The film features new characters throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - apparently just to keep it nice and confusing. The movie shows you THINGS THAT DO NOT REALLY HAPPEN and then say "this really did not happen, it happened" - see the (apparent) murder of the "first ladies". What did we see the first wrong sequence of events by then? <br /> <br /> Choose terrible in the cast, a confusing and confusing plot and a headache inducing style. 1/5
