Dude, the end of this movie is so inaccessible and dated that my whole cinematic aesthetic class laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the movie was fine. He had some funny scenes unintentionally, but he had some good photos and camera editing. Yes, Alderich is a great director who made the film "The Flight of the Phoenix and whatever happened to Baby Jane," among others. The problem is not with direction, acting or anything technical. The movie was just destroyed in the third act. Because? The murders, twists, turns and characters have revolved around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the hell was the writer smoking when he came up with it? The way it came out of nowhere may have been the greatest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about the Planet of the Monkeys of Burton, the life of David Gale or Notorious I think this is the worst end ever. What a disappointment.
