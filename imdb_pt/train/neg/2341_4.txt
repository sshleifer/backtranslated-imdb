Ok ... it seems like so far, only Barman fans have commented on this movie - time for a counterpoint. Beware, this writeup is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who are not in the know (mainly non-Belgians): Tom Barman, director of this film, is the lead singer of dEUS, one of the best known rock bands of the late 90s here in the Belgium. Basically, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly achieved fame on a national scale. So the egos started to ache and the band basically broke up, with Barman and a few others left to continue making albums under dEUS-monicker. The way it always happens in these cases, the post-collapse dEUS was much cooler and less interesting than the original. They tried to go for an international breakthrough with the album "The Ideal Crash" in 1999, featuring a very diluted form of their previous style of composition. They could not. However, the egos were still quite big: big enough for Barman to consider himself an artist enough to try out movies. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, this kind of thing is a MUCH big mistake, and this movie does not make the exception. And Bartender clearly went by * art * on this, another big mistake. On the one hand, he is a musician, not a film director. On the other hand, the dEUS is more fun and provocative, but never closer than I would consider * art *. This shows. <br /> <br /> So, what is this movie about? Basically it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people doing similarly uninteresting things over a totally uninteresting Friday in Antwerp, as even more uninteresting things happen to them in the act of being uninteresting. The characters are superficial, the plot totally meaningless and the film simply has no other redeeming quality to compensate for these defects. Humor? The whole movie made me smile (lightly) about 3 times, and actually managed to elicit a 5-second chuckle (not too loud). Humor? The film simply does not seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling. Mystery? Well, (* SPOILER MINOR *) the idea of ​​the "wind man", inspiring the name of the movie, is as fascinating as a pepper pizza - not much, and has been made thousands of times before (anyone remembers Johny Destiny - one of the worst appearances of Tarantino in the film to date) (* END SPOILER MINUT *). And well, it's * artistic *, so do not expect any real action to compensate for all of the above. In other words, except for the few smiles, it took me out of my shorts. <br /> <br /> So, what's left? Well, the soundtrack is very good, although it suffers from some of the same problems that other OSTs have shown lately: first, it makes the movie look like nothing more than a commercial for the CD. Second, it sounds like Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the movie behind the quality of the music content, which just does not work. In the end, it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs. And unfortunately, it's Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack that gets the most attention, though it's the weaker part of the entire soundtrack as far as I'm concerned. All in all, it's just to show that Barman knows more about music than movies. Camera work is also good, although it's not something that makes you shout for joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the vision factor. Since I was born in Antwerp, it was fun to play some sort of "guess the place" game. I would hardly consider this as a quality. <br /> <br /> All in all, another missed chance for the Flemish movie. I keep noticing that lately the best Belgian films come from the French part of the country. This is mainly because at least they have something to say and can say in a way that is both acute and emotional (the Daerden brothers come to mind). Maybe the Flemish filmmakers should try this too.
