There are two points I need to clarify right from the start. First of all, we all know what this year's Oscar was REALLY about this year. It was the Academy's way of showing people that they were not racist and never were. They wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves. Secondly, it is kind of pointless to comment on the program, because really, what difference will it make? But it's fun to write about it. This is the year I've had enough of Oscar! I will never watch the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe won for "Gladaitor" when the real winner should be Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you have not seen this movie yet, watch it and you'll agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" when released received no nominations. And for this year, well, bad choices were everywhere! Baz Lurhmann receives no nomination for "Best Director"! You are kidding!! "A Brilliant Mind" is for "Best Makeup" ???? Is "Training Day" indicated? The movie was horrible, and it looked like Washington did not even introduce himself, all he proved was that he knows how to use four letter words! That's what won the prize! Take the language and I bet he was almost playing alone! I liked the "Gosford Park", I really liked it, but why 7 directions? And how on earth they could not give Altman too! I mean, come on, if there's just giving the prize to people to clarify any bad feelings, and how much Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years and has no Oscar! There have been many, many things that bothered me about this year's Oscars, but, I'm going to live with it, as long as I never have to watch another show again! The highlight (and ONLY) of the show was when Woody Allen made his first appearance at the awards. This will fall as one of the greatest moments in show history.
