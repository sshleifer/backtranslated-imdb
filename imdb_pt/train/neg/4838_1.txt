I decided to watch this because he was nominated for an Oscar this year. I think a lot of people here really wanted to like this movie, but I ended up bored and disappointed. The first scene was OK, but the rest of the movie in camera mode "shaking hands" is really annoying. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason for making a movie and naming it for Oscar is: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The American "military machine" (people who profit from war) urgently needs an excuse or war justification in Iraq. <br /> <br /> "heroic" efforts of the director and main character to _populate the public with a "love-war-as-drug" idea? Oh, please, come on! how boring <br /> <br /> see this to get an idea of ​​how low the movie academy can fall ...
