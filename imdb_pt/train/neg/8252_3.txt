What was with the sound? It seemed that everything was dubbed. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. Plot = bad. Highlights = bad (even Dougray, and we live in Scotland), acting = bad, harp = bad, sex scenes - bad / bad. <br /> <br /> Still, we see this to the end in disbelief. How could such a good performance of actors be so bad? Will they get a decent job again? <br /> <br /> Bad, Bad, Bad. By the way, we gave 3 because we were at least seduced to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot, etc. <br /> <br /> And to the older critic - I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce of the 1940s. How was it done in 2004? <br /> <br /> OK, OK, there were a few bits OK. They had a good house in Bristol. Dougray had a good boat. Jennifer looked cool in a little outfit. But how did the sister get all the men?
