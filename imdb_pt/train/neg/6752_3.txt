Unfortunately, lower than high. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike other modern horror movies. The other good thing was the cast. I'm not saying that acting was good because it was not, but every actor / actress was hot and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the downsides is that the film only becomes exciting after the first 40 years. minutes or more. The rest was very annoying. Another downside (or you might consider it if you want to) is excessive nudity. All 4 girls went topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed off their butts for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers'. <br /> <br /> Unless you're too desperate to see some guy take off his swimsuit and run naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a stubborn fan of Debbie Rochon, who this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
