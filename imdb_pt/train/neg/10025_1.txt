If this is a 2008 product of one of the largest production houses in the Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj), then I fear it will be far ahead to meet the right standards. <br /> <br /> If you can go wrong with this huge cast of stars from Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then movie production will still be well studied by everyone involved in this film. The film lacks almost every department except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. It has some nice dialogs to render, but that alone can not make you enjoy a movie with high expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car descending on a mountain river has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon movie. This in itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision. Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted. Anil Kapoor's trick of trying good English falls most of the time. And Saif will surely be surprised wondering why he signed this movie. <br /> <br /> In short, it is the biggest waste of resources after "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say even "Aaja Nachle" was a better and nicer movie than that. <br /> <br /> You can not understand how and why this script was written and approved. The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. After the defective script, the weakest point of the movie is its music. Vishal Shekhar gave only a few songs for each song. The songs begin very well and suddenly the songs fall dramatically. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good on the lot. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> Regarding the manufacturers' intelligence of continuity, just prove this: Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of ​​a foreign location (probably Ladakh). In the next scene, they are looking for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the middle of the car. I'm still thinking who wrote this. <br /> <br /> If you can sit up to the last, then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts. You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of unharmed bullets as if they were GOD. Are we still seeing a 2008 film with all these technical heights? So, there are no more words about this pathetic and demoted movie, but a heartfelt request for the senior actors of your fan. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, If possible, please request a preview of your movies after your first copy. It is out. As artists of such stature, you have certain responsibilities to your fans and viewers. People still clap when you enter the screen in their first scenes, respectively. I think this kind of movie should not see the light of day, as it makes it difficult for everyone associated with the film, the actors and the house of production.
