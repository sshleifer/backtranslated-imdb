How is it possible that no journalist or critic has reminded us of the similarity to that other Flemish film, "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some characters from the Congo Express together without actually having a relationship with one another: Jean, (from Congolees), the worker, the two taxi drivers, the street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels was not. This should not be a reason to forgive the flaws in the script (if there is a script) of Anyway the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) At the ice party in the fridge is taken from that great Flemish movie "De Witte (1934)", in which De Witte is putting lots of salt in the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie, but there is no explanation later. Tom Barman gives us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch on television than a movie in theaters. Another missed opportunity for Flamenco Cinema.
