I read the book and I liked it a lot from start to finish. However, when I saw the film, I was very disappointed. First of all, no disrespect to Deborah Raffin, but she was too mature to play a 24/25 woman. The late Christopher Reeve was also miscast-same motive. Will, according to the book, was about 30 years old. I'd love to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend Red, Elly's journey to see it as an important part of the plot's development of the characters. Also Miss Beasley was miscast as the book mentioned she is a Plus Size Lady. I know the movie did not have the "Bridges Of Madison County" budget, which I believe was released around the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me this was a low budget movie and poorly done. As someone mentioned, I would like Ms. Spenser would come out of retirement and write the scripts of his books as they should be. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope she considers casting as well. The movie let me down!
