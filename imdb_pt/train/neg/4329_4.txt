I will never forget the wit and comedy of the movie ORIGINAL Vacation! The lines, rhythm and rhythm of the events in this movie are great! However, this sequel to European vacations is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the Griswalds win a European Vacation in a game show. The problem is that many of the film's jokes are little more than light, "ha-ha" laughs. For example, a flight attendant asks Clark: "Do you want your Coke in the can?" Clark replies, "No, I'll have it here." That's really about the single line that's funny in this movie. <br /> <br /> The mood of European Vacation is tense. As if the writers had borrowed all the jokes from the first film, they tried to redo a script that had already been done before, and featured a ridiculous sequence of slap chase scenes at the end of the movie just to kill time. Worse, the natural comic book highlights like Randy Quaid as Primo Eddie and the original children who played Rusty and Audrey from the first film so well can not be found anywhere. Their replacements are not funny, they can not act and they seem to be going through the motions most of the time. There are also some jokes and rude comments that are not just funny, they are in bad taste. <br /> <br /> Griswald's should have stayed in Wally World. The place that made them legends! Do not join them in this terrible European adventure. Viewers should watch the original holiday movie again instead! You'll be glad you did it.
