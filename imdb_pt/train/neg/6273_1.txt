This was a cute movie by the end. The end was just another despicable effort to weaken men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who finally relinquished her power and control over her relationship with her. It was not by chance that she was sitting behind the wheel of the driver while they left, after he had to beg and beg for her to take him back. This movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them. It was a despicable film for that reason.
