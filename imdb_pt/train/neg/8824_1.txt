What you can possibly say about this movie other than "careful viewer". Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes, because that was harmful to my eyes and ears. I'm rarely dissatisfied with a "b" horror movie, but this movie could not even scare a five-year-old. The point of a relentless lunatic who thirsts for blood in a movie is that he / she must seem almost divine, as if nothing could stop his manic rage, but in this film the resident psychopath gets trapped in a chimney in a movie. Bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course accompany Santa's popular legend is a reminder to the viewer that this man is not dangerous because he is too dumb to be dangerous. All in all a total waste of film.
