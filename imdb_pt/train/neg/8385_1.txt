I just realized that by watching this movie, I missed valuable precious moments of my life and will never come back. This movie is not only bad, it's terrible. It reminded me of all the stereotypical black sitcoms of all time. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia thinks it's a racial issue, apparently white people do not like it because they do not have white actors. Mate, I think you'll find the reason no one liked that because watching dry paint is so much more fun and funny than this pile of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Please stop making bad movies
