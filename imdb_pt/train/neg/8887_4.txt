Good movies can not be based only on a beautiful garden and on top of a hill. Surprised to see that he won two awards. Extremely overrated. I first saw this kind of movies from China, visually stunning, but also with something really captivating to say, well, over 10 years ago and I'm sure there's still more coming up. This is not one of them, I'm afraid.
