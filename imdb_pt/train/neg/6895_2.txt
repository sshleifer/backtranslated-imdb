The plot is rocky. The acting is somewhere south of a Jr. High School play. Cinematography is not bad, but it looks like it was cut with a machete. I could not decide that this was an intentionally mushy movie or if the people behind really thought they were making a good movie. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running in a modern 'lawless' city using six fast-shooting platforms. You have more than your fair share of cutsey material. Imagine the Good Guys arriving at an old farmhouse and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a trail. Imagine a hotel employee watching an obviously Western movie (hemisphere) with a Japanese soundtrack, but with English subtitles. It's all very strange, but it can be improved if you're watching while you're part of a small peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every clich√© of Western movies you can imagine. There is even a modern version of the good-hearted ballroom girl and a strident Jewish harp on the soundtrack. Same! If someone brings this to your home for a movie session on Saturday night, tell them that your DVD player has died.
