This film is the first effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. Although it has some problems, as all low budget production does, it is a good start for Ms. Beaton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story is not very new, having been made in films like The Burning. and every Friday 13 since part 2. But, the performances are sincere. So many big budget films only have the actors going through the moves, it's always good to see actors really trying to improve their craft. <br /> <br /> History deals with the murder (and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. The others swear by the secret, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, friends are killed one by one by a horrifying persecutor known as "The Bagman." Who will survive? You have to watch. <br /> <br /> If you're Roger Ebert or any other kind of arrogant critic, you probably should not bother. But if your taste runs more for Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people tweaking their craft, then check out "The Bagman."
