I just could not finish this movie. I hung up after what I would call my nomination for the most miserable attempt at the sexual suggestion award: a scene in which Pia Zadora, on a picnic, sits between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) asks her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she would like a hot dog, which he then holds for her. At the groin level. I hope I do not ruin anything to say that she turns around and picks up the hot dog with a smile. Just pathetic.
