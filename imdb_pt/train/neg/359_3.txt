I've seen my fair share of bad endings and final twists in movies, but I do not remember any movies that have committed such a direct suicide. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers were clearly hoping that the big turnaround would "surprise" us all ... and it happened, but maybe not in the way the directors expected. I was surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn, and Capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The film until the final thirty minutes was quite engaging and I liked the way the story unfolded and the nature of the film in general. But once the turnaround was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived, and the ways in which things so clearly worked for Bobby Earl were ridiculously forced. The worst is that, once the turnaround was revealed, the rest of the film became extremely predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gave a great performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a poor performance, even if the movie is not great! So everything starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes are one of the most memorable dives in movie history.
