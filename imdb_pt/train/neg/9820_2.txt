I'm glad some people liked that, but I hated this movie. It had a good idea for a plot, but that's when it ended. It was poorly written, misrepresented and poorly made. <br /> <br /> He had some interesting points, but they were simply skipped, writers needed to realize what to keep and expand these bits, such as lying about why she was kidnapped, and abandoning the scum. Instead, it was "what's going on?", 5 seconds later, they tell you. <br /> <br /> This movie had no suspense, and I was bored from beginning to end. I just wanted it to end. <br /> <br /> Go and rent the misery, or the best plans if you want suspense or twists that lead you to guess to the end.
