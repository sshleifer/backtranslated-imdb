If Mr. Cranky had evaluated this, I would be tempted to just copy his comment and paste it here. But as he does not have, I'll have to give myself a chance. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives this film a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's acting is excellent. However, not even he can save this movie from disaster. The director must have been very distracted when he worked on it, because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were played together with very little continuity - reminiscent of bad films of the 70s. Worse still, both the actors and the director seemed to be inventing what happened, which probably showed how bad the original script was. <br /> <br /> Nor is it worth discussing the plot, although it revolves around a futuristic. The corporation called the Proxate Corporation, which set up a team of expendable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container ship / slave to Nigeria. The computer on this ship is a baby kept in a glass jar and connected to one of the crew via USB 12 or something. The company should have been called the Prostate Corporation, since the entertainment value of this movie is on par with an examination of the same name. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not find a scene that I can say that was well done and made some real sense in the context of the movie. I just watched until the end as I had a touch of bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse than me - Malcolm McDowall in particular. I will not keep this against him as he is a great actor and every great actor is entitled to a bad movie in their careers and this is a doosie. <br /> <br /> So unless this is the only movie your store hires or you're a man and your doctor is not getting prostate exams this week and you somehow feel that it's a bad thing, so give this person ample space, of course, if you really are a citizen of the community, buy a copy to support Malcolm and use it as a drink coaster.
