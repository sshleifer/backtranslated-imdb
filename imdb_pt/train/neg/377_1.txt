Do not even ask me why I watched it! The only excuse I can say is that I was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change channels. :) It's too terrible for words, the movie is, not the bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, Richard Grieco considers him a serial killer, gunman, with a fall by police. Nick Mancuso calls on a performance as the cop in his career and Nancy Allen manages to put the only nice role in the entire film. The script is bleak, peppered with clich√© lines: "Are you ready, Pardner?" Richard Grieco purrs to each of his victims. Dire Avoid.
