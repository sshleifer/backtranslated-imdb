First of all; It is very amateurish to attempt to describe the path of history only from positions of weapons, germs and steel. The same tried to make the Marxists of economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success can not be just luck, the advantages of domesticated plants and animals. We see that all over the world advantages and bonuses are useless if not wisely administered. In Japan there are no large natural resources, but Japan is one of the world's major economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, country with rich petroleum resources, there is only half-low success. Both nations had and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why such a gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond stated that it is very important to understand the factors of weapons, germs and steel, to UNDERSTAND. Perhaps the main factor of the difference in the world is not geography, but people's ability to understand and use things? The mental capacity to understand. And in this case, geography is only subordinate.
