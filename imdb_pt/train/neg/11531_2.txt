The plot is so manipulative, relying completely on the most unbelievable and unthinkable decisions of adults in all parental decisions. Children are super as much as charm and delivery of the lines, but as I say, the whole plot depends on each adult being complete idiots and therefore in that case making more sense of their actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain male actions of total mistrust). Why would cute boys take a baby from the beach? How did the baby get to the beach, and at the same time, is the LAST place to be searched? Why would the two boys NEVER be told, at the same time that a baby is missing, no one gives a shit about them running around with food and diapers, with all that commotion going on and literally everywhere else he looked? There is no possible justification for asking the public to believe that. Asking to believe that this would be brought to trial (even in the informal setting) is very insulting to be discovered.
