The saddest thing about this "tribute" is that almost all the singers (including the incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have lost the point where Cohen's intensity is: delivering his lines in an almost unarmed posture, Cohen conveys the full extent . of his poetry, his irony, his complete humanity, laughter and tears in one. <br /> <br /> To see some of these beginner singers make convulsive faces of suffering, cast their pathetic screams at the patent effort to shout "I'm a singer!" It's a real pain. It's the same sentiment that many of you probably heard in some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs like Lennon's "Imagine." Nothing, simply nothing comes close to the simplicity and frankness of the original. If there is an art form that does not need embellishments, it is Cohen's art. Embellishments threw him on the street looking like the tasteless make-up of sex on sale. <br /> <br /> In honor of this Cohen, I found myself suffering and suffering through lamentable tributes and terrible reinterpretations, all of them totally without the original. irony of the master and, if truth be told, several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show. It's Cohen doing a tribute to them, letting them sing their material, in fact, not the other way round: they may have been friends, or from their daughter, he could have become very sensitive and willing to gift this. Too bad he did not stay in the family. Fortunately, but only in the end, Cohen himself performed his majestic "Tower of Song", but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background. of U2, all carrying the expression that bored children have when they visit their poor grandfather in the asylum. <br /> <br /> A sad show, really, and sadder if you really love Cohen like me.
