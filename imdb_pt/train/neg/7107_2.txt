I'm sure there's some kind of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K did. After seeing this and "Werewolf" and reading dozens of comments about how they are underestimated, I was convinced that there is some connivance going on here. Many people are saying that people who hate "are only afraid of blood," "I do not know good horror," or things like that. Well, I do not really care about blood, but I want ANYTHING to happen in a movie! Most of it is just the woman sitting around and looking around! Or walking through the house / garden! A movie requires something to give the impression, you do not understand only senseless scenes, someone walks around and looks. Oh, and "does you think"? Yes, I was thinking "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Q. For the record, I'm a big fan of the old horror style, Dracula, Frankenstein, that sort of thing.
