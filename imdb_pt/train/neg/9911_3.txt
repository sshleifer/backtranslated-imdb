If you have loved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio or any other distraction. Massive talent is totally wasted on "Three Days to Vegas," with guilt falling on the screenplay. My neighbor's vacation movies are just as interesting as this misguided road movie. If you want to see how to use a veteran cast with a good script, check out "The Crew". There really are no redeeming factors here, and watching these wonderful actors struggling with this weak stuff is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the superficial script misleads the audience, essentially giving the actors nothing to work on. - MERK
