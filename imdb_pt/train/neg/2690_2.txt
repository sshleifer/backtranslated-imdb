Hey, if you have a little more than an hour to kill and find too much ink to excite her, I would suggest. If you like cheap b-movies like me it's good for a giggle! Also, I would not suggest you rent it, I'd wait until it got into the tube around 4:00 am on your cable / satellite provider's free access channel. The band that made this trail down the road was on the road after about two years after that movie, and no, they sounded as bad as live according to the two small town ratings I could find in them. So again good if you find grass growing a lot of fun but it is good to watch if you like to see how NOT to shoot a low budget movie.
