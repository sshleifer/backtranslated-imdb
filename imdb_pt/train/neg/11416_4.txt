The fact that this movie was entitled to the most successful film in the history of Swiss cinema makes me shake my head! True, but regrettable at the same time. A film about the Swiss army can be much better. <br /> <br /> The story seems interesting at first: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in church, marrying his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). <br /> <br /> The acting somehow really does not differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned. Melanie Winiger plays her role as the strong Michelle Bluntschi mediocre, personally, I found her quite annoying. <br /> <br /> The plot contains a comedy combined with a novel, which does not work as expected. The romantic part is very bad, and the comic part is not funny at all, it's just a cheap attempt and does not change throughout the movie. It's funny for pre-teens ages 12 to 13 but not for those looking for a fun comedy. Humor is weak, except for a few shots. <br /> Damn? Nice! Stealing? Nice! If you want a proper comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure not to absolve your military training yet, and even then do not expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give it 4 out of 10 stars because Marco Rima is very funny during his screen time. Not too much screen time
