And a few more "no" on top of that. Voodoo Academy is undoubtedly the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly is this trying to do? Tell a story? Obviously not; As it has been pointed out, most are from bad guys rubbing themselves. Could it then be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism? Well, maybe, if not for the fact never, never go beyond the most innocuous and non-threatening forms of male contact. (Which is, to the delight of no one, repeated about eighty thousand times.) Well, it's a kind of horror movie; Are you trying to scare us? Not unless the director wanted to do it through the boredom and lack of validity of his "job." <br /> Never in my life did I enjoy a movie unless. This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I've ever seen. It's as if the Voodoo Academy took the genres of horror movies, zombies and gays, put them in a grinder, then went through a coffee filter - except that instead of being the kind of coffee filter that filters coffee beans, is the type that takes everything from vital, nervous or in any interesting way. The result is 74 minutes of film as exciting as a glass of lukewarm water - except without the ability to rehydrate it after the 10-day binge that will inevitably happen if you watch for this abomination of human effort.
