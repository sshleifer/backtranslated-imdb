They were a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, but I could not believe he made this movie. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does not even come close to the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma can not create chemistry between the characters. There is no camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There are almost no scenes with more than two people together on the board. The out-of-court sequence with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face each other is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have made this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen were trying their best, but no use. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather useless. Mohanlal did complete justice and proved again that the acting is all about facial expression and body language. The rest of the cast was below expectation. The comedy situation that was adapted from the original Sholay dropped flat in this film. Ram Gopal Varma might have worked on the script, but because of the controversies surrounded against the film he messed up and just for the sake of making him do this Aag. But there is no fire.
