Roy Rogers and company try to bring "Sintown" back to life - it's a ghost town that can thrive if silver mining succeeds. Andy Devine (as "Cookie") beats around. Jane Frazee (as Carol) loses a piece of her bitches to Mr. Rogers's malicious stare. Foy Willing and the Knights of the Purple Sage, stand-in (or, that is, sing-in?) For the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson (of the Laurel and Hardy films) contributes to the "slapstick" look of "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose floor board offers the performance of the winning comedy. Mr. Devine's mule kicks his heels. There are energetic human performances too - but the material is not Grand. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
