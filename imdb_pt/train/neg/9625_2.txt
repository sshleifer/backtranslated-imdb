This film offers absolutely no imagination in its premise nor in its execution, but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this comedy call that has no energy to speak. Story is about analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller), who finds his new wife Lisa (Debra Messing) betraying him with a diving instructor (Hank Azaria) after only a day on a honeymoon. Returning home, Reuben and her best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to a party and meet Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) with whom they studied years before. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree, which is the opposite of who Reuben is as a person but they start dating and Reuben starts to change as a person when you start experiencing new things, like salsa dancing. and eat spicy food. But one day Lisa returns and wants to remain married to Reuben, but he does not really want to, but Polly decides to leave since she does not believe in marriage. <br /> <br /> This movie is the movie. second driving effort by John Hamburg, who wrote two generally bland scripts on "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents," but these two movies look classics compared to this obsolete piece of drivel. It's very easy to say that something is not funny, but I think with this movie it's even easier to figure out why. This film is totally and totally predictable from beginning to end, with each scene looking like it's just happening because of the script's ridicule. Hamburg, who also wrote the script, seems to have written this without thinking of trying something different and sometimes he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as "There's Something About Mary," but the events seem incredibly forceful. Has anyone really found the blind ferret funny? If you do, it's easy! Sometimes during the film the characters would inexplicably have those emotional speeches that should summarize everything, but all they achieve is to exaggerate the obvious. Stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the best scripts to come his way because this movie does not work like a comedy or a novel.
