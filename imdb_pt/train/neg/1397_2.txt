Let's see, here are the "highlights" of The Brain Machine: 15 establishing plans for a pool and a home; 15 setting shots of an undefined office building; 5 countdowns by a gentle technician; 7 close-ups of a threatening guard; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech experiment. Several posters commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given in the 1977 DVD box. This is easy to explain. This dog simply sat on the unpublished shelf for five years, until someone dusted off, thinking that it fit perfectly into the post-Watergate climate of distrust in the government. After seeing The Brain Machine now, my only wonder is that it has already been released!
