SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's that simple. There is no redeeming quality about this movie. The first 10 minutes are quite complicated - they really lead you to believe that this movie will be shocking and put you on the tip of your seat. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes pounding while watching stolen and poorly made scenes without organization. The lake was ridiculous, looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. The characters show their advanced powers of teleportation, for example, Alex Thomas, who falls into the lake (drunk) and then ends up in his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon presented a regrettable performance as Kate, aggravated by the breakup dialogue of the space-time continuum that seems to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader. An example of this would be when she said "Flashlight!" in such a stupid way that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can shrink before falling in half. Finally, the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrible I have ever seen. It was as if cameramen were a bunch of chimpanzees who received camcorders from scientists. An example of this would be when, suddenly, we received a close-up of the lighthouse in Alex's car. I'd bet there was little or no time spent editing this movie. The ending was absolutely pathetic. The writers were obviously trying to create some kind of mysterious plot that made the viewer say "oh yeah!" Instead, we are left to see an idiot painting of a spider that somehow fits the story line. Unfortunately, there is not a prospect in the millions of people who could save this movie from being crap. <br /> I give it a 5 out of 10 rating, being the .5 of the fact that this movie was recorded in the movie instead of becoming an image book.
