Despite its flaws, I enjoyed "Cigarette Burns," episode of John Carpenter in the first season of the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story looked like a cheap cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still very good for the budget and the time constraints given to it. With "Pro-Life", however, low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There is a solid direction, as always, of Carpenter, but there is a quality to the writing and all the production that gives the feeling that it was made in a full and complete race. The script is not always clear, the message is confusing, and the story is filled with plot holes when you look back. Maybe if Carpenter had rewritten the script, it could have been a worthwhile episode. Instead, it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the least pleasure. Definitely the worst Carpenter ever did. 2/10
