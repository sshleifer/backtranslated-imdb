Yes, there are great performances here. Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that seems to have no idea what it's doing. During the first 45-60 minutes of this, all music presents itself as a realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour later, the characters who, until that point, have always spoken, suddenly begin to sing to one another. To further confuse things, a little further away, out of nowhere, they do about 15 minutes of dialogue, then seem to give up on that idea and move on to other things like a number that starts at a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a huge section of invisible strings. In addition to all this inconsistency in how music is used, it is the clear inability of composers to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed. While the first couple of pieces mimic the Motown sound of the 1950s, the rest of the film is just (bad) Broadway show. Then there's the sheer nonsense of excerpts from a group doing an imitation of the Jackson family and Eddie Murphy transforming from Little Richard into James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder, I could not help but laugh out loud. This was clearly one of those films that make me enjoy the little time I have on earth and I resent that I lost two hours watching this movie.
