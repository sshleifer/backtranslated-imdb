Jason Lee does his best to bring fun into a silly situation, but the movie can not connect. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the character of Julia Stiles seems strange as the conniving and sexy that soon will be cousin of law. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because she and Selma Blair's characters should have been chosen the other way around. (Selma Blair seems more conniving than Julia would be). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is more of a Hollywood trivialization of a possibly real situation (than being caught with your pants on your bachelor party not lowering your cousin), who despite having promised not to deliver. <br /> <br /> There's some laughter to be sure and the cast (even if it's miscado) does its best with sub-series material that does not transcend its obscene topic. . So, instead of making a successful festival (for example, Animal House or American Pie) we get a partial mood of humor and part stupidity (ala Meatballs 2 or something).
