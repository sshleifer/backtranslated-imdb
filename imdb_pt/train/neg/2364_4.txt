"Freddy's Dead" did the smarter thing it could have done after the disappointment of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Of course, this "final" movie in the saga is silly, but at least it's original. Some of the visuals are even a bit of a breathtaking one. And the story of Freddy's son (Lisa Zane) returning to town to face his evil father is unique. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is nothing but another cartoon made to take kids to the theater. There are a lot of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and wander like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick, and in the end, it's nothing more than silly and childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
