I think this piece of crap is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why do all American animators think kids nowadays want stupid versions of good stories from GI JOE? the Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in the story, but they were not meant to be Xtreme, I mean, come on !!! Tiny Toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without losing its original charm, but this piece of junk is just one example of stupid corporate decisions that just want to create a cheap dumb show that kids will love because hey !! ! Kids love superheroes right ??? the whole show is just a waste of time when we see the new versions of Looney Tunes, but this time in the form of superheroes, this does not look too bad, but the problem is that this show tries very hard to copy series as batman the animated series, or the new league of justice, the result ??? bad copies of flash (the road runner) or superman (who else ??? bugs bunny) the problem is that Looney Tunes was not meant to be dramatic, it should be funny !!!! As I said before, this series sucks, and many people wonder why the anime is taking everyone around ??? This show tries to be dramatic and action packed, but this is something few series and anime are able to do, if you want to see a good update of an old Tiny Toons show, this is an example that you can bring come back to life old characters but with a good story and respecting the original roots. too bad that show is already dead, another wise corporate decision, I suppose.
