Why do I watch movies like that? - besides having a strange misleading masochistic belief that one day I will find a real jewel among all these scum, I can not think of a good reason. This film was dross from start to finish - but semi-hilarious scum. Where else, except in a bad Italian dubbed movie, you could find hot swapping of such shabby Englishmen as this between an honest military type and the sinister chief of a secret X-Files organization dedicated to hiding "The Truth" > Man in Black: Silence is best for us until we can prove that UFOs have no bellicose motives. <br /> <br /> Military Type: Anyway, I consider your interference abusive. <br /> <br /> Man in black: Who has to impose his will is. <br /> <br /> I rewound the DVD (you know what I mean) a good half dozen times and I still can not make those lines mean anything sensible. My other favorite phrase was: "We can be very hard on those who are against our interests." <br /> <br /> It's Englishman Jim, but not as we know him. <br /> <br /> The other highlights of this film's movie score for me were the fully spaced out performance of the character photographer at the beginning. Sealed with the worst haircut ever in the history of all, the man just wandered around looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig until he was kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of acrylic by some aliens. The aliens are no longer seen as a POV photo - a portable camera with a fisheye lens - half scary the first time, but, used again and again, it has lost its power (incidentally, if it is a shot point of view). means that the aliens always leave the rooms for some reason). The film was set in "England". This meant that Italian Spanish set designers put some British plates on some English cars and put a Union Jack on our hero's press card ... and that's about it. No other attempt to make the UK look like. <br /> <br /> Favorite moment? When the Foley artists did not notice that the characters they were foleying (is there such a word?) They were no longer walking on the gravel, but were now on the lawn, so that their feet continued to do "crunch!" noise. Other than that, another total waste of 90 minutes of my life. I hope they prove that these UFOs do not have bellicose motives soon ...
