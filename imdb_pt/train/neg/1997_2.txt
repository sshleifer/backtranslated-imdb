This version is probably available at your local dollar store on DVD. The printing is not great, nor the sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or more minutes to spare, you will receive the value of your money (which does not mean much). Anna Neagle is extremely insipid like Nanette. Whatever their charms in the past, they are not evident in this film. A large number of fine-character actors appear in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts and Even Arden), but the material falls far short of their talents. Still, it is interesting to see how these talented artists make the most of poor writing. The musical numbers (there are only two) are pretty awful. Clearly, the studio did not feel compelled to profit from the rich musicality of the original "No, No, Nanette." For what it's worth, the DVD can be purchased for $ 1.00. It's worth just saying you saw it.
