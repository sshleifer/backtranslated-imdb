Weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring this down. <br /> Flay being the worst. Definitely a pony of a trick, I think they could have gotten other American chefs to come to the table in this one as the Iron Chefs. The kind of dishes this duo actually creates ... does not reflect the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series. I do not think Batali even went to the chef's school, actually. There are many great chefs in the United States, I just wonder why they do not show up on the Food Network. <br /> <br /> It would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts who can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he's a little irreverent / funny for that role.
