For months leading up to the release of this movie, you saw the ad in all kinds of print media, so I waited patiently for its video release to see what all the hype was about. After it was over, I had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. It essentially fails because it is a character-based movie about non-redeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you do not support any of them. The film is based on his dialogue which is sophomoric, moronic and crude. The only slightly entertaining character is Eric, whose portrait of the only married member of a group of friends is dead. The finishing touch, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only inspires the same kind of resentment toward Peet. All in all, only rent if you are desperate or have a black sense of humor.
