I've heard about this movie for many years and finally got a chance to see it. A mass murder of cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 ended up causing a cheerleader to close. Advancing to 1982, Bambi, a former student, opens the list with new recruits, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, they are murdered by the killer, until only one remains. That's when we find out who did it and why. Also in the movie are Tom Smothers making a terrible accent as a Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens doing his jab with Pee-Wee Herman. The plot in general is not very well developed, and rather idiotic, but some funny scenes occur, namely the House of Bad Pies and the strip poker scene. The end looks like it's thrown together, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Overall, good for about ten or fifteen minutes in total, the rest you can simply move forward. Maybe get on the TV, but not worth buying.
