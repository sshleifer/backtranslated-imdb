A very interesting black and white exploration film written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-engineered and strangely appealing. She looks like a demented Renee Zellweger with a bad hairstyle. This puppy only made two of those movies and then returned to Texas. The music is terrible. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name. <br /> <br /> Better music in Tony's movie - "You're putting me on, doll? Not one of my girls put me on." Good photography B / W by Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locations (cold pool, also used in DEFILLERS). Odd but appropriate ending. A 4 out of 10. Best Performance by Stacey Walker.
