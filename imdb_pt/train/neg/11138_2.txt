Let me start by saying that I read a lot of reviews before renting this movie and kind of knew what to expect. Still, I was surprised at how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I'm a big werewolf fan, and I got used to forgiving a lot when I watched one. Most of them have sub-par effects, poor acting and weak stories (at best, portrayed in previous films). So far, with the possible exception of some of the latest "Howling" movies, this is the worst of the batch. <br /> <br /> First, the story. It has been quoted several times in comments on this site, so I will not go into details. However, it is very obvious that the writer (s) had absolutely no affinity for licantropic monsters. As so often happens when a horror movie is given to a writer who considers himself "above" such a fare, they have tried to create a new twist in the werewolf myths. Okay, but a non-terror fan trying to do this usually disregards the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing to them. The plot looks like a parody of werewolf movies, and the events portrayed sound so false that I felt my intelligence being seriously insulted. Images of TV news, for example, never move away from the reporter to approach someone in the crowd behind them. Give characters and viewers credit for being able to identify the villain in the scene without using a blinking neon sign. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> As for the effects, I have NEVER seen a less believable werewolf. I would have been happier with Lon Chaney Jr. in crepe hair. The beast they used is a lot like ... well, like a guy in a cheap rubber outfit with a little hair stuck and some really horrible animatronics. And I know a lot of people have already criticized the CG, but my God was horrible. One scene shows a woman changing and begins with a full version of the actress, naked, but for some reason without nipples. My first thought was, "Hey, why is one of the characters in 'ReBoot' turning into a silly-looking werewolf?" <br /> <br /> Anyway, I like to look for positives in any movie, and there were a few. The cinematography was acceptable (the film was filmed entirely digital, which is interesting) and some of the presentations were not terrible. It was also interesting to see Tippi Hedron as the most successful woman in the world, and Kane Hodder as the villain title. Besides, the Yellow Power Ranger has grown and ... well, dammit. And if you're looking for skin, there are some very tasty examples. This ends the male pig segment of the review. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a good werewolf movie, try "An American Werewolf in London", the original "The Howler," "Dog Soldiers," or even "O Wolfen" although this one has more wolf than it was). If you are a more complete lycanthrope then take a look. Otherwise, give this one a miss.
