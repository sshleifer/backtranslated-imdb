The Slackers, as titled in this movie, are three college friends, Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel, respectively) who are about to graduate from university without going through an honest but successful examination . This continues to the end, when the nicest character in the film, Nathan (Schwartzman), discovers what they are doing. Nathan begins to blackmail to make amends with the girl of his dreams, since he can not pursue it under normal conditions. The only problem is when the trio starts working on it, Dave falls in love with the beautiful and good heart Angela (James King) Unfortunately, it's not a genre movie genius. Schwartzman makes it easy to watch the movie as his performance is brilliant. King's performance is medium, I think she was hired just to be around with her beautiful look. The Slackers is reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction. Jokes are as shallow as American Pie. But are not they all used? I think this movie is a warning to filmmakers of the genre that they are losing their originality. Overall, some smiling moments, but a horrible movie in terms of acting (except for Schwartzman) and subject matter. * outside of *****
