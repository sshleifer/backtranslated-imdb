I feel that the film did not portray Smith historically. The purpose of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be "comfortable" for LDS Church leaders, historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The film was designed to be a "faith-promoting" experience, not a balanced view of Smith "as a man." I took on the responsibility of studying the life of Smith and read LDS works and no LDS works. The film, like most LDS projects, was filmed and well represented. However, this was not a realistic portrait of the early days of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> A significant period of time was given to reenact an accident that Smith had when he was seven years old. Although this event was undoubtedly important in shaping his mental outlook, it seems that the main reason for including him in the film is to help establish a comprehensive view of Joseph Smith. Another point is to portray Smith's adolescence the film is silent about the Smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820s. Another problem is that while the movie shows Joseph Smith humorously entering wrestling contests, he does not show as he sometimes lost his temper and became violent. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. This film was not historical at all and should be considered a fictional film about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other than the entertainment.
