I was convinced to watch this movie of a friend who was crying about the cute story that this was. <br /> <br /> Yuck. <br /> <br /> I want my two hours back, how could I have done so many things more productive with my time ... like, for example, spinning my thumbs. I do not see anything redeeming about this movie except for the sweet-eyed aspect of it ... 3/10 (and that's generous)
