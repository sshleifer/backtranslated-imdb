Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good and strong plot, but it is ruined by extravagant details throughout the film. I'm a younger teen and I did not really like this movie. I thought the effects were horrible, but they might seem fun for younger kids. The matrix moves ruined action, you know it was absolutely false. Then there was Yen Lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming where Wendy was struggling to win. It all ends as a typical movie of feeling when Wendy and her Buddhist monk Shen cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) in the end. So Wendy learns a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
