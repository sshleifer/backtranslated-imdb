** May contain SPOILERS ** The topless titular heroine rescues another cute baby and his father (an eccentric teacher whose helmet stock is broken in one shot and all in the next) of a moth eaten moth and nasty Nazis go for what else? Build a Reich Room. Misty's costumes, like those of a few other men, get more spectacular as the movie goes by. The last part of the film is dedicated to the extended lesbian action; this footage gets really boring, very fast, which says more about the creatures behind the cameras than the curvilinear creatures in front of it. The MISTY leaves its nominal plot out of the way first and fast, then gives full attention to nudity and soft sex. This makes the MUMMY RAIDER a throwback to films made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this marvel of work had been released four decades ago, it would have played for years on 42nd Street along with WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICKLY. As it stands, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to the home video. Get yours, fast, before it gets off the paper.
