I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were mediocre, the acting was terrible and if there was a plan for it all, it was in the back of the box. I do not think I remember a movie being so bad in a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobs !! ;) Even though I could not save this movie from just being a terrible excuse to pay someone to stay (or lie down in this case) in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> I was practically disappointed with the movie. "zombie" effect in general. As seemingly in this movie, zombies are so common that they run over a couple here and there, and casually talking about it at a gas station (one with an internal windshield repair, but no internal bathroom), the movie genre of zombie is not even a factor to the end. Even so, an appearance of a dozen zombies ripping a girl's clothes does not really constitute a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> About Vampires: Apparently all zombies are men and all vampires are female, which is good for me. I'm not sure how vampires are out during the day, or why / how a vampire soldier came to stand in the middle of the road, still holding his gun with a stake in his heart, just waiting for the Vampire Queen to spend all the time. The last segment in the old convent did not make sense, and when a hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire "Do you think we did the right thing?" killing the two apparent heroes in the movie, who put him on top. <br /> <br /> The acting and special effects were also down. You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out during the closeup of the zombie that was hit by the general. Speaking of the General, where did they find THAT Kenny Rogers look alike anyway? I have no idea what he was the General of, besides being generally confused and lost. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong desire to waste $ 3. Just my $ 0.02.
