This movie was screened as part of the 2007 Mardi Gras Sydney Film Festival. I had no expectation of the movie as someone chose it for me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I like films that take time to develop, movies that allow the characters to unfold and let the story flow. The stillness is good. But this movie was simply slow. <br /> <br /> Credit should go to the two main actors. There was a sense of tension between them, as two totally different people, mismatched actually, come together in a very strange way. There were moments of tenderness and sadness when we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scenery and the way it was filmed. It was claustrophobic and monochromatic and enhanced the intimacy of the film and reinforces the strangeness of the characters. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the ending. What was the point of all this?
