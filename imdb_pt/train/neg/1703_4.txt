A Vietnam veteran decides to take over an abandoned city, and anyone stepping on his way is eliminated (including women). Released for theaters shortly before "A Star Is Born," which turned his career, this mix of action drama starring Kris Kristofferson is wildly impotent, thoughtless and petty. Filmed in Simi Valley, CA, the results are truly indecent, with country cliches and senseless violence that make up most of the script by director George Armitage. Armitage reunited the most curious cast of the 70s for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, director Victoria, Bernadette Peters and partly Loni Anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is Kristofferson, who is rude and rude everywhere. He deserves points that I suppose to be a completely unfriendly drive-in thriller, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) cover the whole project like an ugly stain. * 1/2 of ****
