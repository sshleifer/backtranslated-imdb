I was looking at our DVD tower last night for something to watch. We were among the NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night. I took one I had never heard before and realized it was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket, it sounded like a steal from "The Big Chill," but with the cast of stars he thought it would be worth watching. Boy was I wrong !!! Not only was it like "The Big Chill", it was almost one character per character. The character Bill Paxton was a copy of William Hurt ("where you've been all this time") - foam alert - and behold he stays behind to take care of the old place (hut / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; Jerry womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I found myself wondering why I'm really watching these people. There was no development of character enough for me to find any interest in them. How did Unca Lou even find these characters after 20 years? Besides, it was not even funny, except when Perkins fell, missed the bed the first morning, it was a sign and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife, "Was there any catchy character in this movie? ... Are you sleeping there?" She replied, "No, I'm still thinking ... No, nothing I can think of."
