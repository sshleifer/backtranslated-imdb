Watching this, I noticed mainly the ad channels. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. It is one product placement after another. It's obvious how this movie got its funding. Jessica Simpson's acting is laughable. Any Dick should never get a job because he plays the same stupid character. The "story" is just a backdrop to this very long commercial. I can not believe this movie was considered for the theatrical release. The more you watch this movie, the more you'll be embarrassed by everyone involved. The only minor saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who almost does not have screen time as Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed, I watched the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding this.
