This film features Ben Chaplin as an employee of the bored bank in England who asks for a Russian correspondent bride, gets Nicole Kidman in the mail and gets more than he expected when, surprise, she is not what it seems to be. The story is quite predictable and Chaplin underacts to the point where it becomes somewhat anoying. Kidman is actually very good in this role, making his character about the only interesting thing in this movie is this. DEGREE: C
