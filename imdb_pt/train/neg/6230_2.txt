I was half interested in this movie as a useless cannibal film. I was completely disappointed. was the same kind of disappointment I felt watching 'Friday the 13th: Jason takes manhattan'. both wasted potential! <br /> <br /> The opening scene is a decent attention grabber. then it stops. copious breasts and the elegant fashion of the 80s can not help in this film. the only things they eat near this island of cannibal monks are the piranha! I'm not asking for a "cannibalistic holocaust" blood level, but I was looking for an inexpensive and exaggerated exploratory exaggeration. I do not have any of that. <br /> <br /> I found some parts of the fight scenes a bit intriguing, hence the 2 stars. I do not think it's worth the time it takes to watch, though. I could see showing at a party where nobody cares what is going on and you want something in the background. but I would not tell anyone: "Ah man, you WILL see this movie." it is neither good nor bad enough to demand much attention.
