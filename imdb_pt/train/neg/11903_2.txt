Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel.I do not know how he came with this movie! The idea of ​​giving the situation after spt11 and the vision of the American Society is hopeful, that makes it 2 out of 10. But this is not a movie. There are important things happening in the Middle East and it is just emitted on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is really on the level of stupidity ( because she is just ignorant about the facts). they are not well shaped. And most importantly, the idea that is given to religion is somehow funny to me. In the final scene, Lana says it's just to be quiet and try to listen. And the background music says "... I'm going to pray." The thing is not about religion actually. But that ends it. How will you see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray. The lights are already on shining on the truth. It's just that nobody wants to see it. ps: "My house is not a place. It's people" The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that phrase. But it's wasted behind this movie. (by the way, as "someone" mentioned below, the best young man in America is not the best, they are just the "poor" and the "desperate" subscribing to the army that needs good paychecks that are not provided by government government
