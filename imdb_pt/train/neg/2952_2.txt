From watching only Theodore Rex's trailer, you would think this is a bad cop comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur fantasy. That's true, but this is mostly a futuristic story, which looks a lot like Batman Forever, with his directing style and strange character designs. It was mismarketed, and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale, rather than just a lame cop comedy. Whether or not this movie is wrong marketing, it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life through incredible technology, and they talk and walk around like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur is murdered, he gives the case to work, but he has to be the partner of the most difficult cop of all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It is up to this incompatible duet to solve the murder, and it is up to the public to stay awake long enough to get through this piece of crud. <br /> <br /> Teddy gets the picture as a normal acting character, but in the end, he is unbearable to hear. For some reason, besides being a detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad imitator. He makes imitations of famous people and accents, and has some truly awful lines. Whoopi blames him for farting and he says, "It's not my ass trumpet!" Wow!! What an immature and childish line, even for such a childlike film. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I expected Teddy to bite his head the whole length of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie never knew what it wanted to be. When futuristic scenes and actions occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any non-action scene, the characters try to be as funny as possible, which results in a direct nonstop nuisance. The action scenes do not work because they are very strange and are not violent enough, and as said earlier, the comedy is just a bunch of butchered jokes. Nothing ever works here. <br /> <br /> Having a detective / human dinosaur duo looks like a very original movie, at the very least. Not! This movie is a big fraud by Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Simply replace the dinosaurs with cartoons and set them in the future, and it's exactly the same plot. One man is dead, one dinosaur is dead. A dinosaur and a detective solve the murder, a detective and a detective solve the murder. The bad guys on Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys who act like the weasels. The scene of the club in Roger Rabbit, where Jessica Rabbit walks on stage, is imitated with dinosaurs. This is a huge rip-off of a much better movie! <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a bad movie, not even deserving of that is straightforward to the stature of VHS. <br /> <br /> 1/2 out of **** 90 min. PG for mild violence, language and raw humor.
