I like Chris Rock, but I feel like he's wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​remaking Heaven Can Wait is good, but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey very closely. When Eddie Murphy remade Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he totally remade them - so they became Murphy's movies / vehicles, not just lukewarm re-images. That's why they were successful. If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. The few laughs that come when he's doing his standup routine - so he might as well have done a concert movie. It would also have been much funnier if the white man whose body he lived in was a truck driver or a country man. So why does Hollywood keep making trash like that? Because people will see it - because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Do not redo movies that were not so good in the first place!
