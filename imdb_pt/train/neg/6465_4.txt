This Charles output is decent, but this is a rather understated performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that forgets to develop and hurts the movie a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie with "Charles" has been very bad.
