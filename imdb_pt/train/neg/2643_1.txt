This, for want of a better term, the film sucks. Where do I start ...... Cinemaphotography - This was perhaps the worst I've seen this year. It looked like the camera was being thrown from the camera man to the camera man. Maybe they just had a camera. This gives you the feeling of being a volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of scenes, randomly, played without any continuity. When they did the "split screen," it was absurd. Everything was spoiled, it seemed ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The color tones were far away. These people need to learn how to balance a camera. This 'movie' is poorly done and poorly done. <br /> <br /> The plot - You must be joking. If I were an SS agent, I would sue the producers. It looked like the Marks Brothers with radios and guns. Sutherland was in his '24' mode - I can see it for free. Eva Longoria would have been better off with a little less, and more showing. As a bimbo action, she was not much. <br /> <br /> I could not see a real plot, other than Douglas, the president's wife. I never said why the mercenaries were trying to kill the pres. I just do not see the President of the United States rushing through his life in the utility tunnels of a building, like a rat in a maze. p-1-e-e-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie is proof. I like the "big screen". Since I was a child. A lot more 'movies' like that and I will give up going. What's the matter Hollywood, made so many girlish movies, forget how to make a real movie? If I owned a theater, I would start running the old movies. The one with real actors, good stories - and good cinematographic photography. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is a dog. Do not waste your time or money on this. I rate this movie as zero! Douglas is not fit for this role. I can look over your age, but your just are too weak to accomplish this.
