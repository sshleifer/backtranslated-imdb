You all know the story of "Hamlet." I do. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase "Being or Not Being" (not the speech itself) has been knocked to the ground so many times that it's not very interesting (actually, it was not that good). start with). In fact, I think "Hamlet" is a good game, but overrated. Not even the best of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, with "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" not far away. "Macbeth (knock your desk, out of your drawers, the record will make up, OW!)" It's not that bad. There are many others who are better than this by Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I will not comment too much on the movie, but I will dissect the horrible episode of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Okay. . Mike and the Bots win a card game and choose the movie. . . they ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends it to them, yadda yadda yadda. . . and get ready for the most annoying science fiction episode of the MST3K ever (admittedly, I did not see any of the CC Ones). <br /> <br /> While Dr. Z's "Blood Waters" visualizes that awful episode, since it's not really a movie but rather random, amended scenes (I remember Mike's speech from "Future War ":" Maybe it's an anthology of short films and no plot "), the SOL very Much Crew came out of many good cracks. I can not say the same here. <br /> <br /> The riffs fall to the ground, the host segments (even) are at best mediocre, and when the movie itself (which is not so bad) is really BETTER (I mean, like a quality movie, not as a camp, as "Prince of Space") than the MST3K version, you know the show must be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw it was several months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried and tried to entertain myself - but I just could not. Just the occasional line, like "Hail Boss Queen Dilbert!" (and when that's the funniest line in the episode, well, ahem) - and occasionally, I mean every ten minutes - maybe I even laugh. The second time I tried to watch it, I did not even laugh at the few jokes that I found funny before, and I just gave up forty minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> The movie is not horrible; is just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough, and although the dubbing is not the best, this is not in itself a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, yes THREE for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY WHY, MST3K!
