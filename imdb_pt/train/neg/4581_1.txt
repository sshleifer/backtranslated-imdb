Pathetic attempt to use science to justify the religion / philosophy of the new age. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this confusion is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports ideas in Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. As? Well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never definitively predict a location of particles at a specific time. You can only give the chances of being precisely at one point at a time. In addition, the act of observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All this, until now, is necessary. But then they claim that this means that if you sincerely believed that you could cross a wall, you could do it. This is a complete poppycock. Instead, the theory states that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through a wall, but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief. Also, you would have to keep going into the wall for eternity to have the remotest chance of going through the wall, the odds are so astronomical against this. <br /> <br /> This is just an example of how they misrepresent science. But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture, it gets so confused as to be incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-hatred. There may be some truth to this, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> In addition, string theory is a novelty in physics today. Instead of wasting your time with this dreck, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an incredible series made for NEW on PBS that gives you a history of Newton's physics and gravity for Ed Witten and M Theory in only 3 episodes of one hour. Quantum mechanics is very well explained if you want to know it without the haze of metaphysical appropriation.
