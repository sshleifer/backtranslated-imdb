As a spiritualist and not a Christian. I thought that I would really be holding on to my faith, but what a burden I see. I thought the movie would have great arguments, but only have a side view of atheists and Jews ??? And who are these street people he's interviewing and who do not know the back of the head arm. Where are the theologians and priests themselves and things from which he could have arguments. Not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and it's not worth my time to check whether the facts are right or wrong or whether I should or should not believe because an anti-Christ me said so. Please think that he came to the conclusion of not finding God because his own ego and the demons got the better of him. No, I will not say the movie was wonderful to help atheists read this. But if you really want to show the world that you care for us, poor souls who believe in Jesus then seduce us with their worth, not their drum beating.
