I think Stuart Bliss is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and the plot absurd. I understand the fact that the main character's wife let him unleash a mental breakdown, but it got so silly and annoying, after a while I could have cared less about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The film continued more and more the same ideas with nothing fresh or surprising to add to the plot. The whole thing with the Geiger counter got too much after a while, after Stuart started to open the wall to see what was behind, after the accountant indicated that something was there. <br /> <br /> Then there were the repetitive scenes with the meter. pamphlet, and the confused ones where he is. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed that this movie was a failure when I did not recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie shows up, read a book! You'll be better.
