Probably the only thing that got the movie into a room for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's great portraitists of fumbling incompetence. . . and yet it is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster. Like Roman Pops, it offers a respectable blend of gangster charm and heterosexual man to Chris Kattan's craze. Reputable performances are also offered by Richard Roundtree as the tormented chief, Vinessa Shaw as a talented FBI agent who bangs his head on a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Advisor to Falk and Benedict Arnold. The concept of plot actually has some wonderful possibilities and, in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, could have proven to be a great comedy vehicle. Kattan, who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, just provides a messy mess. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portray their misfits, are far short of their proven ability. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are very few and separated by many. boring What I really miss here is what has always drawn me to Leslie Neilsen's films. There is no "second level" intelligence about the slapstick. No cultural reference that only adults receive. . without double meaning. . It's silly. <br /> <br /> And by the way, that does not mean I'm recommending to your 9 year old because I hope they have a better taste and less fascination for some of their body parts and their functions.
