Listen to some of the interesting things that our fighting hero Faith Curator Pat, his son Gordon (TV Ministry looks like a family business) and Terry Meeuwsen (won Miss America in 1973 wearing a swimsuit and showing off his legs.Oh my God, gracious!) when our poor spectators are sick and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. Someone with an "abscessed right tooth" has just been healed. Someone with "twisted bowels" was healed.3 Then Terry said there was a person with a "strange condition," (You mean God does not know?) A burning in the legs, which has just been cured.4. So Gordon said there's a man (who reduces weight!) With the breasts swelling from the right cheek, with a lot of pain behind the right eye, but now he's cured.5 Someone with a problematic right hip, limited mobility of a course, now is able to walk. 6. Terry said he saw someone with severe stiffness in the neck bone, but did not know the exact disease (God does not know?) - that person is now cured. 7. Someone paralyzed on the right side, particularly (not exactly?!) The right side of the face was healed now. A man (who reduces the world's population again) with a plaque on his skull is having ongoing problems, and doctors simply do not know what to do. Terry said she saw the bone reshaping around the plate (the funny bone ?!) and the man's pain was gone, he was now healed. <br /> <br /> Hers as our war hero Pat helps our sick and poor people. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas, but that narrows everything down) Who has a breast, you are drying now, thank you Jesus. 2. There is a man with a financial need - I think a hundred thousand dollars (I think their god needs to go to school or something!) This need is being met now, and within three days, money will be supplied through of the miraculous power of the holy spirit. Thanks, Jesus. 3. There is a woman in Cincinnati with cancer of the lymph nodes. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you've been diagnosed yet (ask your vengeful god Pat!), but you're not feeling well, and you're breaking the cancer right now! 4 There is a lady in Saskatoon (I assume Canada.) In a wheelchair curvature of the spine, You are straightening that ours right now, and you can get up and walk! (If you have this condition ignore Pat!) And it's yours. Thank you Jesus! Amen, amen! <br /> <br /> When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer, did he go to Peter Popoff, Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, Terry or Gordon? Not! On February 17, 2003, Pat went to a real doctor to do his surgery! (Do you mean he does not trust his healing friends by faith, Terry or his own son Gordon ?!) <br /> <br /> When Private Pat Robertson was in the Marines during the Korean War, he was official responsible for keeping officers supplied with alcoholic beverages. He was known for drinking and frequenting prostitutes and feared that he would contact gonorrhea. (He must have asked for a healer by faith!) <br /> <br /> The reason why Pat left the fight was because his father Absalom Willis Robertson (D Va, 1946-66) was chairman of the Appropriations Committee Military of the Senate. <br /> <br /> Terrorist Attacks, September 11, 2001 We imagine ourselves invulnerable and consumed by the pursuit of health, wealth (Pats worth between 150 and 200 million dollars!) material pleasures (A mansion in Virginia Beach with a helipad!) and sexuality (He had sex with his future wife before marriage who had a child!). This (terrorism) is happening because God is raising his protection against us (statement released on September 13, 2001.) Pat Robertson reminds me of Burgermeister in Santa Claus Is Coming to Town and his evil vengeful god reminds me of Avenger in Dungeons and Dragons . <br /> <br /> The brat Gordon does what dad tells him and Terry is a sympathetic woman who has no mind of her own! <br /> <br /> This will get you real! The September 5, 2005 issue of The 700 Club included a report by Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent Gary Lane from outside the New Orleans Convention Center that housed victims of a black disaster over the weekend. evacuated "Lane said" they include this glass of voodoo with the saying "May the curse be upon you." A picture of a souvenir cup from one of New Orleans' trinket stores appeared on the screen. warfare title Warfare and Thugs 'R' Us. "Lane stated, pointing to a pile or rap CDs scattered on the floor. (Your Absalom fanatic father taught Pat racism well!) <br /> <br /> If any of you good people always think of giving away to these sexist fanatic people, please in the name of God, no! Sponsor a softball or basketball team, give it to a food shelf, be a big brother or a sister to a child but please do not give these people away because they have been around for over 40 years and have not solved anything. <br /> <br /> If you still do not believe me, type Pat Robertson heard during the commercial break on the web and hit the search and once you hear what he really likes, I know for sure that you will not Give a penny to those deceitful liars! And by the way, Terry once divorced and Pat talked about divorce many times at his shows. <br /> <br /> I like to say hello to the folks at Dover in Pennsylvania, Orlando Florida, and to the nice people that I was hit by Hurricane Katrina and hope it's a nice day. Has Operation Blessing been helpful to New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Please let our readers know! I do! By the way, if you're sick, go to a real doctor and let everyone laugh at these liars and one day Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry can go elsewhere and take their angry Venger god with them!
