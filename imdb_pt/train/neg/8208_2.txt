"Hey guys, I have an idea, we found this egg-shaped space thing, so why do not we unfreeze it and open it?" "Yes, I know it would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do, and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to Earth and could do away with the human race, but hey, I want to know what's in it." "And nobody told NASA, they can take it away from us." "Wow, this thing exudes vibrations!" "Yes, very strong in touch, so do not touch, but it's okay to open." "Hi, there are beautiful, check out my pinches." (Later that day); "DO NOT OPEN"!!!!! Uh, we have to run to the lab and tell them not to open it because we do not have phones, radios or intercoms, even though we have a zillion dollars in other equipment here. "I've never seen this organic technology!" "Yeah, let me get this dick and stab it." "I'm getting out of here, I do not care if I kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, no one is killing me!" "Look, it's the Abyss's friendly aliens! They want us to come with them." THE END
