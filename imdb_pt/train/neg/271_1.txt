I can not believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid fan of science fiction. I read numerous science fiction novels and enjoyed many science fiction films and TV shows. I really would not even consider this true science fiction. All the episodes I went through were like a lame, dilute version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> It's basically a bunch of people standing with CUPCAKES, talking about something boring, that occasionally passes through the Stargate and ends up on a planet that looks like Earth, with people who look and sound like Humans ! It seemed extremely low budget. The characters are all one-dimensional cutouts forgettable, and many attempts at humor fall. It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it, trying to be funny, but it is not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The film was also terrible. There is so much you can do with a portal through space, but every place that Army personnel goes is annoying! That does not show imagination! I really thought the TV series "Alien Nation" a few years ago (based on the movie Alien Nation) was much better. This show really had good story lines and decent characters. I was not crazy about "Alien Nation", but compared to this overrated crap, it was great! <br /> <br /> In addition, unlike the great series "Battlestar Galactica", "Stargate" copied the look and feel of the movie lame very closely! They should have at least upgraded the special "flush" effect of the bathroom whenever someone passes by the Stargate.
