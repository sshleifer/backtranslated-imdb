Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so well together in THE MUMMY'S HAND, return for this little offering of Universal Horror. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as fellow comedy "Babe", we have Fuzzy Knight replacing it as a silly friend called "Stuff". But the results are not nearly as charming, and the level of fear is practically zero. Dick is an entrepreneur who has the idea of ​​leading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a scary old castle. Peggy is one of the gangs that comes for the ride. But there is a tall, skinny John Carradine resembling a black cape and big hat known as "The Phantom," which catches the party in search of the fortune buried itself. <br /> <br /> This "ghost" is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to try to keep the face of an ordinary guy in the shadows to create any tension or astonishment. It's always good to see Moran excited, but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of Universal's instantly forgotten faults.
