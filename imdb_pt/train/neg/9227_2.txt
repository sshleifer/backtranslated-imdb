CQ was the worst movie I saw this year. Almost all the movies I choose to see in the theater are at least entertaining or have something to say. This movie looked like it was directed by a film student for his Intro. for Cinema class. Your dad makes great movies. Your sister made a good one. But Roman brother? NOT! One critic had the audacity to compare this film to Godard's Le MÃ©pris (Scorn). While Coppola, Jr. had the same idea, a film about cinema, he tried too hard to make himself look European, artistic and witty, when everything is really just kitsch. The main actor bears the same expression throughout the film, as if he was amazed or in shock at the film being made around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to play his role as extravagant director. Depardieu is fine. The only scene that has any fake real movie humor is, surprisingly, not the scenes from movie B, but one that occurs in Italy; a montage of photos of several characters inside a very small car, driving around picking up and leaving random people. That was the only thing that reminded me of the movies, I think he was trying to imitate. Or theft. Or both. The documentary with the leader talking to the camera and filming several objects was reproduced, the ending was marked by a "twist" or artistic value ... I suppose the funniest thing about this movie was the movie itself, not the way it intended. No wonder this movie has been sent back after a festival screening to be reissued or re-filmed or whatever, which makes me curious about how bad it was before. I can not believe it could have been worse than that. If you want to see a good movie parody, check out the Austin Powers movies. Anyone of them. Opening for the third is more fun and cooler than the whole of this movie. Lil 'Romy, for the good of the cinema, PLEASE, re-direct your cousin's music videos. Leave the godparents for Dad.
