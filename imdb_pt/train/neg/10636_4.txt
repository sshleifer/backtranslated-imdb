I was really looking forward to this show, given the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately my hopes were frustrated! Once again we are led to believe that the KGB is a group of incompetent idiots who have no idea what they are doing. At one point, there is a laughable scene where four KGB agents could not deal with a CIA agent. I got tired of those biased, unilateral and completely inaccurate portrayals of the espionage game that happened during the Cold War. I find it ridiculous that the US is incapable of making objective films about their involvement in World War II and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the US has obtained the Enigma machine again, totally false. <br /> <br /> To his credit, "The Company" is very well filmed and acted. The sites are also exceptionally well done. Alfred Molina does a great performance, as does Keaton (The conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to like this show and I will definitely watch the other two episodes, but I really would like US productions to stop trying to portray their spies, soldiers, etc. as supermen who are intellectually and physically superior to anyone else in the show. world. planet. It ages quickly and seriously undermines the plausibility of what could have been a 10/10. <br /> <br />
