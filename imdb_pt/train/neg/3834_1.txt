I watched this movie having really enjoyed Gregory's Girl many years ago. That was silly. The plot was vaguely unpleasant, with the teacher and her friend trawling 14- to 15-year-old girls in very short skirts. Previous reviews seem to think this does not matter, but I found it quite unpleasant. If you have kids at school, the last thing you want to think is that every young teacher is longing for his students. We were surprised that the censor let this pass. Also, the movie was just a waste of time. The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair was trying very hard to recreate his student image, a little crazy and off the wall. Why would anyone want to covet him in this performance is incredible. This movie has failed in every way for me. Terrible. Please do not waste your time watching. Life is too short
