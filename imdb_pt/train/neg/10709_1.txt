I can not think much to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> This was a horrible movie ... I can not even tell you what made me decide to see it. I had so few redeeming qualities that I do not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The plot went from implausible to totally absurd. My whole body was tense throughout the duration of the movie, because I could not expect the horrible thing to end and end. At the end of the movie, I found myself feeling relieved. <br /> <br /> The editing was bad, the acting was insignificant and the plot was weak. Fran√ßoise Robinson was cast as a Native American, even if she does not look like someone from the Native American heritage. <br /> <br /> If a movie is going to be so stupid, it should be ridiculously stupid - at least. It was not. It was just pathetic.
