In the beginning, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really people - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine interpretation of esoteric matters. I loved the book and was totally dissapointed with the movie. It was ridiculous, half-hearted, and the story barely explained. The novel - first! - it was not meant to focus on an adventure! This is just the environment. In the film, the focus reverses exactly that and the message is in the background! In addition, the visual effects to show the energy of all living beings and the elucidation of events at the end were parsimonious! They ruined everything! ... I will never watch this again!
