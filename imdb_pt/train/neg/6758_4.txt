Quite possibly the prettiest woman in show business, and the sexiest, Debbie gives another good performance here. Although her work on American Nightmare has been far superior, she's still worth watching in this movie. <br /> <br /> The cast is filled with its typical Melrose Place type, chiseled features and seductive curves, which I had never seen before. In addition to Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I had ever seen before in the Delta Delta Die. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of arrogant Californians who started poor na√Øve Debbie Rochon in her clique. They tell her that they have a murder club and that she must kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more than to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group must decide what to do with her, after she falls for the joke. Gore Hounds will certainly enjoy it!) NUDITY: A lot of people have a lot of fun, Julie Strain also has a bunch of nudity scenes, as do many of the actresses and unnamed actors.The pool party seems like an excuse to leave everyone naked, man and woman. special participation in topless, but she the character disappeared after the first five minutes). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (It could have gotten a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a fill between nudity scenes. <br /> <br /> I understand that B-Rate movies use nudity often, but this is excessive. ACTING: $ (The acting is sub-standard, to say the least. Rochon is always in Is without doubt the best actress of B-Rate in business Danny Wolske does a great job as an object of lust for Debbie, but the other actors have been nothing to write about).
