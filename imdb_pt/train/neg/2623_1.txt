Sly Stallone is hardly the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother, Frank ... well, hand out the prizes now! Frank seems to think that all the parts he plays require him to play American / Italian refugee Wise-Guy's "Godfather." Please someone make an offer for it, it can refuse! This movie just stank of the place, even with the terrible overcoming of it, Frank still steals the disgrace of the acting. All people make up for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms, gesturing frantically in a style that has gone out of style with silent films. <br /> <br /> The plot, what is there, does not make sense, for a meteor lands and turns all women into sex-crazed nymphets, but since this is a 15-certificate film, it means they take away underwear and make moans as if they were dogs in heat. What happens in the end, I'm not sure how I was losing the will to live long before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague and watch 'Deep Impact' for a reasonable movie about a meteor about to hit the earth. <br /> <br /> NB Point of order: When one of the females takes the underwear, she has the panties under the suspenders / suspenders, and pants over the suspenders to allow the women to go to bathroom with less noise. A trivial point, perhaps, but it shows how dumb this movie is when they can not even hit it!
