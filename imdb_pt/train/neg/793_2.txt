I did not know how to evaluate this movie, since it was so bad that it actually was very funny. I'm not a fan of Gackt, even though he's talented, despite the odd pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing a ball of hair. I always thought Hyde was talented, but Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But on the topic here folks. This movie is ridiculous. It's so exaggerated and meaningless that it's almost like a parody of supernatural action movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has almost no plot here except that it's just vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this movie almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with the way it had many ideas, which resulted in insufficient time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were laughable. Quickly edited, almost difficult to understand, with choreography that is so ridiculously bad. Although Hyde seemed very elegant during the action scenes, but this is the only redemption of this film. I'm a sucker for good action movies, but the action was terribly made. Although the final shootout was OK and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie. <br /> <br /> He keeps jumping between genders, not a good thing. Want to be a drama, or an action movie, or a horror, or a novel ... what the hell? <br /> <br /> If this review is driving you crazy, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Make no mistake, this movie is bad.
