It's been almost 30 years, and I still hate everyone involved in this movie. It's still the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before I saw this, I never cared much for Rivers, one way or the other. After seeing this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see her on television. <br /> <br /> I was drawn into this - against my best judgment - by peer pressure. However, leaving the theater, these friends took an oath never to nullify the movie's choice. Almost thirty years later, we still carry mental scars from the film. <br /> <br /> On my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time I lost waiting for this movie to get better. This never happened. <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, you'd rather put your own eyes on paper while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I registered in the IMDb postings only in the hope that maybe I can alert others against viewing this movie. If I can save only one person from seeing this, then my existence on this earth will have been justified.
