Any movie in which Brooke Shields hits a Fonda will be an anomaly and a horror. Shields is actually only bad because she is young, inexperienced and clearly not well-led by her co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because he is bad. I liked him at Ulee's Gold years later, but Lord above, he's horrible here. Not that anyone is good. There is not a single performance (aside from the delightful participation of Henry Fonda) that is even acceptable. I've never seen a movie with so many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the main villain, it is clear that this is due to bad dialogue and direction, since he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. The writing is simply awful, and the actors can not be blamed for the terrible things they have to say. But they say so bad! Editing and direction are worse than pedestrians. Shots are held for long without any dramatic reason or cut before the impact of the scene can be perceived. This image was much worse than I had imagined and would have been totally forgotten (and probably never done) without the participation of two famous names. One plus point: Grand Canyon cinematography is great, capturing the beauty of this area in a way that even the large-screen Imax productions have not done so well yet. And finally: either this is a bad version of Paper Moon with an adorable pair of parent-daughter types, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a much more disgusting romantic relationship between a 40 and 13 year old. old. It suggests more than the first, and therefore is rather disturbing.
