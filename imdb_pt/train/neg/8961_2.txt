This movie was more of a waste of time ... Why, oh, why do I keep renting crap like that? ... someone, please tell me ... * sigh * Oh well. Back to the movie: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you REALLY enjoyed the first movie, (as I did), and just want to check what's going on in the last movie (hopefully) joined just to keep some poor actors and writers employed , then of course this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot ... * evil grin * then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK, I'm lying ... At best this one movie sucks. Okay, I have to admit that certain elements for this were cool ... well ... cool ... and I laughed a few times, prolly in the wrong things, but I still had fun. :-) But after all, the few things that barely make the "ok" category are not enough to make this movie worth it. Unless you count "Hands of Fate" one of the top ten films ALWAYS !
