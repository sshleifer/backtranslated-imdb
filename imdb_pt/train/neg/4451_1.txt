This movie was probably as silly as The Naked Gun (it should be). Case in point: 1. To pretend you're drowning, Roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the YWCA. After her "death", the YWCA calls her husband on the job to give her condolences. HELLO, how did you get your work number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving town, she drops the wedding ring in the bathroom. Days or even weeks later, her husband meets John. Does that mean the toilet has never been washed? <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation is given about how she is paying for her mother's care in the nursing home (since she did this behind her RICH husbands back). <br /> <br /> 4. At the end of this tiring movie, Roberts suspects that her husband is in the house. Instead of running for her life, she runs to the kitchen to see if the cans are well stacked.
