Come on folks, you can not be serious, another snipe case when it's not totally! This is not even remotely scary or terrifying or depraved - it's just an absolutely terrible amateur videowork, made for the next party to get the girls. <br /> <br /> The blood is incredibly bad, even the eye -scene is far from making me want to vomit, but only making me want to take the camera and hit those guys on the head. The girl is lying there with her face covered in rubber, without moving. It would have been funnier to wear a real doll. <br /> <br /> A season of "I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!" is more frightening than this. Do not waste your time or your money.
