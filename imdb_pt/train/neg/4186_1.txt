My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings found in the film. In fact, they are quite congruent with mine. What causes me is the fact that, in terms of a movie, it is stupid and devoid of any similarity in history, motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neal that replacing song lyrics that are not managing to inspire anyone out of a shrinking audience is not the same as creating motivated characters talking because of events created by the writer or director. A silly narrative remains so despite Neal Young's iconic legacy. The most childish scene is where the devil dances in a bar, lends a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way to the dance floor to utter Young's words to the heroine, who does not know what's going on . occurred. Somehow these two dream a scheme where they will climb the west coast in search of ????? Sorry Neal, stay with the music and leave the theater for Steven Stills.
