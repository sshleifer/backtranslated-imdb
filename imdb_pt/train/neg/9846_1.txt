You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears on it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most senseless films of all time. I kept expecting something funny to happen, but nothing funny appears in this movie. Even the film industry acknowledged that this was a very weak film and did not even try to promote it. It's a wonder that has already been put on video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of contract caused the Sellers to sell in this movie. I also wonder why the people responsible for this movie could make other bad movies. Surely this movie is a waste of the money used to create it, and a waste of time from anyone watching. Certainly there are high school students who would be able to write / produce a movie that as a plot.
