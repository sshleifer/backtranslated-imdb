This movie is one of the most horrible movies ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play a movie? He's a singer and not an actor, what? Is he killing vampires with his guitar? And the terrible plot? Oh my God, this movie really sucks. In the end is the vampire queen played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" slayers arrive, there are only 4 vampires left !! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? They run to the sun? What about the "Grand Finally" when Bon Jovi blows his head with a shotgun? That's really a "NO". In "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes, no vampire is killed with A SHOTGUN ??? This really is a lack of originality!
