I was really hoping this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever viewing clips. And I talk about hype, I even heard an interview with the creator of the show on BBC World Today - a show that is broadcasted around the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show does not even come close to delivering. All the jokes are obvious - the kind that sounds kind of funny the first time you hear them, but then it sounds stupid - and they do not get any new treatment or twisting. All characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - well - mediocre (I'm being cool). It's the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you're a Muslim, I think you'd have to be stupid to believe in any of the white characters, and if you're white, you're probably offended a little by the fact that almost all the characters whites are portrayed as intolerant, ignorant or both. Not that making fun of whites is a problem - most of the best comedies are rooted in that. It's just a problem when it's not funny - like in this program. <br /> <br /> Canada is filled with funny people - so many that we export them to Hollywood regularly. So, how come the producers of this program could not find any?
