Most of the great moments that fans will expect in the half hour of Tommy Medley are simply lost or cloaked: At Christmas they did not show Daltry's screams after the phrase "Tommy does not know what day is today ... ", they showed almost * no * Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard, there were too many shots from the crowd during the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We do not go (Listening To You), they stole almost every scene from Pete's guitar chords. Huge pieces of the film are filmed on the back of the band. It's a very frustrating movie to watch and not deliver the goods. I do not know if director Murry Lerner is not just a fan of the Who, or worse, at least to him, if he's a Who fan and that's all the eight cameras could offer him. To his credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some favorites, which are beautifully filmed, and sometimes the editing is brilliant. That may be enough to make some viewers happy as long as you're not anticipating Tommy. The overall sound was mediocre in the broadcast I watched from DirecTV; may be different on video or DVD.
