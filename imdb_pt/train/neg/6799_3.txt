do not expect too much from this movie. In many ways, this film resembles a movie that Doris Day starred in in 1956, title, Julie. In this film, Doris, who was a flight attendant, stewardess, landed on the plane after her husband, shot by Louis Jordan, shot the captain. She did a much better job, more convincing, than Kim Ojah, who took control of a 747 and managed to land it without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 aircraft, I use to be flight attendant myself. Like I said, do not expect too much from this movie, it was done on a cheap budget. The producers were cheap to use an airplane with the name of an airline. Oceanic is a name that several movies have used. The only writing on this plane was the name of the company that manufactured the aircraft.
