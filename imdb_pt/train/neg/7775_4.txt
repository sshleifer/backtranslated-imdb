I'm not familiar with the trilogy, but I saw this movie last night on Showtime. The film looked very well done with the scenographer and the cinematography, but the script was flamboyant and wooden. The acting was pretty bad - the two female leaders were helpful. You never really believed in anything that the supporting actors said. There was the Stereotyped Reverend, able to beat the bibles, without a hint of nuance, authoritarian Captain, hot-headed soldier, etc. I regret to say that, on the basis of these shortcomings, I immediately realized that the Canadian knew it was not so. The final credits of Telefilm Canada gave us. I know I'm a horrible person. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something at first, but the hostility toward girls is never explained. Here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason. FOCUS people. There is a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than if these girls are lesbians or not - this is just my inference to the hostility directed at them. If they can point and fire a gun, you can also be kind to them. The question of his "immortal soul" can be resolved later. <br /> <br /> Besides, I think this relates to the rest of the trilogy, these girls are supposed to be the protagonists? One of them murdered the Indian in the end who saved one of their lives. I think one is just a victim of his condition that can not necessarily be blamed for his actions, but the other is just a killer who does not deserve his happy ending.
