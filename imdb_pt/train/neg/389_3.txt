I bet Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear. Is not it just too invented for Gene to switch to the women's team and then play on his sword? And big pussy? What the hell was that? "Look at me, I'm a mouse!" Two-bit crap? All that banter-mafia clich√©! The big names rejected just received money for their charity and got a personalized exit. Hmm ... This is not reality, but drama staged! Mark Burnett's other program, "Survivor," also raised issues for me when Johnny Fairplay staged his match when he clearly had a short time before his son was born. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
