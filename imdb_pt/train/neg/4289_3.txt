The Education of the Little Tree is not as good as it could have been. The education of Little Tree is about things like the circle of life and how you should look for a star to help you. What happened to the three R's? Read Ritin and Ritmetica? When the idiot talks to the teacher again at the boarding school, he starts crying and talking to the sky. Oh my God. Of course, you were a bit harsh, but then the character of James Cromwell arrives and takes you away, leaving the audience thinking that Little Tree was absolutely right. He should learn to adapt to the new discipline. Those were the times! Talking to a star is not going to change anything! Little Tree needs to learn that his worshipers are not always right.
