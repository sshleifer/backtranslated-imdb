I had the distinct displeasure of seeing this movie at the Vancouver International Film Festival 2006. I have been attending this festival for over 5 years, and I have certainly seen some poor films on occasion. However, 'First Bite' hit a new record in the cinema. Despite being filmed in beautiful locations with the occasional and delicious close-up of fabulous food, the film twists an excessive number of twists and blistering characters until I was practically begging for it to end. <br /> <br /> Lead actor David La Haye has completely failed to show any character development throughout the film, portraying a pompous chef from start to finish. Additional sub-plots, such as eating disorders, were developed so poorly that they did not fit into any context that the film had presented up to that point. <br /> <br /> A theme of mysticism was used as an unsatisfactory attempt. hide a film that reaches nothing, leads to nothing and completely disappoints.
