Turn your back or you'll have a big problem with the back of MY BOYFRIEND! Only a happy ending can flourish your innocence that is full of sadness and doom at the moment you are watching it. It's safe to say that the whole movie falls apart, with a sarcastic approach and a tribute to the zombie shows that defy the absurd to the fullest. We get a name like "Johnny" once in a while, and this "Johnny" has nowhere to go. There is no specific reason for our "dead corpse" coming out of his grave just to survive until the night of the ball, which makes the film totally useless. Without a sense of sadness, her mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he is dead. Johnny takes a bite of Eddie's arm afterwards. The viewer asks a difficult question: why does the movie have to be that cornball? There is an answer. Any likeness to all living or dead people is mere coincidence. "Living" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing in common with the film. Show this to your girlfriend and she will skip the prom, turning your life into a deserted ruin. Blah !!!
