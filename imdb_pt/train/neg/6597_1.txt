This is much worse than the terrible drawings of Laurel and Hardy of the 60s. They were terrible, but at least they were simple ripoffs of a resurgence of Stan and Ollie. New audiences had rediscovered the comedy genius of the duo and the cartoons were mind-boggling junk to profit from the children's interest. It was to be expected. But as one even tries to rationalize this work of ... I can not even think of a word. I'm sure the creators hoped they would somehow inspire another revival of Laurel and Hardy, but you can not inspire interest in the past with a superficial and bland caricature of what made the original so appealing. The Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) make a Vegas show and that's where they belong. The plot is even more fragile than those used in the old days, trying to extend ideas from two cylinders to one feature. If this movie was someone's first exposure to REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the viewer would reject the original duo's reputation as deranged senility. The only movie that I hate worse than that is that I spit on your GRAVE. And, you know, these camcorders basically did the same with Stan and Ollie.
