I would have rated this movie a minus 10, but unfortunately it is not offered. <br /> <br /> Why do not I leave the first five minutes of this movie I can not say. I should have gone with my gut and left immediately !! Several people in our theater did and, unfortunately, I did not follow them. <br /> <br /> The story did not have all the criteria for a movie. No plot. Awful performance! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I could never see another movie in which he is. Not a single relationship in history went beyond the talk of the hall. I liked the tazer scene. It's a pity it did not shock a little meat with the folly of the plot. Someone needs to fool the writer and director of this movie!
