Boy, this movie fooled me. I honestly thought it would be an exaggerated horror movie with absolutely no humor, kid, I got the cold shoulder that time. This movie was, and I'm real, very good. It was not scary at all, but the campiness and the malicious humor really crazy this interesting movie. Some for horrible acting and clich√©d murders were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was but to some extent I liked it. The kills are vaguely related to snow sports and Christmas, which has made things more intriguing. The POV camera angles were incredible. <br /> <br /> The film is about a slimy killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. Later, he is resurrected in that same chemical with the snow attached to the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He takes revenge, like the snowman, of the policeman who condemned him. <br /> <br /> This film had such a bad acting, except for Christopher Allport, who was funny. I will say that I am also very disappointed that this film was not a horror, but in fact a dark series. They had a great story with a good plot, but it was not executed correctly. All in all I like the movie first, but now it's really annoying. But this film is much better and darker than the sequel.
