Although the cast for this film was admirable, particularly Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the whole movie was that it was like a train wreck, and it was almost impossible to turn our backs. It may have been that we "hoped" that the message would become apparent, and that we might reap some meaning from that effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course the public may have been able to "make sense" of this complicated tale, a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd. The writers, however, have done NOTHING to facilitate this innate need we seem to have to find meaning. It was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts, and that any intrinsic passion as the characters or story were secondary or nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, movies made for TV seem to have passed over the years. Since communicating a message to the public may have been the main interest of writers in the past, present-day writers and producers seem patronizing to their audience, concentrating primarily on manipulating us to "get in tune" through incessant advertising that seems to be the only reason why films like Surrender, Dorothy are made.
