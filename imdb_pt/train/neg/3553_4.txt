"The Incubus" is a mixture of the good (an interesting murder mystery), the bad one (a disconnected script, a sloppy resolution, badly made attack scenes) and the odd one (strong incestuous implications, a strangely drowsy and hard performance by John Cassavetes - did this character really mean being so "crazy"?). It is not as offensive as it is reputed, but it is not particularly successful either. (* 1/2)
