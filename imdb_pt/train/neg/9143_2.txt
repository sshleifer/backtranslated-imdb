As an actor I really like independent films, but this is an amateur at best. <br /> <br /> The boys go to Vermont for a civil service, but when the plane lands on a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - not palms. And the same for the wedding service - again a beautiful palm grove. <br /> <br /> When the boys are leaving the VT, they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline, since the plane shot is Federal Express. Did they give themselves overnight in a box? Come on, little details like this separate an indian movie totally amateur. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is much gayer than Arthur with his discolored hair and tribal band tattoo. The two of them must have changed roles. <br /> <br /> Secondary characters are laughable and overdoing something terrible. <br /> <br /> Applause for the directors for making a gay movie, but pay attention to their locations and locations. releasing the next time
