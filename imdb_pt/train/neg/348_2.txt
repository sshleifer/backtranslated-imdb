This movie is a shabby and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle. The performances are generally bad, especially by Capshaw, Fishburne and Ed Harris, generally solid. Connery seems miscast as a Harvard scholar. The film gets even worse as it progresses. It is a third-category mystery that becomes extremely artificial the moment it unfolds. The film wastes an excellent supporting cast. George Plimpton also appears in a smaller role to add a bit of seriousness to Connery while debating the death penalty. Violence and the atmosphere spice up a third mystery / suspense that is manipulation to the highest degree. The script and direction are extremely poor. Connery's charisma and on-screen presence are the only virtue of the film. Manipulative, violent and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid.
