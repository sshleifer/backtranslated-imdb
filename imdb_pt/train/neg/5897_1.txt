Acclaimed Japanese director Takashi Miike does not seem to be able to deal with this dull thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book about an evil (and child-abusing) old woman who is part of a new urban legend: if your cell phone rings with a strange tone - and you see the message "One Missed Call" - you will repeat the message just to hear your own final words before your death. The most successful part of the film is the incisive satire of Reality TV cameras intruding on future victims, but the not-so-elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) Are disappointing and discouraging. Frequent photos of devastated corpses are actually displayed in a discreet manner, and this general politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so serious. Hollywood predictably jumped on the forced plot in 2008, but the American version did not fare any better. NO STARS of ****
