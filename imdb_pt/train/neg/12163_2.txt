The absolutely putrid horror film does not have a redeeming quality. She has Camp Counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson ... beautiful as the killer, she plays when she wastes people are not even funny) in the war killing teenagers who act the least impertinent or resist their claims of good behavior. We have a series of boring killings and cliches, like cutting a child's throat in search of his Freddy claw glove, a child who gets a chainsaw, a girl who is pierced, someone who is pushed into the cell (full of leeches ), someone who is baked, etc. <br /> <br /> You do not have an original idea to offer and it's just a waste of time. That's unless you want to see the breasts of Valerie Hartmen (who does Ally's whore). Most of the violence occurs off-screen, so even this will not satisfy.
