Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business in producing films. <br /> <br /> You'd think that after such bad films as "Superstar," "Night at the Roxbury," and "Coneheads," he begins to understand that maybe he does not know what he's doing when it comes to movies (and many argue that he also does not know what he is doing when it comes to television). Trying to make movies with skits that used the welcome the third time they were made in SNL does not make sense. <br /> <br /> I personally like Tim Meadows, and I think he'd be great at the right movie. . It's a shame to see a talented guy squandered on a movie that features unfunny after a bland situation, and covers it all with a terribly bad scene of music and dance. Any laughter here will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have movies made about them. . It's a shame that it has hit the big screen.
