Certainly, no Saturday morning TV show was done so badly. After all, these producers had to count on the audience coming back. Well, in that horrible offer, they could at least count the money they saved on sets. The script could have been a rejection of some long-forgotten space opera series, with a few moody sentences added for Gerald Mohr to mutter to Naura Hayden. No director could have done something decent with such a crazy plot, so the action simply goes on tediously. The spacecraft's supports are absurd - a Bulova wall clock and a portable typewriter, for example - but the planet's settings have to be some of the worst in cinematic history. Most are rough drawings and everything is bathed in a red light that is often poorly focused. Even Mohr's bare, hairy chest is used as a prop. And it's bad - as thin as the plot. Any viewer who gets to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians - and will probably agree completely!
