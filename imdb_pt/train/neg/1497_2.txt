Understand that I'm reviewing the movie I saw. I realize that virtually all nudity and blood were cut from this film, neutralizing it completely. Seeing names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson attached, I knew I was not going to get a horror classic, but at least I expected free breasts and bloodshed. But no, this has to be the most massacred modern horror movie, I mean it's easy to say that there's a lot more in certain scenes, but suddenly they're cut, or the scene completely ends when it begins. How does someone spoil cannibals and porn stars? I mean it's a winning formula, it makes me wonder if the director slept with an executive's wife or something, because it's literally incredible how much of that was cut off. Reading about it a few years ago in Fangoria, I was excited, it seemed like a fun movie, but unfortunately the real movie is locked in a safe somewhere, and we must endure this piece of excrement renamed as Evil Breed. I hope an unrated cut comes out someday, since I think there's a good movie in this mess, but by then you'd better get a twelve-pack Bud, because that's the only way you get through this movie.
