There is a book entitled "How to make a movie with every 'man versus nature' Clich√© Imaginable"? If not, the ants would be excellent sources for the chapter on killer insects. Ants do not have an originality fragment to be found at any point in their 100-minute runtime. I suppose the most amazing thing about Ants is that they actually extended the movie to 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the scenes of death and the way the ants are presented were made before any number of times ?? and in most cases, much better. It's amazing that many of these Insects on Rampage movies were made in the '70s, because they are all basically the same movie. <br /> <br /> And can anyone tell me what, in the name of God, Myrna Loy is doing? this monkey-turd from a movie? A woman as talented and elegant as Loy deserved better than Ants as one of her final films.
