I was one of those "few Americans" who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action / adventure film if only the writers could have discovered where to look. <br /> <br /> I hoped it was a joke, but I did it. Do not expect him to target such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, this could be both visually stunning and exciting. Should have focused on more action / adventure and the aim of the original series ... save people in trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead, he focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers (who were also scaled young anyway vs. the original). The highlight was Lady Penelope and Parker. I did not care much about the characters in the original, but I was grateful for them in the movie. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I've always liked Thunderbirds more for high tech than stories, and even that did not give me enough time on the screen as much as I was worried. I would have liked to see more of the cool gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then, I'm just a big kid ...;)
