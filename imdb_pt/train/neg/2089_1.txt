Of course I was watching BG. I loved S1, I enjoyed Season 2, Season 3 was good, and I loved the final. Yay, there's a spin-off show! I did not know anything about it, one of my friends told me about it. I was really excited. <br /> <br /> I watched the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of crap! Teenage Drama Fest. There is no science fiction ... well, hardly any. At the end of each episode, we can catch a glimpse of a Cylon. That is all. Who cares? Have they decided that the target audience for the next show will be for women under the age of 18? Annoying absurd religious talking, moaning, complaining ... and a little more. <br /> <br /> It's sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch. Stargate ruined, BG more ...
