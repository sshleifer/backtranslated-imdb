I just watched this movie. It was not ridiculously bad, but I'm very disappointed with that. I'm not sure why someone would make a movie like that. It was marginally fun, but I feel that the people who did it had a lot of disagreements about what they were doing. Monday, the writer was in charge; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, the guy who catches the coffee; It looks like they really wanted to make some different movies, but they just had the time and money to make one. <br /> <br /> Someone commented that the acting was very good, but I would have disagreed. So again, if the actors were able to keep a straight face during filming, maybe they're better actors than I give them credit for. <br /> <br /> The back side of the DVD gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery ... something along the lines of a law and historical order or the National Treasury. It starts like this, but then, out of nowhere, it leads to a bad Twilight Zone episode, or ... what was that other show that was not so good ... A bad episode of The Outer Limits My main complaint about the movie is that it is so thrown away. There's the mean guy with spiky white hair. There is the love interest that, when it first appears, the wind blows through your hair. Seriously. Once you realize it's a Christian movie, the ending is also pretty easy to spot. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was poorly done, especially in the opening scenes - a way to give the best forward. It was not atrocious for most of the movie, but there was a ridiculously bad photo of an old lady, praying, with her arms raised in a dark room, while the lightning was impressive - the kind of thing that only makes you a little embarrassed to be watching the film.
