After watching this, I thought to myself: there are very few good writers and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a terrible movie. Terrible in a way that is not fun, but it makes you grit your teeth and shake. It makes you scream "this is wrong" in the movie. Immersion is zero. So far, most of you are probably accustomed to the terrible errors / weirdness in movies that have computers, hackers, etc. This movie is so in every respect. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is the girl Emily, brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope she gets big, and do it ... at least something worthwhile. Do yourself a favor. Do not watch this. There is not even proper action on it. Total loss of time.
