The opening of 5 minutes gave me hope. So Meyers proved that he only had a good idea for the rest of the film. Absolute lower common denominator humor. Painful visualization. A complete task. Written no doubt in less than a week, just like the first. Give Meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let him leave until he has developed a decent script for something, anything. He has it in him. These things Austin Powers are just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Let the Goldmember sink without a trace.
