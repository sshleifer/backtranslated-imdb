How often do we have to see a ghost walking in the background and coming through the reflection of a mirror? It has been made in two dozen movies in recent memory and four dozen times in this hectic and poorly made movie. There were only two weird moments to enjoy ... when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of characters, the performance was as flat as the Diet Coke in 64 ounces. Cup I was drawing. The secondary characters could have been drawn from various Scooby Doo designs. There was the nice old sheriff. There was the crazy freak living in the hinterland with the Alabama accent. Many characters without development. The most disturbing image was that of a murdered child at the beginning. But instead of exploiting the child's murder, which would have been interesting, they just informed us that she was dead and her parents had difficulty reconciling her death with the community and with others. When they arrived at the cabin, the scenes rarely flowed together ... with flashing images of the dead daughter interposed here and there. Oh ... and the scary sounds were also exaggerated. You know what I mean ... squeaking doors that open on their own, crickets in the woods, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh I have not seen this before. Once again, you'll see the incredible automatic aperture door of the movie over and over again. NOTE TO THE DIRECTOR: A scary scene is only scary if it is not repeated every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think of these things before calling "it's a wrap!"
