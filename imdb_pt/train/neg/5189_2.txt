This series would have been much better if they had done a simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. Diamond Head, the character needs someone who can handle the role of the kind rogue, which McShane proved he could do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the real Diamond Head, is really just on paper. McShane is not as good as the Bandit Tree. France Nuyen's character, Tso-Tsing, can not decide whether it is the unhappy victim or the woman who is tough and willing to fight. She actually earned her pay in the end when she had to play the role of Diamond Head's lover. After watching an episode or two, I did not care what happened to anyone. Tree gives us a lot to hate him, but Diamond Head gives us nothing to like him. Unfortunately, the spy genre in the 1970s was not exactly as it was in the 1960s.
