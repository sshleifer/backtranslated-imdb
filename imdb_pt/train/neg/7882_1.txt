After stopping by the movie store to find something to watch, we stumbled on it. It looked appealing by the résumé, at least then we tried. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's really fun! Oh, wait, I spoke too soon. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, the film took a turn in the fundamental right-wing Christian brainwashing. Not entirely sure what happens, but I think the writer found God somewhere there, finished writing this script and did not have time to edit it because he had a KKK meeting with his Westboro Church friends and his hood did not and clean. <br /> <br /> Can they post warnings about it? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Just like video games have rating systems, movies need some sort of symbol: perhaps a small cross at the bottom shows that a movie is going to get worse. <br /> <br /> Unless you share feelings with any idiot has come up with this story, and will have your bible open on your lap while you watch this and plan how you will convert your neighbors, do not waste your time. These are some of the worst bullshit that have come out in a long time, and radical religious nuts no longer need funding.
