I understand what this movie was trying to portray. As the old are often ignored and treated as an annoyance, which means that they end up feeling devalued and as if their lives were empty. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with this message, but I feel it could have been put in a way that is not so painful to watch. I like a good art film, but when a film becomes very consciously artistic (as in this case), the result is often frustrating. Including photos of a person packing slowly, which take 5 minutes, try to make a point, but they end up irritating the audience. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to tell them to pull together. This is a movie that you think you should enjoy or value a lot and it certainly has its merits but I was very frustrated watching to recommend it to someone else. It may have a deeper message than other Roger Michell films (for example: 'Notting Hill'), but at least that was a movie you can watch.
