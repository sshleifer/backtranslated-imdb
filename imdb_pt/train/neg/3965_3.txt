I think I agree that many of the comments here must be false. Even though the film is not necessarily bad, it's definitely below average. "Dark Remains" is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you. The movie begins already with two vaguely inter-webbed stories that are still not tied together later. A couple loses their son who is found cut into his bed. They move to a country house to escape their past and guess what ... the house is haunted. From here Dark Remains starts very slowly with some scary moments, in fact (the first ghost appearances are cool and the flashlight sequence also worked very well). OK, so ... The woman sees the ghost of the daughter, other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear, the man tries to solve the secret of houses passed, the woman gets depressed, strange neighbors appear. It's practically there, but the premise that it's the emotion itself is good, so you wait for the turnaround. No twist, you're just confused with a haunted house story, the strange neighbor, a spooky prison totally meaningless and the dead daughter played along with a photo-idea reminding me a lot of the "shutter." The ending is ridiculous because when you start and finish a movie so slowly and with piano music, it is quite ridiculous to include a few hordes of ghosts at once, which look like a zombie movie, just to get back to the slow pace and to the music of piano <br /> <br /> To make it short ... Dark Remains could have been a good story of spooky ghosts if the script was not trying to go anywhere and get nowhere.Many stories pile up together and that do not make sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the film. And next door ... please never use abandoned prisons again. It is so worn and, in this case, it makes no sense at all. "Hey, there's this creepy prison, let's film there." I think many ingredients in Dark Remains were thrown into the mix as well.
