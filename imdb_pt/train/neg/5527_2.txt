The zombie revolt is bad. There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. It is monotonous, lifeless, poorly executed and badly scripted. I've always complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste, well, this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster. The 65-minute race seemed like 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through "zombification." A man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. When this happens, he releases the zombies under his control for terrible consequences. That's it. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead. He looked so familiar. I've had plenty of time to think about it. Nothing was happening in the movie. Just before the "zombies revolted," it hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I had recently seen him as the General in White Christmas. This is how I "entertained" during most of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and is a masterpiece of cinema compared to this movie. For what it's worth, I'll give it a 2/10. (I'm not going to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I've seen worse.)
