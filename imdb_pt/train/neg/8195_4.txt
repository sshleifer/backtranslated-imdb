Every Christmas night I make my children endure another display of It's a wonderful life. I also really enjoyed Bad Santa. Then sue me. I admit. I like weird and weird movies. I also like excellent and smart people, but with so many things, variety is a good thing. What would be the Christmas season without the annual cinematic ka-ching ka-ching of Santa Claus in all its forms, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will not make anyone forget Bedford Falls, but I do not believe a Christmas movie has to reach iconic stature to succeed. "Fred" is a perfectly OK holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and enough charm for the kids. My wife and I laughed a lot, even though most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just being Vince. Paul Giamatti was a first-rate Santa Claus, which helped a lot. It's not a great movie, and it's unlikely to become a must-have attraction for anyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed what it was, schmaltz on holiday with a small pinch of spice. There is nothing wrong with that.
