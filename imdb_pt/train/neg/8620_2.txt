I was not sure if Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the blockbuster hit "Malibu Express." With his film Fit to Kill, he proved that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a director. The plot written by Sidaris, who was ungrateful for the Academy, is a complex script involving many invisible twists. The main characters composed the work for a radio station sexually known as KSXY. Cleverly, KSXY is actually its secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill" they face Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most valuable diamonds. A well-written screenplay is not everything, excellent acting from the cast helps to secure this movie as a cult classic. Panned by critics and the box office, this movie will be appreciated in the coming years. Now it is suffering the same fate that Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver have done, but in the future will undoubtedly be recognized. I am disappointed that no critical circle has recognized Andy Sidaris's trademark cinema. The costumes, the special effects, everything helps to praise this already beautiful cinematographic work. You might as well skip the bad rating 3 of this movie and get out and rent it for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the blockbuster Runaway Bride, and the action is better than or equal to the movie Last Action Hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
