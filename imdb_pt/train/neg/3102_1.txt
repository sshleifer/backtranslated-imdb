No matter how you look at this movie, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> If you see this as a horror, then it is an unsuspecting movie with the monsters being hand puppets. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a comedy then you will notice that most of the humor goes down and is just lame. <br /> <br /> If it's a novel, you'll wonder why a guy would get a B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at it as an action you can not really pull to the weeping hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie simply does not deliver anything. fun remotely. As mentioned, the monsters are obvious puppets and this movie was another attempt at a Gremlins-like movie. This, however, has the most dangerous monsters of that genre. Animals looked very good, just like the Ghoulies, even the Munchies dolls looked better than these. The characters in this movie are deeply unpleasant. The hero is a security guard complaining, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a hobo friend who has an idiot military boyfriend and another friend who is a spaz. At one point in the movie, the hero and the military fight with rakes ... this movie is completely stupid. I like the scene when they are in the dregs of the dreaded club (which obviously is not a club but more probably a dinner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 and I look more young than any of them.
