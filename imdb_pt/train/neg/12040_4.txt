I do not know anything about the Iliad so I can not comment on the accuracy of this story. However, as an independent film I found this very annoying. The battle scenes tried to be big and spectacular, but they were just obvious CGI. <br /> <br /> The acting is poor and no doubt Brad Pitt was chosen just to attract the girls. But he does not make a good warrior, too handsome, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Good points are the design. This movie looks good with the landscape and the impressive castle buildings / walls. I like a movie that at least tries to get the accents of the true characters, but this movie seems to ignore it completely. we hear Scottish American English, but what you would expect from a movie about an ancient Eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I would not recommend this movie for a family sit down. It's too long and the young people will be bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, it's okay if you do not mind the lack of realism.
