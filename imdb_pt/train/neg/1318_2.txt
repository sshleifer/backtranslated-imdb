A sentimental school drama set in Denmark in 1969, "We Shall Overcome" offers a pathetic Danish view of American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a thirteen-year-old, obsessed with floral power, leaves with half an ear hanging in the office of the brutal master Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, a school principal, portrayed as a fascist tyrant, has the local community in control. Lindum-Svendsen went too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (certainly, there was not enough drama), and stereotypical hippie music teacher Mr. Svale ('Hi, call me Freddie' ) Frits stands for justice. <br /> <br /> Tell him what. It is so unconvincing, super-acted, and so full of misery, that, like a 'family' picture, this grotesque - full of cliches - excuse for a movie fails miserably to convince the non-Scandinavian public. Sorry, let's say the Danish readers, that they fall like this in their sentimental journeys. But it's definitely not a tale about a 'boy becoming a man fighting the system'. The boy never becomes a man, but remains a face of naive crying and big eyes. If you call a small town church of the small town, led by a dictator as cartoon character "the system", I'm sorry if I'm missing something. <br /> <br /> If you are into family photos, go see Happy Feet instead
