If I write a review about a movie, maybe it stays with me ... but generally I hope I have forgotten that I saw this one in two weeks. So why bother? Because again I find myself watching a low-key movie that was fun to watch. I did not expect that I would be able to stay in the room while I was on. <br /> <br /> It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable ... nor a comedy of mistakes which always makes me shudder. It was just a sweet fuzz ... and if you can not handle it, stay with the boys in the locker room. I agree with those who advocate this movie because it is sure to please your target audience, and there will be a total hassle for an adult. <br /> <br /> It offers some good laughs here and there, but not a side splitter. Of course it's silly and just slightly fun, but at least it does not suck (as many have said it does). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to rank on the bell curve, so a 4.5 or 6 is actually a good overall rating in my book. Giving a 4 makes sense and will strengthen your rating at the time of writing this article. Giving a 1 or a 10, as most have done so far, makes sorting numbers meaningless. I can not believe how strongly people feel in one way or another about this forgettable fluff (or that I'm even bothered to write about it). I'm forgetting something? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it should be noted that Emma Roberts plays her role as Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel, often written in b * ch roles, does not disappoint when her character receives her. You may also recognize Bruce Spence as Leonard, although his role is to assist. <br /> <br /> Surely you can lose this if you are an adult. But if there's a preteen girl in your life, rent that movie for her ... and be prepared NOT to hate it (you might even like it).
