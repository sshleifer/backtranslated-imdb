What a great actor to have in such a horrible story ... <br /> <br /> The film and its production, however, are very good, although they are in London but with exteriors in Bristol. Does not matter ?? see a cathedral, you've seen it in everything, more or less. <br /> <br /> The story, however, is about a man born with the power to cause death and destruction over anyone and anything, if he wants desire. With only a fleeting reference to the instances of real-life telekinesis, the narrative constructs an image of a man misused and misinterpreted as a boy, a teenager, and finally as a man; so much so, in fact, that it requires revenge at will, literally. Over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is going in the wrong direction and thus decides to destroy the lot ?? just thinking about it! The problem with the narrative, however, is that it attempts to blend genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it with a quasi-religious claptrap to produce a miscellaneous theory about it all. Does mixing costume and fantasy in this way rarely work? and I'm afraid that Richard Burton has tried too hard on some occasions to try to sound convincing. His best scene, however, is when he gave his wife and his lover a verbal necklace when they left home: a sharp, witty and deadly dialogue, delivered just like Burton. <br /> <br /> A good supporting cast helps make things look and sound so much better, starting with Lino Ventura, which I last saw in Garde A Vu (1981), as Inspector Brunel; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner; the much underestimated Lee Remick as Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as editor, Towney and a few other known character actors. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the story was presented, as a flashback flashback to fill the story behind and thus solve the immediate mystery. of the assassination attempt of Morlar (Richard Burton), the writer with the murderous disposition. Until that moment, it was a good visual job of detective Brunel and his English helper. Still, it was very predictable, as it was very obvious to me about the identity of the would-be assassin. <br /> <br /> So they went and spoiled everything in the last fifteen minutes. If you want a clue as to what that is, think of Samson and Delilah (1949), the illustrious Cecil B. de Mille, and how Samson got the bad guys in the end. And the last scene is just stupid. Because? Because there are at least a hundred ways that the agitation of Morlar could have been stopped, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Shame, actually, because this could have been a much better story and film. I think Burton really needed the money. <br /> <br /> If you are a Burton fan, then spend time to see the scene I mentioned above. Otherwise, do not bother.
