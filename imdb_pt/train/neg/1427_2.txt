The British claymation series putting "spirited" recorded conversations of "ordinary" people into the mouths of "cute" fancy creatures had at least the advantage for non-British viewers to look funny and the kind of refined humor you could not understand USA. Someone made the mistake of putting it on television in the United States. More or less like the sad American version of the sublime Brit-with COUPLING who died in a month on NBC when the same basic scripts did not "translate" from British English to American English, which looked funny and worshipful (and only slightly boring) in England, appears in CREATURE COMFORTS, the American version, as simply a boredom with puppets. There is no plot line, no characters and after an episode and half watched (of the three finally on the air), there is no reason to suffer with more. The only positive thing to be said about the new The Summer Series and the brief and merciful campaign it has been was that claymation was at least professionally made and mounted as one of the worst presentations on CBS programming , The New Adventures of Old Christine (or "How to Be a HORRIBLE Mother"). - or person - in an endless and unfailing lesson "), children who wanted to stay awake before going to bed rushed to bed instead of watching this show, and adults could wait to watch at 9pm when" Two and A Half Men "(guilty pleasure) and" How I Met Your Mother "(real quality writing) come on.
