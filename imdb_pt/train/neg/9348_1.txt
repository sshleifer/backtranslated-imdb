I found this movie embarrassing to watch. I felt like I was pushing the plot in my throat as if I could not pick up the subtleties that I needed a voice to spell everyone for me constantly. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is still an alcoholic, I did not really feel it was a movie about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, true alcoholics are very lonely people in, in my opinion, of course. They find it difficult to communicate, something that the main character had no problem at all except that he had a problem in saying that I love you at one point - which was a weak effort in establishing his cold character. He was constantly surrounded by people too! <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that at no time were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil. I could not connect with the character and felt no bond considering my father. I did not feel anything when it was over, only relief was over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is a good actor, but not a tough guy! The mechanical orange thing was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teenager, they should have three different characters or avoided the teen stage and focused more on the adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> On a good note, I felt that the actor was very good at the beginning of the movie !!
