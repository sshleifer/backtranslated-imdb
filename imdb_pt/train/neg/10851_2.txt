This film was made for fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I'm not one of them. I think he's just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon (still, I'm not usually a black metal fan). But as I was loading this DVD to pay for it, I convinced myself that the less authentic it is, the more it tries to be convincing. So, I assumed I'd go for a rubber roller coaster and do-it-yourself spills with a sinister background. Now, that's what I like. <br /> <br /> I got home and put it on. My patience lasted 15 minutes. AWFUL camera work and WEAR quality. And it was then (2002), which appeared to have been filmed using a Hi8 camcorder. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a nice evening with beer and Bmovies would create a nice setting for this ... photo. <br /> After a few months, I returned to him (in the vicinity mentioned) and saw half. So not only did the aspects mentioned bother me. My heartbreak has evolved. I noticed how funny Dani (1.65m; 5'5 "tall) looked in his platform shoes ripping the head off of a thief on the side (Yeah, ripping his head up apparently had no skull). this movie may have. Still, I have not finished yet, so I was not positive. After a few more attempts I finally managed to finish this movie - a few months ago ... (Yes, I delayed 5 , 5 years.) So - Dani was actually funny as HELP from Satan / Manson / super-evil-man and the movie made no sense. See our bad person employs Dani to do bad things. <br /> <br /> We have some short stories joined by Dani's character.It was about a guy who STOLE SOMEBODY LEGO, because he is very, very bad. he wants to use it as his own. It is, exactly. <br /> <br /> The acting is ROCK BOTTOM. CGI is the worst of all time and, boy, it's Stinger's CGI baaaaad.) History has no meaning. And the quality is ... Let's just say it's not satisfactory. The only thing that can keep him watching is unmotivated violence and violence. Blood and courage are very well done. Well, you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on. (Example - Dani 'The Man' Filth catches a plush cat - false as it may be - and consumes it ... and then eats what it fell in. Why ... We never know.We know, however, that this cat must have been about illegal substances, since his heart is almost half his size.) <br /> <br /> You may think, after my comment that this movie is so bad, it's good, but it's bad. Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points. I added one to gore.
