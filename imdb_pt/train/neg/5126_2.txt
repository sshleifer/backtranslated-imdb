I rented this movie because I hoped it was one that the whole family would enjoy. Although the film is familiar, my family did not like it because it gives a false view of God. If you obey God and follow Him, you will not be guaranteed success. Your football team will not always win. You will not magically get better grades. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always receive a raise. Sometimes you get stuck in the old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to satisfy all our whims. Instead, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we glorify Him when things seem to be going badly for us. To live is Christ; dying is gain.
