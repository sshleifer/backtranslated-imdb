absolutely rubbish. I liked Halloween and, from then on, Johnny is in a downward spiral. this is about the wells. we understand John. pro-lifers are scary! You do not have to make a fucking movie that annoys me to tell me. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is a long way from here. Looks like John does not have much to work with here. To his credit, it looks like he did not write this crap. There are countless times when the camera just sits down and expects the actors to look dumb or say something stupid. I love the long cut. Poor carpenter does not know how to employ it. he must live with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, stop making a fool of yourself and annoy me to death!
