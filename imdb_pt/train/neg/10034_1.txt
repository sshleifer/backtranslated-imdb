If there is a movie that is the worst this year - it's TASHAN The first promo gave an indication that the movie will be a boring Dhoom 2 movie, and well I knew first it would only be a bad movie whatever maybe because of being a Yashraj movie Or maybe see the promotion chegue But this movie gave me a shock, it was worse than Dhoom 2 and what I expected Presentation of the first Saif that is boring So Saif- Kareena meets, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor oh god, what is he doing in such a strange movie? What role is that? What he is doing? His first scene is fine but then his act becomes repetitive and he overacts Then came Akshay who provided some enjoyable scenes but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated childhood novel stuff, overdose of kid style action scenes Rajnikant and all the boring scenes The end is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would have 3 more films to direct, if this movie had worked, this is yashraj's strategy, just money, nothing more So Vijay is another addition to his list of crap filmmakers Music (Vishal Shekhar) is common <br /> <br /> Performances Akshay Kumar comes in the film as a breath of fresh air, it actually provides some engaging moments Saif Ali Khan is annoying, Kareena is equally bad Anil Kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more Rest is well
