This is one more bad movie that you should probably avoid watching. The plot could be a lot more "thick" than it really is and would be best done as a blockbuster movie. <br /> <br /> Performance leaves something to be desired, although you can not pinpoint what It is one of those you watch on TV late at night, maybe in the USA simply because you can not sleep. Watch if you want, but do not expect too much from her.
