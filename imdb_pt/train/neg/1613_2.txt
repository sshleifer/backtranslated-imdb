Now that Che (2008) has finished his relatively short period in Australian cinema (extremely limited release: 1 screen in Sydney, after 6 weeks), I can join the two presenters of "At The Movies" to topple Steven Soderbergh. It is usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style / subject, but Soderbergh's latest film, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), is also missing a story, so the narrative (and editing?) seems being of Soderbergh. main challenge. Strange, after 20 years in business. He has probably never been very good at narrative, just hiding it well within "daring" projects. <br /> <br /> None of this gives you an apology for this almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, "two parts of Che do not (not even) form a whole." <br /> <br /> Epic epic only in name, Che (2008) hardly qualifies as a feature film! Certainly it has no legs, in so far as, except for its final uncharacteristic resolution imposed by history, Soderbergh's 4.5 hour chant goes nowhere. Even Margaret Pomeranz, the most tolerant of Australia's At The Movies duo, commented on the repetitive waste of Soderbergh (digital storage HD): "you are in the forest ... you are in the forest ... You are in the forest ... ". I'm also surprised Soderbergh did not give us more 2.5hrs than somewhere between his two existing parts because he still left out massive pieces of Che's "revolutionary" life! For a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure, Soderbergh inexplicably alienated, if not deliberately insults, his audiences by <br /> <br /> 1. never providing much of the history of Che; <br /> <br /> 2. imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dull repetition; <br /> <br /> 3. Ignoring both true retrospective and a narrative of events; <br /> <br /> 4. Misunderstanding an idea or a character; <br /> <br /> 5. remnant claustrophobically episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. Ignoring the appropriate context for the scenes - whatever we have is bogged down in disruptive time intervals; <br /> <br /> 7. linguistically displace all audiences (even Spanish speakers will be confused by incongruent exposures in English); and 8. unnecessarily whitening your main subject in one dimension. Why, in this last stage? The T-shirt franchise has been a success! Our sense of claustrophobia is certainly due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen basing their script only on Guevara's memoirs. Thus, as a poor student who read only ONE of his texts assigned to his designation, Soderbergh's product is extremely limited in perspective. <br /> <br /> The public is held captive within the same limited knowledge, setting and circumstances of the "revolutionaries", but this does not arouse our sympathy. Instead, one notices that "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to hurt his audience in the same way as the Latino peasants at the time." But these are the same illiterate Latino peasants who sold the good doctor to their enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate us and keep us mentally captive? Such a straitjacket audience must have a purpose. Part 2 is more chronological than Part 1, but is literally numbing with its repetitive repetition of bushes, misery of perspective, and lack of arcs of variety or character. DelToro Che has no opportunity to grow as a person as he struggles to educate his own undisciplined troops. The only problem is humor while Che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant "revolutionaries", some of whom violently have no self-control around local peasants or food. Certainly we have no insight into what caused the conditions, nor any strategic analysis of its guerrilla insurgency, as it was. <br /> <br /> The excruciating countdown of Part2 remains terribly episodic: again, nothing is telegraphed or contextualized. So even the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demi√°n Bichir) are unexpected and disconcerting. All selected events are presented minimally and latin-centric, with Part 1 interviews replaced by time-change meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president (Joaquim de Almeida) and US government officials promising CIA intervention (!). <br /> <br /> The rest of Part2's woods and blue day-to-night filter only exasperate the audience until they're eyeing the exits. <br /> <br /> Perhaps DelToro has been very sorry for the frustration of many non-American Latinos in never getting a sincere and flawless story of Che's exploits in their own countries. When foreign governments still do not deliver a free press to their people - for whatever reason - then one can see how a popular American indie producer might try to seduce the not so well read ("I may not be able to read or write, but I am not illiterate! "- cf. The Inspector General (1949)) for his own local cinemas. The film's obvious negligence and excessive oversimplification strongly suggest that it is intended only for the understanding of the less informed. If they did, they would have read books on the subject and criticized the relevant social issues among themselves - learning the lessons of history as they should. <br /> <br /> Such perceptions are precisely what societies still need - and not just the remaining illiterate Latinos of Central and South America - yet Che (2008) happily fails to deliver. Soderbergh buries his leadership because he is weak in the narrative. I am shocked because Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew that. Forty-four years ago, the late perception that Guevara was much desired: that's what I went to see this movie, but the director mocks us diabolically. <br /> <br /> David Stratton, writing in The Australian (October 3). 2009) noted that while Part 1 was "unequal", Part 2 actually "rapidly descends" from there, "mapping Che's final campaign in Bolivia in excruciating detail," which "... seems almost unbearably slow and turgid." <br /> Che: The Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly not a travel book for Bolivia, painting it as a picture of misery and atavism. The whole second half is only redeemed by the humor mentioned above, and by the dramatic - albeit tragic - capture and execution of the theme of the film. <br /> <br /> The rest of this never-ending movie is just confusing and irritating misery. - for a Soderbergh movie, to be avoided at all costs. He is bound to break the hearts of all who know, if only a little on the subject. (2/10)
