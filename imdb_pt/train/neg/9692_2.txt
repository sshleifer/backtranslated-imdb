Bonjour Tristesse covers land similar to that of "The Marriage Member." namely, a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a loved family member and an intruder. While critics love 'Marriage Member', I find Julie Harris a sassy and adventurous in everything she has done. This portrays annoying and rich idiots as last year in Marienbad, but this time it's a travel diary. <br /> <br /> In this Preminger movie, the sequences develop, but the characters do not. In the first 30 minutes, he is content to confuse the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, making sexual readings uncomfortable. Once the conflict is introduced, Seberg can not provide the depth that the piece requires. Kerr pulls the rating and turns the film into "Endless Love". Seberg's empty narration is like something out of the Strange Interlude - not good. I really wanted someone other than Niven to be in her role. He spends so much time normalizing British orthodox behavior in all his films, he never gets around the character. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable sequence, a night out dancing becomes a place for everyone in a harbor. Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty exercise, "The Conformist." Kerr is on board to shake hands and portray another great pain (as in Black Narcissus, Night of the Iguana, King and I, Heaven Knows Mr. Allyson, Tea and Sympathy, etc. etc.). Really, Kerr was a horrible actress. I wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car accident, or rather start with one. <br /> <br /> People uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.
