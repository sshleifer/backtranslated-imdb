the foywonder review of this cheap STV hits the nail directly into the head. Make sure you have read it. If you do not do it, a group of scientists head to the deep forests of the Pacific Northwest to get in the way of a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard. The Big Foot family does not kindly accept this, and proceeds to withdraw the team one by one, largely off-screen. Big Foot himself has a monkey-like face, but it's less scary than Harry's in Harry and the Hendersons. Most of the movie has the generic actors of wood pretending to be scientists walking through the forest and walking away. This is a budgetless movie in which very little happens, at least on the screen. We begin to watch the sexiest of females take a shower while one of their male companions watches, but nothing comes of it.
