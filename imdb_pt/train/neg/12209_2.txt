Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and brother had a policy that the person who chooses the movie should pay. And while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me, I could not resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I came to see crap as Conan's second movie and never say never again! Now, though this is a miserable movie, it's in fun places to watch - in a dead brain type. And, technically, acrobatics and camera work are good, so it raises my rating to 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike Rambo's first movie, this one has virtually no plot, Rambo himself says only 3 words (besides grunts and screams), there is an unnecessary and completely irrelevant and underdeveloped "novel" and the film is a giant stupid) special effect. And what stupendously awful special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are thrown at Rambo, none has any effect on it and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo hits its mark! And while the thugs are using AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes, all Rambo has is a bow and arrow with what looks like a nuclear tip !! The scene where the bad guy is shooting at him while he slowly and calmly launches one of those exploding arrows is made especially for idiot viewers! It was beautifully parodied in UHF, starring Weird Al. In addition, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a funny parody of the genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, such a stupid and meaningless movie, is almost like a parody of itself. !
