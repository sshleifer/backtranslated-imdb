I could not relate to this movie. Could not get involved intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was very dense and uninviting. I could not connect and therefore worry about any of the characters and I'm finding it hard to find much positive to say about it. <br /> <br /> I read this to understand it properly. familiar with some of the most obscure aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that, as an atheist, I probably do not know many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and not dependent on specialized knowledge or beliefs.
