All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you do not understand what makes movies. If you insist on making movies about gangsters, I recommend you do a search. It's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that sound even more absurd when they talk. <br /> <br /> I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and starts kicking his ass in kung fu fashion. This movie was hard as a special after school. Who had the idea of ​​having used hats that say where a particular gangbanger was? I suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming gangs. That would be stupid considering new laws that add duration to a penalty if a person is related to a gang. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the worst gangbangers movie ever made.
