1993 was the year. That was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas won an Oscar. Who knew I'd be an extra in a movie with him? In fact, I got an extra on "My Boyfriend's Back," which was filmed in an Austin suburb called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thank God the producers changed their minds!) I was on the theatrical scene. I ran to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters. It's more of a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you might want to take a look. Nothing that is close to the quality of "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead", but the cheese factor is good enough. bye
