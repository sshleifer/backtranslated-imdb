Beast Wars is a show that is super-hyped, overrated and overrated. Let's meet the characters of this nasty show whose creators must have gone into acid to try to make a show like that. <br /> <br /> Cheetor - Seriously, they need to have censors about this guy. How does he not scare viewers with the same voice as baby Taz? (at least Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is voiced by Slip & Slide) Action Blast - If you want a show line that sucks, get G4 Tranceformers Cybertron - A show that should go down in a bathroom. Good Job Creators (Sarcasm) Show yourself self-retarded and boring (at least Super Mario games are better) This program had many followers telling you to bring it back but I believe it was canceled for your own good .
