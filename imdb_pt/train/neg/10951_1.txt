I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palme d'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious! I actually watched the whole thing simply because I could not believe someone would make a worthless movie. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt to give any kind of environment with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to waste 2 hours of your life watching this movie, make sure you bring something to vomit because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a portable camcorder and half the time you can not even see the main subjects. This style has been used with much more success in films like "Blair Witch", because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense to which this style would lend something. I should have known better when it came at 2 o'clock in the morning that it was going to be awful.
