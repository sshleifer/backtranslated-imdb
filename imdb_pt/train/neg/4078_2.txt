JESSICA: THE HISTORY OF GHOSTS is how the name indicates a ghost story. The theme is to be horror, but it gets closer to the comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman who was brutally murdered returns from the dead. This is what this movie tries to convey as a plot. There is really nothing more than that. The film consists of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman before her death. <br /> <br /> Immediately from the opening scenes, this movie has the appearance of a "straight-to". -DVD "effort Unlike gems like VACANCY 2, the film has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives a bad name to" straight to DVD "movies! The direction is as poor as possible with a complete lack of suspense, fear, or tension.Even the elements of the drama are hopelessly treated and represent something more annoying than the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune to bear. <br /> <br /> The overall performance is absolutely awful, actor involved can show even the smallest potential of a successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between the dialogues.I'm not exaggerating! </ The only reason I give this film a rating of 2 instead of 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with an even worse dialogue made some unintentional laughter.I emphasize the word "few" ness the phrase. This is not, in general, one of the so-bad-it-good films like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch those movies. If you want to see a good horror movie about ghosts, watch THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE EYE (original Korean version), THE GRUDGE, ONE CALL LACK or PHONE. <br /> <br /> I advise Anyone who has had the good fortune to avoid seeing JESSICA: A GHOST STORY, to keep up the good work! Just forget that this movie exists. Do not skimp on that!
