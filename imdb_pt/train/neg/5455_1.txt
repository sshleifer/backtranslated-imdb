I saw this work at a film festival in CA. My God, what was the director thinking? Film teachers should use this film as a case study of what NOT to do when making a short film. First of all, this project makes absolutely no sense. The movie happens partially in "The Waystation", a stupid bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> The acting is beyond evil. So bad I almost thought it was a comedy. Lead actress Julia Reading is a step down from acting in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner, but it's as if the director had no idea how to work or use their actors. The only thing worse than acting was the dialogue, which bordered on the absurd. The writer (whom I assume is also the director) writes each character as if he were auditioning for a comic book villain. <br /> <br /> The overall value of the production is very good, but to be honest, with such a bad movie it's easy to ignore it. The production design is very good, although the Waystation looks like any common bar. The costumes and makeup are fine, and I understand that production was working at a low budget. It's just when the characters speak, or try to push the plot forward, the film unfolds into a piece of crap. <br /> <br /> Like I said, this movie sucks. It's as if the director / writer watched a lot of sci-fi films and played every part he liked in the blender and invented it. My only hope is that he used other people's money on this, because if he used his own, he's a total sucker.
