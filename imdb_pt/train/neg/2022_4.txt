Dude, this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books. Frankly, I found it very slow and unattractive from the start. I kept waiting for this to get some steam, but this never happened. This movie is overrated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, with the King James English, has never appealed to me in any way, so it may just be me. There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film, as they show Ronald Colman in the role of Othello. <br /> <br /> The good points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some good cinematography and a young, lean and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is simply too annoying, too repetitive in some of the scenes to watch again. Also, we all know that most of the actors are crazy, but praise to Hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story.
