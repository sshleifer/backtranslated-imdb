Do not watch this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our collective observation, my friends and I estimate that each of us lost 5% of our brains during the course. The only person involved with his creation that was not clinically insane was the set designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. I now realize that, instead of a feeling of revulsion, this film has generated a deep hatred within me. I hate this movie very, very much. <br /> <br /> Some may say that this movie should not be taken seriously. If only he did not take himself seriously. But this happens. The plot is a warmed version of the Blade Runner-esque universe fused with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. The dialogue is not only childish and meaningless, but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg is not even trying, but George Newbern as Theodore Rex's voice is like nails in the soul. And if Juliet Landua is back with British accent or Richard Roundtree (also known as Shaft) as the noisy commissioner, you will delve into a growing sense of disbelief and disillusionment. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film only to those who want to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind can fall.
