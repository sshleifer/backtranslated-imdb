Have you ever watched a movie and after it's all over, it's like a big "wtf!?". <br /> <br /> Welcome to the decoy. <br /> <br /> Another direct video to video action action, you can immediately forget to have watched or, better yet, did not watch anything. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick star and are quickly wasted in this fast-moving mercenary-for-hire move where the story is really bad and the action is a drug and what's the point of watching an action movie if the action explodes? Robert Patrick in particular hits a new record in an action sequence that causes him to fire a machine gun while in the hood of a school bus on the go. Co-stars Charlotte Lewis and Scott Hylands of Canada (TV's Night Heat).
