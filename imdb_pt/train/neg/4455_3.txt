Where to begin? OK, do not compare this movie to fight the club - ridiculous. If it was even a patch in the fighting club, violence, blood, blood etc. would be much more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this movie is not a football factory - which is much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby seem like an embarrassment). Fair enough, the plot is pretty decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending that I could add. But the film in general is poor, seriously poor. As people mentioned the accent should not spoil a movie - I disagree - either a simple casting error, or a lack of effort in training the voices caused the film to be annoying all the time - was obvious from the scene an American / Geordie was playing the role. Do not get me wrong, handsome guy, that looks great with a fur head - but no, not a soccer hooligan. I could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was - the "butler's" situation. Also, when the GSE will play United in the north, they go on the train hoping that only 3 of them - does not make sense - this is a true organization of gangsters and thugs who is portrayed in the film as mickey cult to mouse about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - have West Ham and Milwall not played in the last two years together in the Championship? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Bother' would be able to get into a Milwall pub. Basically, a very poor movie that people will enjoy if they have little knowledge of real football and vandalism. If you really love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism, you will simply feel as if this movie has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
