Oh, Lucius Fulci, rest in peace. This infamous Italian is most famous for "Zombie", and the absolutely countless "The Psychic" and "Baby Manhattan." Well, add that to the unshakable list. <br /> <br /> The plot, so to speak, concerns a nekkid woman wearing a gold mask and a floss. She wants the power of a young nicknamed stallion who has a set of magical arrows and a bow. They are magical because they shine. Arrow boy joins a guy with a bad wig, and they spend most of the movie rescuing each other from flat-action sequences. In the end, the nekkid girl is defeated, but not before taking off the mask and reminding me why I broke up with my high school sweetheart. <br /> <br /> Fulci bathes all the shots in an orange glow and fills the screen with smoke. Nothing like a fuming orange action sequence to make you crave Sunny Delight and a cigarette. Special effects are laughable. In a sequel, our ambiguously gay duo is attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously scratching the film itself. Most of the effects budget must have been spent on fulci-licious blood, which consists entirely of wounds of gushing. Hey, we can all use a good gush sore once in a while, but when you start spouting an exaggerated injury, it gets boring. <br /> <br /> I kept messing with him. setting brightness on my TV anyway <br /> <br /> just to see what the heck was going on. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of talk about filling in omens and prophecies, so let me take a look at the future ... if you find this movie and watch it , <br /> <br /> you will regret it. The scene in the video box (by Media) does not appear in the movie in any context. "Conquest" is a work with <br /> <br />. What MST3K could have done with this! <br /> <br /> This is classified as (R) for strong physical violence, strong gore, female nudity, brief male nudity and moderate sexual content. <br /> <br />
