I thought the movie was a bad documentary. Nothing of substance was discussed. It seemed to cheapen ideas and did not provide anything new. The movie lacked wonder or romance or anything that really took the person to science. Most scientists seemed "stereotyped" and sometimes strange. One woman said her prizes did not matter much, just children who were helped. She said that after a 10-minute scene, she explained all of her awards. Playing "humble scientist", are we? "I have equations dancing in my head," said another. I do not see how that explains anything to us. It did not cover significant effects of science in our culture. The politics of science have hardly been touched. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie for kids between 10 and 14 years. Besides, I felt it was boring and irreversible. <br /> <br /> 4/10
