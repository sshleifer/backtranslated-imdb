I really should have gotten a different movie from the rest of the commentators on this site because at a screening of the movie last night the audience got so mortified by the dialogue that (I'm not kidding) half came out. Shown as if the filmmaker thought he was approaching some new daring territory by presenting a story of homosexual maturity, the film uses visuals inspired by David Lynch with the performance inspired by Fassbinder. The performances in this film are so monotonous and boring that I imagined one of the actors would faint for how uninspiring they seemed to be by the script. What's worse is that it is colored like an episode of Miami Vice. I do not know who this director is; perhaps he has surreal pretensions like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all the above-mentioned directors exhibit a level of erudite sensitivity that is extremely inadequate here. I could understand the meaning of this movie about ten years ago, but when we have masterpieces like Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, why bother with this film mob? There is nothing new to be seen here.
