<br /> <br /> The film is typical Sunny type with bashes, great dialogues and melodrama <br /> <br /> The movie also has typical Rajiv Rai ingredients of many henchmen and a strange villain. <br /> <br /> The match is fine and then the move to Kenya is good but then the movie goes on and on <br /> <br /> <br /> The sequence of events moves at a slow pace and nothing happens <br /> <br /> There are many stupid scenes like the Kenyan police who are shown as playful, especially Sharat < <br /> The climax is also prolonged <br /> <Rajiv Rai does a good job The song is good, only 1 song works and this is the last TOOFAN The camera is good <br /> Sunny Deol is as always, Chunky acts like a monkey while her serious scenes are laughable, Naseer is alright Heroines are pure wood Amrish Puri is not even m tade as he was in TRIDEV the rest is fine.
