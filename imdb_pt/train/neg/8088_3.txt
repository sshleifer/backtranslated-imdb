To make a good movie, you need excellent actors or a great director. You need at least one of them. In this Eye of the Needle we have none. <br /> <br /> I do not even remember the director's name. He must not have done much in his career. I really like Donald Sutherland, but he can not be the lead actor in a movie. It falls short Sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for no more than 15 minutes. I would say, for example, that Sutherland was excellent at Oliver Stone's JFK when he talked to Kevin Costner on the park bench for 10 minutes without stopping, even without a breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland, being the lead actor in a movie, is not good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? She's probably good for TV shows. The DVD is awful. Terrible colors. Terrible light. I could not even appreciate the Storm Island scenery for how bad the picture was. <br /> <br /> This Ken Follett story was good, but it's a shame they turned it into an uninteresting movie.
