I never understood Garbo's appeal. She always comes across her stuck movies, not so seductive, and that annoying voice that could have drowned the tuba section. She was also a very limited actress, as Gloria Swanson, much better left in the age of silence. In this his last film, his performance is very average and even unsafe. She struggles, but it all comes to naught, because the script is even worse than her acting. <br /> <br /> A rombo that is never believable and never goes out of print (even if Melvyn Douglas gets on the air in the skiing scenes, which is really the only fun thing here. <br /> <br /> There was potential, but the script fails in almost every department, wasting each actor on it. Douglas and Garbo had good enough chemistry together, but this is not a point in Ninotchka, which I also found extremely overrated.
