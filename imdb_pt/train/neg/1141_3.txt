With low expectations, the new opening shoot (with more than five minutes) of 'Husbands' was a pleasant surprise. I will not say that the new footage was a first class material, but it provided a very solid basis for what "could have been" a totally original good movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was set up in 1955., during a day of shooting times. After the filming, Jules White decided to simply cut the images of 'Brideless Groom' for this short, making a not so smooth transition of the story, that Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a quick look at new images at the end, giving us the old, worn-out boys' end (Moe & Larry, in this case) being shot in the ass. <br /> <br /> 3/10
