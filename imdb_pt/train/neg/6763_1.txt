God, what a horrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and pictures here), but for what? The whole thing behind "Natural Born Killers" seems to be a "clever" view of how media can turn into complete junk, but unfortunately the movie turns into junk. Please, Mr. Stone, the next time you want to criticize the fascism of TV shows using violence to get high fees, avoid doing the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said very cleverly about this film that was denouncing fascism of the media with the fascist cinematographic forms. How true ... He just forgot to tell us about the huge headache that you feel after you've been through this crap!
