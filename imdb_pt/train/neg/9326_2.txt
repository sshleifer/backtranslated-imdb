Me and a group of friends rented horrible videos to laugh at them, believe me, this led to horribly spent money, but also to a few laughs. SICK. is one of the best but funny horror movies that we rent. The plot is over-done, the whole take your friends to the woods and never come back thing is too old. The craziest part of the movie looks like you're visiting the local butcher shop, except a little dirtier and with blood on the dough looking like meat. And if anyone has ever been afraid of this movie at any time, they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls are reasonably hot, one better than the other and you see them naked during the movie. The other good thing is that this movie is so bad that you laugh until you cry. I do not like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos, I do not find it fun, but seeing the amount of effort these people invest and still go out so bad is hilarious and worth renting. Unless you're very mature to laugh at the falls of someone I would recommend. <br /> <br /> If you rent / buy to laugh, I would give 8.5.
