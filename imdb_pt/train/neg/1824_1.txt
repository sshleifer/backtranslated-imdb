I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for making this movie. It is, in a word, boring. Maybe being too predictable, Ben Stiller's loser role, more than exploited, or unusual funny scenes, make this movie something to forget. Even Christopher Walken's appearance ends pathetically. I was very disappointed. I love the performance of Ben Stiller. I loved most of his films, the last one I saw before was the Duplex with Drew Barrymore and it was not so bad. About Jack Black ... Well, in addition to High Fidelity, I've never seen him doing anything good. And the School of Rock? Ooops, scary.
