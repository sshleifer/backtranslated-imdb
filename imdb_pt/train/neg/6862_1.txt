This superior inferiority to the original film "Blind Dead" is another waste of garbage. So many people have exaggerated these films that I can not believe what they say about it. Ever since I was a kid I've heard about how scary and big these movies are and I've seen them all and I was completely disappointed, everyone was stoned out of the '70s or just did not know how annoying this oil is?
