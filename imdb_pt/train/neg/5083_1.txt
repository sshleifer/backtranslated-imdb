I find it useless to comment on this "movie" for the simple reason that it has nothing to comment on. It is similar to a rotten egg that has nothing good to show the world out of the fact of being rotten as another endless. number of eggs were before him. But since a commentary is required for such a grandiose insignificance ... Filth is definitely the word to describe this film created in the same way as any other Romanian "film" directed by Lucian Pintilie, which insists. to describe the so-called "Romanian reality" after the Communist era (1990 to present). <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances recommended for people outside of Romania as for others (who lately find amateur camera, lack of plot, lack of quality of direction / actors etc, noise etc. as being modern and even artistic ): watch and enjoy this "movie" (as I know you will) but make the other well-meaning members of the IMDb a favor, do not write a review online as this will mislead, irritate and, in the end, time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie (among others) has some value, an educational one for him gives the example: "How not to make a movie."
