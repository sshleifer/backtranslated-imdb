This was another big screen for a 60's TV show. It's fun enough, but it was a lot for the formula. The intelligent Martian lands on Earth and finds humans not very bright, in his opinion. <br /> <br /> The usual madness follows with the human, Bridges eventually connects with him and helps him get home. Along the way, he also gets the girl, Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a good ride for some Hollywood stars that I have not seen in a while. Pleasant enough to pass. some free time if you have nothing better to see.
