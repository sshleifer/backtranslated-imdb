Murder By Numbers is one of those movies you expect to be made for TV, but it's not. Considering the only actor of any note is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving to bigger and better things), it's no big surprise that this movie quickly fades from memory to be replaced by more important things. Like ... remember to lock the front door when you leave. Or putting the clothes back on when you get out of the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a police officer with personal problems (it's not all). Along with her new partner (a wet-looking Ben Chaplin), she is called upon to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual there, except that criminals are a couple of teenage students who think they planned and executed the perfect murder. As the investigation continues, a battle of wills arises between Cassie and the main suspect, Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling). <br /> <br /> The paralyzing issue here is that the two leaders are desperate. Bullock, though she's pretty cool to see, is almost as believable in the role of a cynical cop as Rodney Dangerfield (actually, he'd be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and I'm sorry he has to put this film on his resume in his attempt to invade Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, as dishonest and conniving suspects, acquit themselves properly. As if cunning clues were not bad enough, a story that would make anyone sleep and a highly predictable (but illogical) ending throws that movie into his head before he gets a chance to be executed. Murder By Numbers "has absolutely nothing for it, even a nonsensical nudity scene of Bullock would not rescue him. Well, just a little, but still not enough to save him Unforgettable, predictable and redundant - this is a movie that will not take the cop genre in. As Cassie probably says in her next case, there's nothing to see here.
