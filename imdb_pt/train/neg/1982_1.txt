Who? What? At where? When? Because? The acting was terrible. Very robotic, rehearsed. I saw all the actors in this movie in the best roles. The script was very elementary. At the end of this movie, the plot was tied. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied too. So he never tries to write / direct another movie.
