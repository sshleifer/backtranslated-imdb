Once again, Disney manages to make a children's film that totally ignores its past. About the only thing common with this and the original Gadget designs are the names. The most glaring mistakes are the characters - Penny does not have his book, Brain has been reduced from a character to a costume accessory, Dr. Claw is more of a show-off than an evil villain etc, but there are more than that. The horrors begin in the first minutes of the movie - having Gadget as a security guard named John Brown does not help to identify him as the classic Inspector Gadget. And right at the beginning we see Disney's blatant attempt to turn every story into a love affair between a man and a woman - they feature Brenda, who only serves to make this movie compatible with Disney. Add to that the fact that the "Claw" seen in this movie and the classic Dr. Claw is almost diagonally opposite and you will see that this will not be even close to the original plot. What would help would be a better plot to replace it - but as you guessed, Disney also failed in that. The whole movie is just Gadget acting silly because of the nonsense and coveting Brenda. As if to add insult to injury, Disney introduced the "new" Gadgetmobile - it does not look, work or think like the old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just the canonical figure "comic relief." Disney obviously recognized that the Gadget drawings were a comedy, so they also did a comedy, but they got all the smart jokes (like the mission role exploding in the Boss's face) and replaced us with Gadget being an idiot, the Gadgetmobile being a wise-ass, and "Claw" showing off. Someone should tell Disney that the "children's movie" does not imply "total lack of brain use." The gadget should be targeted to children from 10 to 12 years old ... not children from 10 to 12 months like this movie. Whatever this movie should be, it's NOT, I repeat, NO, the real Inspector Gadget. Because I love old Gadget, I hate it.
