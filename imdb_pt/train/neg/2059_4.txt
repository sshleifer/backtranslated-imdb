A program girl witnesses a murder and becomes the assassin's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really a pretentious roll here: his camera revolves around corners in a museum (after a long time on a painting of a monkey), divided into split screen for artistic purposes, virtually gives his plot with a sequel (again split screen), where two characters are watching a TV show about transsexuals, and stages their (first) finale during a stormy storm. "Dressed to Kill" is exhausting, mainly because it asks us to swallow a lot and does not return anything substantial. Much of the acting (with the exception of the young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) final is a scam by De Palma's own "Carrie" - not to mention "Psycho." The explanation of the dirty acts plays like a spoof of Hitchcock, not a homage. Elegant in a cold and austere manner, the final results are different. ** in ****
