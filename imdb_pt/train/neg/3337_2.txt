Leaving aside many of the favorable comments that have obviously come from friends and / or relatives who pepper this and many other low-budget independent listed in IMDb, one is lost when it comes to using these ratings as an accurate indicator. So eventually you have to go out and rent the movie just to see for yourself. One of the first things you should understand are the slogans that camouflage the reality of the movie. In this case, the term "dark psychological thriller". Read: "Hack writer / director who thinks he's an author, who replaces plot, story and action, with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul." "Your great insight?" Repressed and repressed childhood trauma emerges to ruin chaos when many would be filmmakers like Kallio, who were raised in low-budget horror movies of the last few decades, could not dig their own fresh grave, buried the graves of many other directors who came before them and are happy to repeat ancient and tired horror clich√©s that they borrowed from a dozen or more movies. The result is a waste of non-original, uninspired and unbelievable material.
