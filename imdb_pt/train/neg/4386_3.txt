With a title like this, you should not expect a great horror movie. But that was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: a criminal who ran away wears a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he's someone else. this joke can run for 5 or 10 minutes, but not throughout the movie! the actors are not that bad, but their characters are pretty dumb and the story is boring and completely stupid. No suspense, no emotion and little gore (very cheap). The Little Helper of Satan tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically in this. It became so annoying at the end, that I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I could not care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great at Pulp Fiction, but come on ... that was 13 years ago, and she did not do anything decent after that. So no wonder she had to sink as low as this piece of crap .. Avoid or be warned ..
