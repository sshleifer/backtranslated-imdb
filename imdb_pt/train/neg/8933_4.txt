Watching this last night, I was struck by the fact that Fox had spent so much money on it and had invested so little. It is the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the first morning of filming Raquel Welch dusted the shelf over her mantel to prepare a place for the Oscar she would surely win for this daringly original movie. Oops That's not what happened. <br /> <br /> The set's internal struggles were detailed by Rex Reed and this helped the film to have a reputation even before it was released. When it was finally released, there was the usual circular advertising circus. As I recall, in Houston opened at drive-ins and neighborhood theaters and never touched any of the great sites. <br /> <br /> I put most of the blame on the director Michael Sarne, who was hot after having directed JOANNA, a film with music about young people in modified London. <br /> <br /> As I recall, Fox eventually fired him and put the film together as best they could. That's why the scenes unfold in any particular sequence and the characters appear and then disappear. An impressive supporting cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) is wasted with nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To expand it to the size of the feature, there are numerous Fox movie clips featuring such stars as Carmen Miranda (in incredible footage of THE GANG'S ALL HERE) and Laurel and Hardy, who have never dreamed that they would be playing in an X rated movie. <br /> <br /> The X rating is due to numerous occasional sexual perversions; however, none of the characters seems to be amused. Perhaps someone involved with the film had a distorted puritan sensibility and imagined that if they could make these things unpleasant, it would not be bad to exploit them. <br /> <br /> This was one of the photos of the "youth" that almost went bankrupt. Hollywood in the 70s. One writer joked that EASY RIDER (which was made for money trading) was the most expensive film ever made because many movies followed, which tried and failed in the worst possible way to double its success. Sixty-one-time honored directors such as Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger made films like RPM and SKIDOO in an effort to attract a young audience. White directors and writers have tried to make movies to attract a black audience. These movies are locked somewhere in a safe and the two nominees and many others of that sort have never gone as far as I know in home or cable video. They are the deep secret of the studios. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch's performance in all this is very good. With the right direction and script she could interpret the kind of bold women released Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specializing in. She looks great and has amazing costumes. Mae West is the most animated actress of seventy-five I've ever seen. On the one hand, it's kind of painful to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years past, but I'm sure she needed the money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget movie this season check out BEYOND THE DOLL VALLEY (also from Fox) because you do not take yourself seriously. They are crazy kids playing with the equipment in a big studio. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE tries to say something. There was no one who wanted to listen.
