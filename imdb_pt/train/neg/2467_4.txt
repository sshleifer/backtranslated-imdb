This movie gets a rating of 6/10 from me, as well as a 9/10 rating. Here's why: As a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where action and threats are taken into account, this movie will get you boring. It's basically a family drama similar to what you'd see on the Lifetime channel, but put in a universe of terror. The story and formula are old and retreaded hundreds of times. If you are looking for some originality in the plot structure or minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Take out the zombies and you'll have something as melodramatic as A Brilliant Mind, tripping over cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the synopsis and the basic idea are quite original and exaggerated. It's literally something that you and your friends would make jokes when you're half drunk. . . but this joke really did have a theatrical release. The idea wins 9/10 from me. The only reason it is not perfect is because they could have taken it even further, but they did not. <br /> <br /> The mix of both is mixed. I found it funny, but like in most comedies, it was not funny. I had my mother and my little sister watching with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the scripted jokes. There were moments of absolute genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films have this kind of exaggerated risk and original ideas. I just can not say it was perfect, or even close, because of the lack of originality of the plot. <br /> <br /> A great movie for the family. A great movie to watch with a lot of guys (or girls). A great movie to watch with anyone. . . but if you watch by yourself, it will be a bit annoying. Other people always make this kind of movie more fun and rich. <br /> <br /> 4/10
