My score for this crap: 1/10 1 for the tech only. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that does not make sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is an almost impossible mission. <br /> <br /> Although it is easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the greatest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make such pathetic movies. <br /> <br /> We need to believe that driving people to idiots. Maybe it was a reason to believe, since 99% of the movies suck. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> When you look at the price we give to the Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And, oddly enough, it's always been money for this nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to hear this s ** t, press the super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
