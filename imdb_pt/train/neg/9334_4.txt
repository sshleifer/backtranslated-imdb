An OK movie, set in Mexico, about a gunslinger (Scott Glenn) who hangs out with an American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after a success. Does it pay to take you to the border? but things get out of control. <br /> <br /> It starts well, but it quickly debates and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The eventual twist relationship is poorly created and hard to believe. An absence of passion and, essentially, no reasoning behind it leaving one man to another, made it ridiculous - and the end was predictable and bland. <br /> <br /> ** End of SPOILER ** <br /> /> Harvey Keitel is the US agent on the trail of the killer, but he seems a bit confused about how boring and slow the script is .. .
