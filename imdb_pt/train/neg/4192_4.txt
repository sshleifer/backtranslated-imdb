In this short an urban man and his wife have their strange lives armed when the man starts wearing his mother's old red pants in the law. <br /> <br /> I kept watching this hoping that I could see why it was done, or because the other reviewers found it funny. For me, it was a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> Not all tastes are the same, but this was clearly not mine.
