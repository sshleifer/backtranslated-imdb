This movie is more or less what it seems: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and sex scenes (quite meek)! The movie is not sure what it wants to be and ends up in a mess. It's more expensive than most director Al Adamson's films, but it's not at the same budget level that viewers expect from science fiction films. The actors are very bad and unlike most of Adamson's films, there are no former big names or actors B. Some of the songs are good, but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for many years.
