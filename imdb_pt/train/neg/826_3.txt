I love these actors, but they were wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine, what were they thinking of agreeing with this crap? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger just called him in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked "Breaking the Waves," you're probably going to enjoy it too. I hated them both. 3/10
