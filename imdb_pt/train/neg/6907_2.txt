No cunning writeup here because it does not deserve one. It's not an art film. Not even one of those "hidden" gems. You know, like those movies you hear through a friend who saw this incredible movie downtown, where they show all good independent and art films. <br /> <br /> Just put it in the Christmas boxes and discard it quickly.
