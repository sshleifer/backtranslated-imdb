When I first saw Robotboy, I thought it was new and interesting, but then I realized that with each episode, this show is trying to teach you how to behave, which is good / bad. Episodes have become predictable. And main characters are not interesting. Once again we see a hyper-intelligent boy, beaten by his older brother, parents who do not understand his son and his friends: girl and fat boy. Also this show has no logic. A super-modern robot that works with two AA size batteries and can use many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and overactivated modes. We see two different robots, and that narrows down the main idea of ​​the show: "The robot must learn how to behave in human society"
