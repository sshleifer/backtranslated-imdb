One of Boris Karloff's true clinkers. Essentially the dying Karloff (seemingly about 120 years older than him) is a scientist who needs money to finish his experiments before he dies. Moving from Morocco, where his funding is taken by someone else, he goes to southern France, where he works as a doctor, while trying to spend enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he makes a deal with the young and wealthy wife of a dying cotton baron. She will fund him if he helps her poison her husband so she can get her money and continue with a gigolo (which I think is married). If you think I realized the movie is wrong, I had to read what other people posted to find out what happened. Because? because this movie had me lost from two minutes. I had no idea what was happening to his numerous characters and multiple lines of converging plot. Little is spelled and much is not said until the end in that time I really do not care. It is a boring mess of purely pure interest for Karloff's performance, which is rather strange at times. To be honest, this is the only time I saw him enter the bizarre territory of Bela Lugosi. It's not every scene but a few and it makes me wonder how much they left.
