*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If someone were to review the movie based only on the premise, one might think that you were looking for an animal-oriented horror film. The plot is as follows. A group of documentarians are going to an island to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or surfing in the blood. (I live in South Africa, so it was released as "Blood Surf.") I admit that this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it, that if it were explored further, it might have improved the film somewhat. However, this is not the case as the part of the film is minimal due to the fact that the documentary is interrupted by a large saltwater crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is whenever someone is eaten by the crocodile, which is a frequent occurrence in this film, no one seems to give a shit. The most anyone did in the movie was simply toast the victim in a scene that was supposed to be moving, but it turned out to be ridiculous due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was highly dubious in nature. Another thing that really annoys this movie is that they introduce characters that are totally superfluous to the movie itself. They introduce a bunch of pirates that can only be seen by adding another 10 minutes to a short and merciful movie. <br /> <br /> You can say that the acting is mediocre. It would probably have been much more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work with. All in all, there is not one person who has a terrible impact on me. Each person seemed to be a diluted caricature, and thus none of these actors caused any kind of impact on me. <br /> <br /> The crocodile itself is considered huge, over 31 feet long. and that sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious pretense of a crocodile they provided us with in the film. The crocodile's death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and invented that it makes the stomach flip. With a huge scream of bravado, the hero of the movie announces that he has a plan that ends up falling on a hill and causing the crocodile to impale on a fortunate spigot at the bottom of said hill. <Br/> <br /> All in all, I would say this movie is a movie that should be seen for you to believe in how bad it can be. What probably seemed like a good idea at the time, was suffering from a terrible script and an overwhelming low-budget sensation that served to create a truly horrible movie.
