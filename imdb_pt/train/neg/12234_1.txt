I think it was useless to produce a second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie, but it's ridiculous to do a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.) dies. The story ended after the first movie. I wonder why anyone tried to find a way to make the story go on. That was nonsense!
