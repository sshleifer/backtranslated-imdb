I like quality shit, and that ranks up there with some of the best. the cg is out of this world, or at least predates our world, and the insanity of a 6-foot guy in a mouse suit chasing people is ridiculously bad. I enjoyed it a lot, but the acting is so horrible, and even the obligatory nudity scene has nothing wrong with it. just a complete waste of time, if ever I saw one. I do not know who lost the most time, I see this, or the poor wives who have been dragged to do so in the weak hope that this will launch their acting careers. I can assure you, it will not. However, on a clearer note, I was able to successfully make Kevin Bacon's 6 degrees from that film, so I think it was almost worth watching at 91 minutes of it.
