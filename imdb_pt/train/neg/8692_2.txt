I think Elisabeth Rohm, although she can work, is not very good at all. I think it was because of the budget that she may have been the one who got it for that price. I watched mostly for the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most believable and undoubtedly the most attractive to see. When he was not on the screen, it was dead. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me shivers, but make sure that in real life he is a gentle, funny, compassionate man. He even said playing that role gave him shivers. <br /> <br /> I'll watch anything with it, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. She was as exciting as the Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person, but no actress.
