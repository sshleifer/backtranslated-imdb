I saw this bomb when it hit the theaters. I laughed all the time. Because? Because the stupidity of it made me go crazy. I look back and realize there was NOT ONE funny thing in the whole movie. Do not leat anything intentional. It's very funny that Lizzie cn chews a piece of Nurplex and becomes a gigantic carnivorous demon ... but her little dress is perfectly intact, though now she's hundreds of times bigger than when she puts it on. Or the kind of film in which a man might be shocked by a defibrillator and just become unconscious, and return to consciousness without any medical attention. And do not let me start the ridiculous fate of the "villain" they decided they needed to create "conflict." Uh huh. <br /> <br /> For the person who complains about Disney just by targeting children - The cheeky parts of this movie seem to refute that claim. Do we really need Daryl Hannah accusing Jeff Bridges of having eccentric video tapes? You do if you are from Disney and you are out of ideas to make the movie appeal to the above 8 crowd without writing a smarter screenplay! I am completely convinced that Disney compensates for the ratings board so that the films can end the murder and still get family-friendly ratings. <br /> <br /> What a waste of the DVD format.
