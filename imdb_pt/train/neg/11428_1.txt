OH MY GOD ... THE WORST THAN I HAVE SEEN - that's the main thought that came to my mind right after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anyone with the opposite myth. But maybe the idea was good, but the effect was miserable. I especially want to say the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion, it has destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character was touched in an affected and annoying way. Every time she shows up, she remembers that you're watching a movie and it's destroying the spirit of the moment, so the whole movie, because most of the time you can see their stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion. Terrible, do not waste your time.
