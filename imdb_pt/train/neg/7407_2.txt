1º visto 6/18/2009 ?? 2 of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): Strange psychotic movie about a girl with autism being tested in a hospital, power flashes, and then all hell breaks loose. I'm honestly not sure what the filmmakers' intentions were about it. What we won in the next 1 ½ hours (at least it was not over) was a horror / twilight zone / ghost / zombie movie that really ended up making no sense until the end. Initially, after the lack of energy, everyone is missing in the hospital, except for a small group of misfits, including the girl and her father. There is the typical boring character, a scary old man and the typical tough guy look like many pessimists and of course the young the main character is drawn to. Random things begin to happen at various times, like ghosts and monsters appearing, an insinuation that time has stopped, and dead people while this little group tries to escape whatever it is. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of it all somehow and I really hate how they used the affliction of this girl and hinted that she was the cause and put her in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame. We never figured out the answer to what was happening - which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. Unless you want to be scared and confused for an hour and a half, this is not for you or for any viewer. What a waste of time?
