A rather incoherent film about a man who belonged to and left a superficially hippie religious cult of the 1960s, which fights them sixteen years later. The man has a son with one of the other cultists, who during a police attack is hidden and taken away by another man named Hawk, who lives in a small hut near the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people of the city. It's hard to know who the characters are or what period the scenes are supposed to be going through. The leader is on parole sixteen years later (I took it out of the box - I lost the amount of time in the movie). No one is meant to look older, or notoriously, anyway. <br /> <br /> A murder is done with a large circular saw, others are made with knives or a beast. I've never heard the name of the title character mentioned in the movie, but he's the one who overacts more, pouting and screaming. <br /> <br /> The movie is mended very badly, with narration helping (not much) to explain what is happening. Some of the sound effects were very bad. A man is being punched and we hear the sound of a whip breaking. A woman fires a gun, and we do not hear her shoot, but she hears a ricochet! It does not seem to have been made for comic effect.
