I just saw Adam Had Four Sons for the first time and what struck me was that I believe the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four children. They were roughly the same ages as the four boys in this movie. Warner Baxter in his interpretation of Adam Stoddard spoke about the same values ​​and family tradition that you would have heard of our 26th President without some of the more exuberant aspects of TR's character. <br /> <br /> Like TR, all Stoddard's children serve in World War I, in this case, although the younger one only loses an eye instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But what if a female shit goes into this all-male house and mess things up? This is Susan Hayward's work here. In one of her earliest prominent roles, Hayward is an amoral flirtatious girl who marries a child, has one affair with another, and begins to make a play for the third. It is a forerunner of the kind of part that later earned him an Oscar in I Want to Live. <br /> <br /> I suppose with a model of decorum as powerful as Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter portrays, everyone is afraid to tell Dad what's going on. The children and also the housekeeper Ingrid Bergman. This is where the plot gets a bit silly. Bergman is introduced to us as a housekeeper hired by Baxter and his wife Fay Wray to their children. Wray dies and Baxter undergoes some financial investments in business. Bergman has to be released. She returns to France and years later returns to the family when the children grow up. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I do not think kids need a housekeeper right now. Hayward is right when he confronts her that it was not the boys who brought her back. In the normal course of things, Bergman would have gone on with his life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the movie that I have been editing. Possibly, this could be the reason for the many holes we have. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Ingrid and Susan could not have made another movie together in the 1950s when Hayward was on his heights and Bergman had just done it. a return. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam Had Four Sons. And I'm willing to believe that much of Ingrid was left on the cutting room floor.
