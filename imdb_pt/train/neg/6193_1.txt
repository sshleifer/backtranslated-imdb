I can not believe I just spent an hour and a half watching such a faint movie. If there is only one movie you have to lose, this is the one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father recently died, so he starts dating some local anti-social teens and use drugs. All this makes you subconsciously more violent and finally such a subconsciousness explodes ... <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I do not think I can find any sense or traces of great ecstasy in this movie, not in any single character. If the director considers what I have seen in the last minutes as a great ecstasy, I must say that this is not even close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is not mature either. Most of the time I could not see any facial expression from the actors and did not feel that the body language was enough to make an impact. Maybe the team was so tired it fixed the camera to include everything in the settings. Everyone happy except the public. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are many unrelated scenes and conversations that may be related but are actually so random that you can never get them together unless you wrote them. <br /> <br /> In an hour and a half you can find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other hours there are just people walking, talking and moving. So I really can not comment on acting here. <br /> <br /> Good choice of music in the last minutes. Maybe that's the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I've never given a movie to 1, but this movie certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch Scary Movies). This is a movie about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers comes across an extremely upset audience. I hope you do not join any group.
