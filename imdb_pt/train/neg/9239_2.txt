Heavenly Days commits a serious comedy: he is desperate to teach us a lesson in civility, and will not stop until we pass the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly make a trip to Washington, where they see the Senate in action (or inaction, if you will), have a fight with the Senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of his career), get acquainted with a bunch of stereotypical and annoying refugee children, and find a man on a train reading a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace !! A year later, he was considered a naive communist, but in 1944, he was A-OK. Add some truly horrific musical moments, a lot of hooeyas and a boring plot about newspaper reporters, and you have a movie that must have had Philip Wylie ready to write Generation of Vipers 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Drastically messed up, Heavenly Days is another reminder that the devil has all the best songs.
