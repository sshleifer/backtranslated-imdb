If it had not been for "Oh So Gourgous", Natassia Malthe, this B movie would not have been worth a sector of my Tivo disk space! At what low rent, back lot warehouse was the supposed spaceport filmed in? "People of continuity!" It's a basic principle in real cinema! At night an alleged spaceport and day (night and day on a space station?) A warehouse! ??? People Please! The only thing I recommend this movie is the costume department. for ever, keeping Natassia in those tight and revealing clothes! Even the women who saw this bomb had to enjoy the clothes that she obviously spent some time getting into every day of filming! Science fiction channel would have been better showing SpaceBalls! At least there would have been some real humor in watching something so unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Fr. Michael Ironside, please activate your agent as soon as possible! You are much better of an actor, even associated with this level of film production.
