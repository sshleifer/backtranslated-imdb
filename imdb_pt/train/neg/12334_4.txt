The premise is ridiculous, the characters unbelievable, the trivial dialogue and the absurd end. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but see him making an accent of Pepe Le Pew for 2 hours, since a supposed French is not as much fun as it sounds. <br /> For your part, Meg Ryan is once again as joyful and adorable as one (make your choice): kewpie doll, baby, dog, kitten, what do you think is the cutest creature in the land. She also bears no resemblance to a real human being. <br /> <br /> This film seems to me an opportunity taken advantage of by friends Lawrence Kasdan and Kline to spend holidays in Paris and the south of France, while they are well paid. this. So I can not blame them.
