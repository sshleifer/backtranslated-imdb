I love special effects and testimony of new technologies that make science fiction look real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I've seen most of this movie since it has been on HBO for the past two months. I must admit, I may have missed some scenes, but I'm usually drawn to movies, and I've seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see a bit of "Hollow Man", I feel depressed, almost like a "film noir". Not sure why; maybe it's because I do not want Kevin Bacon to be bad, and there's disappointment in that. But I think it's witnessing how relentlessly evil it becomes. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do not recommend it for youngsters under 14 (maybe 12 if they are mature).
