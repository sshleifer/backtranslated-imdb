The cover of the DVD and the disc is incredible, you'd think they made a movie about black metal candy that's still a great idea, but the actors in this movie are worse than Ben's at pearl harbor, and better actors. I was going to buy the DVD, but fortunately I rented first, the plot and script are also horrible, nothing seems to go together for the movie really never makes sense. The poor attempts to scare you using flashback scenes are worse than those used in the '80s series, and in the end they will leave you wanting to hit your head against the wall of your house.
