I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many of the facts were incorrect. The only certain thing about the Chinese story in the movie was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues guarding ShiHuangDi. I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many of the actors and actresses were not very good. Some of the supposedly "funny" jokes were really stupid. I think this movie should get the worst rating possible. Disney really needs to get more information about Chinese history if it wants to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was pretty accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time.
