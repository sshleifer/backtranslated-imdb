Truly horrible movie made by director of photography who turned director Ted Tetzlaff. Quite decent looking movie, but for a time bomb film totally devoid of any kind of tension. Ford, as someone put it here, dreams of his characteristic smile. There are some details around - the former Canadian Army or the RAF, bombs disabled in the war, his wife is leaving - but none of these secondary stories add up. The bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? What time period are we talking about here? World War II or postwar? I assumed the second that makes the reason for the bomber even more salient. Usually, however, just a horrible movie. There are many good time bomb movements to skip this. Watch any episode of "Danger UXB" for a more exciting time, with approximately the same length of time.
