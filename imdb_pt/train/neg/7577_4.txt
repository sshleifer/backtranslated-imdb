This is just a little eye catching for fans of the "bad movie" entertainment. It pays off for the pop culture students of the 1970s: fashions, furniture, attitudes, and that big time for women in the early 1970s, when there was still a new independent, independent, independent woman. "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a monetary reward if she stunned her career (after all, a flight attendant, but a 30,000-foot waitress - who is also good for men), slept with several men, could protect yourself and others (with karate) and was not tied to anything. This is the kind of emancipated woman who frightens the juices of anti-feminists, those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband. <br /> <br /> The "sexy stewardess" was a powerful archetype of the late 1960s to 1970s, (even in "The Partridge Family", I remember rocking bachelor Ruben Kincaid constantly attached to flight attendants) and from that point of view, this silly movie is an important time capsule from pre-AIDS to pop culture. free love, female lib, swinging the seventy. The plot is quite terrible though. And for those cavemen in the audience, there are few bare breasts to look at.
