this movie really tries a lot. If you're going to make a horror movie, at least give it a reason to believe in connecting the viewer. <br /> <br /> Wait and wait for the movie waiting for some great explanation, but this does not happen. instead, try to be very smart and not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the movie? Where Is It Really Going? and more importantly what the heck was going on. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how did they connect to anything? just another faint science fiction horror. I love the fake comments about the IMDb saying how good it is by related press releases to hit the movie (or that or people have low horizons). not worth your two hours. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the movie is better than the fragile, but at least that gave you reasoning and why things happened and has a final result. this does not happen and it's just waffle with tons of fill to make everything look scary. this movie is as low as when a stranger calls. God who was lame too. <br /> <br /> Great tip, if you're going to make a horror, make it convincing with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on, so they have a hook in your story. because if there is no reasoning or credibility then there is nothing firm and it can not be scary. no disrespect to the cast or team because they did a good job. it's just poor writing.
