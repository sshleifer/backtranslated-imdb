Roman Polanski has made many films that are not exceptional. Your fame puzzles me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I did not see 'Knife in the Water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he made to filmmaking ended more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and / or monotonous (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). <br /> <br /> R's baby must have meant the end of the establishment the moment he came out. It's a high-quality concept for a 1968 horror movie (never show the baby). But that's just misconceived horror sap. Everything is artistic to such an extent that the plot becomes hopelessly clear too soon (Um, thank you for that title that destroys the ending), and on a clear day you can see the end of the twist coming in for days. It did not hold my interest. I think whatever that movie was, it was totally hampered by the 1960 version of what was femininity. Farrow is a helpless and distracted and helpless housewife. Her fragility is exaggerated ... she's annoying to the extreme. There are no real ideas in him ... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. <br /> <br /> The Dakota is barely exploited by its strange potential.
