Joyce Reynolds appears to be an adult for the role of Janie, a sixteen-year-old teenager in the small American town who frees her soldier to a visiting soldier and ends up on the cover of Life magazine (kissing a party in general) same week An uninterrupted barrage of jokes, criticisms, bull-talking, and unimportant business, like Janie's little sister bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (as the housekeeper) constantly chasing after little children, Janie's mother involved with the Red Cross, and Janie's father trying to write an editorial about problems with today's teenagers (such as parents, dull, asexual Edward Arnold, and babbling Ann Harding make an unlikely couple even in 1944, he seems unable to conceive a child much less lifting two of them). Nominee for an Oscar (!) For the edition of Owen Marks, the Warner Bros. followed this in 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds must have outgrown her cohorts then - she was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 of ****
