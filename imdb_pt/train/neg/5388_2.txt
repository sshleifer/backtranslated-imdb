There's a good movie lurking here, but that's not it. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral issues facing a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so confusing that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid in picking up the mysterious airborne contagion that has destroyed virtually all of humanity. They still wear surgical masks sometimes, not others. Sometimes they are fanatics about sanitizing any area touched by an infected person. Other times, they seem completely unconcerned. Worse, after apparently surviving a few weeks or months in this new world of killing or being killed, these people constantly behave like new messages. They do not bother to accumulate proper equipment or food. They are always running out of gas in the middle of nowhere. They do not take elementary precautions when meeting strangers. And after traversing the rotting corpses of the whole human race, they are as touchy as warm-hearted debutants. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived so long ... and even if they did, why would anyone want to make a movie about them? <br /> <br /> So when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions, it is impossible to take their soul quest seriously. Your actions would have to make some kind of minimal sense first. <br /> <br /> On top of all that, we need to deal with the dubious acting skills of Chris Pine. His portrait of an arrogant young man, James T Kirk, may have seemed insightful when viewed in isolation. But in Carriers, he plays exactly the same note: arrogant and silly. It is impossible not to suspect that this is all its dramatic scope. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the movie * looks * great. It has a very clear and saturated appearance that really matches the southwestern US location. But this can not save really weak writing nor the fine (and annoying) characters. Even if you are a fan of the end-of-the-world genre, you must save the agony of watching the carriers.
