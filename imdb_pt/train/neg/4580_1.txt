I'm still trying to decide if this is really the worst movie I've ever seen - A very disturbing problem with this movie is that real scientists are interviewed, but their footage is edited to give the impression that they support the ideas of the many BSers that populate this movie. The signaling rate for interviews is about ten thousand for one - in the end, respondents seem to be saying, "We want you to think ..." but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research on the things they claim. If you feel that you are open-minded and want to expand your consciousness, be open-minded enough to read some books on quantum theory: "The Einstein Universe," Nigel Calder. (a small volume, not a challenge), "The Cosmic Code" by Heinz Pagels. If you can not read a book, please do not complain to the reviewers about being "open minded". <br /> <br /> To recap, this movie is unbelievably bad. <br /> <Do you know what a really good movie is that questions the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol and Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, thought-provoking.
