Anita e Me seems to be little more than an excuse for Meera Syal, the author of the novel and the script, to expose its prejudices, complaints and general antipathy towards the English. The general feeling of Indian superiority over the English in this film is bad. The English in this film are portrayed as obsessed, violent, dirty-mouthed, promiscuous, involved in child neglect, stupid, uneducated. , racist, ugly, eating poor and stupid food - revealingly, just by turning to Indian culture the local priest can be "redeemed" at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the Indian Family is beautiful, intelligent, educated, can speak many languages, are loving and loving parents, and high school fodder. The film is so insidiously damaging that I'm surprised that the BBC funded it. If it were the opposite, an English family in an indigenous community portrayed in this way, the film would have been seen as racist. <br /> <br /> There were moments when my eyebrow went up so high on my forehead. I thought it would lodge in my hair. First, the gossip scene among women in the Divali celebration - undertext: the English are dirty and promiscuous - and men - undertext: English women are prostitutes. Second, the meal with Anita, where Neema's family lies to her about cutlery - undertext: the English are so stupid, you can make them do anything. <br /> <br /> But the underlying contempt for anything English-even English. marriages are an object of contempt - is evident throughout the film. Anita's character was designed so amazingly - almost the stumbling of fallen woman - that I finished the film feeling angry. <br /> <br /> This is not a "Bend it like Beckham" where humor is focused on loving exaggerations of a community's behavior and customs within that community, and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds if uniting Instead, Anita and Me seem to say that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, since the English are almost a version of the Indian caste untouchable, and this is highlighted by a series of veiled attacks on the "other" community of the film: English. <br /> <br /> I felt that Anita and Me is a job full of hate and based on complaints. On this basis, the BBC should not have funded its production.
