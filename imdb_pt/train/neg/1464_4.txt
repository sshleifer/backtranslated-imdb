I watched this hoping to discover something I did not know about the most infamous man in modern history and could not help but think that the story was rewritten in HITLER: THE INCREASE OF EVIL. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have a shot of his admirer. Hitler appeared with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking, but did not the writers confuse Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana's SCARFACE? That's bad enough, but what really offended me was that there are whole chunks of historical context missing in this miniseries. Germany lost the first world war and the Allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price for it. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that is why they turned to Nazism. The German humiliation of the 1920s caused by allied powers seems to be entirely absent, so there is no way to HITLER: THE INCREASE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I did not even mention that Himmler and Goering are conspicuous by their absence <br /> <br /> There's a plus point about the miniseries and Robert Carlyle in the title role. Sure, some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a bit too loud (recordings show that Hitler had a soft and seductive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he can communicate Hitler's own charisma on screen. Comments in the British press that Carlyle resembles the Sparks synthesizer more than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the best interpretations of Hitler. <br /> I liked the performance of Robert Carlyle, but I hated everything else. about this mini series and asked why on earth was made first. There is nothing to recommend to serious fans of history
