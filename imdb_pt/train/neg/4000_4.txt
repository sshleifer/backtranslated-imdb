I liked "American Movie," so I rented the first Chris Smith movie, which I thought was a documentary as well. In the first minute I saw it was not, but I gave it a chance. What a dead end movie. Being faithful to life hardly serves you if you are just going to examine boredom, esp. Boredom, with which we are already familiar. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but it will be something relevant to ANYONE that 1) many jobs suck and 2) most sucks, minimum wage jobs in the service sector ??? I knew that before I saw the movie. It really did not prove an exam of it anyway, as the film struggles to feel "real" (handheld, no music, etc.), what is happening hardly ever unfolds like in the "real world." Would an employer be so cheerful with Randy when he got his check, after Randy fired him after 3 days, when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months ?? Or the day after he quit his job (and ruin the machine he was working on), would everyone be so easy on him? <br /> <br /> A big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This guy is a loser. Not because he is stuck in these jobs, or has a miserable apartment, or looks like one. He's an addict. He does not pay attention or actually try these works. It has zero personalty. If I had to hire someone, he would not be past the interview. <br /> <br /> I'm anxious to see what Chris Smith will do next, but, boys, end the "this is an important movie" stuff. "American Job" does not work.
