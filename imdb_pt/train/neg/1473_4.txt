A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose devices and means attract men susceptible not only in their arms but also in terrible circumstances that will typically only endanger the male victims, along with uncertainty about whether or the tempting ones will not be forced to take the remedy, and here Susan Lucci presents herself as a mermaid, although her acting abilities of a novel pedigree are inadequate to make her performance credible. Isabelle (Lucci), the unstable wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love affair just for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a trifle to her, but a serious matter for Richard. , apparently hypnotized by her lover, as she takes advantage of his ardor, wrapping him in a risky plot that will form in a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis becomes convinced that Isabelle is a victim of the physical abuse administered by her husband, he desperately tries to free her from what he feels to be a marital trap so he can marry her, coming to believe that the only clear solution to his situation will be found in a rudimentary essay on hiring a professional assassin who will get rid of the supposedly violent Stewart. In the wake of Collins's assassination, a pair of police detectives, played by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become increasingly curious about Isabelle's possible involvement in crime, while at the same time the reality rises to Richard as he might having to pay an expensive price in exchange for the maneuvers of his inamorata. Lucci and Kasnoff are proposed as a pair of viable conspirators, each giving a reading that makes a set of boring rather than charming pigeons, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong twists in a movie that suffers from a banal scenario as well like uninventive direction and design elements. Released on a Fremantle DVD, this largely unglitzy case depicting a man under the spell of a seducer benefits from the high-quality visual and sound quality, and while no extra feature is provided, the above-average quality of production increases the efforts of cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.
