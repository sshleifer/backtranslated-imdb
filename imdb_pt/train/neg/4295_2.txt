This is another depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very uneventfully and is predictable and continues throughout the film. I kept waiting for him to pick it up, but unfortunately that never happened. The acting is fair, but the script needs a lot of work. And if you're looking for nudity, do not waste your time with these not-so-hot actors. Due to poor sound quality and lack of subtitles, I lost 1/8 of the film. If you've never seen more than five gay films, or if you recently agreed to be gay, you might find this film interesting, otherwise it's your low-budget movie. It ranks as one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
