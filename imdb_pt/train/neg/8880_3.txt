This movie was o.k. but could have been a lot better. There are some scary moments, but there are not enough of them to make me want to see this movie again. There are some scenes in which you can move forward and not miss anything. The biggest flaw is that it's so predictable, and that's the reason why I rated it so low. It's watchable, but do not expect anything good.
