Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of horror movies. I never watch them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure it's better than this ... movie? Anyway, we really did not expect it to be good ... we really were just laughing at it. Cool with me ... I have a problem in ruining the movie for other people in the theater, but as they were just other couples talking and kissing, it did not matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes the 2 other people went out to get into Borat, a movie that I would be happy to see again about it. The movie was not scary, and not stupid, so it would be funny ... it was annoying. It was not terrible as "Baby Genuises" terrible, it was terrible as ... not fun at all. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm no expert, but it seems like the problem with the horror industry nowadays is that you can have a horror of PG-13 that is annoying and not scary or you can have one R A horrible horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting to people. <br /> <br /> You want a PG-13 horror that sucks, but is it funny? See "The Scream". Avoid this movie like the plague ... because it can literally bore you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
