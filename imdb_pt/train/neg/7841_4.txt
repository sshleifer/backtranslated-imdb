I liked The Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played as a typical sequel. Everything about it - budget, script, plot, cast and performance - was less than the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe, looks nothing like an Indian, nor half of the other "Indians" who were touched by Italians, Mexicans, and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old man who played the chief acted more like a fat old man than a fierce leader of warriors. He even wore the bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such a great job in the original, seems to be wasting time. I think he could not resist the easy pay he received for replaying his role as Horse. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the film, like that of a painful ritual of purification. find their sight "and gather their yellow hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but in general, the return is uneven, boring, tacky and predictable - as well as most of the sequels.
