I can not believe, IMDb really has all the TV shows known to man! I have not seen this show in over 20 years. I only remember two episodes, and I barely remember those. I remember that Tony may not have appeared from the beginning, because one of the episodes I remember is one in which everyone tries to get Tony to join, but he rejects them, but usually at the end of the show he becomes a Power House member , with everyone applauding. <br /> <br /> The other one I remember is the one where Lolo, for some reason, pretends to be dead, (complete with funeral and mourners). I do not remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends. <br /> <br /> This is one of those shows that I convinced myself that I must have dreamed of since no one had ever heard of it.
