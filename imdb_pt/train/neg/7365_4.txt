An assault movie is not bad, but it's not so good either. Kirk Douglas is a newly released prison who, after rejecting an offer from the Mafia, decides to pull the job on his own. He recruits the circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem goes on. Douglas and Gemma soon found themselves being chased by mobster Romano Puppo, as well as getting entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps up the pace and there is at least one excellent and creative sequel to the car chase involving Puppo & Gemma. Although it is an Italian production, most of the footage seems to have been made in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just throwing a quickie in Giallo. The impressive Bolkan gives a great performance. The song is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
