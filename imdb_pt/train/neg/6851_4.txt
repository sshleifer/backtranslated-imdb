Feh. This movie started in an interesting way, but quickly went from confusing to tedious. The confusing parts happened mostly in the beginning, where the scenes are so numerous that it is difficult to say exactly what is happening in the first twenty minutes. The dull comes later, with a tepid romance between the two living people (pussies both). The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the movie, which is sad. If the rest of the cast was up to its caliber, the film could have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the story gets really interesting for a while, as it seems that the insane mother priestess of the dead sixteen-year-old girl is trying to resurrect the daughter of death, with the decidedly unhappy side effect that all other dead people would also return to, assume a solid human form and probably start killing everyone. A sort of Japanese mystical thing from the Night of the Living Dead. But that does not happen. Even if this hairy, dirty priest with a small basket tied to his head tells the uninteresting young men that it will happen if the priestess completes her ritual, she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter. No mass ascension of the dead, no traveling army of corpses, nothing. The priest merely makes the girl's spirit go back to the land of the dead, carrying a boyfriend's misalignment with her as she crushes her spine like a brittle peanut (where I was tempted to scream loudly, since idiot was kissing and caress the dead girl, ewwww !!!). The best sucking friend and Robitussen has a long introspective shot at the end when she leaves the village for the last time, and that's it. No real horror, no real shiver, which the Japanese tend to do much better than the American filmmakers, with their emphasis on exaggerated makeup of the face, without strident mimes. I was very disappointed.
