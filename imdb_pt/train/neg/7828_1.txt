Along with 2 days in the Valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just another long line of Tarantino thefts that has sprung up since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere that the film creates is fun in the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make the unpardonable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to rise to the "hip" quotient. You'd better skip this one.
