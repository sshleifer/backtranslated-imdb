It seems that more analysis has been done on the analyzes of this film than on the source. <br /> <br /> Here is a criticism without pretensions: <br /> <br /> When you think that nothing is going to happen <br /> <br /> It happens, it is not so. <br /> <br /> Get dressed as you like, this is a bland movie, full of disinterested characters that make very little interest. <br /> <br /> One to put on If you want to convince an impressionable emo girl that you are, so deep, man. <br /> <br /> It is not something to observe your own pleasure. <br /> <br /> Unless <br /> You are. <br /> <br /> Pretentious.
