I did not really post comments, but wanted to be sure to alert people about this movie. It's an unfinished student film with no redeeming features. On a technical level, it's completely amateurish - constantly unwittingly jumping inside scenes, wildly dubbing, etc. The plot is completely clichÃ©, the structure is laughable, and the acting is embarrassing. I do not want to be too hard: I did my share of student films, and they were all terrible, but there's no reason for this movie to be in the world where innocent fans will have to see it. /> <br /> Sure guessing that - as well as the cast - positive comments are filmmakers, friends and family.
