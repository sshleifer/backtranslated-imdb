Regardless of the subject, it is an amateur, exhibitionist film - or an effort at one - that is as interesting and daring as the composition book of a high school student filled with "poetry" of death. Of course, this will disturb viewers who are determined to be disturbed, but success will be attributed to themselves, not to the director. To genuinely face someone's skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. The film contains an evocative image, shown as a real estate (and also used in the case of the video), but without development that took it or moved away from it. If the director had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting film - that is, a movie.
