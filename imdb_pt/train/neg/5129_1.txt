The message of this film is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not ugly (actually she is much more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now, would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" were really uninteresting? When will Hollywood stop this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message you want to convey, this movie is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br />
