The story of Nikolai Gogol, "Viy", was filmed again and released in the United States via Faith Films. <br /> <br /> The original story concerns a priest who has to watch over a witch's body only with his faith. to protect it. Widely expanded and defined in America, although clearly filmed in Russia (the houses, clothes and furnishings are all wrong despite the English signs), this is a weird movie that does not really work. Part of it is the odd setup that tries very hard to be backwoods America but clearly is not. There are also some strange moments, intentionally oblique as the main character being a reporter at the beginning and a priest shortly after. I do not know why they did this, even after seeing the making of it on the DVD). The other problem is the dubbing that is beyond horrible. It is done in such a way that everyone talks when their lips are not on camera - or if they are the voices do not even remotely match with the lip flaps. I do not know if it's the fault of Faith Films or the producers who made the film in hopes of getting rid of it in the West (revealed in the production of the play). <br /> <br /> The movie is not very good. As I said, there are all sorts of technical problems that make it a strange curiosity of the ball. Despite some really beautiful horror images, the movie never works like a horror movie. How the film to engender faith is too confusing in this recount to make anyone feel closer to God. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I would give a pass, even at a banana price. My advice would be to find the 1960 version of the tale called Viy, which will bring some creeps and some understanding about a belief in god.
