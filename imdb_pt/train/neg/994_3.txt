This movie was simple and simple. Okay, so it's basically about a girl who is raped, and to get revenge, she gets another guy to rape the rapist. The rapist is an idiot, but the victim is partly to blame. I mean, they both get into the mood and start kissing and stuff like that, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she will not let him, so the rapist rapes her. And the thing is that the rape scene for the girl is too short and does not actually show or show anything, but when it comes to rapists being raped, it's a very long rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching. 3.2 / 10
