The STUDIO 666 (also known as THE POSSESSED in the UK) is another sub-par slasher that looks like a straightforward DVD movie. <br /> <br /> While many of the direct DVD movies are fast paced or unintentionally hilarious in the bad sense, the STUDIO 666 is a regrettable flop. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing, all comments on the first page include a negative rating and a negative review. . Each of these people hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> The two people (at the time of writing) who wrote comments rated 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. Obviously, they have seen some horror movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> The only really positive thing I can do about this movie is that it does better than CHOKE and ONE, two extremely mediocre horror films that I would not wish on my worst enemy! <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie must have been made hundreds if not thousands of times. The film only has a slight twist (and one that is poorly handled) to the usual expectations. A depressed singer commits suicide. Soon afterwards, his spirit again possesses one of his surviving friends. The said possessed friend goes on a kill. The rest of the plot is really too bizarre to summarize. You only have to see for yourself, as long as your interest has not yet diminished to the point of extinction, of course. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie is very poor for the most part. The actress who played Dora was an exception to this. Her character was always interesting and alluring when she was on the screen. It helps to raise the film above similar contemporary endeavors. Unfortunately, some of the lines she was given to say were poorly written to say the least and thus prevent her from saving the movie. <br /> <br /> The direction was equally bad. The villains did not seem at all threatening, each murder was totally devoid of suspense or tension, the atmosphere was nonexistent, and camera work was incredibly basic. Some of the special effects (if you can call them that) reminded me of the TV series, GHOST STORIES. Unfortunately for the producers of this film, GHOST STORIES has cleverly written screenplays, believable performances and made excellent use of camera angles. Maybe if the producers had watched this TV series closely, they would have picked up some more techniques that could have saved that excuse for a movie! <br /> <br /> The music is completely inadequate to the tone of the film. It's just rock and not the best examples of this kind either. Do not make me start playing this horrible song at the beginning! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, particularly the dialogue, are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up (or should be down) to the level so bad it's good. <br /> <br /> Overall, STUDIO 666 is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy. aspects. I recommend this only to those who are fans of movies direct to the DVD and wish to see all the slasher ever made.
