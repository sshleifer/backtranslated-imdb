I do not think I'm too far away saying that this is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I have been working on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "Bridge to the River Kwai" (all in black and white), all with good plots, rich characters and excellent performance. I have seen better dialogue and acting in a college written by a student. The plot, however, is not a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's like a traffic accident, though, I could not turn it off! A movie does not need a lot of money or great scenarios, like "Twelve Furious Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... then the budget is no excuse. What were they thinking?
