Warning: This review contains minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequences are very good for direct video. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very annoying movie. Where the hell are the Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of Graboids in the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry into the series should be a "character study". Unfortunately, there is not an interesting character in the movie, except for the character of Billy Drago, who receives few lines, very little to do and, in the end, little time on the screen. What saved the second and third films was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. Whenever there was no action on the screen, you could be sure that Burt Gummer would be interesting to hear and / or watch. However, in this movie Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and annoying replacement. On the plus side, when the Grabids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on screen, they look good, but that's as good as it sounds. <br /> <br /> I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed with 101 minutes in length. Very good for direct to video. But after watching, I'm sure that this movie lasts about 15 minutes. There are long stretches of dialogue that are boring and do not favor the plot. Were you in a hurry to make this movie? I do not think so, more time could and should have been spent on the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with .... Tremors !!! How lucky I thought, pay for # 4 get # 1 for free. Well, after watching Tremors 4, I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I can not imagine paying a single penny for Tremors 4. For fans of the series, it's best to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins really exists. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The Legend Begins ranks 3 out of 10.
