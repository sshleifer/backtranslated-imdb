Watching Josh Kornbluth 'acting' in this movie reminds me of my TV production class, where the 'not funny' had the chance to prove just how bland they really were! <br /> <br /> OBVIOUS is the word that comes to mind when I try to synopsis this comedy wannabe. Jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. Delivery is painfully poor. OUCH !!!!!!! Writing is simply dorkish. It's similar to a Bob Saget show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as watching a Saturday Night Live session of an hour and a half (post Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and I want my money back !!!
