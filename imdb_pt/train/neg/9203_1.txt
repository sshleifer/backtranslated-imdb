Many people like to point to this TV movie when they argue with Hanks-philes' vast legions that Tom actually made low-quality movies (I think "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on a "Dungeons and Dragons" game that eventually takes our young Gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is charmingly in the early 1980s, focusing on the imminent threat to our youth represented by these bad RPG games. <br /> <br /> I, however, prefer to see "Labyrinths and Monsters" as the turning point in "Whatever Happened to Chris Makepeace?" story. we all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and as the unfortunate Clifford in "My Bodyguard," where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by defeating Matt Dillon. Few could argue (especially those of us who read "Dynamite!" Regularly) that great things were reserved for him. <br /> <br /> And then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad acting and poor writing is very thin, so I leave it up to you to decide who the performance fault of Makepeace is. All I know is that the last big release I saw him was "Vamp", and it was 1986. He had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and the Snowman", but at the time the Brat Pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashy curricula. <br /> <br /> I can not in good conscience recommend this movie. Watch if only to see a younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace, before Rona Jaffe feasts on his soul.
