This is one of those movies that makes you think: Hulk "The True American" Hogan did the same? Frankly I do not think so and he would be right. I'm Italian, I can not be proud of my country for many reasons, but I would not have rowed for another team (the French, for example), simply because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition to the protagonist does not fall in love with a British girl at the end of the film, but with a fellow countrywoman, so why row against Yale. With regard to acting, well, all players act very badly. And then, you know, I hated the atmosphere of the "Society of Dead Poets." Actually, this is another movie that I hate.
