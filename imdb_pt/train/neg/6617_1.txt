It truly shows that hype is not everything. It shows that a low quality actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his father and his wife. Amitabh as always is solid. Ajay Devgan as always is shit and useless and the new guy is a joke. The protagonist is a great waste of actor. A pathetic film of such a revered director and such a large industry. With movies like these, I've cut down on the amount of Bollywood movies I watch. <br /> <br /> RGV has been making very bad movies for a while now. Time to get different actors. Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back. All other major ladies are semi-naked and want to be. Pfffft.
