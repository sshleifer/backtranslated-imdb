This small, solid horror film is, in fact, one of Renny Harlin's best. The story is quite routine, but the atmosphere is what really makes it come to life; in fact, the ghost story is almost a belated reflection. The real horror comes from the prison itself, and Renny H. spares no details in showing us how bad the old hell hole is (with a sadistic director too!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role backed by some very authentic-looking prisoners (there are no handsome boys in this cast.) Terror fans should check this out.
