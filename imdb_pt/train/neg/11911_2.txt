I sat glued to the canvas, riveted, yawning, still keeping a watchful eye. I waited for the next terrible special effect, or the next item in the ridiculously clichéd plot to show full strength, so I could learn how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that when they set out to do this movie, the team watched all the other action / science-fiction / shoot-em-up / well versus evil movies already made, and saw cool things and said, "Hey, we can do this." For example, the only car parked within a mile on what appears to be a one-way street with a non-parking shoulder is the only car in which the protagonist, an attractive brunette born from bile, is thrown. The car explodes into pieces before it even lands on it. The special effects were obviously my biggest beef with this movie. But what really put in my bad books was the implausibility and lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict bizarre damage, encounters a lone army truck carrying an important VIP. Unnamed security kids with guns get out of the truck, you know they're already dead. Then the guy protecting the VIP says, "Under no circumstances do you get out of this truck, do you understand me?" He goes out to find the beast that killed his 3 friends, he is struck in an almost comically cliché way. So, for no apparent reason, challenging logic, convention and common sense, the idiot sucker VIP IS GOING OUT OF THE TRUCK !!! Much of what happened throughout the movie made no sense. Transparent acting distanced me from the film, as well as the camera's poor work, and things that only make you go: "Wow, this is unbelievably extravagant." Shiri Appleby saved the film from a 1 because she gave the film the only element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeal.
