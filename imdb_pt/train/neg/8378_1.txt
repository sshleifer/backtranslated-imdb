This movie is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! The plot is ridiculous and all the crap of "Little Man" is so stupid. The whole movie is unreal and idiotic. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". This is just an awful nonsense piece that should never have hit theaters. The jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous. Please, I ask you to save your money than to see this useless piece of crap. I had to bear sitting through Little Man for an hour and a half wanting my eyes to bleed. I'm disgusted that something like that would even be thought of! Who writes this crap? The actors do not have talent, how do these people enter Hollywood? They're making money on this crap!
