I'm trying to decide whether jumping on a wooden chopper would be nicer than this dreck. It ends the destruction of what was once a classic couple of movies. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith, we have the death of Lucas' career. Does he want us to swallow Annakin is Vader's absurdity? I never believed it was true. This movie confirms these feelings. The story has not worked since Phantom Moron, and each new movie just piled up the crap until all that was left was a toy parade. I have to go. I know where some new stones are to shoot. Do you want spoilers? Here they come. Luke and Leia are not related. Vader is not their father. Duke Countoo should have changed sides while he still could. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. Your advice has never been good to anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke in the first two films. Annakin did not build the C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother about putting him from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. All this mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be attributed to this stupid Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had any brains, she would not have reached a light year for Annie, but she had told him to do what George Lucas wrote her. What the hell!
