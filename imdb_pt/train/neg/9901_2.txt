That really should have been a star, but there were so many, cliches, predictable twists, seen all before parallels in the slasher flick that I really gave an extra star in the fact that it made me laugh ... though that was never Eu I do not usually write reviews about movies, they have to be sensational or, in this case, very bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey, I knew it was going to be bad as he has a unique nose to pick the worst movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the farce of everything made me watch it all way, possibly to the hilarious voice of MR T, (do not retransmit Mr. T, but you know what I mean if you bother to watch this), if you watch it, make sure you do not pay to see it. This may have worked if they had put the intended comedy, but I'm sure you'll find a strange chuckle here and there in the farce of everything ...
