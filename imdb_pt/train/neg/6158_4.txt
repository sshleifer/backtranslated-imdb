Once upon a time, in the mid 90's, I used to write to the fanzines DOCTOR WHO and all the fandom was breathing on the new DOCTOR WHO TVM produced in the USA. As soon as it was announced that the Doctor's arch-nemesis, the Master, would be played by Eric Roberts, everyone scratched his head and exclaimed, "Who is Eric Roberts?" I must point out that this was before IMDB came online when all you had to do was enter a name on this site for your resume, but a helpful soul wrote in a publication I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite F Murray Abraham, the film was called BY THE SWORD and went on a fencing school. In fact, looking back now, Roberts is best known for THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN, but that did not stop the person from putting his boot on Roberts and BY THE SWORD and his mind was invented that this American master with his Southern accent was going to a disaster. Strangely, most fans were furious about Roberts playing the Master, but after they saw DOCTOR WHO TVM, many fans (myself among them) thought that Roberts' acting was the best thing about disappointing American production. <br /> Yes, I'm rambling, but BY THE SWORD was a movie that I wanted to see simply because it was the first time I'd heard the name Eric Roberts but I did not get a chance to see it through to the end and I was quite disappointed with this. I do not know anything about fencing. (Everyone else on this page seems compelled to mention whether or not they surround themselves.) I do not know, so I do not know how accurate all this is, but as mentioned the film seems somewhat anachronistic even you saw in its 1991 release, the hairstyles seem a few years outdated along with their mixed teen cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it would have worked much better had it been produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid-'80s. You could argue that it would mean that the relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard was off center for most of the film but I was not convinced about their love / hate relationship and Abraham and Roberts gave much better performances before and after BY THE SWORD
