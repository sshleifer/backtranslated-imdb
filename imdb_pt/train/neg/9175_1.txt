This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie combines the quality of movies like "THEY" and "Cabin Fever", but even those who had actors' names where it fell short. The "eye drop" from this movie appeared to be a 50-year-old woman with a bad face lift. (just an example of quality). I would have rated this film in the negative if possible. Ladies, I have to tell you that men were not bad to look at, but not too bad. If you were planning on going see this movie, I strongly recommend saving your money.
