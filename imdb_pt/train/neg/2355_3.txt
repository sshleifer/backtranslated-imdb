I almost always went against including songs in a movie. He believed that the quality of the film would be automatically improved if only those extremely annoying songs were eliminated. However, things changed quickly after watching that horrible Black (without songs) and this movie, (many songs). While Black has been weak to the extreme, he delivers an exciting story with strong acting and good direction. The songs were almost incidental and mixed almost perfectly with the film. Certainly there were no women being sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious springs of water as they whirled wildly on the streets at night. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the bold and daring approach used by the director. . There was no concealment of anything and almost every scene was completely believable. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to Hindi-speaking people with at least a little understanding of Mumbai life. The first one because English subtitling was under par and contained many errors that sometimes completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. The latter because you will definitely appreciate the accuracy of the representation once you have lived by yourself. <br /> <br /> I would definitely rate this as a job worthy of international recognition. The scenes with the gossipy pilots were a nice touch and served simultaneously as a source of genuine humor as well as another perspective across the mishmash. The film is insufficient in some places where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that undermine the overall direction of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought that some of the saddest scenes were not done very well. It was a fun touch to watch, instead of arousing feelings of sadness and the whole scene tends to look a little silly. However, these are minor issues, because the film, on the whole, is truly a rare treat to see. Overall, it's a cynical and pessimistic and refreshing prospect. Actors, not 'heroes' - that's the key. A chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting - everyday life. A behind-the-scenes look at the extent of depravity and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> 8/10.
