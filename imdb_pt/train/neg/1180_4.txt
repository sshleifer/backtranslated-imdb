Notorious for more than a quarter of a century (and often banished), obscurity was his greatest asset, it seems. Hey, it's often better to be talked about, rather than actually being seen when you can not support the "legend" with substance. <br /> <br /> The movie played in Los Angeles a few times recently, and is available in home video, so the veil is being lifted slowly. Although there is still much to offend the masses, it is more likely to annoy them than to arouse much real passion. Except for a free and prolonged XXX sex scene between a pair of horses ("Nature Documentary" anyone?), It's almost an hour after an arranged wedding melodrama. <br /> <br /> As soon as sex and nudity begin, it's an endless sequence involving masturbation, a looooooooong flashback to an alleged encounter of 'the beautiful and the beast' and a naked woman running through the mansion (no one, nor her supposedly protective Aunt, it seems to think of putting some clothes on her!). In the video, I think you can move quickly with banality, but it's not worth the effort. Nudity does not go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive, like Bertolucci's THE DREAMERS. <br /> <br /> No matter how much you try to find some 'morality' or 'symbolism' in carnality, I doubt it is. worthy of anyone's effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can more easily see the movie, the notoriety of something that was "banned" has been suspended. And this beast was tamed.
