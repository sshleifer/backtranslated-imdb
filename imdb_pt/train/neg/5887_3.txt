Jane Russell proved to be a musical comedy artist in the title "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"? but unfortunately, this movie wastes those skills. There is a budget and a good picture of Paris, but the film simply does not work. Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. This leaves no one to properly interpret Jane Russell. Some of the other players are out of their element. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing scenes; Above all, be warned: there is a musical number where African cannibals "cooks" can "cook" the brunettes in a pan, after Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting, sometimes embarrassing. , wasted resources. *** Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
