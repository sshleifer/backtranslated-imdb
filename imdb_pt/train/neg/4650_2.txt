With a cast of British character actors and pleasing British photographs from the 1950s, I expected and hoped to be more entertained with this film. Unfortunately I found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - I could not believe how awful it was. I must have seen thousands of old movies and am always ready to make concessions for them to be the products of their time, but this was really difficult. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, one big problem is that you do not seem to know what you want to be: a soft romantic comedy, a comedy or a musical. I was a bit shocked when Jeannie Carson suddenly started singing in 15 minutes! It is not credible on any level, either the story itself or the fact that Daisy never seems to have a hint of threat in her at any moment. Other aspects that defied credibility included Donald Sinden's cast as composer (a songwriter for God's sake!), The fact that he had Diana Dors for a bride and did not seem to care for her (I mean, Diana Dors! Come on!) And a ridiculous scene in the office of a music publisher. The whole thing is silly in the worst possible way. <br /> <br /> If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be the same at the beginning with the wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after that all went wrong in a great way.
