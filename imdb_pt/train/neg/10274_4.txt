In Texas, seven friends meet at a bar to celebrate Halloween night before going to a party. Meanwhile, they call the Pirate Nightmare American radio for fun and confess their most intimate fears. A serial killer, who is listening to his confessions, makes his nightmares come true, killing each of them in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a bizarre low budget movie that has a horrible start: without any prior explanation, a woman kills two couples in a secluded camp area, as if it were Friday, the 13th. a bar where seven friends are celebrating Halloween. From this moment on, the story has a great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, also showing beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of production of C. However, the end of the script does not provide any explanation for the instinct to kill and motives for the behavior of nurse Jane Toppan, giving the feeling that the budget ended before the completion of the shooting. With a better start and conclusion, this weird story would be a good low budget movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agony" ("Agony")
