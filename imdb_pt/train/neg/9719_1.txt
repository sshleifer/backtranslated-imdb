Ummm, please forgive me, but were not more than half the characters missing? In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a piece of bread and then trying several times to escape. He interrupts probation and is pursued relentlessly by police inspector Javert. Along the way, there are MANY characters that were not in this version. Some worth mentioning would be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the film, trying to see how he was somehow connected to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
