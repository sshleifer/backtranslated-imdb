An update of the sketches and jokes you would have seen on a Burlesque stage in the first half of the twentieth century. It is a sequence of several jokes expressed. Some of them you could tell your grandmother, some of them not, but it is a pretty safe bet she has heard them all before. For what you try to be, it's not so bad. Before renting it, remember that it is an old style of entertainment and has more value as a story than as comedy or excitement. Robin Williams has a few bits, but he is interchangeable with the other players.
