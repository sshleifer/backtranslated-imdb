When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was being broadcast in the United States, I was thrilled. So I had the misfortune to watch the damn thing. I love M. C. Beaton's books about the wonderful Scottish policeman. The characters in the book are fun and very well written. The powers that are responsible for this miscellany apparently never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the series. In addition to the lack of familiar characters, I find the show all offensively loud. It seems that the actors feel that they should shout their lines and shout at each other. If you love the lovely Hamish Macbeth of M. C. Beaton, do not waste your time with this crap.
