You must ask yourself how some flics were never made ... this one decided to skip with why, among many other things, and simply wave beyond the limit. <br /> <br /> And yet you have a good number of decent actors doing their best to bring the story to life. The blue tint throughout the film goes "once again", which in itself would be depressing, but here is an exaggeration. The idea that it is not a medical condition, not a house curse or gypsy or trinket, but only something that for no apparent reason begins to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone around him, ends up being a lot like taking a big sip of an empty mug. Some doppelgangers have superpowers, but others do not know or do not know? It seems they are as unsuspecting as we are. <br /> <br /> It is a robbery of "trespassers" with the "Mirror" of Keifer Sutherland and "The Sixth Sense." you seriously screw up the three together.
