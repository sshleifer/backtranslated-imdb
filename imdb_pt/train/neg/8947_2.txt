The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason why this film could not have adopted a futuristic technological vision of the book. Inferno, total recall was released a few years later and it did a good job, even an orange watch released in the 70's did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world. The gloomy German Expressionist colors, the black and white images of the viewing canvases, there is no reason for this approach when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white-collar writing job but gets dressed as he works with oil. and grease in a garage. This film decides to adopt a mock-communistic approach to set design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel does not necessarily dictate a communist, worshiper-humble-worker theme per se. This book needs to be seriously adapted in a modern context, as this book is more relevant today than ever before. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of prediction is annoying, this movie seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or credibility when it is exactly what is needed to hammer the messages of the novel to the viewer.
