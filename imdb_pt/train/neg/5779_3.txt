I saw this movie a few days ago ... what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are funny and fun. When I saw a name of this title and genre I thought great, this could be really good ... some parody for slashers or other bloody movies ... but .. so I read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway ... but it was not ... <br /> <br /> My opinion: if they are documentary-like movies, with some comedy try some Moore movies or Alien autopsies, they are really about something. it was empty. <br /> <br /> and put a comedy to the title ... no comments ... very bad joke
