Okay ... I watch a lot of bad movies. I'm proud of that. there are often a few gems in the B-rated bombs. But this movie is one of the worst I've seen. I like a good horror movie ... but with a plot and sense of movement. The opening scenes looked very good. Decent music and pictures. Then down the hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (Ringing in the Ears called Tinnitus). Now that, in turn, will threaten to reveal his secret. They made it so much of the film's focus. So what he is playing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where he should not be. There is no need to keep mentioning. So this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and bangs her head on the final table. So, instead of letting everyone know of your case, he decides to leave the body. Now her twin sister is trying to figure out where she is and what happened to her. Well, after seeing her sister several times (as a zombie as a ghost) and even pointing directly to the location of the body, she finally finds her. Now the body is recovered and she is willing to deal with the only suspect who killed her. Bad thing is she does not have much of a plan. Just to pretend to be his twin brother and meet the guy where the body was dumped. The idiot did not even believe he killed her. Then everything is revealed there and even if she had a gun ... somehow she can strangle herself. So the last scenes of the movie are from her and her twin's spirits coming out of the water. So you want to tell me in this movie that the bad guy wins. And not one, but two innocent people die. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie: images <br /> <br /> Bad things about the movie: music long and drawn sound effects bad direction of the low grade acting plot of some not all actors
