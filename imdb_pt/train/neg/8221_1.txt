This "movie" tries to follow the genre of low-budget camera movies that have proven to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This, fails, and HOW. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many so-called "prizes" this piece of crap was stamped on the cover ..... makes you wonder what those critics were when they actually presented this .... < Words can not describe how absolutely shocking this movie really is. Seriously, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I watched in 20 minutes, in almost continuous advance. <br /> <br /> From garbage illumination to terrible direction, visuals grainy to muffled sound, and of course not forgetting ABYSMAL's performance, this was a complete and pathetic piece of so-called cinema. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it DOES NOT have redeeming qualities - whatever. Save your money and watch a decent low budget horror film, there are many out there - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, to name just a few. <br /> <br /> AVOID this rubbish at all costs. DO NOT waste your money or time on this piece of junk pretending to be a real movie. <br /> <br /> Beware of all other comments! You have been warned!
