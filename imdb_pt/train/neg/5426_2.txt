`In the tradition of 'Carrie' and 'Heathers'? Try 'a shameless imitation not only of these two films, but' The Evil Dead 'and' The Shining 'as well. That being said, they really do not do horror movies like this anymore, and that's a shame, because it's a gas. Rainbow Harvest is Winona's replacement here, and although she barely does more than that, she murmurs her lines (and occasionally screams, 'YOU ARE UGLY !!!' in her haunted mirror), she is Gothic before it's fashionable, then you have to respect it. (And she's also quite creative about it, accessories with black leather handkerchiefs and a sort of Hawaiian-Hat-Punch-painted black-spray.) Eat your heart, Cher.) <br /> <br /> Karen Black overactates one little, but she is not totally without dignity, and you can not help sympathizing with her. (Unless you are a certain friend of mine, who asked, "Who is this, Horse Lips of 'MASH'?", The first time she appeared on the screen). <br /> <br /> Kristin Dattilo (as the square girl who befriends Rainbow), Ricky Paull Goldin (in his trademark hunk role) and William `Larry, Darryl and Darryl 'Sanderson (as some kind of pet funeral, or something like that). But it's sad to see that the once smokin 'Yvonne DeCarlo has narrowed down to touching what can only be thought of as part of Charlotte Rae. <br /> <br /> The '80s were the pinnacle of hilarious and incredibly stupid horror films like this, and' Mirror, Mirror 'was one of the last of its kind. Definitely worth a look.
