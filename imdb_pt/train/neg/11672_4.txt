Three writers have made a valiant attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock's novel to the movies, but this television movie ends up being injected with a lot of melodrama and just does not know when to stop. The struggling artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds herself employed by the enigmatic and enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. After learning about the last meeting there - the farewell party of Ellen's daughter - Tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreaming that the daughter died mysteriously even before the ceremony began, even if she and the deceased were one with the other. ! Two excellent actresses lend their services to an incredible strand that does not have a scrutiny that does not match either of them in emotional intensity. Burstyn's role sways in the camp, while Tilly gets caught doing the routine with dreamy eyes. Only one sequence at the end of the film (the morning after the mural ends) is loaded with honest feeling, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.
