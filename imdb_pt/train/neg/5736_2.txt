This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years !! You could randomly pull 5 people out of the streets and they could act better than anyone in this movie. Absolute loss of time watching. I only gave a 2 as I like bloody movies, but this is just crap. The acting (and I use that term VERY loosely) is awful, does anyone, please tell me that the top 5 actors were making their first movie? Do not waste your time watching this. Hostel was a better movie somehow. I can not believe that someone spent money doing it, I hope for the good of the producers it only cost $ 50,000 to make - it looks like a school project, done by children who have no idea. Did it really hit the movies?
