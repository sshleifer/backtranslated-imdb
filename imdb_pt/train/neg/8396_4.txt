... but I've also seen better. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable - a film crew trying to film a horror film in a place where murders occurred. Three guess what happens. This is not a total bomb - the cast is pretty good with pros John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine giving the best performances. It's reasonably well done - for a low budget movie. Just do not expect any nudity, swearing, blood or blood (the film has a very light PG rating). I was never totally bored - it's OK to see on a quiet night. I saw it on video - it was HORRIBLE - very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. Still, I did not hate it and it has a nice ending that surprised me - basically nothing happens until then, which catches you unawares. Worth seeing, but only if you are a fuller horror movie.
