The genre of volleyball is strangely ignored by most writers. Fortunately, acclaimed director Nelson McCormick brought us the second best volleyball film ever (rated below Side Out and higher than, well, umm). However, do not let the cover of this movie fool you. Kill Shot starred and came to star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes. Using these high-tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji is able to help FBI agents in tracking down a man who has committed no obvious crime. Although there are other actors in the film, including brief special appearances by Denise Richards, a gay black man and an absurdly ugly and annoying girl, Koji carries this film alone. Any fan of movies like The Matrix or Hackers will love Kill Shot.
