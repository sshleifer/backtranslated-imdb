The title of worst movie of all time is one that is distributed quickly and often. Most of the time, it's an exaggeration, but I'd like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from the Outer Space, Battlefield Earth, and the Adventures of Pluto Nash. <br /> <br /> As I watched the 90 minute I found it difficult to even stay awake even while I was trying so hard to laugh at the movie. But I felt alone in the dark (I was going to try to avoid the pun, but I could not resist) as I looked around expecting to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Oh my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about action and effects, as this should be the only positive part of the movie. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens (they also call Xenos), and the creatures in Pitch Black. The can become invisible at random (and I assure you it's random) and hurt me with the light. Also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that turn them into something like a zombie. All of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and impossible to follow. People shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set on monsters that were inserted in the post. The light flashes quickly on a dark screen, causing your pupils to burn from overwork, while rock music plays in the background. <br /> <br /> And those were the high points. The story revolves around a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea of ​​looking tough is wearing a black T-shirt with a trench coat and not shaving for 2 days. An archeologist (Reid) who is quite inept. And a government agent (Dorff) whose lines involve barking order. All three should be ashamed of their performances (not that they really have done a good job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the movie, I think. The film contains the strangest love scene I've ever seen in the movie between the two. <br /> <br /> Then comes the plot. Quietly, the parts that make sense are not interesting. The rest is illogical at best. The plot holes may contain the collective egos of all three stars. The film begins with a text and a voice explaining the background story. This opening lasts more than a minute and already the viewer knows that they are in something terrible. This opening narration is later repeated in the clumsy dialogue in a very clumsy and heavy way for the rest of the film. And the ending did not make an ounce of sense. Not only did it not make sense in the movie world, it just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally the direction of a Uwe Boll. Disgrace, that's all that can be said. Its use to shake the camera to simulate suspense. His lack of direction with the actors. Just watch Reid in scenes where she's not the central focus of the scene. The complete waste of money from special effects for the purpose of bullet time. And finally, choosing to use the voice to explain something that should be painfully obvious to viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to see this show in a second running theater. And while the laughter my friends and I made every quarter, I advised people to avoid paying more for this movie. Take about 3 friends and split the cost of the rent and rip this movie a new one. <br /> <br /> What a shame on you Uwe Boll. Shame on you, Tara Reid. Shame on you, Christian Slater. Shame on you, Stephen Dorff. Shame on anyone who was associated with this movie.
