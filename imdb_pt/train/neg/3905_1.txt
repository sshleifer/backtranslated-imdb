Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate fiasco, a fantasy drama, directed, script, rendered inept, etc. This movie is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-best novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, strive to overcome such a terrible script. Lots of mistakes (such as since when it rains at Christmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of this so-called "magic realism", it stands out as the worst movie ever. It totally sucks !!!
