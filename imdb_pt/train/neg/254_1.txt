Oh, bait. How do I hate you? Let me tell you the ways. 1. You try to be funny, but you are tacky and carefree; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it does, it does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to vomit. 2. You try to be dramatic, but it's unbelievable; the woman excels to a terrible degree, and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates, and it's just as scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate someone with a gun.) It does not work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watch him try to deliver a dramatic dialogue and sincere is ridiculous and makes me want to vomit. 3. You try to be filled with action, but instead get bored and dragging many times. And when the action warms up, the camera tripod must have been lost, as the scenes wobble more than those of The Blair Witch Project, and I get nauseous and once again want to vomit. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I'd rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a package full of dry, water-free beef, sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep as company. This hell would be more lovable than a minute more, watching everyone in the Bait make their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates to a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the bomb that blew up in a car that the character Jamie Foxx just left OFF CLIFF, but somehow managed to escape ... just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that's so bad, never.
