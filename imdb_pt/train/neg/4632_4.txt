Maria Bello does not seem to care what people think of her choices in film roles. Again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star. Maybe she needs these movies, to get the sugar (aka "Hollywood") she does here and there (Coyote Ugly and, of course, Mummy 3). /> <br /> Although I do not think I get what I set out to do (I'm not going to ruin it), Maria Bello is as good as her other independent / small films that she plays. movie. That combined with the strange subject almost did the trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to ignore some flaws, such as bad rhythm and dramaturgy), the movie is still very long
