Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate his troublesome expansion / expansion machine to the Smithsonian Institution as he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) prepare for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall ). Wayne's brother, Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and their children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteer to take care of Adam while their parents are away but luckily title would take you to wait), the adults are accidentally zapped by Wayne's shrinking ray. As children run loose, their miniaturized need to fight monstrously huge insects, wrinkles on the rug that look like canyons and other threats to them. That was bad, as most video sequences are, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves was kind of laughable. I had to laugh at the "cheap" movie Stuart Pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous, see at your own risk!
