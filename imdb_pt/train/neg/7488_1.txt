Anyone who has seen the original 1970 film knows how a great cast, script and director can put together a comedy masterpiece. Likewise, it's easy to see how the opposite of it can create another insipid Hollywood whim! This movie was pathetic! If it were not for John Cleese (a comic book genius), I would have gone out for about 15 minutes of that terrible waste of celluloid. Neil Simon would not write another screenplay for this version (he said he could not improve on the first one), and I'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he would not sue for defamation of humor! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a wonderful job in the original, where the producers were thinking when they released this? How did the director and editor get to see these scenes and think that some of them were funny? I do not know, but one thing I know - not surprising because foreign and independent films are becoming more and more popular .......
