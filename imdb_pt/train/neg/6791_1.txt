This is a movie about animal cruelty. Under the guise of a marathon, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death IN SLOW CAMERA. The guy who did this then has his conscience cleansed spiritually by the burial / fire flames of the horse, which is obviously still dead, having been tortured to death. This is one of the most unsafe movies I've ever had the dislike to watch. Like Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line in their DYING animals, we must admire their spirit to finish the race. I'd like to put the producers and the director into a marathon; I'll decide when they're done, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
