This movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because Jean-Claud Vam Damme starred in this movie. There are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is so bad and it is the worst performance I have ever seen and the two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can not act in ALL. And this movie has to be by far one of the Jean-Claud Vam Dammes worst movies he did and if u see him watching one of his great movies you should watch Blood sport, KickBoxer or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> Throughout this movie sucks / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
