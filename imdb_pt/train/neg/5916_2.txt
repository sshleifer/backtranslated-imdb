The excruciating slow pace of this film was probably the director's stated intention in order to convey what life was like as a village teenager in China. However, I found the combination of the glacially slow "plot" and the overall style of filming so impersonal that it became totally alienating, particularly to a Western audience. Sometimes I actually had a hard time separating some characters, since they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours and I was totally in the past. As someone who is not only interested in music, but also very attached to the history and culture of China (and not strange to Chinese cinema), I could not get involved with a single character and found nothing to put my teeth. That raises the question: if I did not like it, who on earth would I like? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of just about any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This discouragement effort simply does not measure anything. I would be sad to see Chinese cinema judged against this benchmark.
