When you go to an open-air cinema under the Greek summer night, you usually do not care what the movie is! Edison started very well with a good effort from the singers-who-want-to-be and once again the great Morgan Freeman, but ... (In a movie there is usually a good start to catching audience, done, a bit boring but the movie plot in the middle which is more about characters and less about action, done, and the third part is something really good so you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite cops (full of weapons you can demolish a building) shoot a guy behind a car, do not hit him not once while he kills all (but 3) and then the guy picks up a flamethrower (to kill the rest 3), you realize that the Greek summer sky full of stars is too good to be distracted by a movie like this!
