My God, this movie is very annoying. I'm a big fan of Gina Gershon, when I rented this movie, I expected a romantic drama and a great performance from Gershon. Gershon is great as always, but she's not the right actress for this role, she's too good for Rade Serbedzija. The romance between the characters of Gershon and Serbedzija is very unconvincing. And I absolutely hated Serbedzija's character (a victorious organizer), he's not charming anyway in the movie. How is Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) beyond my comprehension? Maybe Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would have done a better job in that role, but they do not have the European look, I guess. Anyway, I was so bored to shoot the movie. If you're looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, check out Bound, her best movie so far. If you're looking for a romantic movie about a younger woman and an older man, try some Harrison Ford or Sean Connery movies. Gina Gershon is so underestimated, and she deserves a better chance than that, I wish she'd make a better choice in the future.
