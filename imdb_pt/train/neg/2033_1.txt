If I could give less than 1 I would. Do not bother renting; If someone gives you the DVD, burn it. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. A total waste of digital "film." I've seen better on YouTube made by 12 year old boys. Lommel claims to have written this, if that is the case, he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The plot is non-existent, the dialogue is mostly glaring, the camera work is a kind of artistic flirtation attempt with senseless cuts of totally independent jumps for scenes of industrial transport or some kind of strange splitting of young woman. <br /> <I usually can follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a "creative" movie - I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This here is so beyond my limited powers of understanding that I have missed it or it is totally useless. I think this is a "let's see if we can get a title that will leave soon and make a strange feud over it and see if we can get some of the dollars" work. <br /> <br /> I do not see why Lionsgate did not even bother about it. Totally useless, it's so bad I will not rent any other by the same director.
