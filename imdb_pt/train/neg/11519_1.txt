This is absolutely the dumbest movie I have ever seen. What a waste of a splendid cast. That's James Cromwell as the ignorant playing vice. I could go on and on, but obviously I'd be spending more time on this review than anyone else I've ever done in the script. The only thing this movie is about us against them and how to revel in profane clowning beyond the tolerance of any reasonable human being. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
