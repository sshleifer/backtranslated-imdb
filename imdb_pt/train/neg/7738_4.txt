The movie was "OK". Not bad, not good, just OK. If there was anything else in the theater that would have been skipped away. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 also stunk, but I'd rather see this than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk, this will be a "fluffy" movie for you. Personally, I would wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
