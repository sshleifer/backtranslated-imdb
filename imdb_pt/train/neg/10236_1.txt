Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before a legion of film puritans gag with their lattes, let me elaborate. As much as I like it, this is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it's certainly the worst movie I've ever seen in the movies (an impressive statement, as I remember seeing the Daredevil on the big screen). The two leaderships (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were not convincing, at best, and absolutely worse, at worst. Of course, they were not helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a single by Daphne & Celeste and a characterization as compelling as OJ's defense. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was tenuous or non-existent and the 'blood' scenes, while undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and ridiculously stereotyped. The plot that exists revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral, psychological and physical tortures. The torture scenes seem disconnected, and the emphasis was placed directly on shock rather than scare the audience. Although there really are very, very few positive points to be drawn from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a horrible movie. I've never heard a more vocal audience in a movie theater. In twenty minutes, the whole cinema was in spots and remained so everywhere. For my part, I came out blushing with laughter, propelled by a film that had risen to the apex of terrifying cinematography. Whichever way you look, this is really a cinematographic achievement and a plan for future aspiring directors detailing how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Q. I failed to mention that I got into the movie for free ... so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back ... it was really that bad.
