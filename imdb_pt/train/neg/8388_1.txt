There comes this comforting tale of hope. I hope you never have to endure something so horrible again. * cough * Prize Razzie * cough * I did not like this movie because it was bland, predictable and futile. While watching, I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how movie standards could come before people complained. When I asked for my money back at the end of the movie, I was informed that because I watched the whole thing 'I was not entitled to a refund'. I was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and obtained refunds already though. <br /> <br /> The summary of the film is pretty basic. The dwarven thief steals a diamond and poses like a baby to deceive the police. Under this intelligent scheme, however, is a repertoire of originals, fresh and hilarious. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people being hit by pots? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see dwarfs posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired jokes? Do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goa gaa gaa'? You drool? <br /> <br /> If you answered "yes" to any of the above, then this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been advertised in some places as "The worst movie of the decade", there is probably a movie or two that are worse ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave this film 2 stars because we all know that a one-star critique would indicate a bias on the part of the critic and then the criticism would not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This lowbrow comedy is aimed at a less intelligent audience and I can not, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something funny. <br /> <br /> Respect
