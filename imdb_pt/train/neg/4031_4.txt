It really is a terrible fraud of a movie. Its 70 minute run time is very well filled with archive images. The rest are non descriptive exteriors and monotonous interior scenes. Plot exposure is poorly rendered. All of them are only superficial scenes, linked together. There is no attempt of drama in the selection of scenes, but rather the drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors. Please do not ask. The plot relates to a rocket that radiates a million degrees of temperature orbiting the Earth five miles above threatening to destroy Earth. It is a real-time threat that must be diverted if a custom-built hydrogen bomb can be modeled and placed on an experimental rocket within one hour. Nothing much to report except for a crazy speech by a scientist against the project, because there might be some kind of life on board and think of scientific possibilities, but this speech made by the liberal compulsive idiot was practically outdated by then. /> <br /> What saves this film, in a somewhat unique way, is filming. I've never seen a larger selection of jet fighters from the fifties in any other movie. This is by no means a complete list, but only a few of the aircraft I could see. There is a brief interception by a flying pilot, in alternate shots, an F-89 Scorpion and an F-86. The first to intercept the interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker Hunters and the F-86 Saber Jets (or Canadian built CF-13s) and even a pair of Clunks CF-100. <br /> <br /> So, for some reason, it's B-52s, B-47s and even B36s are seen taking off. More padding. <br /> <br /> "These Canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles per hour." I do not think so since one of them seems to be a Meteor Gloster of the WW2 era, the rest of the F-80s. The Meteors press the attack and one becomes a late F-84F with an F-84s flight in direct attack in formation. <br /> <br /> There is a strange version of the F-80 that does not work in the cockpit. t seems to be the type of T-33 training, but some kind of inter-atmospheric interceptor variant with nose radar. These are mixed in a snowstorm. <br /> <br /> An angle-shaped aircraft carrier is seen about 500 meters. He launches the F-8U Crusaders, the F-11F Tigers, the A-5 Rangers and the A-3 Skywarriors. The Air Force shuffles the F-86s and F-84s and more F-89s you've seen in your life, as well as the F-100 Super Sabers and the F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F-100s press their attack with too much filler. The F-89 unload their rockets on their wingtip pods in slo mo. The F-86 ignites, an F-102 releases a Falcon, even some F-80s (F-94s?) With loose-winged rocket launchers. There is a very strange shot of a late model F-84 (prototype?) With an F-85 model early on, obviously a manufacturer's advertising film (Republic Aviation) showing the differences between the old and the new improved F models -84 ThunderJet. How this got in here is any guess. There are other great filming from Ottawa in the old days when the capital of Canada was a sprawling spot on the road and especially wonderful footage from New York City's Times. Square during one of the Civil Defense Fights in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think we also have to deal with the idea that this was filmed in Canada, with the possible exception of automatic chase seen at the end of image, since the Pacific seems to be in the background. The use of a Jupiter Jupiter is somewhat disconcerting and there is a good TR 3 to be seen as well. Canada must have been cheap and it's pretty free, heavily used in the background. <br /> <br /> As for the actual narrative of the film, there is little to recommend it beyond the mystery of just who Ellen Parker is. giving the finger to the end of the image. And she's definitely taking someone else. Could it be, R as in Robert Loggia? The director who dies before this movie was released? Was your career like this your last credit? <br /> <br /> It's like the newspaper that the gift came wrapped up was more valuable than the present.
