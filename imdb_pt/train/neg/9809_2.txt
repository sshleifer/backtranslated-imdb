Some wonder why there were no more Murphy films after this movie. It's because this movie spoiled everything. Disney was not the right studio to run this movie. Maybe Touchstone (well, they are owned by Disney, but would be more adult). The film is very childlike, as the series of books is not. The cast is wrong for the characters. The characters do not even act like books. And why did Tucker change into a guy? He's a girl in the damn books! Was this done to make the film attractive to boys? Sheesh And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is missing from this mess. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney ruin her job was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps at the forefront of Don Bluth's work, would combine with a better film by Mrs. Murphy. Overall, I give a 2, because at least Disney made a movie from a series of books underestimated. But I wish they would do better. Anyway, I still have my books to keep me entertained.
