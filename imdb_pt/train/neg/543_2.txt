Well, one can not waste time just because of a large cast of stars ... I think all I could see is a lot of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor that will appeal to I do not know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by whom? some pathetically abrupt turns justified by whom? race against time? Do you mean waste versus time? Okay, so first you spoil your son, then you teach him a lesson, we're so ignorant of that fact, who said it's a shiny new concept, it's probably some other species besides humans, okay, let me just comment on how human, the movie has a good message to be given but could very well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you on the bus instead of you go to such a wasteful movie to learn Hindi movies have already proven this much and so have I I can not waste my time writing about waste anyway!
