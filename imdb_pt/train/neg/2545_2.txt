There's laughter in this movie, for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he used to be funny (before deciding that he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me a lot in this movie is how unpleasant practically all the characters are. Besides the two main clues, everyone is an idiot. I mean, these losers from small towns are as rude as you can. You just watch and think, man, these losers must be unemployed. In addition, the American worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful goofy. It made me wonder if this movie was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh sure, in the end they all come together as one, but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there.
