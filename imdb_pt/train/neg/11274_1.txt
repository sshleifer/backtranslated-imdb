Just so you movie fans understand the movie, I decided to write another review. I missed some things last time ... <br /> <br /> First, the script. Second, the performance. Third, Jesus Christ, what they were thinking of making a piece of garbage like this and then expect us to enjoy it when there is no redeeming feature from beginning to end, except when Joseph Fiennes is finally caught up in a very uninteresting climax! !! I can not believe I lost my money on this when I could have given to a homeless person or a busker or something! <br /> <br /> Are you getting the picture?
