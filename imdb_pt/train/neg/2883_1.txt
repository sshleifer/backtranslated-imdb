This movie is so awful. So bad that I can not afford to spend anything but a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crimes is properly re-enacted. Many images of the slaughterhouse. Weird cuts and issues. There is no continuity in the plot. The acting is absolutely the most amateurish I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This one-shot bomb was obviously made to earn some money without any consideration for the accuracy of its content. Camera work is out of focus at times and always unstable. It looks like it was shot on video. <br /> <br /> In fact, now that they have Dennis Rader with life in prison, I'd like them to put the guys who made this horrible movie into prison too <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not even think about watching to this. I would give a negative star if I could.
