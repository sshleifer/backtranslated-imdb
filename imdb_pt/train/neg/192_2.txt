The only good part about this movie is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have withdrawn from the pulpit at the time when his son Paul deviated from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can your boys name the Lord in vain in this movie being of Presbyterian origin? It does not fit. I wished Paul were swept by the river without a boat in the beginning to save us from Paul's (Brad Pitt) stupid and selfish selfish story. Then Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler Norm wants to rescue, but does not. It's very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites being championed by Paul because of his native American girl. This was the only part that had any interest and perhaps could have been developed in a true 'western'. What we see is only a sleepy city where the two sons of ministers have nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a limping girlfriend and deal with his family and 2.Paul make up stupid stories in the newspaper store while scratching his head and take lots of gingar and tie many flies. I'd rather watch a show about catching that movie again - it never will.
