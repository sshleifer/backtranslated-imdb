I still can not see all this; it's running out now, and I seem to keep coming in the middle of it. My main reason for being interested is that I am a fan of Bill Paxton; He is a good actor, and has consistently proved to be good work throughout his career. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that although I'm never a fan of the old series, I kind of liked the Thunderbirds for the first time. ships and work of effect. Derek Meddings was possibly the best in the industry during the sixties and seventies, and his designs for International Rescue Craft are wonderful. The current staff did a great job translating their work onto the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is a lame story. Children are invited to drive, and while they do a good job, it's hard to suspend their disbelief, especially when you have the eight-year-old son of Brains flying in T2, a huge transport of several tons with all the aerodynamics of a car. Buick Wherever you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is far above the top here and is irritating. Ben Kingsley does a good job as The Hood, but he can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the movie for its very small merits, Thunderbirds is a fun and fun ride. Just do not look too closely at the machinery that drives you. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I've finally been able to see all of this, and it's worse than I thought. The acting is reasonably uniform and, although the effects are reasonably good, the story in several views has become more tacky. Exaggerating product placement for Ford is irritating, and children, as central characters, irritate my remaining nerves. As with the Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it is bearable. But not much. Watch the original show, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course in the Guild of Directors. You can do better than that, old friend. <br /> <br /> Another footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. In the Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish with comedic sound effects. And yeah, I kind of came in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I did not think it was possible that an already bad movie was worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> If this had been done directly, without children to the rescue, without funny jokes, it could have worked. As it is, it's just another joy of childhood loved that was ruined.
