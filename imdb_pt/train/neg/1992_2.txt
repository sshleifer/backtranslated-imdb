Do not let the name of this movie deceive you. In fact Jake Speed, the character is possibly the most lazy action hero that already knows to film. When Jake Speed ​​is not saving virgins girls from crazy villains, which he is not often, he is seriously relaxing. Maybe that adds to his charm, but in my opinion, an action hero should not "relax" whenever he gets the chance. Also, unlike other daring heroes who often have an impressive roster of talents, this man has none, unless, of course, you call him a sleeping talent. Anyway, this film is basically useless, writing is insignificant and action, when there is any, is very weak. (The machine guns in the Jeep were not bad, but that's about it.) So if you're in the mood to watch a movie that's a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - There's a hero who not only puts himself to sleep, but also his audience.
