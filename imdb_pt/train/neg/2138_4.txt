War, Inc. - Corporations take on the war in the future and use a lone killer, Brand Hauser (John Cusack), to do their job with rival CEOs. A dark comedy that satirizes the military and corporations. It was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on. I kept waiting for things to make sense. There is no reason or method for madness. <br /> <br /> He is considered by Cusack as the "spiritual successor" of Grosse Point Blank. That is, war is more or less a knock-off. Again we see Cusack as a killer who protects * the * spoiler * the person he should kill while he grabs his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack seems a bit reliant on taking half a dozen guys with relative ease. Brief fights look good. The rest of the film does not. It's all quirky, often bordering on bizarre. War Inc is not funny enough to be a parody, and very exciting for anyone to think about any message in the movie, which I assume are the inhumane ways corporations, like warring factions, compete and plan without a drop of consideration. how they affect ordinary citizens. Interesting, but satire simply does not work because it's not funny and, deep down, the movie has no heart. We should give a damn about how war affects the carcass of a Cusack character rather than millions of lives destroyed by war. <br /> John Cusack gives a decent performance. Your character kicks spicy sauce shots and drives the smaller private plane, but the quirks are meant to replace character traits. Marisa Tomei is a romantic journalism companion. There is not much chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and does not play dumb. Joan Cusack just screams and moans and wig. Blech. Ben Kingsley may have to return the Oscar if he does not start performing a decent performance once in a while. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> It's not a terrible movie, but in the end you need to ask "War, what's the use?" Absolutely nothing. W-
