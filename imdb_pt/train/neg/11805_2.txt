Watch the original with the same title from 1944! This made for the TV movie, it's just awful! Although I use (as far as I know) almost the same dialog, it just does not work! Is it the acting, the bad direction? OK, so it's made for TV, but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original? Especially because you will be spoiled by the plot and will not appreciate the original as much as if you had watched it first! <br /> <br /> There are some things that are different from the original (it's smaller for once) but all are for the worse! The actors playing the parts here just do not fit the bill! You simply do not believe them and who could surpass Edward G. Robinsons' performance of the original? If you want, just watch after seeing the original and even then you will be very brave if you watch! It's almost sacrilege!
