I just did not get this movie ... Was it a musical? no ... but there were choreographed songs and dances ... <br /> <br /> It was a serious drama ... no acting was not good enough for that. <br /> <br /> It is Whoopi Goldberg a serious actor of quality. Definitely not. <br /> <br /> I had trouble staying awake through this disjointed movie. The message about apartheid and the "homage" to students who died during a student's performance is noted. But as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary-style film was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but in justice I hated
