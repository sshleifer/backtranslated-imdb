I bought this DVD from a friend, who got it from someone else (and that's probably still going on). Even the DVD cover looks cheap, just like the whole movie. Shots and fights with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple plot, made me laugh - even my stomach ache! With few financial resources, I must admit that it seemed very professional. Seen like a movie, it was one of 13 in a dozen gangsta movies that no one expects. So, if you're tired and want a cheap laugh, watch this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
