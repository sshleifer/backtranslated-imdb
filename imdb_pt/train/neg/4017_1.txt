Yes, this movie gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult movie genre. Still, I did not like it at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene best suited to a horror movie, she has the opportunity to briefly return to Earth to live the life of lust she has never done before in her mundane life. Bad sex scenes to follow. Why are they bad for one they strive so hard to be artistic that they draw from the actual sexual act. I mean, we watch porn for not sex. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it's still very erotic and cool to look at. Of course the girls are cute. Here we have an unattractive lead actress and that does not help matters. If you think the lead in your adult movie is unpleasant, there is not a lot of artistic insight that makes me appreciate the movie. The sex scenes vary from odd to bizarre ... I mean, there's a snake in one of them. So for me, this movie fails because it does not excite me, but it discourages me.
