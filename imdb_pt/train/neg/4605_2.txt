This movie is written by Charlie Higson, who previously did the "legendary" Fast Show and his own show based on one of the characters from Fast Show (Tony, the car salesman). He also wrote James Bond books for children. <br /> <br /> In fact, I've seen only Gordon's films based on Lovecraft's stories before, and they're all wonderful. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is totally "contemporary", which means shaky camera, fast and strange cut, chillout music in the background. It works great here, I guess, but it's still useless and cheap. It makes me think often of the cameraman who is shaking his camcorder in front of the actors and trying to make elegant movements in the photographs (in the hope that something tolerable arises from this). The cast is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is the result of a good direction. I think the main character, the young "zero", is quite interesting in his "zeroness". The fat guy is good too. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but it's not him. But just after the beginning, the film ends up being something not so interesting: in this case, I mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and disease. There is not much humanity in this movie / story: it's totally pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dies. Needless to say there is no humor too. It's a long vomit of 1'40 without relief in no time. Anyway, Gordon remains one of the most interesting filmmakers who are active today, and I think of this film as an experiment, and as a flaw in that. Everyone has to experience getting lost at times just to learn and find their way again. This may be Gordon's most uninteresting and empty job.
