I usually do not feel much encouragement to comment on movies that I do not like, but in a case like this, I have to say something. This movie is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many flaws in the narrative that I do not even feel compelled to elaborate because it's time for me to get out of this experience. The most annoying point, however, is that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for Bacon's character madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition. <br /> <br /> Granted the special effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven did some good things (Robocop's cut on the DVD is great). However, this film is stupid and usually does not come close to explaining the technical point or aspect of the subject, and instead resolves predictable action without any pleasure. <br /> <br /> In short, like many other reviews here say (I wanted to have read before ...) - Stay away from that movie!
