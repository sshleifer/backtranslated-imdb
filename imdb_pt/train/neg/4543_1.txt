I read the book and the book was fascinating. <br /> <br /> This film, the direction, the script and the acting were totally unbearable. I cringed at the lack of a script that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity and courage to illustrate the temerity of a great story based on facts. <br /> <br /> I can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities. I would never recommend this movie to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> Simply, one of the worst adaptations I've seen has turned into a less exploration plot of heaven on earth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was indeed the only highlight. But, how could this fail when filmed in a beautiful country like Peru? <br /> <br /> For potential spectators, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.
