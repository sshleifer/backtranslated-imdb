The idea behind this movie was good. Too bad it was not written well. Launching Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea and he did a great job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. The character of Kirstie Alley might have been great, and even showed a few possibilities once, but the writer really let us down, making her role primarily a helpless woman. This was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be. I do not care for Alley's acting anyway. The movie should have finished about fifteen minutes before what happened. The director ordered the cow to dry before the unbelievable final action. I'll keep this in my collection just as an example of Poitier's performances.
