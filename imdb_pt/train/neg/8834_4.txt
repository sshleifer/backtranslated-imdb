there was some truth in this film. I remember a story told 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fishermen who found a body in the water and decided not to report it until the trip was over. I also remember that they were accused of interfering with a corpse (or some other charge). Not sure if it was in Australia. Viewers outside of Australia should think that we live in a country full of rapists and serial killers. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception. The movie itself reminded me of a Simple Plan. But far from being one of the best Australian films of all time, as someone put it, I can not be that generous. Put it this way, I would not mind watching it again.
