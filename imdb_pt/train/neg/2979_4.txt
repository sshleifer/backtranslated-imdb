"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most overrated movies in history. It is a movie beloved by mothers, grandparents and people who go to the movies every five years. Like a zombie movie, it blows. There is no corpse in sight, and it is terribly light in the blood department. "Zombie 3," on the other hand, is big on stumbling corpses and quite generous with its bloodshed - so it's better than "Gone With the Wind." Nor is it overrated. Most reviewers have no illusions that it is junk. It is, however, not boring rubbish. After a terrorist steals a virus, he knocks him down while being chased by a helicopter, and the chemicals leak to the ground. The terrorist, who was exposed to the nasty mix, hides in a hotel room where he slowly turns into a zombie meat eater. One of her first victims is a cleaning lady. Once she's bitten, Lucius Fulci's kind of hell loosens up. As usual for a Fulci movie, the acting is atrocious, the plot is full of plot holes, and the blood is plentiful. It turns out that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, which explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is poorly recorded, poorly edited and sound design is flat. Still, he is saved by his joyous allegiance to the cruellest of murders and his impatient rhythm. Definitely worth catching if you're a complete undead. Or do not like "Gone With The Wind", arguably the worst zombie movie ever.
