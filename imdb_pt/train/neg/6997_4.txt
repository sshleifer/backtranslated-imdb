I watched this with a growing sense of discomfort. Why would God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help these people in their attempt to escape Devil's Island? And what was he doing there in the first place? I mean, I know God works in mysterious ways, but to help thieves, murderers and prostitutes find redemption, forgiveness, and heart changes in a place so forgotten by God ... Anyway, it's hardly a nice movie. Whatever Gable had for charm is missing in this picture of a completely selfish man, Crawford is as captivating as he ever was, that is to me, not at all, and the whole look of the film makes it look like it was made. Compared to contemporary films like "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," this seems prehistoric.
