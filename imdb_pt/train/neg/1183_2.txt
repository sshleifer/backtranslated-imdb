This and Immoral Tales, both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are tales of warning about what will happen if you have sex. Like a movie, it's not very well done - some of the performances are really bad (like the "American" woman with the French accent). Her sudden failure to be anxious about marriage for being interested (when it seems she should have been otherwise), and her sudden perception of the young man's secret makes no sense. is not explained at all. I also did not like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of the perversion or predilection of the family for bestiality. The central idea that there is this "sensual beast", if you like, that lives in the woods, could have been the basis of a perverse but fun story but, on the contrary, is used only as the basis for a nasty and sexist story. negative, morality game.
