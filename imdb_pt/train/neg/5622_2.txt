OK, besides the psychedelic background image, the information presented here was good. The music that I could have done without (not that it was bad music, except that it did not fit into that movie). <br /> <br /> As for the content of the film, the director talks about it frequently. - without the pagan perspective of the existence of Christ and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of Christ's life versus the lives of mythological figures / divinities like Mithra and Dionysus. So he brings up the chronology of the origins of Christianity and presents an 'ok' case, but not one that surprised me. <br /> <br /> If the director had stayed with the facts and continued with them, this movie has been good. However, at this point in the film, he disintegrates into a group of personally gratifying attacks on Mel Gibson's "Passion of the Christ," and a private Christian school that the director frequented in his youth. During an interview with his former director (who during the course comes to the fore that the director set up under false pretenses), I felt that the director was acting childish. He was asking good questions, but like the movie itself, the interview disintegrated into an attack on the private school rules in particular, not Christianity. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are interested in some information, watch the first 30 minutes or so and then turn it off.
