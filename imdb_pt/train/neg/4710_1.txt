My brother is in love with this show, let's see if I get it. I completely agree with the people who said they were copying from Dexter's and the Fathers' Lab. <br /> <br /> I've never liked quite strange parents, I mean, some things made me laugh, but most of the time it's just annoying and not cute. That's almost the same as I feel about Johnny Test. Except, NOTHING makes me laugh at this show. The jokes are so stupid and meaningless, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but kids do not DRESS like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is amazing, but c'mon! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Lab, which used to be one of my favorite shows and I still do not mind watching it. Which makes me disgusted and embarrassed by Johnny Test to have made an absolute joke of that wonderful show! <br /> <br /> One more thing. O. Dog. Yes. Like this. Irritating. He's taller and nasty than Johnny! And the gay accent? What the fuck! I hate the dog to death and I hope he dies because it would be better for the kids than to listen and watch the nasty crap that happens in that show and get a gay accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want your eyes to burn in miraculous flames and your fried brain from this program, do not watch!
