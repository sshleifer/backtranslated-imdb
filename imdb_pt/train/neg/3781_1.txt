(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Dreamworks was thinking when it decided to spend $ 80 million with this extremely tired and lame animated film. They probably thought that the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring the audience (mainly families) to see it en masse. Well, it seemed to work for the opening weekend, made $ 26K, roughly and made $ 38,1K. total (an estimate for this weekend). But I think the audience that came over the weekend saw pretty much the same thing I did when I saw it and they spread the word. This is a mostly lame film, in addition to the animation everything else, especially the script seems to be done by a three year old child. <br /> <br /> The movie is only about 80 minutes. long, but it looks like a three-hour epic. Some points to me are, well, the annoying narration is one of them, and it's so obviously written. At one point he escapes from some captors and even if you can see that the horse is obviously scared, the narrator (the voice of the talented Matt Damon) appears to clear up any misconceptions (which would only happen in the simplest of mentalities). Another is the constant appearance of Bryan Adams's songs, now I'm a fan of his music, I think he's good, but by chance Dreamworks really thinks the audience would be able to handle 8- 9 of her songs over such a short film, I certainly could not. Finally and here is a spoiler, a horse is shot at point blank by a member of the ordeal, not least, she (the horse) falls into a mighty river, Spirit (the focus of the film) tries to save it, but the two pass over a waterfall that must have at least a 50-foot drop, much later in the film near the end, we see that this Horse is alive and well. I know this is a kid's movie, but even that little realism is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a vie, I'm not saying kids will not like this, but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end. Definitely in my top 10 worst list this year. - ** of 4 stars. <br /> <br />
