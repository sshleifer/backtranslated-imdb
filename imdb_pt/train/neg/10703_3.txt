but Thomas Ian Griffith simply does not have the polish that a big buck has, since that was done 5 years ago. Some of the funny lines could have been programmed to do this not just action but comedy. And how do you take KC out of Katia Koslovska anyway? Plummer's character was so tacky, he would have fit better into a Bullwinkle sketch. Personally, if the action movies will show the skin - I wish I had seen the same time between the female / male sex, otherwise I will not show any.
