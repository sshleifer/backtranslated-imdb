There is an interesting discussion in this film. Being a moral person is good enough, or do you need something else? <br /> <br /> The film preaches that, without God's guidance, being a morally good person is not enough. There's a line at the beginning of the movie: "You and I can look at a person who is morally good but both know he's going to hell." <br /> <br /> Though I'm not a Christian, the discussions about it throughout the film were fascinating, but not in the way the film intended. I left the film with a stronger feeling that being morally good * is * enough. The arguments and arguments presented were strongly biased, so much so that they crumble in the weight of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be powerful, especially when inferred in the minds of the ignorant and ignorant. As George Carlin's character in Dogma said, "Engage them while they're young." <br /> <br /> The basic premise is also very interesting. A Bible scholar of the 1890s is trying to publish a book that says godless morality is OK as long as morality is meaningful. Do you just tell a kid not to steal? Or do you tell him not to steal because God tells you not to do it? (not bothering to say that the child does not steal because, well, how would it feel if their marbles were stolen?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle, wants his school's recommendation to be Help sell the book (to spread the world). However, it needs unanimous consent and one of the scholars opposes this. He raises in a very interesting discussion at the beginning of the film about morality because of morality versus the argument of God's words. To prove his point, he produces a time machine (put in the movie just to make the plot work, which I'm fine), and sends Carlisle to the year 2002 to see where to teach morality without God will take us. As it should be obvious, he has his opinion, and is changed by what he sees, and has reversed in the time of his return (for he returns, this is not really a spoiler, this is a bible <br /> <br /> Something that was not necessary in this film is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to try to find out who is Carlisle, even if he has not hurt anyone, committed a crime or anything else. What's wrong with the film showing only Carlisle's opinion, showing his vision of this "sinful world" and returning it with a new point of view? <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some points in the film that claim that I am happy not to be a Christian, or at least to someone who says "it's God or nothing." Three near the end of the film, instead disturbed me .. first, when the two "thugs" corner Carlisle before he jumps, Carlisle does his * only * really act sneaky .. he pretends as his time leap is the coming of Jesus, and makes the "bad guys" (who are also Christians, oddly enough) think they missed the rapture. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after Carlisle returns, he meets a boy he rebuked at the beginning of the movie about not stealing (but did not mention God, the boy kept the marbles and ran away), and says it's time to steal is wrong because God commands it. Like Carlin's quote above, scare the children into religion is a faux-pas in my book. <br /> <br /> And finally, the epilogue. Another tactic of fear. Carlisle asks the inventor how far in the future they could go, and he says he does not know ... the epilogue shows that he tries to distort the Bible in the distant future (begins in 2100), and it fails ... it continues to decrease the years by 10, and trying again, and by fade-out, it's like 2030 or more. Throughout the film, Carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming, because the world was full of sins and the loss of the name of God. Tactics of fear have been used for thousands of years. the church would have illuminated as well. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie. While I was quite right before being morally good was enough, now I know that. It is worth noting if you are not a Christian, to state how happy you are by not being as ignorant as the people in this movie.
