Wow. I do not think I've ever seen a movie with so many great actors who have played such an important role. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the only worst actor to get a big role in a movie with the star power and money behind him that Edison had. <br /> <br /> His performance was painful to watch. The story was good and all the other characters were played by professional actors, even LL Cool J was fine, since he had several small pieces to cut his teeth. As the director and film company figured Timberlake was ready for this role, there's no way to understand. <br /> <br /> Your character spoils the whole experience, since every time he's onscreen, you're rooting for corrupt cops. to cover his sad ass, and he should be the hero ... I would not waste money on it in the theater or in the video. Maybe if you have HBO and you have nothing else to do at 2 in the morning on a Saturday night and you're drunk and stoned, this might be OK. <br /> <br /> Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Caco Frog' act in Hollywood Blockbuster, it just did not work.
