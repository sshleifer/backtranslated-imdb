This esteemed production has its fans. But, to paraphrase the classic negative critique of "Mary Reilly," Moby Dick is like a painting, but more slowly. <br /> <br /> That's because the philosophical foundations of a cinematic "production" are never to make a great movie. instead, it is to replace the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case, from the transfer of books to films) with a list of irretrievably atomized, non-dynamic but dazzling concepts in an effort to deceive viewers into thinking that they they saw the greatness. As viewers and critics are apt to fall for this, the Oscar follows, fueling the whole stupid equation. <br /> <br /> I do not share the pleasure that all these reviewers found. Moby Dick is surprisingly non-engaging. Actors dutifully recite rehearsals about Jonah, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick ... all the things they can not answer, and none of them are absorbing at all. It's dramatically inert. It does not build. In narrative terms, Moby Dick (as a film) is little more than a hasty conclusion in pursuit of a true story. After half an hour I was grumbling "Oh great ... another oath ... another soliloquy of 4 minutes!" <br /> <br /> In the failed effort to wrap it up, it is a very exaggerated showcase. Plenty of gray hair here. Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!) <br /> <br /> It is known that one is looking for a great director when he makes his own instead of trying to reproduce the feel of someone else's paintings and palettes, or reverently embalm a classic like Huston is here. Paintings and books are good, but they are different media. A movie like this can not understand that a really nice piece of trash (Village of the Damned) is better in most respects than a piece of unbearable culture. This is the school of film production Eat Your Vegetables. <br /> <br /> We appreciate the work that must have been done to make the film, but not the narrative. Only a few segments that reflect maritime research are interesting; the registration of favelas as a means of structuring work and various maritime efforts; and whaling technology. And that does not require a movie of more than two hours.
