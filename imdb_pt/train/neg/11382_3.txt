Someone realizes that Tommy only has 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Furious eyes look he gives to all enemies. 2. Possession of hands to face, mouth open and eyes startled. 3. The smiling Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I practically hate this show, I do not watch, but it's like Code Lyoko, we all watch at least one, I must say that this show is extremely racist, uninteresting and without sense. <br /> <br /> Each episode ends with the robotboy except for one exception when robotboy basically lets this freakazoid overly nerd fly in a jetpack. <br /> <br /> The jokes are very rudimentary too, I think it's more people saying the word "suck" or farting, I think the show bullies are very shocking too. <br /> <br /> There is not one who hides a bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, for God's sake, what kind of school he goes. Not to mention his older brother, who is a marginal psychopath and has no other qualities of character. <br /> <br /> The show I feel is stealing the mega XLR and Fosters. As if you could say that the trio of cooper, Jamie and Kiva, just like Robotboy, is similar to Megas, where he beats everyone, no matter the odds and he is free despite being a robot. <br /> <br /> Simply no appeal to this show, I'm surprised that it's still running.
