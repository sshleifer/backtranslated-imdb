The previous poster obviously worked on the film. It's such a bad joke and no one would review this kind of movie the way it did. Mentioning all the names of the actors and what they were before is a clear sign that he is involved with it in some way. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> It's in Cinemax now and I was pretty sure it was a movie where porn stars (the one I called Ava are beautiful and well endowed) were forced to do something else for some crazy taxing reason. <br /> Moreover, when I first saw it, I was sure it was done in 1986, and I was born in 1973, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no. .. it was made in 1993 !! Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Though I call it one of these, it's a good movie. Like watching a train accident.
