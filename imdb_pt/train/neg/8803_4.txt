I loved "Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and hoped it was so funny, but unfortunately it was not. Some bits are great though. I thought the sportsman, Champ Kind, professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious. Everyone is ignoring him and he gets louder and finally kisses Burgundy, which is also not recognized. But overall, history does not gel. It is a noble attempt, however, to save the unused bits of the first movie, including an entire plot about some supposed benign domestic terrorists called "The Alarm Clock". Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines, but basically this unused plot has good reasons not to be used in the first movie. The extras on this record are very good, with the two best being the rehearsals filmed with a lot of improvisation comedy, and the false commentary with Will Ferrell and an "executive producer" that Ferrell discovers from an early age was not even a part of the movie in any way , form or form. Turns out he's "just a guy," who stepped into the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. It's a very funny thing and it goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes
