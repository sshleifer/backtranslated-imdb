This movie explodes - let's get this straightened out now. There are some gems inside that pile of crap, but no one can rescue the meek plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and acts in a similar way. I usually hate Colin because he's a fairy in general, but he's fine in this movie. There were two plot lines in this movie - one about a child throwing stones through windshields of moving vehicles and one over a woman with a mustache. Let's face it, this movie has no idea what he wanted to say or where he wanted to go. The stories of the characters intersect on some levels, but are not worthy of being included in a script. The whole thing is weak and meaningless and so there is an occasional OK scene. But in general - do not worry unless you enjoy Irish so much that you can watch mediocrity and be rescued by everyone who sounds like the elf of Lucky Charms - an American fetish that catapulted some really bad movies to success.
