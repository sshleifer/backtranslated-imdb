Two sisters, his perverted brother and his cousin have problems with the car. They then happen over the house of Dr. Hackenstein, who conveniently needs the body parts of three young nubile women to use in an experiment to bring his deceased lover back to life. He says he will help them get home in the morning, so they spend the night. Then the good doctor starts working on this low-budget horror comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this kind of funny, absolutely nothing to get out of your way (I came across this Netflix instant view & streamed to xbox 360), but better than I expected it to be for a movie purchased by Troma. Most of the humor does not work, but it's still some of the parts that made me smile. In addition, the late, great Anne Ramsey has a small part and she has always been a treat to watch. <br /> <br /> Candy Eye: Bambi Darro & Sylvia Lee Baker went topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
