Can I have my $ 13.00 back? I'd rather see "Hydraulic power comes to North America." Again. This is a movie with a voice. The same voice, which comes out of all mouth characters, regardless of age or sex. To hear that voice again I would have to charge at least $ 150 per hour. And I do not make insurance. It was scary watching Will Ferrell turn into Woody. But I do not think imaginative casting is enough. One should wait until they have a story before they bother to make a movie. Unless he's just doing it for the money. And if that's the case, why not just reissue an All-Rap version of "What's up Tiger Lily?"
