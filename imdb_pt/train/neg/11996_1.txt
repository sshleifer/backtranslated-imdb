I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is at it, she's a great actress. <br /> <br /> This movie contains six stories. It's a new concept that came from Hollywood. So it's not a new item. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to be famous and invents a boyfriend to let reporters take an interest in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and he claims to be her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is not yet a good actress. When she screams, I get angry. Salman Khan can not play comic roles. But in its serious parts it is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He enters a middle-aged crisis and is attracted to a much younger woman, forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil kapoor en Juhi are natural actors / actresses. They are great. But this story is fine for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) is going to marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he gets scared and ends the marriage. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She suffers an accident and suffers a loss of memory. Now she no longer knows she loves her husband. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz), who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian man, but he is about to marry an Indian woman. Raju has to bring Staphani to that man, but falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> I've never liked Govinda's movies. He's very annoying, not funny. But in this movie I really liked it, as it has grown in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! There's Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal, who is married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to do something serious with her, but every time her family is in the middle. <br /> Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor, but he's funny! I like your movies. <br /> <br /> Now here's the problem. All these stories are not interesting. To make a story from six uninteresting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there the stories touch, but are not meaningful to the characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka can not act! Drop this woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more movies, this role for him was very small. Salman Khan can not act in comics, but in serious movies. This is written in his life as an actor. This film sucks, and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It's like you have the ability to make a movie with Amitabh. Bachchan, and you just let him sing a lullaby.
