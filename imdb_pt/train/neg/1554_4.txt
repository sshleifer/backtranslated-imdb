Cannon achieved a true visual beauty of a medieval epic that seems fascinating (except for Dragon Prop). Now, how did the old studio known for the Chuck Norris movies come to have a complete lack of knowledge in the first place? Case in point: amateur acting and the horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is not a cure for a lousy execution. They really went on and made another cheap explorer with hundreds of vigorous bimbos, just to make it look even better. For the two "Barbarian Brethren," they certainly know how to make strange noises than to become brave warriors so bold and bold enough to save their homeland. This is the biggest waste of potential I've ever seen in a "expensive" low-budget movie, and worse enough to let an ax go through the beautiful copy without mercy. All this followed an ad campaign that sold T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS! The movie just makes a great memory!
