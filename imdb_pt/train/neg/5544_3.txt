Although this film certainly has the stench of a bad movie, it is surprisingly watchable on several levels. First, for fans of old movies, it's interesting to see the lead role played by Dean Jagger (unrelated to Mick). While Jagger later came to play a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even winning the Oscar in this category for 12 hours HIGH), his performance here is truly unique, since he really has a full head of hair (I've never seen him this way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the movie. This film just shows that if an actor can not act on his previous films, does not mean that he can not possibly learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. A second reason to watch the movie is cheese cheesy. all. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an anonymous Cambodian are crossing the water, it is obvious that they are actually walking in place and the bottom is badly projected behind them. Also, once they get out of the water, their costumes are 100% DRY !!! Horrible continuity and insanely bad dialogue abounds throughout the film - so much so that it's hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the film - since they both starred in many z-horror movies. In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> So while giving a 3 is probably a bit generous, it's fun to laugh and short, so it's worth looking for bad movie buffs.
