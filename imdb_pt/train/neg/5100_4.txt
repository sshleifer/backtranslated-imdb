This anime series starts very well: interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Not everything is explained immediately, swinging a proverbial carrot in front of the viewer, drawing the viewer to watch each successive episode. But imagine the disappointment of discovering that the adventure of the science fiction / giant robot thriller is only a backdrop for the exploration of psychotic and quasi-religious poetry. If you want to hear, "You're fine. It's good to be you." after being confronted with negative slogans and negative emotions of the characters, then this is for you. If you want a good science fiction movie that is simply fun to watch, forget that one. Both the original and the alternate endings were very disappointing to me. All this, And this movie was very preacher.
