Okay, let's get right to the point. We have five newly graduates (must have graduated from the word F) by going out on a weekend camp. They find someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to put him on fire. Nice group of people. Then some of them start getting sick - there must be something in the water in the hut they are staying in. However, the neighbors seem to be fine. Oh, well, when things start to get really bad, they arrest one of your comrades instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). Some residents do not like them. They chase one at a high speed through the forest for many miles, until the truck breaks. Somehow, ten minutes later, he appears in the hut (how he can find it and how he can travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another type of neurosurgeon in the hut realizes that something is wrong, so he hides in a cave to let it go. He then decides the next day to go back to the cabin believing it must be some kind of sanctuary. He is dizzy with relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24-hour bug). Unfortuneatley he is known by some not-so-friendly cops. Another couple decides to have sex while the carnivorous animal is doing its magic, and then the women realize that she needs to shave her legs (taking too much of the skin off with shaving cream). Anyway, you got the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I would not want to be friends with. I was rooting for the bacteria that ate meat. Other characters were introduced, which were also a little fun but also totally unpleasant. Ninety minutes of good life wasted here.
