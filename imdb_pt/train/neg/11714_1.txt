The US seems to be in charge of the UK police, all of whom are armed to the teeth and you know that ICD officers change uniforms when they stop working and go down the pub! This has to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst picture of the "real" UK police that has been foisted on the unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr. Snipes may have needed the money to pay his late tax bill, but what the hell a good actor like Charles Dance was doing in it is a mystery. <br /> <br /> Worse than the worst low budget "B" movie of the 50s. An hour and a half of suicide and time I will never go back. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the real plague.
