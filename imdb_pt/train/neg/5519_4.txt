Okay, so the previews for this movie just tell you that a rebellious young woman is going to live with her grandmother in the summer to dress up. This is not really the case! It's about a 17 year old rebellious girl who reveals a secret and it's up to her mother to believe if she's telling the truth or not. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really liked the concept of this movie. They had a very good plot and a very good theme of a love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. I did not like it, however, I enjoyed watching the performance of Lindsay Lohan. In fact, this movie would have been great if they had someone else, maybe a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a sexually aggressive person and kind of reminds us of the real Lindsay, so she takes a lot out of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think, though, that if you put Lindsay aside, you'll like this movie. The ending is very good (and sad).
