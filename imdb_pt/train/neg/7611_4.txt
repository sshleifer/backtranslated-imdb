1 Dated 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version I watched titled "3 Days of the Condor" - So the CIA drama filled with laid-back performances for a very laid back movie. The premise of the story revolves around 7 of 8 members of a CIA research group being killed with the character of Robert Redford, codename = Condor, being the one left behind. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford tries to figure out by trying not to be the 8th victim at the same time. Along the way, it involves the character of Faye Dunaway involved, originally because he needs a place to hide, and then she eventually helps him after a loving time. This is one of a handful of innocent guys in the racing stories, but this one does not have much suspense. The flat performances do not help and the finish also does not close the agreement for the public. Despite having a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classical artists, history and performances are not what they should be and therefore the film is not what it should be.
