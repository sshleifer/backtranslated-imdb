Mary Pickford becomes the head of a Scottish clan after the death of her father and then has a romance. As the commentator Snow Leopard said, the film is rather episodic to begin with. Some of them are fun, like Pickford taking his clan members to church, while some of them are there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the plot of recycled and planned romance and its climax. The transfer is so somber that it is difficult to appreciate the landscape, but even so, this does not seem to be the best work of director Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur once again collaborated on the most accessible "The Little Poor Little Kid", playing Pickford as a childish character.
