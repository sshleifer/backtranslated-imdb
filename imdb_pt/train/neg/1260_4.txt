Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nickname that the romantic character of Donna Reeds played for Tom Drake. So let's get this straightened out right away. From his first role in THE GET-AWAY (1941), also his last, DALLAS (1984-1985) Ms. Reed could NEVER be described as CHUNKY. Not this attractive and slim actress. Whose functions in M.G.M. rarely lived up to his talents. <br /> <br /> Ms. Reed is backed by a cast of competent character actors, who unfortunately must come across this so-called "screwball" comedy. Clearly M.G.M. was out of his depth doing this kind of movie. A better type produced in COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the 'touch' of Ernst Lubitsch nor the wit of Preston Sturges could save this film. A rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the marks of a pre-war effort (WWII). <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg were still alive, the screen would have gone through a meaningful rewriting or never seen the light of day. This fit the "safe zone" of Louis B. Mayer, of no challenging family entertainment. A form that could not withstand the post-war challenges of the DeHandilland Decision, the loss of its theatrical chains, television and would contribute to the decline of M.G.M. Fortunately for Donna Reed, her best days are ahead of her, culminating in HERE'S ETERNITY (1953) and her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.
