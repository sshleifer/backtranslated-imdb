Did this mean serious comedy or drama? This movie begins with a light play between three women. Well. He moves in a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Well. There are a few antics among them. Well. But when the plot thickens and finally turns black, I began to wonder if I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie. He continues in that sense for a while until, in the end, he tries to get back to the original light play. But now it's too late. It's hard to understand why these women were still talking to each other and the ending is not convincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make movies. Hard to see how the producers were convinced that this movie would work. And the box office proved to be a real flop, because I had never heard of this movie until this weekend (four years after the release).
