Anyone who gives this film a good review obviously must have something to do with its creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. The acting is hard, the generic soundtrack is laughable, the direction is soft and strange, the teacher is not so attractive (which makes the student's results even more awkward). The creative minds behind this garbage should disperse and spread out to avoid further demonstrations of such concentrated carnation. I'm sure some starving children in Africa could have used the money wasted on this project. Hell, the funds would also have seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack addict; at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it. For the only reason that did not give me a terminal illness, I'm going to give this movie a two.
