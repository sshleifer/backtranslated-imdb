I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time, and it was even more annoying than when I first watched it. I do not understand why it has become a cult classic when it's tediously tedious. The opening scene looks promising, as the fat nurse drops her blood can and runs to her beloved life. After that, all that really happens is that the man melts around some forests and houses, while he has flashbacks of his life as an astronaut. The makeup is very good, and its sticky melted face looks quite realistic. There is a cool scene in which he throws a man's head into a river, and floats until he reaches a waterfall where it falls into rocks and opens. There is not much to get wet, though, most scenes are filmed in the dark and you can not see what is going on. Not much blood, at least on the Vipco DVD I watched. <br /> <br /> No, The Incredible Melted Man is not so good. I'll give you notes for your cheese factor, but that's about it. If you want a true science fiction / horror classic, watch The Deadly Spawn!
