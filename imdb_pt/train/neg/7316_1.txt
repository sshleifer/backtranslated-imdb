When I saw the previews for this movie, I did not expect much to get started - around a second-rate teen horror movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely horrible. And that is being generous. <br /> <br /> First of all, the cast for the movie was terrible. You do not feel any sympathy (or even any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was just waiting and hoping the horrible thing would end. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are points in the film that had absolutely no relation to the plot. Can someone explain to me why the female-looking kid starts yelling "PANCAKES !!!" at the top of his lungs, while entering Jackie Chan moves that I've never seen before, and even more biting the guy who has the virus? Why does the boy's father start getting angry with the guy infected by the virus and goes in search of a country boy to find him? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and absolute disbelief that I literally said out loud: "Where the hell did that come from?" <br /> <br /> I just could not believe what I had seen. I actually thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever is on top of all of them. This movie made me want to vomit and then vomit again. So blow my brain. <br /> <br /> Please save an hour and a half and do something more productive. Watching the grass grow, perhaps, is a suitable alternative.
