"Darkness" was entertaining to some degree, but it never seemed to have a plot, missing one more than other movies that were accused of this injury; that is, "bad taste". It started very well, with a man running from something. It was very scary for these first few minutes, but after a while, the movie turned out to be fun on the blood level, which was difficult to understand at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway. The film was hard to believe because of the youthful acting, which most of the time looked like some friends talking to a camcorder, making the queues come closer. This, with the lack of any plot, made it appear that the movie was started without, and ended without, a script of any kind. As previously stated, gore was the only drawing point of the film, which was often difficult to understand.
