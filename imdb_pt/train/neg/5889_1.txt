First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are continuously improving. From the tedious emotional films of the '70s and' 80s, the films of this place began to contain a bit of humor. Imagine .. Real comedies have been made! The movies were starting to get fun and funny, as opposed to long, dark, depressing and boring. During the 90's and 00's, several really good films were made by a 'new generation' of filmmakers. Film after film were praised by critics and they played a lot of money. It has become the norm! <br /> <br /> Then United came ... <br /> <br /> * SMALL SPOILERS * It just is not funny. Not once. Never. But the thing is ... We think it's funny. Because we're used to Norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with a cast like this with some very funny comedians. But they do not say or do anything funny! Where's the humor? Show me the mood! Is the clumsy clerk played by Harald Eia? Is the exaggeration of the football coach totally ridiculously unrealistic? Are the comments of Arne Scheie? The movie is not funny! <br /> <br /> But that's not my main speech about United. That is predictability. (And this is where I fear that the Norwegian comedies have stalled since I've seen this in many other films as well.) All the time you know it's going to end well. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the movie, and everyone gets exactly what they deserve in the end. There is absolutely no room for surprises at all! <br /> <br /> All in all I can say that I sat down with a bad feeling after seeing this movie. It was the only film that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in Norwegian cinema ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
