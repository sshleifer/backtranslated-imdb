'Mojo' is a 50's story in London, a world of rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses a technique to film the 1950s, often seen in films that emphasize physical differences for our time, but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated way (due to the way the speech was represented in films made in that period); I have no idea if people really did talk like that out of the movies, but no movie made today and set in contemporary times uses such stylized language. It is as if the blistering discourse of the writers of the 1950s served as a common shortcut to a past that, as a consequence, seems a far country; and therefore emphasizes the particular, not the universal, in history. 'Mojo' features a strong performance from Ian Hart and the annoying Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a post-Trainerspotting career; but it looks like a period piece, a modern movie, incomprehensibly structured in an old-fashioned language. Quite boring, actually.
