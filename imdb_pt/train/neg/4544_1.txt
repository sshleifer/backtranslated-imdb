This movie is not worth your time. His reliance on New Age mysticism serves as his only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been recycled countless times. <br /> <br /> I was only asked to spend the time to put a comment when I noticed that some tried to sustain the reputation of it. Drivel. Your motivation and objectivity are dubious, since they encourage you not to look at the flaws of the cinema, but to your well-meaning message of New Age consciousness. Thus, it would be good for twenty thirty evangelical Christians? , or Islamic fundamentalists to pour positive reviews about movies / television that support their views? Despite the poor qualities of production, or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historical bases? I hope not. <br /> <br /> I'm sure followers will come after me to say flowery things about this movie despite the truth.
