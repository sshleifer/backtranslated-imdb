Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made. The whole plot is about someone trying to sabotage the superbowl and every attempt made to stop them. As the careers of Tom Selleck and Donna Mills have managed to survive, this is beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing about it was that there was no football at all! Avoid this if possible.
