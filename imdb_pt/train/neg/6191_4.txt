I watched this movie along with all the other adaptations I could put in my hands - including seeing pieces - in preparation for some academic research. Cinematography is very moving, as is music. Unfortunately, all life has been taken from history. I've never seen such a horrible portrait of Mr. Rochester. All his most fundamental traits are gone. Where's your wit? Where's his passion? Scott Rochester remembers the role of Rochester, St. John, as the character of the novel. In fact, the actor who plays St. John in this adaptation played a St. John of Passion while Scott is content to destroy things or just look at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they were thinking. I would like to give this film a slightly higher vote based on the wonderful music and cinematography, but I honestly can not stand seeing this movie for a long time because of the performance of George C. Scott.
