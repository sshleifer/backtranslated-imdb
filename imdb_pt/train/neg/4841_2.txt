REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I'm really amazed to see the glowing reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a great pathetic and grainy clich√©. I would have laughed out loud a lot, but I was on a date with an ex-military man. I could not hide my other answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my boyfriend, a "good old man" straight, liked. This is not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work ... Good for others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful provocation from Ralph. I vote at 2 only because Ralph looked so gorgeous. But I must beg, Ralph, how could you? It's because?? I'm going to watch The End of The Affair to heal and recover now.
