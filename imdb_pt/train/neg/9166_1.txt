Recherche is a good word to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's say every movie has a selling point, a trick. The trick of the Transformers are the awesome effects, as well as the nostalgia of the fans. Sleepless in the Seattle scheme is situational in its tag line, "What if someone you've never met, someone you've never met, someone you never knew was the only one to you?" Many novels rely heavily on these tricks and some attract big names. Leap Years employs both using Irish folklore as condition and presenting pretty famous names within the country. So now that the audience is in the cinema, beyond all the usual elements in characters, conflict or consequences, crisis, resolution and outcome, they also hope to stimulate dialogue, more absorbing situations as a result of leap years , interesting sub-plots, and perhaps to some extent a good twist in the middle or end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters. <br /> <br /> That's what Jean Yeo is trying not to achieve. If they tried, their goal was apparently on the other court, at the other stadium, on the other side of the planet. She and her writer, Alain Layrac, failed to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most lines were invented. It looks like they have a bag full of lines that she would like to use in her film: "Okay, these are the phrases and quotes I've heard or read in the movies I've seen or in the books I've read before and they all sound "If it sounds good to me, it will sound good to the public, so all I have to do is put them together, I'll use them all." The result is cathartic. I can not say that the lines were unnecessary and have nothing to do with the story or the plot, but they seem to come out of nowhere, catching him unawares with the quotations quoted. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who cite quotes based on most situations in our dialogue, trying to make them meaningful to themselves as they agree. I do not go out with them anymore because the desire to punch them is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Second, the characters portrayed are silly and one-dimensional. Aside from the unnatural dialogue implying their motivation (necessary to conduct the plot), there was no sense of conviction in them. I have no idea who they are. All are simple phrases from the advice column of a magazine aimed at women. <br /> <br /> The leap year trick is not enough to propel history, because the circumstances are too shallow. Then again, there are movies with less, but if they fared better than that, they are not there. They made my first and second point. In addition, the subplots are irrelevant (not that it's a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad thing). <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to get through the terrible plot with extravagant sites and passable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to gain the approval of some viewers than others with the good use of cinematography, soundtrack, and filming locations. These spectators without discernment. <br /> <br /> It's not even the kind of movie that's so bad it's good. This is bad. Do not watch this.
