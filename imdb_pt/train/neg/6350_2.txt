I've seen my share of the Woody Allen movies, and although they're not always great, you can usually be sure to have fun. Probably the last really good ones were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then, the ones I've seen were jagged but watchable. And then when I was invited to see Woody Allen's new movie, Melinda and Melinda, which I did not even know was released, I was happy. I had not really heard much about it so I was hoping I would be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I won was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I ever saw. The premise is super explained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. Many scenes said nothing and were still stretched, I presume to fill in what would have become a 15 minute short. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the concept behind this movie - two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the film goes on showing us this, interpreting both scenarios. The problem is that neither of these two films are good. The comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. It seems that Allen had a good idea, but he did not have the time, or time, to actually complete the film. <br /> <br /> The overall level of performance is notably bad too - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings something to the table, and it's basically an impression of Woody Allen. Before, good actors like Chloe Sevigny were annoying, and the worst of the group is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame because her character is in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> Fair to the actors, the script with which they are working is missing, if not nonexistent. Definitely a long way from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
