The back cover of the DVD (which did not appear when he left) greets Hitler - The Rise of Evil as "The New York Post" and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> Well It does not matter the Post, but in fact, who wrote that word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace of art should be fired. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start. Why try painting the picture of Hitler's evil with colors that did not exist? He was in very bad shape, but now his character is portrayed in a way that is historically imprecise (compared to his love for animals, the gentle and moderate manner in which he treated women), and so on. <br /> <br /> The actors are good, so you should feel sorry for them as they are stuck inside your one-dimensional characters. Some kind of curse here with Peter O 'Toole: This is the second time in his honored career when he ends up playing an old and failed leader in a failed film (or, in this case, in TV production, to be exact). The first was, of course, the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I guess I'll leave it here. <br /> <br /> This is a problem if you are on television and you have nothing else to do but believe me - it is best left on the shelf of your local Virgin store.
