Americans have the attention time of a fruit fly and, if something does not happen within the space of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest very fast. <br /> <br /> I discovered an interesting fact from this film: someone has to paint high voltage posts and do it on a timeline! And guess what, they really would like to be doing something else (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, when I was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this movie, I found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging. <br /> <br /> I usually do not watch that TV late at night, so I can not recommend this movie, unless watching dry paint is your idea of ​​two exciting hours. Out of your life.
