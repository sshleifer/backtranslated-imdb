This film is about a police officer (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch a super-intelligent thief (Ekin Cheng), who blackmails an insurance company led by a Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever plans the cop tries, the thief somehow knows them in advance. This film, covered by beautiful actors, beautiful actress main and good pictures of scenes of Hong Kong, really does not have any substance. Everything is flash, and the flash quickly becomes dull as well. I lost all interests one third of the way to the film, and there is no redeeming quality after that, except for the cinematography, which looks good. Just consider watching this movie if you can do it for free. Also, consider stopping watching the movie for 20 minutes in the movie because it's all the same to the end: BORING. 6/10
