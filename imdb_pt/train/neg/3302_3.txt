Swedish action films have evolved over the past few years to something that mimics American action films like "Heat," but with a low budget. This film follows the same recipe as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that they are trying hard to make a movie legal and difficult. <br /> <br /> The story has been seen before, the dialogue seems artificial and the acting is very bad, especially the main actress. .

It does not succeed very well. <br /> <br /> The bluish photo style does not look fresher, nor is it well done in this photo. Only a few scenes really look good. Also, the sound is rather strange and it seems that much of the actual dialogue is recorded later. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this film is Stefan Sauk, although it is not a convincing portrait of a SWAT team. leader, has some really funny lines. Also, the music is very good.
