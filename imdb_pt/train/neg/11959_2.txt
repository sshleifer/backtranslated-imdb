This film is a distorted folly of a film, set in Japan over a dysfunctional family that ends up having a strange violent guest who just sits and watches the four family members at the worst moment. Nothing is sacred in this film, with sexual drugs and violence stretched to such a limit that I'm surprised to have passed by the censors. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it will appeal only to those who should not be encouraging, rather than any supposed underlying message that goes out for the rest of us to consider. A film that favors the worst element of society and is, in any case, a total cut ... A deception of a man who made the sublime films Dead or Alive and Audition.
