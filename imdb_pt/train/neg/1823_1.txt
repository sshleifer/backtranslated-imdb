Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman, the "Dreamer" in Envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​an aerosol "Vapoorize" that, when sprayed on canine feces, makes the poo disappear into thin air. <br /> <br /> For a moment I was hoping Vapoorize was a real product so I could sprinkle it on that "stinky" movie and make it disappear in the air as well. <br /> <br /> Although Envy is not the worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months (this honor goes to The Cat in the Hat), he gets the honor of a close second. <br /> <br /> It's not funny not sad, it's nothing. A real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> A 0.2 out of 10 !!
