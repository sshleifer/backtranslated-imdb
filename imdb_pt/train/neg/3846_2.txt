The book "Of Human Bondage" by W. Somerset Maugham is supposed to be a classic of the English language. If so, a lot may have been missing from the movie version here. The attraction of Phillip (Leslie Howard) by Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicable that it makes the setting look like the post-breakup account of a relationship from the man's point of view. As a family lawyer, I have heard many such accounts; the man describes himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a demon that had no other purpose but to exploit the man. <br /> <br /> Indeed, unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of man. filmmaker, this is an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip even surrenders to Mildred when she brings an undetermined paternity baby, but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred - enraged and now with dubious sanity - to free her apartment run with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period did not occur here. In fact, by the end of the movie, she looks a lot like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I notice how Howard's character is always impeccably dressed and neat. Tell me Phillip yearns for the respectability of the middle class. Someone like that could not run away from a woman with a Cockney accent fast enough. Phillip is, for most of the film, a student; such a person would have been more believable if he were younger, and had the disheveled appearance that indicates low income and low self-esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov, as it will be. And balanced that, allowing Mildred a little charm.
