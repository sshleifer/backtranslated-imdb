Bobby is a silly boy who smiles too much and wants sex. So he buys a van to help with this mission. The acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is nothing more than a chain of loose cliches and cheap emotions. The creators of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the craziness of other films of the time, but they fell far short. They even resort to bobby slipping on a banana peel, because that's supposed to add comic value. <br /> <br /> I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the movie. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito role - but he's just a supporting actor and there's a clich√© of value.
