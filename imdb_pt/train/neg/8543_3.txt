I admit, I had to move quickly through this poorly downloaded DVD after about 30 minutes - NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the "plot". But someone mentioned the opening scene - a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and impaled on the grass of the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did this, put this is never explained. Really manned aperture. <br /> <br /> I wish this had been a better written or thought-out film, because what we have left, if well made and a movie that does not make sense, is not a "smart" movie. , is just a poorly executed movie. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a clean version and if there was some missing recording, I'd like to see if that would help. Otherwise, this is a weird little movie that is best if you move fast!
