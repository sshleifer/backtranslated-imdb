This is very ridiculous, I hope many people are exposed to Muslims living across the country, the UK and around the world. Religion has more than a billion followers. I was born myself and bread in America and through my classes of religion and teachings I was taught to value my country and work to contribute to society. I am very dedicated to the followers and teachings of my religion have been emphasized through life to educate and prepare for success through education in order to contribute back to the world. I know many Muslims everywhere and I have traveled to countries like Pakistan. I have yet to meet a person who believes we should hurt someone or not accept another religion, except the media people. Why ... It's also sad that these extremists are the ones the media uses to represent an entire religion. It is a religion of a billion people, and these are less than one percent, I am sure other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the KKK, IRA and many others who are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages of respected books in order to seek their own revenge, personal or business affairs through their so-called religion
