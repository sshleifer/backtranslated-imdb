This movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action movies ever filmed. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough, but add a very tacky action to a friend, an eccentric and exaggerated villain, a sub-theme of cliched love interest and one of the worst endings of all time, and you have a little cure for people who like their lives and, until they watched Showdown, never thought about killing himself with a torch. <br /> I do not know if it's just me, but the whole homosexual subtext is not very subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia and not to females. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other's virulent parts, and actually before going on a suicide wave, Brandon tells Dolphy, "If we can not, I want to tell you, you have the biggest d --- I've ever seen. "<br /> <br /> Now, is this what a normal man would say to another man? In an ACTION movie no less? And you wish these were your dead words? <br /> <br /> Later, there is such a preciousness: Dolph (about the villain): "I would like to cut off certain parts of your anatomy." Brandon: "Dude, you have a fix." <br /> <br /> As the guy from RuthlessReviews.com pointed out, "Unfortunately, Dolph does not respond: 'I have a fixation? I have a fixation?! You're the one who decided that your last words should be about my privations! I was just going to cut off your ears and nose, man. "That's tirelessly silly and a lot of fun if you're someone who likes to get root canals from unlicensed dentists without novocaine. It's about parity. Great fun for the whole family!
