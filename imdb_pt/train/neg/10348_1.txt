I was very excited to see that they had made a movie of my all time favorite book. I did not know it was Disney until it was too late. I was shocked by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story. It was as if someone was making a movie from a fourth-grade class book about the novel. Meg did well at school, and neither she nor her father wore glasses. Ms. Murray (Meg's mother) was not portrayed as a scientist at all; they left the kitchen lab and replaced it with the internet. And this is just the beginning. In the middle of the movie, I saw myself screaming on the screen, to the despair of the other people who were watching the movie who had not read the book. I wish I had more thumbs so I could give it four thumbs down for this. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this movie is good.
