........ and extremely bad at it !!! How long did this train accident last ?? 14 episodes or something? I can see why now. <br /> <br /> I bought the episode "Serenity" from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so I was free. This is the ONLY good thing about the experience (incident ??). I'm not going to really comment on the acting, since these were, I think, fairly new people who did not really get the job done. just right yet. At least I've never seen them before in any kind of show, theater or TV. If I did, then I easily forgot them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were absolutely horrendous. It's true that this is not exactly a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek was better than that and that was THIRTY-FIVE years ago. I especially had a laugh from the bad guys (grim reapers or something) as he chased the hilarious Firefly, with smoke coming out of the engines looking like something like a gigantic rocket model. I expected to see Wiley Coyote riding on top as he chased the Roadrunner. MODERN jet / rocket engines do not do that badly. <br /> <br /> And that was not even the worst of it. The wild-west guy made me wonder if I was actually watching a science fiction movie or a Gene Autry movie. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the hype, do not waste your time ... I did ... all 80 and a few minutes of the disaster called "Firefly".
