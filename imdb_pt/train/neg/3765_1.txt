I've always been interested in anything about Bigfoot, so when I was looking for a movie to rent, this caught my attention. It was the WORST $ 4.50 I have ever spent and I want my money back! Please do not waste your money on this !! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was incredibly annoying and I saw myself roll my eyes and watch. I'm just sick of it. The acting was horrible, the effects were horrible, everything was very poor and tasteless. All this turned out to be a really bad and boring film and a total waste of time and money. I hope one day they make a good movie about Sasquatch, but by then, I'll have to sit down with countless cheap failures like this to find the real masterpiece.
