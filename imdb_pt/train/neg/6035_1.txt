I really wish I could give a negative vote because I think I've lost 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie I've ever filmed. the acting was just awful, I mean REALLY bad, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded as if it had been written by ... I can not think of anything horrible enough to say. And the day "outside" and the night "in" shots make you think that the events took several days. Terribly acted, directed, written, etc etc all the way up to the gofer as he gets the lunch for everyone. Stay away from this at all costs. If my only saving grace to stay out of hell is to do a good deed, I tell the world not to watch that crap. This movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.
