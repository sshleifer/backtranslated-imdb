I was expecting a French musical B-Movie. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès were superstars of French films of low budget of the time. And it's in color! But I have hallucinations in this unbelievable hour and a half of sheer mediocrity. The musical numbers are terrible and the comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? What songs? This is just a succession of bad numbers, one after another. The very rare thing about it is the nudity of women. It was unfamiliar at the time. In fact, some numbers are just there to show us topless women. This increases mediocrity! And try to find the young Michel Serrault, the future great actor of French cinema, partly as a musician, in his first film. Good luck!
