We rented a lot of Blockbuster movies last night, and this was the first one I watched (it was late on a Saturday night, I wanted a "horror movie fix") ... Wow , that was horrible, almost embarrassingly so ... Stupid slasher-like story I actually thought that movies like the Scream were over; amateur actors delivering clich√©d and tasteless dialogue that is hard to believe was actually typed and read on a page; and sordid scenes that are nothing to get excited about (especially when they occur in a poorly scripted film). <br /> <br /> But I've always believed that no movie is 100% totally useless. Here are some good things I can say about this mess: # 1 Bobbie Phillips: I love this actress. She is the only member of the cast that exhibits any acting talent. The only reason I risked renting this is because her name was on the cover. She absolves her presence in this process with professionalism, even if it seems confusing at times that she is acting in such a stupid story. <br /> <br /> Unintentional hilarity: This is the kind of movie that I remember seeing back. when there were still grind house theaters across the country and they used to include crap like this as the third movie on a triple-bill with some prestige thriller movie that was finally making its way inland. Unfortunately, in this era of direct video, most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone now, without the common experience of being part of a public mocking and throwing things on the screen because the movie is so terrible. What It Takes To - <br /> <br /> # 3 Porn Stars Trying to Acting !: Mostly at hand, because the producers do not have to persuade or beg them to undress for prolonged sex scenes, but this trade-off usually it means that they can actually speak some lines that should advance a story (other than "ooh yeah baby" or "harder!"). And, proudly, everyone proves to be fools when they try to act. I almost deleted Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if her character was not supposed to be an Irish mother and she's really trying to make an accent sometimes, which just keeps the smiles coming. <br /> <br /> Good look at the positive in all experiences, and this is what I took from this pit known as "Evil Breed"
