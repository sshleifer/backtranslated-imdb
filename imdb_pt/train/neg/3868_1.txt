If you're studying Welles and want to see how far he's fallen after Citizen Kane, this movie will prove it. The cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self-admitted puppet to explain how he can fall into a half-cooked scheme can not explain the court's absurd theatricality and the ridiculous twists that eventually happen. Do not get carried away by the high rating of this movie in the database as I was; All I can imagine is that there are a lot of Welles and Hayworth fans out there.
