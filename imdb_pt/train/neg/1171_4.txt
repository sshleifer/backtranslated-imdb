I can hardly believe that this inert, turgid and poorly staged film is from a filmmaker whose other works I thoroughly enjoyed. The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE (and no other word but "enduring") left me with vile humor, a condition relieved only by reading Ali-112's review of the IMDb user's comment. For Rohmer not only attempted to make us see the world through the artistic genre of eighteenth-century France, but, as all pointed out, he showed (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of class consciousness and the revolution that inspired through the eyes of an elitist and unpleasant woman of his day. The director has accomplished something undeniably difficult, but I question whether it was worth the effort he took to do it - or for us to watch the dull results of his work.
