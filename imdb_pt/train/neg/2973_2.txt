I have two very important complaints about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. That my local video store has filed what is clearly a soft core pornography in the "suspense" category. (If I knew what it was, I would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place. And yes, this movie is a softcore porn.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with the movie. No one in this movie does anything that is deviant or obsessive, much less a combination of the two. <br /> <br /> In fact, make the three main complaints: <br /> <br /> 3. That for some reason I watched the movie long enough to figure out the second point on the list. Boy, I regret that. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This movie is worthless on practically every level.
