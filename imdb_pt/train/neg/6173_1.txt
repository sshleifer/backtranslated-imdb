This film is a blatant attempt by the left in Hollywood to portray the Reagan administration as incompetent and incompetent. Some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis, but I'm sure they were not portrayed in this lame movie. My first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by Oliver Stone, but this time I was wrong. There are apparently many others.
