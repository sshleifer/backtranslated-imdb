Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable litter; and unfortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the last. The plot is just his ordinary story of witch, witch or (as is the case here) wizard, who is condemned to death - but not before swearing revenge on those who did ... etc etc. We then receive a session and one thing leads to another, and soon the executed wizard is useless again. The plot is slow, painfully annoying and the movie constantly seems pointless. The characters form reams of diatribe and never serve the film in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me, he should continue acting because the dialogue is extremely banal and serves only to make the film even more annoying than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in The Blue Eyes of the Match Doll and Curse of the Devil, provides dull guidance here, who likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film. Sometimes movies like this have a certain charm about them; but Horror Rises from the Tomb does not even have it. This is a painfully annoying movie that has little or nothing of interest.
