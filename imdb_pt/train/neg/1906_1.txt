They played it in the July 4 Twilight Zone marathon and this is certainly the worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. You are completely out of sync with the rest of the series in your tone. Although Twilight Zone is a very uneven series and many episodes turn out to be predictable, this has been completely out of place. Compare this with legendary episodes like "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun", and you realize that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with this terrible stuff, and frankly it surprises me. that someone of his historical stature comedy would lower to the level of that episode. Even though he seemed to be giving a little effort, he MUST have needed the money ... there is no other explanation.
