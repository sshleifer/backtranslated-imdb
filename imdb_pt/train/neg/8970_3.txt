The first Cube movie was an art film. He established a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world they could not understand. It was, at the non-literal level, a conspiracy of "man versus cruel nature," in which the individual who represented innocence and goodness came to the end, triumphing to face a new, indefinable world beyond the petty disputes of man; a world where there was no struggle but peace. I rated Cube 10 out of 10, and it's a movie that was never meant to be sequenced. <br /> <br /> The second film, Hypercube, was a big disappointment. Some of the ideas were cool, but in the context of the original film, both the story and the scenario made no sense and had no meaning. Still, for being a lot of fun, I rated it as a 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third movie, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, plays like a commercial movie bottom B of the first, sans the symbolism . There is no "homage" or "tribute" here; There's only robbery. The same kind of plot, with some elements altered idiotically (like having letters rather than prime numbers between cubes - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that this is a steal with absolutely no originality and nothing to say). <br /> We see something "behind the scenes" does not mean anything, because the observers are only part of the Big Bad Experiment, whose architects did not hear anything. And in this movie, those who come to the exit (as Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are simply dead - where the * bleep * is the sense of it ?! That's just an idiot. I'm glad I did not pay to see this. <br /> <br /> The values ​​of production and acting in Cube Zero are not so bad, but the story and ideas are so devoid of inspiration that this film can only get me a rating of 3 out of 10.
