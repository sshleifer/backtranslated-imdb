Slaughter High is intrinsically its iconic slasher movie of the '80s. A joke goes out of control leaving a nerdy guy horribly burned. A few years later, the nerd returns and begins to kill the people who hurt him. Now the story may seem intriguing and a lot of fun, but what makes this horrible movie so different from the rest of the 80's horror movies is that it has some pointless flaws and continuation errors. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrendous, however, it's actually not as bad as one might suspect. Although it does not help that all the characters in the movie are so grotesque and unpleasant. The protagonist, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro), is easily the greatest tormentor of all of them and it is with whom we are supposed to share compassion and roots. Not to mention, the nerd is almost too nerdy and I think even stereotyped geeks would be rudely crazed and simply annoyed by how geeky he is of him, so when he gets attacked, does anyone really care? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of potential for unintentional laughter. Munro's lack of acting talent is quite apparent, which puts her on the same level as the rest of the horrible cast. However, the most entertaining is easily when the film barely plays Munro, who is in his 30s at the time, as a teenager among a cast of teenagers. And when it comes to the future life and Munro is playing with the real age, the rest of the cast does not pass as adults. This all goes well with a theme song which is a fun pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by manic laughter and a voice yelling "I'll get you". With that said, Slaughter High really is not a good slasher movie, but it has a bad entertainment value. Maybe an essential factor for fans of hardcore slasher, but do not expect dilemma, suspense or any credibility of it. Horrible!!!
