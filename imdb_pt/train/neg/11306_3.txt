Back in Scotland, Lassie is (again) on trial for her life. Because the faithful dog sleeps in the tomb of its master, it must be condemned to death, according to the law. Strangely, it is also explained that Lassie had no "legal" owner, which is, apparently, also against an old Scottish law. If, after three days, no owner is found, the dogs should be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) invokes the case of Lassie, which leads to an extensive flashback, showing Lassie's adoption by Donald Crisp (as John "Jock" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although based on an interesting and original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie" revisits several previous Lassie situations; and does not improve on them. Comparatively speaking, this is sloppy and uninteresting; and, is a disappointing sequel to "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (as Susan Brown) and several other artists can be charming but can not elevate this. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a Wonderful Life") is among the remarkable children who support Lassie; much later, he will grow up to marry "Dark Shadows," bewitching "Angelique" (Lara Parker).
