I'm glad the IMDb guys have been able to decipher the genre in which this movie fits. I suspected I was trying to be a comedy, but as it also seems to want to be a somber and solemn melodrama, I was not sure. For a comedy, she is unbelievably devoid of even the smallest endeavor for the realm of humor - to the ridiculous end of the "twist", which confirms the enormous waste of time that the whole movie really is. It's hard to describe how amateur is THE HAZING. Has anyone involved in this movie had any idea what they should do? In fact, it pays to watch so you can look at the screen with careless jaw disbelief at how awful it is.
