Western society has been fed with ideas about India being a poor country. Films like these just make these beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it even more difficult for Indians to be accepted abroad. We agree that there are poor and homeless in India, but why there is no representation of educated people, if not the successful ones. <br /> <br /> I totally hated the idea of ​​the movie portraying Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teresa. In my opinion, this movie showed India in a very bad light, giving wrong notions. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. Exactly why people ask me, "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant from outside the airport so we do not have to walk the roads so full of dirt and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion on contemporary Indian society should attend "Monsoon Wedding".
