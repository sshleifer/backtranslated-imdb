At least among films with 100 votes or more. Named for best script written directly to the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role? Named for best photo? I always disagree with many of the Oscar choices, but this movie may well be the worst movie ever to be honored by the Academy. The writing and acting were both horrible. Blethyn's performance in particular was one of the worst I have ever seen, and probably the most exaggerated performance performance of all time. Horrible movie, not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any television or cable channel you've ever played, including HBO (where I've seen it). I'm just grateful that I did not actually pay to see one of the best-selling movies ever.
