Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move reminds me when my sister plays with her dolls because they can not be harder or more false than they were. <br /> <br /> The plot made no sense at all. I mean, first they're on a bus, then on a warehouse and all of a sudden they're on a boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense for some dinosaurs to get together in a van or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit in a moving van. It sounds stupid even when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave a 3 is because it's still fun. I found it better than the first (I have not watched the second). Just do not rent. I saw it on TV and it was a good thing because I did not want to waste money renting.
