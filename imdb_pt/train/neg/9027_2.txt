Revenge on us, the viewing public, perhaps. I sat by this 2 hour movie and I was waiting for the second act to kick in so the movie lived up to its title. But Costner never avenges her fate of lovers, she dies and the movie ends. I was wondering where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called revenge, then the hero should get a little by the end of the movie. I had a choice to see this or Black Rain in the movies, fortunately I saw the movie of other brothers in the movies instead. I'll get this turkey on video. there was one good thing about the movie and it was your beautiful theme song. Listen to the cd.dont watch this is horrible. 1 out of 10
