Hood of the Living Dead and all the other films these guys have directed seem to have stayed together and filmed this with their friends who have no talent in an afternoon when they were bored (the lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing). I think 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home video footage are better than this movie (although the similarities between them justify the comparison). "Hey let's see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies!". I hope no one else has been. My apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is a bit harsh, but I was the one who read their fake reviews and bought the movie.
