Uh oh! Another gay movie. This time is showing the black side. Bet your last dollar, it will have an unhappy ending! But why? With just under a half dozen exceptions, ALL gay movies have to end in death or an "addio" ending. It's like all the European Film Noir releases in the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's. The lead ... man or woman must die or walk alone into oblivion. Why, in the name of God, should writers, directors, and producers make the public depressed? After all, it's supposed to be gay ... not sad. Maybe the category should be changed to a "sad" movie. A large percentage of gay relationships lasts and couples leave together for sunset! No matter who writes or produces, it only shows the negative side of gay life and gives the wrong impression of gay lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, because here comes another gay movie! This is wrong!
