As others have pointed out, this film is a load of preposterous nonsense for the inattentive or masochistic. <br /> <br /> We all know, after seeing trainspotting and acid house, that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humor or realism movies like this do not work. And even more importantly, without a decent script, a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or thought-provoking about the script of this movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie has won some Bafta shows as bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Australian film industry was pretty bad right now, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I would not even bother renting it in the weekly section. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this movie ample space.
