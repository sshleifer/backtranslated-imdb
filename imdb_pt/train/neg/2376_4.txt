George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress. She is supposed to be the heiress of a fortune in the face cream. He interviewed her on his yacht. They fall to each other in bathing suits. <br /> <br /> It happens (very early) that she is not an heiress. It is part of an advertising campaign for the ice cream. <br /> <br /> The film follows the ups and downs of his novel. <br /> <br /> The support cast does little to sulk you. Davis and Brent take the picture. Although fairly predictable, it is also quite entertaining. It is far from being the best of it. But, especially considering his obscurity in his work, is not one of the worst.
