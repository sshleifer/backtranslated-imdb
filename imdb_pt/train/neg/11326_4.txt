This is one of the two post-apocalyptic fantasy films that Albert Pyun did in 1993 - and it's the worst. Apparently, all his energy went into "Nemesis," which was a non-stop action movie and had a much more expensive look. "Knights" is clumsy and tacky, a bottom-up science fiction that often resembles a video game (new opponents appear all the time and should be wiped out as quickly as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is Kathy Long; is not a particularly attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, considering his age at the time (58), I hope his stuntman has been well paid. (* 1/2)
