Lois Weber, self-proclaimed missionary through the movies, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial topics, but this may be the first to have a broad vision, thanks to TCM. This film is her accusation of abortion, but she cleverly disrupts the issue by bringing about eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Her writing skills and other film skills are well shown here, but she can be forgiven for wishing she used them less docile. If you ever wondered what Tyrone Power Jr.'s "famous father" was like, here's your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. It's fun even if you do not enjoy the advertisement.
