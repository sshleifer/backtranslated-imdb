Hello. This is my first review of any movie I've seen. I've had the job of doing this to tell everyone that this is literally the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. I feel that the film was porely done, that I'm going to give some understanding due to budget constraints in doing so. I felt like I was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw. Which I can agree, I saw is also very graphic, but, I liked the movie saw. <br /> <br /> The scene in which he takes the hammer to the victim's head tied up in the chair is the most disturbing scene I have ever seen. the scene lasted almost always, well, actually it was probably about 5 min, but still. I want to note that I like some horror movies and I give credit if they are good. this director and his group of people who made this film should think before making another similar to this. one final note haha ​​!! FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO ENJOYED SEEING ANIMALS LIVING TO DEATH, LEAVE THE SCRIPT, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN WELL AND FIVE SCHEDULES SOMEONE'S SCENE TO GET THERE HEAD WITH A HAMMER, then you will enjoy this movie, if not, and you like horror, go with a bigger budget movie, as you saw for example. I can not believe people actually make movies like that. Anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart, this is just my opinion on the movie.
