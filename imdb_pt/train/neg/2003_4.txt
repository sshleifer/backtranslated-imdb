For all its visual delights, how much better the Renaissance would have been in live action. The animation is fantastic on the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and empty, very much like the story and style of this movie. With real actors, perhaps the world of the film was not so lifeless. There is much to admire here, but in the end I discovered that all I could do was admire. I did not like the movie very much, and this clarifies something that I have not seen before: that the visual elements can be the positive defining aspect of a movie, but without a good story and strong characters, everything can be for nothing. I will not go so far as to say that this movie did not hit anything, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love Dark Science fiction thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two movies that I found wonderful. But Blade Runner had its tragic villain and Dark City had its story arc intriguing. The rebirth has shade and light, but little else. I wish I had enjoyed this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters got in the way of it. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic explosion of color and life. How ironic, then, that one of the darkest and lifeless films I've seen this year receives its title from the Renaissance.
