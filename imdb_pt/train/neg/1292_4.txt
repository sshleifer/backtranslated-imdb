Ok .. this was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I heard lots of good things about it and was very disappointed. I could see where the filmmakers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle were not very different from each other, that the guys were getting lost in the fighting etc etc (well, this is the my presumption, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> Anyway .. the movie kind of bored me. I watched a lot of long films, but this one just seemed to drag on and on ... basically because I just could not care less about any of the characters. I just kept thinking .. who cares? I also found the acting quite oppressive and the dialogue tense. I understand that this was the nineteenth century and everything, but most of the conversations seemed unnatural. No one seemed to have any emotion during most of the movie except during melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> The "romance" in the story does not seem to be supported by anything other than "I'm a guy and you're a girl", which I do not consider much romance, and yet I felt like I was being taken to the belief that these people were in love. Oh well .. I think it's the whole "all this horror around us, we have each other to cling to" kind thing, or whatever. I was also hoping for some kind of dynamic between the two best friends (who initially seemed to take an interest in the girl), but that was kind of ruled out. Maybe avoiding a clich√© love triangle. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Oh well ... Daniel Holt was the only character I really liked. And Sue Lee was fine. I did not exactly hate Jake, but he looked a little ... cowardly, I guess. Jack Bull I did not care about anything. And I'm sure you should * hate all others, except for the normal people who have just been slaughtered to the left and right. It was pretty graphic and had all this "horror of the war" thing down, but I've seen many other films with the same theme, done better. (I really liked the Patriot, for example, even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative.) But as I said, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
