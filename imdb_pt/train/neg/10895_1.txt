I've seen a lot of bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a low quality horror movie for what it is. But this really leads to meanness to new extremes. <br /> <br /> It's bland, the plot for what ever is really is going nowhere and takes your time on it. There are no shocks, no horror, no suspense, just a bunch of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick final. <br /> <br /> A plague in the horror genre of low quality, avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
