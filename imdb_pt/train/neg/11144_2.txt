This movie reminded me of those erotic thrills that I used to stay up late and watch at Cinemax when I was 13 years old. I would label this movie as a softcore, since there is not just one dummy. There is, however, a ton of nudity, the opening scene is in a strip club, we see Kane Hodder keester (or at least a stunt double) and then an inexplicable 10-minute scene of lesbian dancing in the middle of the film and a naked female werewolf who seems to have assaulted the Munster by a fantasy. 13-year-old boys rejoice. <br /> <br /> Other than that, the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen in years. The photos look like FMVs from the video game Resident Evil in terms of quality. The wolf is too bad to be explained and, despite the poor quality of the costume, is shown many times. <br /> <br /> Plot and acting make no sense. There is a strange story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves - Darkwolf is the last, but from what I can tell, hybrids do the same thing: all werewolves look human, change to a wolf, and kill people. Darkwolf is trying to find a mate, but strangely he can not find his mate, but he can sniff anyone she touches. Again, these abilities are not useful, since Darkwolf ends up killing several people that his target never touched, knew or even saw in the best way that I can say. The mate does not know she's a werewolf and she's fighting the transformation or something. <br /> <br /> You'd think it would be hard to ruin a simple monstrous movie like this, but, well, they did. Want low-end werewolf quality low-end, will rent Dog Soldiers want a ton of T & A this is your movie.
