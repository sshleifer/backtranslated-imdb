In my eyes, this is almost the perfect example of the ego of Hollywood, only defeated by the new film of King Kong. Superman is the original superhero and deserves to be treated with respect, even if he wears tight pants. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, since the beginning of the movie you just want to stick a piece of kryptonite in his throat. He looks just silly wearing the costume. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for lois lane, she should be a tough reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a high school girl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, he's actually superman's son, who would have thought ...) and the acting was horrible. This movie has a good thing, and its name is Kevin Spacey. His interpretation of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but even he could not save this movie. What this film needed was the cast of "lois and clark" (except Kevin Spacey, of course) and a different story. I watched this movie after watching "the hills have eyes" and I was shocked to learn that there were worse movies than that.
