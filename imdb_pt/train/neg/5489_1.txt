The story is similar to ET: an extraterrestrial race on Earth and tries to return home. As long as you stay on our planet, it will create friendly ties with humans. <br /> <br /> But unlike ET who exudes drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. In fact, it is a pure Dysney production: its main audience is children and the film is more in the visual than in the message. <br /> <br /> So, you'll find some funny scenes (the first time you spotted the city). , a cosmic "cosmic toaster" and casting is experimented with special mention of "Doc", which rejuvenates a character "Mac Fly", and Hurley, who seems to be open to self-derision. <br /> <br /> Ice on the cake: The main title is branded by Danny Elfman, and like any other great songwriter, you recognize your "voice" before even being credited.
