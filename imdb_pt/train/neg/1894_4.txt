Although there are Flying Guillotines as part of the title of this film, it has no connections with the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and its sequel Flying Guillotines II (1978). The original two are masterpieces of the kung-fu movie and still stand out as a classic. This is a much lower copy of the original, and even as a regular kung-fu movie, it is below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie does not have much acting. It's a senseless fighting scene after another, and the flying guillotine does not even play a big part in them. History is about some Shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains who took off with a holy book, and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince has plans to lure the monks and use the flying guillotines. <br /> <br /> There are four films with Flying Guillotine as part of its title. That in my opinion is of lower quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this film is different from the other three, indicating that this film was produced by an entity different from the other three. <br /> <br /> The film has no chemistry besides being unintentionally funny due to poor production. <br /> <br /> Better skip this and watch the original two.
