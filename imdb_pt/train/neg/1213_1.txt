I can not believe the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger got involved in this piece of crap! The screenplay is so poorly written and the direction so weak (both by the same person) that it is difficult to find more one-dimensional characters in a movie. The dialogues are so idiotic that this so-called thriller made fun of the few idiots who entered the theater. The setup is tricky, inviting you to believe you're going to watch a chilling suspense and suddenly it turns into the most stupid chase movie. Bassinger's character is so stupid that she stops screaming at God "Where are you!" then people after it can follow, and then it takes a leak !!!! And then she apparently went into the smallest woods in the world, that is, she runs all over the place and the killers never lose sight of her, and it happens in the middle of the night. It really makes me think, is that actually the best person written in Hollywood can find that they spend millions producing this.
