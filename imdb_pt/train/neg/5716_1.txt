This movie is not deserving of the next few minutes I'll be criticizing, but I know a lot of people, like me, rely on the movie to help decide the movies. For that reason alone, I am writing this. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like an Asian version of "The Incredible Torture Show" of 1976 (also known as "Blood Sucking Freaks") http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 / . Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism ... of course, it's all here along with a third-degree script, pathetic acting and a perverted failure of a black comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in China, but everyone speaks English. There are plenty of girls in the movie who are horrified by the carnage of dogs in a market, but are sexually excited when entering a porn studio. A girl who is disgusted with filth in a bathroom moments later, is still there with her boyfriend (how he got there may be the only interesting thing about this whole movie). The movie is absolutely horrible, even for a B movie. Even if you were to download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
