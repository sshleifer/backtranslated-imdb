The movie begins with a cool song It seems like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking suspiciously but suddenly we are forced into a comedy With stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown kids Their scenes are pretty funny first and then they get boring There's a bored sub-lot of Tanushree's brother being killed In the end the movie tries to take seriously the villain who kidnapped our heroes but here it gets stupid So a long climax bashing bashing out of HERA PHERI and wait, there's too a long chase in the house of Payal <br /> <br /> The movie is so annoying that it makes you fall asleep <br /> <br /> Priyan's direction is very bad music (Pritam) is routine except the first music <br /> <br /> Photography is bad, the film has a cheap appearance everywhere Rajpal Yadav is good in his first scene where he will pay his rent and I was happy that the actor is not loud and exaggerated like other movies But no, He becomes his habitual self and gets irritating most of the time Tusshar should not talk in a movie, his delivery of dialing is terrible Sharman is the saving grace, He is the only actor who acts very well in this film Kunal Khemmu strives in his first comedy film as an adult, but does not impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less reach and is usual Payal is a non-actress Murli Sharma is terrible
