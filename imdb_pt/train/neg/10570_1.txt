Do not let the MPAA fool you with your "Rated R for extreme violence" there is no extreme violence in this boring piece of s * t. I expected a cheap action of type 3 rambo that the trailer promised, however its senseless boring nonsense with tons of flashbacks lame lame mo that do not make sense. AVOID!
