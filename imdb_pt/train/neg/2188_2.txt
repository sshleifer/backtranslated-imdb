After a car accident, a mad scientist (Jason Evers) holds the head of his fianc√©e (Virgina Leith) alive. He then goes looking for the perfect body to make it whole again. Very lame all around, nothing redeeming here. Also in the cast are: Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton. Someone should have helped get this out of their misery. Let him die.
