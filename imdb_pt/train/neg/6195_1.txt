Badly done. Terrible acting and an ending that the director appeared to invent out of nowhere as the film had been frankly nothing less than boring. Shocking that this film is considered for an award at the Festival de Gij√≥n. Everyone who left the theater was of the same opinion as myself - what was the purpose of making the film? The references to Iraq were either bizarre or just not thought out correctly. I'm surprised this movie has been released - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, terribly negative comment, but hopefully it will dissuade some people from making the same mistake. Too bad we did not have Q and A at the end of the movie - now that could have been interesting.
