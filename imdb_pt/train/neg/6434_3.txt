I'm always surprised at how different people are all different and as for almost every movie you have both extremes. People who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmata would not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. First of all the sound. Producers spent more time on the soundtrack than on the issue. It was so noisy when the soundtrack played and no one spoke, and when Patrica spoke in her monotone voice, it could hardly be heard. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patrica and Gaberial, but both were flat in this movie. Patrica had basically 3 emotions. Quiet, in great pain or very angry, she has stigmata. The first was the predominant, the second involved screaming in pain, the third involving the increase of his voice. It was the sound that distinguishes the three, not the emotion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I lost a lot of the deep meaning and subplot that everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the awful footage and MTV style. When you watch a 3-minute video, you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story, in a 2-hour feature film, is nauseating. I can not see the meaning of it by seeing the women across the street and letting a child fall. And not Pittsburg does not rain so often !! <br /> <br /> I think maybe a real story with something to say might have been planned but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to make slow rain drop shots and renting that wonderful apartment in that Mrs. Arquett lived, they ended up dismissing the guy with the story.
