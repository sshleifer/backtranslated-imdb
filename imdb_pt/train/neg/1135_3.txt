I have not read a biography of Lincoln, so perhaps this was a precise portrait ... And perhaps it is because I am accustomed to the equally alienating and unrealistic portraits of worship that strangely deify. Lincoln as a brilliant, honored and savior of our country ... But why would they make a movie portraying Lincoln as a clown? While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, his interpretation of him as an "ah, I'm just a plain guy" seemed a bit insulting. <br /> <br /> [All right, Bushie Jr. campaign, to make us think he was "just a normal guy" so we would not mind him being a rich and privileged idiot - but that's a story altogether different. Not only does the film show Lincoln as a kind of simple guy (almost simplistic), the film claims that Lincoln sort of got involved in law by accident, and that he was not even interested in the law - just with the falsely simplistic idea of ​​law being about rights and mistakes. In the film he is not a good defense lawyer (he sits with his feet on the table and mocks witnesses), and the result is mainly determined by chance / luck. <br /> <br /> In addition, partly because it was funded by Republicans (in reaction to some game sponsored by the Democrats who had left) and partly because it was just the feeling of the times, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this movie!
