The Brain (or head) that would not die is one of the most thoughtful low-budget exploration films of the early 1960s. It's hard to imagine how such a sexually repulsive sexist script could have been written without the intention of self-parody. And the themes that are repeatedly expressed by the female lead, Ginny Leith - a prominent head kept alive by machines, I-Vs and staples - seem to confirm that the film should simultaneously explore and critique gender stereotypes. Shadows of Under-rated Boxing Helena. <br /> <br /> Sexisms are abundant and as annoying as an army of angry ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, super-dramatic and unbelievable, and the acting is simply OK (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie a 4? Because some thought clearly went into it. I'm not really sure what point the film really was trying to make, but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually nervous and raw type of horror (without the blood and courage that today's audience expects). Another unique and interesting aspect of Brain is that there really are no heroes in this movie, and none of the characters are particularly nice. <br /> <br /> All things considered, this is a rather painful and disturbing look at first. The American pop sexuality of the 1960s, from the point of view of a woman kept alive despite her body lost after what should have been a fatal car accident. Her lover is threatening to sew a new, high-quality body and force her to continue living with him. She is understandably impassive for all this and forced to make friends with a creature that is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Ah, there are also some vague references to the clich√© of the 1950s and 1960s about the evils of science that go mad. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of science fiction and postgraduate students in gender studies. O / w not recommended.
