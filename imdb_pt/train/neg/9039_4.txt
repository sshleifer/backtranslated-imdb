A noble effort, I think, but ultimately a poor one. Before seeing this movie, I felt that "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was not applicable. After you see, I still do. Unfortunately, I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on, and will be annoyed at the unnecessary revisions of the film (1850-70 update, moving from New York to London). Even Paul Scofield's fine talents can not save what seems to me to be a well-meaning but misguided effort to film Melville's metaphysical classic.
