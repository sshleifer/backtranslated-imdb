This film, once sensational for its visionary policies and representations of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced by time to mere curiosity. It seems absurd now that this annoying little movie has been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given the way socialist Sweden has become, the "radicalism" of its once controversial policy seems naive and almost dominant four decades later. And their sex scenes, at the same time the subject of sensational judgments of obscenity, seem quite harmless in a modern context. However, the accompanying film and documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remain marginally watchable as an early reliquary of the youth rebellion of the 1960s. Part of the film still holds: its self-awareness of the "fourth wall." Once in a while, the filmmakers filmed making the film. The satirical joke of this still causes a laugh.
