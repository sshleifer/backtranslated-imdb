For the love of God please do not watch this movie! It's a waste of time, the plot is predictable, just like the romantic scenes. Trying to build a lot with very little, this film and its predictable evil villain is just a failure. The characters are not developed, and most of the film is filled with scenes from Rome, which is much more interesting than the film itself. On top of all that, acting is a disgrace. I know everyone tries to find their niche but this is really a disaster. I can not believe that anyone actually paid many millions of pounds to put this movie on screen. Do not waste money or time on this movie, go see your grandmother or something worthwhile.
