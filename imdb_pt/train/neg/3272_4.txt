I'll tell you something about this movie: there are no calms. You can not be bored watching this. The problem is that it is very intense. There is a lot of action and need calms! That's the risk you take on modern action movies. You want interesting, but not overkill. This is very exaggerated. Although the acting is good and has a few "names" on Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has the feel of a "B" movie. The best part is Scheider's dialogue: the only part "A" of this movie "B". <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly Rambo's mentality, but has had some highlights. One in particular was a very groundbreaking scene with land mines. That was memorable. Not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long.
