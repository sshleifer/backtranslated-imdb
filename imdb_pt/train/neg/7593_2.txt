I do not like this movie, but I also did not think much of the book that, although considered by many to be a "masterpiece", I found that it lacked character development and was disjointed and illogical in the plot, although it was much more than that. legible than Fante's first terrible effort "Road to Los Angeles" was not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-1980s. I was intrigued to see what kind of Towne soup would do with such scarce He worked hard in terms of script to repair the book's many shortcomings, but my money did not redeem it. There was never a movie in Ask the Dust while he tried to remain faithful to the book. I consider this movie the craziness of Towne. <br /> <br /> In a word: forgettable.
