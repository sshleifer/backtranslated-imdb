For such a great classic tale, the setting (location), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script that completely lacked dramatic tension. The rubric of the club's history is useful and would have provided a new insight into the literary classic. For some strange reason, this rubric was dropped early on. To know this was shot in 21 days, he tells me, "rushed" and unfortunately shows. Now we'll have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I talk about FX, I can tolerate really bad CGI, but the script has to be rock and that was very slow, spartan and without drama. I would put the blame on the actors, but ... since I can write more than acting, I will choose my colleague.
