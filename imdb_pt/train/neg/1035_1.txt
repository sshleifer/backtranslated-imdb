Horrible acting, horrible cast and cheap props. It would have been much better if it had been defined as an action parody style movie. What a waste. From the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The Enemy" naming him "Action Movie" would have improved. (contributing to the parody effect). The policeman looking like a 60-year-old blonde girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times. At the end of the movie, he and she are working together to bring down the bad guys and every time they barter words, it seems like cheap lines are given before a sex scene in a porn movie. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
