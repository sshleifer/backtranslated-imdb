When I saw this movie, around 1979, it became the first movie I got out of the way. There is nothing worse than the comedy that just is not funny anymore, and that goes wrong every time (although I can not speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any of the sketches. Although I like spicy humor, when appropriate, these sketches were unnecessarily vulgar. What was even more annoying was that this movie was heralded as "Robin William's first movie", capitalizing on his new fame in the television series "Mork and Mindy." However, your role turned out to be so insignificant that you can not even notice it on the screen.
