.... may seem very improbable ... but there really was a real-life story ... of a man who had an affair with a woman, who discovered where he and his new wife were staying, and she killed the woman. wife, making it look like a murder rape ....... In her illusion she told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him .. so she quit her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... Finally, I heard that she was in a mental institution, Security Prison ... /> <br /> She was still wearing the "engagement ring". which she bought for herself ... and told everyone he had bought for her. <br /> <br /> The events occurred in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,,, and the murder happened in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> There was even a report in the magazine "People" ... Spring 1988, I mean on page 39. I remember this as I was in college at the time, and a colleague of mine met the guy at the Security Hospital ....
