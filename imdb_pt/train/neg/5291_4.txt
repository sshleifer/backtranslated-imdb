Star rating: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning * Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence for his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to keep the family together but ends up coming out more like a doormat. Meanwhile, his mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his growing drug habit that is sending him off the rails. The film follows these desperate characters as they live along with their lives. <br /> <br /> They say that the English seem to like being miserable, and that includes watching movies that entertain them that way. Movies like Nil by Mouth highlight that. It's a tale of a dismembered family torn apart by crime, poverty, drink, and drugs, the kind Jeremy Kyle faced as a three-course meal. It is also essentially a tale of self-destructive men, separated by three generations and each copying the other, dismembering a family and women trying to keep it together, though they are not strong enough. If you pick up a little of what it's about from the set-off, you can see that it does not promise to be joyful seeing it from the beginning and certainly does not disappoint it. <br /> <br /> It's true what everyone said about the performances, and the protagonists, Winstone and Burke, make a great performance. We see Winstone lose him to his wife, pounding her senselessly after another cocaine-induced paranoia, collapsing during a phone conversation with her and releasing a typical arsenal of words when she refuses to let him see her son. Similarly, in a private moment, we see Burke skillfully lose composure on a ladder, the full impact of the night before kicking. <br /> <br /> This is another of those films in which there is no 'plot' to follow. as such, just a real feel of these hopeless lives, going from one day to the next. It has been acclaimed by many (including the Baftas!), But it was really very sad and gloomy for me. I have no right to criticize him for this, knowing what I knew about this set-off, but unfortunately that's how I found him. **
