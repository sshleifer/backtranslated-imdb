I picked up the DVD library hoping to get a good idea of ​​how things happen in the background in a major opera production. I have to say, I was very disappointed. The subject had a lot of potential. The sets in a Wagnerian production must necessarily be elaborate and impressive, and the story behind its creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. Instead, what we have is a mix of people moving around large items of scenery, vaguely helping along with a comment that failed to hold my attention. I found myself mainly listening to the background clips of the operas' songs. I was impressed by the enormous enormity of the effort required to make this production - which turned out pretty well and the next time I'm in the opera, I'm sure I'll remember that part, if this video - but I was feeling a little mistaken. by the lack of detailed comments and explanations.
