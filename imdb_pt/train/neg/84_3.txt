As a kid I thought the weapon the killer wore was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a little dumb. Even as an idiot kid though the movie plot was stupid and a little annoying when the killer was not using his knife to kill people. What strikes me is that the film has a really solid cast. What script did they read when they agreed to be in this movie as it is certainly more boring and just a way to show off a lightsaber on a very small scale. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole movie seems to spin around aliens and a gun. The plot has two kids and some guy having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a comeback as they were in the mix. Dead animals and such to be exploited and for some reason the only guy takes the aliens' weapon and starts using it to make a very light kill. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you're going to have a killer that has good death scenes, if you're going to have encounters with aliens, show more than a weird vortex thing, and if you will have it lightsabers, then call yourself star wars.
