This movie was really bad. I love war movies and I can usually get out of most movies and find something that I liked, but this was not one of them. This film lacked substance and intensity.OK I understand, the Finns put a hell of a fight and that's great, but the story is barely told. You have no real connection to any of the characters and there is a real story to follow. You simply go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form the story you are trying to convey. If you want a war movie that will keep you fascinated, and incredibly no battle scenes, then I would suggest "Downfall" (German WWII movie). Or if you prefer a great storyline and lots of action, I would suggest "Brotherhood of War" (Korean War / Korean film). These two movies will not disappoint you like the Winter War.
