I absolutely hate it when a movie falls apart completely near the end, after you've invested an hour in it. and that's what happened to this movie. I was intrigued by his actors and by the fact that Malamud wrote his story of origin. I did not read this story, but I can not imagine it ending like this movie. Fortunately, I did not pay much money to see or rent because my library had. ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting (the wife in particular was so perfect). but milo o'shea as a Jew? ! now that was funny. I did not research on his creation, but he played as the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the movie. Before that, a story and characters were developing, there were a lot of plot points and there was not much time wasted. but ooh that lasts half an hour - if this was not the most idiotic and worthless ending I've ever witnessed, I do not know what it is. I hate it when faith is so destroyed; it seems an act of violence.
