I had high expectations for this movie (the translated title is "How We Get Rid Of Others"). After all, the concept is great: a near future in which the ruling elite took the consequences of the constant verbal and legislative persecution of the right-wing government to the so-called profiteers and the left in general, and decided to simply kill everyone. who can not prove that they are contributing something to the establishment (the establishment being called the "common good" but actually meaning the interests of the dominant capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> Very cool idea! Ideal for biting satire! Except that this movie ends its chance. The satire comes out only in some scenes and performances of absurd, but this satire is not sustained; it is neither sharp nor witty. And for an alleged comedy, the film has almost no funny scenes. I suppose comedy should be absurd, but situations are largely uncomfortable and extremely serious, rather than evoking laughter or thought. <br /> <br /> The script is fraught with serious layout errors. The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing, but instead, a great deal of time is spent on a young woman who wrote the new laws for fun, and who is trying to save everyone. , organizing a resistance that sends people to Africa. All this is out of the question! A movie like this should not pretend to be that serious! It's a satire! A political statement. But it does not even really begin to solve the problem it should be. Maybe I'm afraid of going too far? How cowardly. This is not art. It's not even a real satire. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark, one of the most serious and up to now one of the oldest actors in Denmark, was very good. It carried in large part the little value of entertainment that the film had. All others: nothing special (well, maybe with the exception of Lene Poulsen, who did a convincing performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, one problem with most Danish films is that language never sounds natural. Neither the wording nor the delivery. Why is it so hard to make it sound right? Why should it be so artificial and artificial? I hope that when people look at these films fifty years from now, do not think that this is how people spoke in Danish society in general. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
