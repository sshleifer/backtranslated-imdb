The acronym "F.P.1" stands for "Floating Platform # 1". The film announces the construction of a "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, to be used as an "air station" for transatlantic flights. Based on a contemporary novel by Curt Siodmark; was filmed in German as "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933) and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Therefore, technology has made uninterrupted ocean travel much more preferable. <br /> <br /> Stars Conrad Veidt (as Ellissen), Jill Esmond (as Droste) and Leslie Fenton (as Claire) find love and sabotage on and off the Atlantic shelf. Karl Hartl directed. Mr. Veidt is more fun to watch; but he is not convincing in the "love triangle" with Esmond and Fenton. The youngest co-stars were the wives of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak, respectively. Both the concept and the film did not age well. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
