OK first, let me say that I'm still amazed at how the plot sucks, <br /> <br /> but again, it's a film that follows Steven's film just like Steven Segal omg !!! <br /> <br /> Just random low budget scenes no matter what point I'm still impressed, I burned 90 mins in that shit really <br /> <br /> Just rent a Jacky Chan movie or go see the wwf more fun and has not and do not intend to have and plot !!! plz plz plz avoid it !! btw the best actor who plays there is bill goldberg and that says a lot !! <br /> <br /> and not it does not play very well as I said plz avoid it pfff I still can not believe I wasted 90 min and spent 10 min more writing it !! :)
