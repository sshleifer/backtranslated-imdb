This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini. About the single most bizarre is his SATYRICON. This is a two and a half hour prank through a strange nightmarish world of decadence, opulence and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes a curiously unpleasant Casanova and the strange happenings in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail to engage the viewer. The art direction and costumes are, however, EXCEPTIONAL. The academy was wrong not to name the first, but did justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the second. Also indicated (strangely) was the script disjointed, meaningless and almost inaccessible. Who knows!! The video movie is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes less than the original runtime. This spectator was grateful.
