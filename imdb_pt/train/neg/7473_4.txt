My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a southern lady with a confused personal life solves the crimes of the LAPD. The first season was a must for us. Unfortunately, the stories of his personal life in Season Two have become so tedious and unworthy of the strong character we have stopped watching. <br /> <br /> My husband and I are bothered by the episode in which she tries to hide from her. mother the fact that she is shacked up. But the breaker of the deal was the episode in which she conceals her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend, but tells her boss. Why would a strong middle-aged woman do these things? The answer is that she would not do that. Besides, my husband and I chose the villain with near-perfect precision. It is almost always a white man or woman presented on the scene at the crime scene or in an idealized family. Can not writers do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer spectators. We prefer shows that do not betray the characters and insult our intelligence.
