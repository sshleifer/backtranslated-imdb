This is your only spoiler warning. What a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional trash like this is considered "worthy of Oscar". <br /> <br /> I divided the material into three levels. The first is stage theater. Here the viewer is stagnant and power rests on the actor's presentation and, more importantly, on the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the forms of words better. The best playwrights know how to create images that the sterile stage can not show. <br /> <br /> The second level is the movie. In this medium, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer is not sitting at one point all the time. With cinema, the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning as well as strong writing. In addition, the film can manipulate everyday elements, such as sound and color, in almost surreal ways. <br /> <br /> The final level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated into paper and then re-imagined by the reader. Much more detail can go into a novel that is conceivable for a movie studio. <br /> <br /> That's why adaptations can rise, but never down. Novelizations are never better than the base film (see the penny for a dozen in your local bookstore), while the film can not convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and SdA). Movies can rarely be turned into plays and plays can always be turned into movies. <br /> <br /> As for 'The Last Picture Show', it fails. It's a movie that should stay on stage because the director is too dumb to film anything. The characters speak the same and act the same way, it is pure futility. Add to that a nasty soundtrack and you'll have a totally unreachable movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other aspirants tormented. The instructor was enthusiastic about the sadness of the film. What is sad is how this stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious. If this had happened in color, the scenes of impotence, the pool party, and the old prostitute would be considered a great comedy. See what Lucas did with "American Graffiti" a few years later. <br /> <br /> The American secondary education system needs to start teaching ABOUT the movie instead of trying to teach with the film. Two visually powerful optimistic films: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Trust them, not that. It's the last one I want to see. 1 out of 5
