It seems to be true, any movie starring Dolph Lundgren is bad! I do not know if it's the fact that the plot is full of holes, or that Dolph is such a bad actor. There is no spoiler here, He seems to have won the action of pushing and shoving and grabbing and playing in this movie. In my opinion, it is little wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get into the can and the theater.
