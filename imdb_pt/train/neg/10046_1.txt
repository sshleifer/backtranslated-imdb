I was not too impressed with Dante's first season in "Homecoming," it was not a horror story but a clever political statement with the undead. Screwfly is the story of a virus unleashed in the world that makes men's sex drive replaced by killer tendencies toward women. The episode begins well with a short film explaining how the screw-fly was killed by scientists. Then there is a short scene in which a man is arrested when female bodies are discovered in his house. I suppose this should show the beginning of the outbreak, but it is not clear why this is never revisited. The episode goes briefly introducing characters blah blah blah. It seems to be cool and mysterious, but the episode begins to worsen as it progresses to its sad and unsatisfying ending. The worst episode Well, except for the chocolate.
