I feel it's my duty as a horror movie lover to heat up other people about this horrible and very bad horror movie. Do not waste your time or money on this movie, the acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst I have ever seen and the script was horrible. Nothing about it was good, you end up thinking about yourself because I'm watching this crap. The plot had so many holes and they were never clarified in the end, it was so bad, I do not know how such a terrible movie could be done. Like I said before I love horror movies and I was so disappointed, it was an 18, but you see little blood and there are no scares or jumps. Also what bothered me was how stupid things happened in the movie that made no sense to the plot like brother and sister kissing, why? that's all I can say. Just do not bother, there are a lot more great horror movies out there, just do not waste your time life is too short.
