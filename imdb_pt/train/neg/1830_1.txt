This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not kidding. Next time this happens, I'll keep running my head to the wall. I'd be happier to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than trying to get through that movie again. <br /> <br /> I hope the blacks and the quiet never work together. Such a bad project again. both are good comedians, so I was shocked to have been so clumsy. <br /> <br /> If they had to do it all over again, I'm sure they would decide not to do it. the people who led the money, must have lost a ton. not really - because the special effects (all two of them) were terrible.
