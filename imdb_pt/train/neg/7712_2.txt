The Assassin Tomato Attack is a "parody" of bad monster movies that turns out to be worse than the movies he fakes. The (very poor) story speaks of tomatoes revolting against those who treat them badly. Basically, they rotate and growl (yes, they growl) and the next thing you know is that the person is covered in ketchup. Actors are not names that have never made movies after that, so it would not make sense to name them. There's a guy who's hired by the government to try to stop the threat of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black guy who owns a disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. Anyway, there's another woman who spies the first guy who works for the government. If that is not making much sense to you, you understand. This movie would never have been very good at first, but it still lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes. The film is horribly cheeky, which despite being the main point, really hurts what could have been a (reasonably) fun movie. At one point, a giant wax tomato "slips" on a wooden board with wheels! Maybe I would have recommended the movie if it would have nice camp value, but even this is missing from this terrible movie. 2/10
