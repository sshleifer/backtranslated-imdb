Positively horrible vehicle George Sanders, where he ceases to be a thief to the police czar. <br /> <br /> While Sanders was an excellent actor, he certainly was not the protagonist and this film proves this. <br /> It's absolutely beyond stupidity. Gene Lockhart provided some comic relief until a moment of anger caused him to fire his weapon with the resulting tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After making such a deplorable movie like this, it's not shocking. <br /> <br /> The usual and attractive Signe Hasso is nothing here.
