It was nice to see all the familiar characters again, but the story bothered me. We loved Ariel in the first movie - so why the second is centered around her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I did not like the plot of it. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not come back as Eric's voice! Disney, please stop redoing classic movies with these shoddy imitations.
