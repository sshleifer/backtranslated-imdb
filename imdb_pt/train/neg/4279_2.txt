I found a DVD of "I Dream Of Jeanie" in the $ 1.00 box at Wal-Mart. When I saw it was the "Stephen Foster story," being a musician and musical educator, I had to see. I had no idea what year it was made, as it was not said on the cover, only that it was a remake of "Sewanee River" from 1939. Bill Shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. The man does not have testosterone and it's a wimp all the way! I find it hard to believe that Stephen Foster thought the music editors were doing him a favor by publishing his songs ... without paying for them! In addition to this ridiculous notion, there is a nearly 20-minute segment of Ray Middleton and his black-faced "Christy Minstrels" playing Stephen Foster's songs that was hard to watch, to say the least. I can hardly believe that anyone would consider this film appropriate for resurrection in our present time. It is an embarrassment and must remain forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will NEVER be forgotten ... also, Jeanie's portrait by Eileen Christy was certainly the highest point at this low point in Hollywood's history.
