Let's just say in simple words so that even the creators of this film might have a chance to understand: This is a very dumb movie with an even more stupid script, a lame animation and a story as original as the tacks. Do not worry - unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. They may laugh, especially if they are out of their remedies. There's a special kind of insult in such a ridiculous movie - not only do filmmakers seem to think kids are brainless idiots who can have fun with the claptrap that costs about zero effort, but they do not even bother to sweat a little. here and there that an adult might find it amusing. This movie, frankly, irritated me. Shame on you for leaning so low.
