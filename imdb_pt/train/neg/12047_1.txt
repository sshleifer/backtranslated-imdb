I had the greatest enthusiasm going into the early screening for this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind, and it was one of the earliest epic tales I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I must say it was a big disappointment. They completely transformed the plot into a joke and turned it into a long novel. The elements that were faithful to the plot were scattered so casually that the audience was laughing many times with the silly script that just mouth out for this battle of all battles. It was a great disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of powers almost like Matrix, total cruelty and male lovers in the original poem) turning to "Fabio on the beach" under the guise of Pitt with a good script and more effort could have turned it into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were really decent, trying to get the best out of a ridiculous script. In fact, it was a waste of such talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and do not even have a candle for them. Plenty of pieces for the ladies to sneak in, but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about a long battle and siege. I would not recommend anyone to pay to see this story dragged by the dirt as one of the characters was (at least they got the right part).
