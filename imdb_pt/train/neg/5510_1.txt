Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this film. He's barely at it. Most of the time on screen is dominated by bland jokes. A joke is that a character is called Jerk Off. There are also many jokes about erection, where the joke is that someone has an erection. This movie is as funny as Kirstie Ally's British accent is compelling. <br /> <br /> This movie began as a weak action movie: five minutes of history and then bam! Jokes without grace. But in addition to the terrible writing, the film is also misdirected and acting is terrible. In addition, this movie makes the old bad comedy clich√© of having many known B movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, despite being considered the main character. Do not be surprised to find this movie at a pharmacy selling for five dollars. Even this is too much.
