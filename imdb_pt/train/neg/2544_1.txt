Gung Ho was a good idea, however, it's a lot to ask American viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this movie, the main character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces an auto company Japanese woman to come to America and help her dying city Pennsylvania. Two things come up in you. First, why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do, and so good at it? Secondly, can anyone understand that American companies of all kinds go to third world countries to have their products made to escape US labor costs? It makes the premise of the film, then, that the number one manufacturer of cars in the world would go to one of its main competitors (besides Germany) and would put a factory there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time. But he does a decent performance in the same way that could prove he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not ashamed, but director Ron Howard can not stop it from becoming a TV movie that ends up being any way, because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending, the politics and problems of relations between Japanese and Americans who do not resist. Gung Ho has Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel that the producers of both TV shows have made the film and also made the TV version of this film, which gives the film a "light" feel. American workers and feel that he and other Japanese can learn from Americans. His No. 2, Saito, who supposedly does not like Americans that much, does not think so. I would have preferred that all Japanese characters were like Saito than the idiot characters that made the Japanese to be. That would have made the film more interesting.
