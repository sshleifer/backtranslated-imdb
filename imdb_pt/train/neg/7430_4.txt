It's interesting to see what Pierce Brosnan's career was like before Bond got to the scene. In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan portrays the gentle Patrick, who works with ghetto children on "courses of trust". He romances a woman, who has a puta-mop-top mid-90's named Eric. The ex-husband of the woman soon arrives at the place and begins to stir with Pierce. <br /> <br /> At one stage, Pierce is innocently making "vegeburgers." The husband enters. Pierce starts making vegeburgers again. The husband then assaults Pierce. Small pieces of half-eaten vegeburger fall from Pierce's mouth. The fight ends abruptly without showing the result. This is as good as the movie. <br /> <br />
