Dear friends and family, <br /> <br /> I think if a teenager wants to become biblical with another teenager, then that is their eternal curse - remember children, "birth control" does not mean "sex" oral, "I do not care what the honor student says. On the other hand, even though the senator's help is cited as "a romantic subject," he is still only giving in a high school girl. <br /> <br /> In addition, I discovered that the Mongols do not kiss in the same way as the French and that baseball players called the Zoo delicate clothes. <br /> <br /> I think I almost prefer to watch Richie Rich once more than suffer the indignity of that slap, slap. Thank you and good night.
