I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this film, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics, beyond what I remembered from the excellent "Brief History of Almost Everything" and what I was able to suffocate in "A Brief History of Time." "It seemed interesting at times, but the obvious absurdity of Indian history being unable to see the explorers' ships was ridiculous." I actually began to question what was being shoveler at that moment, but then the decisive argument was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually "channeling" some nutcase called "Ramtha" completely disturbed the applecart for me. What a waste of two hours.
