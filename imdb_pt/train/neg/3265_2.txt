I have no idea which audience director, George Schlatter, was hoping to sell this comedy of ills. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough clothes and polyester to cover the entire 1970s, "Norman" plays as a blaxploitation image combined with any number of silly comedy episodes involving misunderstanding, not to mention an elongated cameo of Waylon Flowers ! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this tale of a strange married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay - and living with a steady white homosexual - has enough - Jokes with anger to embarrass any early episode of "Three's Company." Bailey maintains his dignity, and the sheer confusion of Foxx is good for a few laughs, but the rest of the artists are humiliated. * in ****
