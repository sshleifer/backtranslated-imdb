This is the third spoof of the scary movies and hopefully the last one. This time the parody is mostly on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some strange reason. In my opinion, this movie was very meaningless and unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed maybe three times and that's not enough for a comedy. I really liked the first two, but this one was just plain dumb. If your jokes consist of being beaten and people constantly throwing things at each other then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies, they just keep getting worse 3/10.
