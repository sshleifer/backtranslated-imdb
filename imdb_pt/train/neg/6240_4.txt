A suggestion that I think can be gleaned from the various comments on this topic. <br /> <br /> I was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this movie who want to make it "mandatory" or "mandatory." I think this gives us some insight into the reason why this film and the underlying question to it are so polarizing. <br /> <br /> The issue of global warming attracts a lot of people who want to force others to "do right". It appeals particularly to more "liberal" leaning people because it has nothing to do with the morality of the rooms, which is what usually leads conservatives to want to force them to "be good." And that's the problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And very successful at it. He just can not help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do what they want. The political appeal is simply too great. <br /> <br /> And then we have a scientific question that can be of great importance, reduced to a political issue that attracts those of the body politic with a predilection to force others to "do right". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how the Environmental movement was hijacked by these people?
