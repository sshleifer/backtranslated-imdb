With titles like this, you know you get a lot of junk. Acting badly. Bad script. Bad director. Bad grammar <br /> <br /> The movie makes a lot of noise that really is not music and many people scream. Movie makes bad racial stereotype. Why are all movies with black heroes addicted to drugs? Why does the hero always have to dance to be successful? Why famous rapper always has to be in the dance movie? Why can not the letter "s" be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood needs to stop shrinking the audience and making movies that have people with brains who know how to speak English properly. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do not go see.
