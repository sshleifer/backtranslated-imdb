Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fire-wreck in 1957. Well, the film happens mostly in 1986. The movie falls into the 80's trap of weird Stupid special effects, including some insane strangers who look like a rocking horse. <br /> <br /> Either way, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to dominate a person's body. Whether or not she succeeds, you will have to watch to find out. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is largely boring and based on a lot of worthless characters. This is also not really a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of high school. There is avg. horror movie retreats, gore, meaningless nudity, beats against the catholic church. Basic material, boring film. <br /> <br /> The acting is decent enough to give him 3 out of 10. You can waste your time doing something else.
