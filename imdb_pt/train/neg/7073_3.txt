We have an average family. Daddy is a famous rapper, we have the "rebellious teenage daughter", the adopted white boy and the cute child. And we have the careless maid, what show had a maid like that? Do we have a messy Brady Bunch? Yay! When it first came out, I thought it was really cool, mainly because I was young. The music was bad. The raps were so bad and they were very bad. All his raps were about his family and friends and problems. The father was a kind of "Danny from Full House" type father. Always gave the advice. But he was not a clean freak. They had a homeowner for that. Remember? The plots were basically Lil 'Romeo was having some sort of problem, or ... that's not it. Oh, and maybe some pre-teen drama. Yes, this thing is good. Not really. But it's still a good show for kids. But Nikelodean could do better.
