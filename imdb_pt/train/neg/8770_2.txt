This film was the longest movie and record film for sure. He had 30 actors. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002), I do not think anyone had the guts to do something like that. <br /> <br /> The movie as the title suggests. is based on the Kargil war but the problem is that there are many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring. <br /> <br /> Even though there are many cinematic liberties like killing people with knives, imagine which soldier do it? <br /> <br /> JP Dutta's direction pales forward BORDER Music is well <br /> <br /> Among the huge cast Ajay Devgan is tall, Saif is very good on his part and is also his first film with kareena , Abhishek is nice Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is fine Akshaye Khanna does his part well rest are passable Rani is good, Esha is well rest is acceptable
