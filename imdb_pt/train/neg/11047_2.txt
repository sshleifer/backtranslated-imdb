There are two reasons why I did not give a 1 for this movie. One of the reasons is that some of the actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) work, who have tried to play at their generally good level of acting. However, in many scenes they were somehow blocked by bad scripting. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the cool idea and appearance of Cyborg, which is quite different from most of the other roles I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, bad script work. And it looked like it was the first movie of all the actors. It could have been an interesting story, but they failed completely.
