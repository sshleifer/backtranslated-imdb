I have to say that I'm really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I thought you were absolutely stupid. Does the mother have "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue ... It just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful, I thought. She was very annoying. The girl who played Lori did a good job and most of the support cast for what they had to work on. <br /> <br /> I usually love the LMN and am very open when it comes to movies, but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over acting and it was not just for me.
