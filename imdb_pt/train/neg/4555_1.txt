This movie fails to capture any mystery and intrigue that the book offers. The main point of the book, the insights, are hardly touched, leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is doing a great deal on them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> Character development is not good at all. No context or personal development leaves the audience without really caring what happens to them, and so the action sequences fall apart. The search for the manuscripts ends abruptly, and with no real explanation, leaving no sense of satisfaction about what the whole search was for. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen. It's horrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you've read the book, skip the movie and reread it. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the purpose of making the movie was to discredit the book, which is how badly ridiculous and ridiculous this movie is. Too bad, because it might have been good if they capitalized on it at the height of their success and probably would have gotten a good screenwriter and good actors. <br /> <br /> Please do not. do not waste your time, READ THE BOOK !!!
