I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago. I watched parts and judged very dumb to review again. The excessive amount of aqueous 'blood' at the beginning is simply obsolete - not to mention the 'whipped' wind sounds. My friends and I made a low budget movie, and the effects still outweighed this crap fest. <br /> <br /> As for the amount of errors in this movie, there are many to tell. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my teacher at THEATER. THERE IS! <br /> <br /> Final verdict: do not bother with this "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of 73 possible)
