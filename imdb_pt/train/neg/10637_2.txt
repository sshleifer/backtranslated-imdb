I'm sorry I bought this series. I expected more action, more objective image and more consistency. This is just a series of pure propaganda, very dark, without any charm or romanticism, it's just boredom itself. I think the actors also work very weak. O'Donnell may look charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this photo he has no charm. Probably, as he grows older, he is losing his childish charm, but he does not gain any adult charm. Not surprisingly, it has not been introduced in many countries and is being sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and has not even been released in the Netherlands.
