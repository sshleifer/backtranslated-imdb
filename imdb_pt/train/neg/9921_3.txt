Strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but overall, it was like a hit. Bonfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire. There were just a lot of anecdotes from old semi-boring friends and a lot of stock stuffing. I love The Clash and Joe for not getting together and selling their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this doctor left me wanting ... to relate more. Using fire storytellers without the proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent. They should have been interviewed on their own. Even using Strummer's "radio DJ voice", little did to put the film together. And can anyone explain all the flags that fly behind the bonfire scenes? After the incredible "Filth And The Fury", I hoped Temple could do it. A Joe Strummer doc deserves better.
