I went to see it in the hope of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment. Once I realized that I would not be getting this, I watched it for a movie very well done (in terms of footage, and yes..what it was that). But besides having a good movie quality, considering I was watching grainy movies all day, there was nothing good about that movie. He killed 42. Why did Tweedle Dee and Dum play Mudler and Scully? Serisouly, Who can answer this for me? Who can answer anything horrible about this movie for me? <br /> <br /> I agree with whoever said it was just a big joke inside the team. It seemed to be. <br /> <br /> Poor Mr.Carroll. I'm sorry someone did it with your wonderful tales.
