A broken scriptwriter and his agent would be (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) forced to live in a self-storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they believe to be the serial killer who is terrorizing the city, the "Costume Killer" (so named because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in foolish costumes). They convince him that his life story would produce a great film and bring together a group of dissatisfied filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano and Kristy Swanson) and find that the art of making movies can be murder. <br /> <br /> There is more to this film but unfortunately it was left on the floor of the editing room and it shows (the rumor is that the studio wanted a "lighter" comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all do good works and deserve more), because this is the result of an exceptional comedy of black humor, but only becomes mediocre cute. <br /> <br /> If you are a Ron Perlman fan, you are absolutely deserving of getting just by your performance. His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to make great impressions (he was not kidding when he said in the Hellboy movie comment that he needed an intervention when he entered Jerry Lewis mode). It is simply fun to watch this. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in a two-pillar role (but fundamental).
