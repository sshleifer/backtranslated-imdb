A disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> History has established our protagonist as Chrissy, a "young" individual, rather moody adrift, not doing much. In fact, she does very little to move the narrative, so I was not surprised to see the focus shift on her relatives. Too bad, though, Chrissy seems like an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and at times seemed quite formulated. So the question now is: when are we going to see the Campions, the Jacksons, and the Tamahori camp with compelling stories told in movie theaters that will inspire rather than entertain the cost of two hours? <br /> <br /> Technically, a filthy shooting film.
