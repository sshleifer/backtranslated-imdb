I watched this movie saying that Amber Benson and Nick Stahl are generally pretty cool - I realized that any movie with two actors that I like and respect could not be all bad. And in that sense, I was right - considering the dialogue they received, both do reasonably well. Not enough to stop the movie from sucking, you understand, but well enough that I could get through 75 minutes of the movie (and that's the main sign of a horrible movie: when, at 40 minutes, you're already praying for <br /> <br /> It is difficult to know where to start the problems in "Taboo." The dialogue, as mentioned, is shocking, wooden and completely unnatural. she's the character that we spend most of the time going through the house, that's an unforgivable fault. The plot can be so complicated that it does not make sense at the same time to be so clich√© that it's completely predictable (literally, none of the more 'twists' in this movie would surprise anyone but a small child.) Some interesting side shots, the director tries a lot with very little success, strange tracking shots and shrill camera distracting from the small in the element of history that exists. <br /> <br /> Three of the stars in this movie are prized for containing Amber Benson, and the last one comes out on the basis that one of the jokes made me laugh a little. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, ever, under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
