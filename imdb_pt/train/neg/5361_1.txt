I saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970s and I hated it, hated it, hated it! Easily the most booooring movie I've ever seen in my life. I do not know where Leigh got her inspiration, but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to make them open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all because there are no moments of savings in this movie, just long, long silences with people unable to articulate what they are (presumably) feeling. If you want to watch something that will get you to drink, then this is the one for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, put a fork in the toaster: the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get out of it! Yes, Leigh had a lot of really valuable things much later in her career, but gave this one a miss.
