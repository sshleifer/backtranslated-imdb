This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was terrible! I can not emphasize enough! The acting, direction, story, characters and all about it was bad! It was so tacky and cliche. Do not be fooled by the cover or slogan "The Texas massacre" is nothing to laugh at. " <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie are good until you get to the main character Brendan, OK, now turn it off. <br /> <br /> What I got from the movie was: A lot of ugly, boring, and immature people goes to a hut in the middle of the woods and a clown who sings lullabies kills them in a non-original and false way. This film was a waste of my time and money, and it would be a waste of your money and time too! I advance most of the film because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how every evil actor died, and STILL was not worth it! This is seriously the worst movie ever! Rating: do not deserve one.
