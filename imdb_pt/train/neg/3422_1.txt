Oh darling Oh darling I started watching this without knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I was seeing. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air a man who is unarmed and wait for him to capture him and escape with a rocket. If only it were that easy. I finally found a movie worse than "Plan 9 From Outer Space".
