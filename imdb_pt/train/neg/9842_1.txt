It seems like everyone in this movie is channeling Woody Allen. They stutter and stop and stutter a little more. Only for REALLY stubborn DeNero fans! He tries to look so bold and artistic - but it sounds like a very low-budget movie made by college students. The word most commonly used throughout the film is "hum". The film, however, disrupts the atmosphere of the late sixties and early seventies. If you like movies where people CONSTANTLY talk about each other, horrible lighting (even for "art"), and it makes you feel like you're sitting at a political meeting, then you might like that - but you you need to be really bored. I found this CD in the dollar can and now I know why.
