Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED OFFENDING EVERYONE - Guess what? It worked, I'm offended that we spent money to rent that. Two friends and I were bored and we decided to see if all that bull about the movie we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that have shoved this crap for us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I usually avoid the crap, but I got sucked into that. Since then, we've beaten the idiot who hints that we hired him, and his film-picking privileges have been revoked. There's nothing remotely funny about this movie ... even the scene of "dickman's adventures" was at least sophomoric .. Color me p *** ed. I thought maybe the value of production was crap for some important reason ... no ... it was just a drug. NEVER SEE THIS! for any reason. Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny. That's saying a lot. Please, for the sake of all that is sacred, if you nurture your sanity, never see this movie. There are many things - stupid, useless and worthless to name a few. But the main objective was: offensively funny - failed miserably. Hits and burns....
