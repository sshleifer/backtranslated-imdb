While navigating the channel, we find this movie with a promising synopsis. We were discouraged by the flat performance and the stereotyped plot. We found fun scenes of cars exploding, unbelievable shootings and scenarios that fall with the weight of tyro foam and cardboard. What was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes of "Dante's Peak," where the front of the church collapses on the school bus, the store fronts move away from the main street, the viaduct collapses, and the red truck runs down the street. alley as the bricks fall on it. It was a good laugh, though unintentional, and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally planned as a parody of low-cost disaster movies.
