Seeing this movie, as I did for the first time in the Turner Classic (which listed it as "Dangerous Female"), can only multiply its appreciation for the 1941 version of Bogart-Astor. Ricardo Cortez must have been paid for by the smile. I hope he has remembered his dentist and his salesman Brylcreem in his will; they made him the actor he was. Women are all good but no better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who competently deliver many of the individual tics, but almost nothing of the ever changing atmospheres of their successors in the roles, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow transcended the essentiality of their characters in the remake; here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can not. <br /> <br /> This movie is not exactly stinky; it stands there like a large slice of ham. Its main value today is as a reminder that great movies like the '41 'Falcon' do not happen. On the scale of 1 to 10, I rate it as 4, mainly for camera work and support players.
