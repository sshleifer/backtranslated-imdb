I wake up suddenly, aware that I'm drooling on the plastic cover of the sofa, and realize it's a hot Saturday afternoon. Why was I sleeping? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all my grandmother's muscle relaxants? Could it be adult onset narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I stopped briefly at Economic Seats as I surfed the canal, and the impressive lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that I fainted. <br /> <br /> It's this shaking my head, mouth open, shrugging. But I have to give these stupid, boring twins the credit for selling that idea. Maybe they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive that they had on me, and when he woke up, some horrendous episodes were already in the can and he hoped that, since all the viewers will be sleeping, no one. Now, as it is horrible and can keep the annual salary of $ 425,000. <br /> <br /> You've been warned.
