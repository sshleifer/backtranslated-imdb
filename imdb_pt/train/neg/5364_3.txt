Complaints are valid, for me the biggest problem is that this novel is aimed at women. I'm okay with these night soaps, like Gray's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the fact that they will never end. However, when the idea resembles daytime soaps aimed at just putting handsome men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and jokes, and numerous difficult ridiculous situations in a so-called small hospital, it seems like the General Hospital. .. or a female Baywatch counterpart. That's what men wanted and they had, so if that's what women want, so be it, but the idea that this is a show with high eyebrows (or something that men will watch) is unrealistic.
