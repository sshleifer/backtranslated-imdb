Contains spoilers The plot of the film can be summarized in a few sentences: Three guys will hunt in the forest. Two of them alongside other people are shot in the head without explanation. The last guy can stay in the clear, scream and do anything without being shot. He can walk through an old factory and make evil people come within reach without a fight. The villains are suitably dressed in black and look like villains. <br /> <br /> That's the whole story, not summed up, but in detail. Everything is drawn with a guy standing on a bell ringing. We waited with him. Shot of guys being bored in the woods and sleeping. We can take a nap with them. The shot taken from following a female athlete could have been rescuing if we could see her butt or breasts jumping. <br /> <br /> There is dialogue is less than Terminator and it is not because there is a lot of action. The characters just do not talk. And then they do not even have something rude to say like 'I'll be back.' If my friend filmed this over the weekend, I'd praise it, because it's a great feat to uncover the camera controls. Paying money to rent this as a DVD is totally inappropriate. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is a bit funny is the extra with the director counting, as the local police did not realize he was filming and treated them like a random guy walking with a gun. If they had filmed this, I would be sure it would be more fun to watch the movie.
