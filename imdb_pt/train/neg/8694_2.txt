The female protagonist was a terrible actress who made the whole movie mediocre. She was smiling too much when she first went to the cameras to talk about her daughter. That should have made the police suspicious of her. I would have been inconsolable in the identical situation. She seemed very calm to a mother who could not find her daughter. It was as if she did not even want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the better role. And he would have made much more money for such a controversial and important subject. All others were excellent. I do not know where the lead actress is, but I hope she has some acting classes.
