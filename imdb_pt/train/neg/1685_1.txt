All children between the ages of 14 and 16 want to watch this movie (although it is only allowed at age 18). They heard it's a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it. I feel very sad children can not see what a good movie is, and what bad movie it is. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. It's the end? It's an open end ... why? Because it's impossible to come up with a decent story for such a stupid story. This movie is made just to make you scared, and if you're a little clever and know a little bit of music, you know exactly when you're going to be scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie ended and I turned to my friend and said (rather loudly) that this was a total waste of money, some stupid kid seemed strange to me. These days I could do an Oscar with a homemade video of my goldfish if I used the right marketing.
