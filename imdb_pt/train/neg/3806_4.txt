My wife and I thought this movie would be a version of the Manhattan Murder Mystery (BBC) diluted, made for TV ... which is good but not great. The story has little tension or chemistry, and not much of a plot. Woody Allen's character simply wanders through the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson do not have much to do. It's quite disappointing, I must say. The role of Ian McShane is just an expanded appearance. <br /> <br /> The first thing that occurred to me was "I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to evict him from Manhatttan?" He must have needed the money, and they must have needed his appeal to expand his audience beyond the youth market attracted by the two stars. I'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it's unbothersome background noise. If you want something to do while knitting or sorting your stamp collection, this does the job. I would not pay to rent it again.
