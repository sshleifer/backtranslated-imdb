The film released in early 2000 along with MELA both disasters So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense <br /> <br /> The movie seems to suit the 70's but it seems an unintentional comedy for 2000 < Anywayz some classic jewels of the movie: Paresh Rawal I do not understand to laugh at his paper or cry Reason: He will seek his mother in the worst part of the village is when he realizes a secret of Anil he keeps the secret in his stomach that becomes big and makes him look pregnant I remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke of Urrf !!!! as a child did I laugh that time but here? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a joke that can not explain We have Anil in a double role (Older and younger) and Rekha playing old Raveena's wife, the younger We also reject Harish, while Shakti plays the son of Aruna Irani, who fights against those who have the worst wig <br /> <br /> The direction is outdated The music is bad <br /> <br /> Anil struggles looks very old in the role more young and very young in the older paper still good effort Rekha is appropriate, Raveena is also well Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as always Rajnikant is well in a special participation
