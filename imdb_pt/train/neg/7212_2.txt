Why every director of horror wants to imitate "The Exorcist" is a complete puzzle for me, since William Friedkin's "classic" is an overrated film and in my opinion is not so tense or shocking. And yet here is another robbery, a Spaniard this time, who brazenly repeats the story of a young woman who is possessed of pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (which I must admit looks very hot here) plays the honored priest who is approached by John Gibson because the behavior of his sister Leila has changed dramatically since she met her new boyfriend. At first, the priest does not believe, but when John's body is discovered with the neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... "Exorcism" is not only unoriginal, it's also an unbearably boring movie! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch have had an open opportunity to make a religious-themed exploration film full of shocks and blood, yet the result is a domestic and bloodless drama that will almost put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, though very stupid, and there is plenty of elegantly filmed female nudity and nudity. The absolute lack of budget is not a real excuse, since Paul Naschy has proven before that he has enough imagination to make up for the shortage of money. This is just a horrible movie, end of story. Other European "Excorcists" are "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door", and they suck!
