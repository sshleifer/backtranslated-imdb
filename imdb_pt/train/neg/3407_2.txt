OK, forget all the technical inconsistencies or physical impossibilities of the Space Shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold. Forget about the hideous special effects and the one-dimensional characters misconstructed. Just looking at the premise of history. The reason for the movie to exist first, and you will see how badly this movie was put together. <br /> <br /> I know 9 year olds who look at this insult to intelligence and just laugh at it. The story is horrible. The acting is comical and the message you are trying to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse is that cable movie channels continue to show! It's twice a day every two or three days! Why does someone in their right mind think people would like to see this painful piece of celluloid several times, much less to see it? <br /> <br /> My recommendation is that you do not bother to spend the energy to watch it. thing. It just is not worth it.
