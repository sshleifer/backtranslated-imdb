I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Memoirs of Geisha proves to be another flaw in combing the Western and Asian arts. Overall, the scene is beautiful, but after the relentless emphasis on exoticism-oriented scenes, some people can get a kick out of them. Excessive cherry blossom was frankly exaggerated. It is probably the cultural difference of perception here: the supreme beauty is not the showy type, since the truly beautiful geisha would not be the westernized pumpkin in the film. <br /> <br /> Some other comments rightly mentioned the biggest flaws. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress is great. An actor / actress can play any type of role when it may look like him. Gong Li is great, but the power of the emotions she showed in this movie has not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actresses, did not even look like a Japanese. Some comment has mentioned the peculiar feminine and delicate characteristics of the Japanese women, with whom I can not agree more. These are so delicate that I can not even imagine that all modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in Geisha, much less the two Chinese and Malaysian actresses who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know much about Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> The geisha is a good idea to arouse the curiosity of the American public. But it would be an insult to the film itself and to the art if the film wins the Oscar for best fantasy, best director or best film.
