This movie is just plain bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I've gotten out of the way, I feel better. This movie is poor from start to finish. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is very bad. Freddy is in his worst cartoon character. Thank God they killed him. And who wants to see the appearances of Roseanne and Tom Arnold? <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the movie is the bit of background story given to us about Freddy. We see that he already had a family, and we got to see his abusive alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Other than that, all bad. There are some quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is so bad. The hour and a half I spent watching this movie and an hour and a half I can not go back.
