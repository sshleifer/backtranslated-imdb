Camp Blood III is a great improvement on Camp Blood II because it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot. This time, they ventured a little further from the parking lot. The other two films were filmed, which is a good move, since you can not hear cars passing through what should be a remote desert. <br /> <br /> <br /> This time there is a reality show and a fake clown to scare the competitors. This is not a new idea, I've seen at least three other horror films with exactly the same premise where the real killer appears, but at least this one has a plot instead of people being randomly stabbed with a knife. > <br /> Unlike the other two in the series, this is at least good for some laughs. I liked how there is a sound effect of shooting when someone is stabbed at first and the way the microphone grows behind people like a ghost. <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone would want to do a third Camp Blood. movie, I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch, but they have at least tried with this. The half-bare and deformed woman was a little too much for me, it seems they tried to keep going by hiring a freak that would take off for $ 5, as they did in the second film. They have not yet discovered that a machete is used to cut off stabbing, but okay, it's a Camp Blood movie, what do you expect? If you like bad movies, have fun with this movie.
