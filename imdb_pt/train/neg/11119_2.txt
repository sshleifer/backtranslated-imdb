Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes team up as cheaters on the basketball court. Okay, that sounds good there. It leaves a lot of room for good comedy and a good story. But none of these events occurred in the next few minutes of a movie's pathetic attempt. This movie became redundant, retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds passed. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t.v. characters, Woody from Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his "acting performance," I came to the conclusion that he should continue to play stupid and loud idiots. His performance was as monotonous and poor as the film. Another actor in this unreal film was Rosie Perez. I liked movies with Perez before, but I decided that the reason I liked other jobs in her career was that she was not a main character and did not have many lines (Do the right thing). But now in White Men Can not Jump she has become a central character with many lines, meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and tearful voice. So after seeing this movie (freely used term) and listening to Rosie Perez for much more than appreciated, I can now say that I am a white man and am getting ready to jump. . . out of a twenty-story apartment building.
