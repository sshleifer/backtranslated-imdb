I did not like this movie intensely and left during the scene when the legalist gang is shot by the British. The film effectively blames the NI people as being the cause of their own problems. He suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intransigence and nothing to do with the division of Ireland by Britain and with the rule of its history, ie the NI was created by Britain in 1921, regardless of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. The characters are portrayed as unfortunate fools, although I despise the loyalist paramilitaries that they were fighting for a cause - retaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with the legalists during the war, no doubt to keep Catholics at bay and demoralize republicanism. <br /> <br /> The values ​​of the nineties on machismo, masculinity, etc. are transposed into the '70s. Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish "psyche" that leads to violence. The stupid music of the woman in the club - the old Ireland of the green fields ..blah..blah .. - receives a symbolic stature, ie, poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause. Garbage boring, unhistorical, cheap and nasty. O'Sullivan made a personal statement about a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
