Yet another Die Hard straight for video theft with cardboard villains? How many more of these horribly cheap (and evil) god made pluck out of the most popular action movies of the late 80's and early 90's, still exist lurking out there? For the record (not that you'll really care) this is more of a blatant boot up of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability. <br /> <br /> Unforested villains are the usual selection of armed bandits who are dispatched by various means as the movie progresses, the hero is naturally an ex-cop or something that has family problems and attitude and of course which he brings to the party not only the usual emotional baggage, but also a piece of eye candy and his annoying son. <br /> <br /> The supposed luxury cruise that is circulating between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a transatlantic and a ferry. ??? will this go some way to explain how they seem to be playing on a rusty cross channel ferry? in New Zealand! The acting is as wood as the deck, the script is pitiful, the only predictable, the totally inept villains and the plot have holes in which you could navigate a boat. <br /> <br /> It seems like there has never been a crackdown on junk video polluting nightly television slots and supermarket bargains everywhere on the DVD (though even this movie is so bad it has not yet seen a DVD release, but give it time!) Is there any chance of something at least half-decent, half-believable and more important? No, I thought not ??
