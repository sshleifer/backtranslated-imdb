This may not be the worst movie Peter Sellers ever made (I think Laurel goes to "The Prisoner of Zenda"), but it's certainly the most depressing. Sellers, especially without makeup like Nayland Smith, looks like he just went through chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchu, he looks a little better and spends most of the movie (with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he is shaken by electric currents) about to collapse under the weight of all that makeup. Supporting players also seem tired and exhausted, and Sid Caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to "Chinks!" (A brilliant point: this would be one of the last times a great movie would portray the Asians in such an insulting way ... or, incidentally, it would be a non-Asian as one!). The film looks surprisingly cheap, with soup photography and bland games - even the number of Elvis at the end seems low. Only the dazzling Helen Mirren and the tall, thin, nervous guy with the wet pants add any spark of life to this sad affair. All in all, this movie provides a mysterious premonition of the death of a great comic, and even stranger documentation of his death.
