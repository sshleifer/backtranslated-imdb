Horrible, horrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! Of course I'm talking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were gold, and if I was talking exclusively about those seasons, this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians who appear after the first two seasons and who were not part of the original cast are good. They were and they are terrible. The comedy is not funny at all. IN ABSOLUTE !!! The original cast was full of very talented comedians such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever her name was), all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left MAD TV. This show is highly overrated and less worthy of your channel's browsing time than Saturday Night Live, another horrible show. Get out on Saturday night and have fun, and let MAD TV to wither and die, as it deserves.
