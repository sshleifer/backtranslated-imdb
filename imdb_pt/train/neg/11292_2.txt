Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells seek submerged treasures in the South Atlantic. Wilde's treasure hunters fight against a group of territorial sharks with little smiles and grimaces on their hungry faces. Wilde and his gay men must find a way out of the menu to start digging an old Spanish galleon full of gold ingots. <br /> <br /> After the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing, pushing, arguing and listening to Wilde's annoying health tips, 5 doomed lunatics get in the boat and complicate things. Now it's a battle of intelligence over who gets the treasure and who can see what the inside of a shark's stomach looks like. <br /> <br /> At least Wilde is in shape using exactly the same thing that he wore 'The Naked Prey' 10 years earlier and he remained in excellent condition. <br /> <br /> Made with a budget of 75 cents.
