I thought this movie was pretty lame. If you are looking for cheesey, you may like this. I did not mind a reasonable amount of cheese, but that was ridiculous. The progression of the film bored me and the plot was very weak. <br /> <br /> The only fun thing about this movie was the daytime zombies, but even that is not reason enough to see this movie.
