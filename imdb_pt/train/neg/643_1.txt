I'm a big fan of the Largo Winch TV series. This movie was a pain to me. I had to use the quick advance so as not to fall asleep. It was boring! How can someone ruin this title so much? The story was the only good thing. The actors were sh.t. They can not live the part. The lead actor (Tom ...) is a null. Watch the other roles of this actor. The fight scenes were unbelievable, boring and not followed, somehow, were not to keep up with the situation. As another reviewer said low budget movie with bad actors.Maybe the next time someone can do better thing out of this title. French can not do the right thing with great movies like Alien 4. This was a bit brrr, after Alien 1,2,3.
