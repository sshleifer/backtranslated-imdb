I saw this movie in 1979, I was 17 or 18 when it was released. The theater was maybe 1/4 full when the movie began. Ten minutes after the movie I and the friend who went with me to see the movie were the only two people in the theater. The film was very strange and had no plot or motive for its script and people demanded their money back. We decided to stay for the whole movie .... why endure such torture ?? ... here is why. We wanted to be true movie critics ... having a standard to base all the other movies on it is hard to justify by saying that you saw the best movie (a 10) that they always create something better. But, it's easy to be able to base all the other movies out of the worst movie ever made (and that's it ... a 1 at best). There may be other movies out there that really qualify as a 1, but I'm still to see them. Now I base all the movies I see on a scale based on this worst ... I am a true critical movie ... he it.
