A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all connected to some stupid plot or something. <br /> <br /> Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. Does anyone notice that this movie is making little case of molesting children? I suppose it's all right, because he's a teenager - if we had one with a man seducing a teenager, there would be (rightly) outrage. Sorry, having done this for a kid is no excuse. Are you still sick. I realize that Brown was of age (he was actually 18 when that was done), but he looks 15. I just find it disturbing that some people find it OK. <br /> <br /> Separate acting sucks (Kristel is beautiful - but he can not act; Brown is easily one of the worst male actors I've ever seen) and constant nudity gets boring and is not even remotely erotic . <br /> <br /> I saw this nonsense in a theater in 1981. I was 19 and with my cousin of 14 years (who could easily move to 18). He wanted to see it - I did not, but I decide what the heck? We walked in and I actually bought tickets for three teenagers who were obviously underage. My cousin thought it was annoying and the other three kids left halfway! Let me clarify this - three ADOLESCENTS left a movie with tons of female nudity! That should give you an idea of ​​how bad this is. I'm surprised this has been released. A 1 all the way.
