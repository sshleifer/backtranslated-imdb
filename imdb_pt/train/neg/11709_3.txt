Have you ever heard that you live every moment as if it were your last? Whether it's your last day or not, I beg you not to miss any part of it by watching this! Nichole Hiltz provides some enjoyable moments of eye drops (which unfortunately remains wrapped) and David DeLuise shows why he should stick with the small canvas or commercial dog food. A superficial and unrealistic plot with a terrible dialogue means that there is no "Art" in the "Art of Vengeance." <br /> <br />
