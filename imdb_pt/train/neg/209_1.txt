I would never bear to watch Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie was Scott Baio (a skateboarding chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first "adult" role turns on her usual professional performance, but that's no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life I will never go back! No noteworthy character, unbelievable plot, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography, but worst of all, I could not have cared less. The story of California teenagers in the 1970s where children live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Do not waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.
