When I was a kid and lived with my sister, she bought all the horror movies I found and this was one of them. The VCR had just become a household item and we did not have more than 150 movies and watched the hell out of all of them. <br /> <br /> I was at a yard sale the other day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movies that I do not have and I knew this movie looked familiar. I thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought. She'd sold it years ago on a yard sale I'm guessing - who knows. <br /> <br /> I did not remember anything about it and I watched the night I bought it and refreshed my memory because of some scenes. I'm not sure how I felt about it as a child, but I'm sure I liked it because it was news to me and I watched and appreciated anything back then. <br /> <br /> I am a freak of terror, but there are certain requirements for me to consider "good" and this has dropped very little. It was one of those conversation conversations and it led to death types. What death scenes you see are made using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatters and this, if you're lucky, you gain so much. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I've seen some with similar plots so I guess this one should be buried and forgotten. Do not see these people unless you're having trouble.
