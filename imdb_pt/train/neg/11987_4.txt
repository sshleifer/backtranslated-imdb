In my Lit. class we just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He did not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother was betraying her father in a van that was not in the forest where anyone could see. (4) The man with whom the mother is cheating does not have black hair, he is blonde. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old boy can not punch his fist through a window in a punch. <br /> <br /> And for acting, the boy who played Brian was a horrible actor. <br /> <br /> However, I believe the setting was impressive, though I doubt very much that the director has read the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good if you have not read the Hatchet book. , by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then start a letter of complaint to the director.
