The 'Tashan' of Vijay Krishna Acharya is a stylized and exaggerated product. Of course it is one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this. Because? The movie script is as amateur as a 2-year-old baby. Script is king without a good script, even the greatest director of all time can not do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars that appear on it. But nothing on earth can save you if your script is tasteless. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> Presentations: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he have such a role? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks impressive and leaves you, all standing up. Saif Ali Khan does not get what he deserves here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring movie. The failure of the movies at the box office if you stay away.
