There is not much to say about the Las Vegas Lady. It's quite harmless, but it's little more than an assault movie from the '70s. The movie is not as smart or sexy as it strives to be. The plot is a retread from the tired old plot of the casino robbery that was made to death. Except for the Las Vegas Lady, I think the plot of the robbery was designed by a 3-year-old boy. Does the plan involve three women? one for unnecessarily and in view of the outside climb the outside of the building of the Circus Cicus, one to pose as a waitress only to cover her cape at the first opportunity, and one to stand in exposing her cleavage. That's pretty much it. Intricate, right? In addition to Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts, the other women involved in the plot are not particularly memorable. The Las Vegas Lady co-starred Stuart Whitman. When he is not pawing Stevens, his involvement with the film is highlighted by one of the most idiotic armed struggles ever put into the film. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. It has to the 70's to feel I always like and some cool photos of Las Vegas around 1975. But the movie itself is too dull to evaluate any higher than 4/10 ?? and this is probably overstating. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some perfectly good neckline.
