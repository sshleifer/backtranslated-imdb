This reworking of the classic piece by Anthony Shaffer did not last long in theaters. Having recently suffered from this on the cable, I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and star / producer Jude Law were deluded by saying that their prestige alone could sustain this farce for endless 93 minutes without the fun or class of the longest original. Michael Caine reinforced his reputation by playing the second lead in the wonderful 1972 film. He now seems determined to destroy it by attempting the lead, played in that version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Best Actor's Oscar, but lost to Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER.) Looking bloated and faded, Caine slides the part in less depth than he portrays as Batman's butler. He had already relegated himself to an appearance in the grisly remake of GET CARTER. What is next - ALFIE II, or SON OF THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING? <br /> <br /> But then no one benefits from this superficial adaptation of Pinter, who thinks that frequent curses and an additional sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shaffer's spirited interference. Branagh's direction depends on bluish lighting and soulless design that would not stand up to a second-rate nightclub. Neither the shadows nor the tight and exaggerated close-ups can help Law to overcome his shadowy persona. The result is a failure as much as direct drama as a detective thriller, almost making you forget the purpose behind the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of the original stage production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Caine's film would do well to regard this venture as a nightmare. The late Mr. Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 script, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and various adaptations of Agatha Christie, must be rummaging through his grave, wishing he could plan one or two real murders!
