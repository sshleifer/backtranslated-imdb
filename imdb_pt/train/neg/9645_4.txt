It's a bad season for Bollywood, with all the big releases, with a massive advertising campaign around proving to be flawed at the box office. London Dreams is no exception to this. Let's dissect it ... It's all about pursuing your dreams and how far you go to reach it. Sounds awesome, right? But unfortunately, the film is not. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to be great someday. His dream is to perform at Wembley Stadium in front of 90,000 people shouting his name. He is accompanied by two brothers, Zoheb & Wasim (rookie Aditya Roy & Ranvijay) and a ravishing Priya (Asin). Together they form "London Dreams", their dream band. After impressing the head of a record company, they become overnight sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya, whom he does not want to reveal until he reaches his goal. Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla, also known as Mannu (Salman Khan), a carefree guy who has no ambitions in life to join the band. Mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for who later Arjun is envious of the superior abilities of Mannu and his case with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to destroy Mannu. What happens next forms the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> Coming to the technical aspects, we feel only the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha that we have admired in Namaste London. It seemed that he simply visualized the script. To shorten, a glorified videographer. Suresh Nair's script dulls despite having its moments. Defined in a predictable way, the script gave him rigidity. The camera work was amazing in capturing the beauty of London. It's the only fun part while watching the songs. <br /> <br /> Few songs are humble, while others are noisy. Ajay was the one who stole the show with its negative character. Salman is monotonous and irritates him. Asin is forgettable and I do not want her to become big on Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive, while Ranvijay is strictly OK. It shows how the bitch is what we've seen in countless movies. Ompuri is in progress with the process. I do not want to write about failures as it will be a Herculean task. <br /> <br /> Finally, let me tell you straightforwardly, London Dreams is a soulless movie that you can enjoy better on DVD.
