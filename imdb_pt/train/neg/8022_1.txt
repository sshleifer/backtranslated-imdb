I see that someone has thought of a similar analogy, which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after I watched this movie. They said the ingredients were there, but there was no plot. In addition to the sexual scenes that bordered on child pornography (which I feel could have been edited or presented in a more suggestive way in the wild than graphically, I would compare this movie to a recipe that was ripped in half. list of ingredients with no instructions on how to join them into a finished product. From the outset, there is a lack of character development and story development ... unfortunately, often in this monotonous nonsense we are plagued with pieces of plot and we think " Ahh-OK ... finally we'll find out something more about WHY this scene is happening ... or ... WHO this character is ... or maybe we can finally meet and appreciate this character more ... or understand and get more involved with this relationship between characters ... etc. "But not so lucky! On the contrary, I was often tempted to turn it off more than once, but I showed it when the carrot was hanging, just for me he discovered that any mini-plot within the hatever mini-plot (and that poorly presented) was just a trick. Why I stayed with him until the end is a mystery, other than IFC usually has better selections and gave him 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). It's not that the characters are not pleasing to ANY degree, or that you can not identify with them or their human nature ... it just might have been a lot better with a little more effort. I realize it was filmed around Santa Cruz and I wonder if it was someone's film school project. I wish I could have given a better review, but honestly, it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half.
