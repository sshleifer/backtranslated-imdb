As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) watch this very, very dull image. It's Miss Dietrich's first color film, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is a redhead! Bad start. The story is a tremendous bore, involving a subject that annoys me hinders me: religious guilt. (Who Needs It?) Suffice it to say that of all of Dietrich's films (and I've seen more, including "Pittsburgh"), this is the one that even his performance does not deserve to be seen. The color picture is ok (this is a very old version of Technicolor), but without any purpose. Ridiculous foundry: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (said enough?). The only thing that matters is the caricature of John Carradine from a performance like "The Sand Diviner", which announces everything that will happen. The so-called "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever conceived. One more example of David O. Selznick's highly inflated reputation (did he make a really good movie? - other than That?) And to a final hassle, the MGM DVD soundtrack is a mess, with apparently randomized volume levels . Highly not recommended.
