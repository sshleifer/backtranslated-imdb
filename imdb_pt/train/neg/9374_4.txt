This documentary is at its best when it is simply showing Ayurvedic curators' offices and preparing for treatment. There is no denying the misery of India and the despair of its richest customers. However, as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general, this movie fails miserably. Although Indian clients mention seeing "aleopathic" doctors, these doctors are not interviewed, and we have to take the vague claims of their patients for their apparent value - "the doctor said there was no cure", "the doctor said it was cancer ". "etc. Well," does not cure "does not mean" no treatment, "and what kind of cancer exactly does the patient have?" The film is weaker when it shows Ayurvedic practice in America. having a high-powered job on Wall Street can make your stomach hurt.
