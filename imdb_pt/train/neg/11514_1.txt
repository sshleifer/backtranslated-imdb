Undoubtedly, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie were married, it was because they both thought it would help their cinematographic careers. If you went through the ordeal of watching "Swept Away," then you know that at that level was a game made in hell. After nearly 20 years trying to become a respected actress (or "actress," as she might have pronounced in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can not get out of herself long enough to turn it into a performance that anyone with taste could even call it decent. And that's what makes people not like her so much on screen: the feeling that her ego is so inflated that it stops her from simply letting go and connecting with her audience. If there is any justice in this universe, it just blew its last chance.
