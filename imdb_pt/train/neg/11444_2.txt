SNL is pretty funny, but the people who say this is like watching a short skirt on the SNL is a little dumb. It's NOTHING like the SNL, it's just stupid crap. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder, but fails. Although Jon Heder is funny at Napoleon Dynamite, Andy tries his best and people think he's funny. <br /> <br /> Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was decently funny with Andy was the pool side. <br /> <br /> They could have done the "Quiet place" much better if they did not make the scene fall 3 minutes in a panic. <Br /> <br /> The part in which he is pronouncing his H's is more retarded. They try to go with him for a long time and half the time it seems that Andy is laughing while he acts ... he is a horrible actor and does not deserve to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10-year-old comedy level. That is about half of the United States.
