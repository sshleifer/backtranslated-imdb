I was aware of Rohmer's admiration for the late works of those he regarded as great filmmakers, and which normal viewers generally regarded as artistic failures (like Renoir's or Chaplin's later films, yes, "politique des auteurs" also has its somber side ). But with "Les amours d'Éstrée et de Céladon," it is as if Rohmer himself wanted, by what may be his last film, to perpetuate this tradition of great directors, who made one last senile film, adapting "L'astrée" of Urfé. "with ridiculous aesthetic codes that look like a parody of Rosselini's latest films (the ones he did for TV from Descartes or Marx's life). In his version of Perceval, Rohmer refused to film actual landscapes in order to re-transcribe what may have been a classic depiction of the middle-age of things. The director apparently changed his mind when the seventeenth century is involved, and films actors, dressed as peasants of 1600 reciting their antic text surrounded by trees and contemporary landscapes.But the whole thing seems even more ridiculous than Luchini and his false trees.It is not that the story itself is stupid, but the way Rohmer mixes naturalism with artifacts seems so infantile and amateurish that it quickly becomes unintentionally funny (and I'm not even talking about the annoying pronunciation of the actors, the annoying and sad humorist tries for Rodolphe Pauly, the ridiculous erotic-soft tone , poor musical attempts, or the strange fascination with transvestism!). The radical aesthetic of the film makes it look like a joke, mixing Erotic-erotic Movie made for TV with scholastic theological discussions (sic!). At the beginning of the film Rohmer teaches us that the original French region of history is now disfigured by modernity, which is why he had to film L'Astrée in other parts of the country. However, I'm sure the film would be more modern and interesting if Rohmer had still filmed the same story in a modern area with the same narrative codes and artistic decisions. This movie may interest some historians, but most moviegoers can laugh at this latest and sad Rohmer movie.
