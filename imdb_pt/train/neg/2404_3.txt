Dude, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller of 'Friends' <br /> <br /> 2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita , Louis Nye) with this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The movie suffers from a horrible pace. He jumps in a confused and confused way. <br /> <br /> 4) History does not even make sense. Why does he want to break football? And the stupid song of the violin? None of this is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It's like a bunch of accountants trying to improvise, saying, "Look at me! Look at me, I'm being funny!" This was a bad attempt to make another "Love At First Bite". <br /> <br /> I like Larry Cohen's films, but he failed here. I could not wait for the credits to roll. Horribly disappointed.
