"The Fallen" falls under the category of wasted life (WOL). I'm sad that I'm now two hours older and not entertained. My other family members also watched this movie and made humiliating comments on the screen and cheered for the mummy. I felt sorry for the actors (Wagner). I read other negative comments and can not add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so that it could have a 30 minute slot on the TV without any loss of plot. This reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients, but when served it is bland, tasteless at all. In my humble opinion, the 42-foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot, taking away the mystic and replacing it with several people who want to denigh the facts and want DNA samples for malignant reasons. Heroes are discredited and thrown there by their faculties. Later, after all was spoiled by bad people. The heroes would save the day and prove to everyone that they were wrong.
