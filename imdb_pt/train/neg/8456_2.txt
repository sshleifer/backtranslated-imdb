I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I can stay till the end. It has been a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I liked Jean Hugues Anglade, but I think he needed to eat, like us, and so he agreed to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, and the rest can be called 'art' or something that I could not express but that I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I've seen was an accident, but I'm sure now that I have enough experience to watch it successfully again. <br /> <br /> Good luck !!
