The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not the one she had to face on the screen. <br /> <br /> Instead, the mystery is why this perennial disappointment in classifications is still in the air. This week marked a nadir for Veronica Mars: it was 146 of the 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be the Big 5). Yes, you read that right. Veronica Mars was beaten up by all the shows of the defunct WB and all UPN shows. It was won by all Fox shows and, of course, by all ABC shows, CBS and NBC. <br /> <br /> Now the hip-hypers will say: but that was a repetition. But everything on TV that week was practically a repeat! It puzzles the mind why the CW would choose this proven evaluation deception as one of the few programs it has saved from UPN. <br /> <br /> Clearly something is happening behind the scenes. Favors are being traded and influence is being sold. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation does it exist? The line "Veronica Mars has potential" is clearly dead now that it took two years to establish itself and failed to do so. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's influence and influence of Joel Silver, but frankly, I'm perplexed why someone would choose to spend their influence on a bad show that no audience is watching. <br /> <br /> A great mystery and a little auspicious debut for the CW.
