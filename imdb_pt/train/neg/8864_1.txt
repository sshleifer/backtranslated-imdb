After watching this, I had lost a bit of respect for Christopher Lee (that passed in time). This movie was total crap. First, they tried to recreate the end of the first "Howling" with incredibly bad makeup. So they try to turn it into a sad excuse for a werewolf porn movie! The plot sucks and the whole movie is just awful !!!! A brother of a werewolf victim from the first film (As It Was, it was supposed to be Dee Wallace Stone) joins Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, led by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked all the time. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth rented (unless you want to waste your time and money watching nudity.). Try to pick it up on the cable instead. It would be so stingy, it could really make sense.
