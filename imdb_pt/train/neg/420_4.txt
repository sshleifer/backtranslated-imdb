Who would you like to see this movie for? I would say: go! Without the narration, it could be a very good film / documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the story lines implemented make it very difficult to watch a skeptical person like me. After several animals, their lives at various seasons gives us the feeling that it is an animal soap we are watching. But the melodramatic point of view is not enough for me, in addition, if a predator finally reaches a prey (an exception there), the camera moves away or jumps to another scene. I wonder why this happens, if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairy tale remains? I think morale is important to the mass of the crowd, because after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
