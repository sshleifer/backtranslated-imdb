WOW! <br /> <br /> I just got this movie from a friend of mine, who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and he felt it was taken! It's boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the acting is a bit improvised, almost as if they did not have a script. Martians are CGI, which seem to have been made by a novice or a fan-produced movie. I can not emphasize how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: In one of the scenes, the Martians are torturing a local female in captivity. She goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a CGI copy of that woman. The change is totally noticeable, and when it is dead, you can see that it is a computer figure, looking like something from a game in 1990! <br /> <br /> If possible, avoid this movie like the movie. Prague! You can download two trailers from your site and see how horrible it really is!
