"Back of Beyond" takes place in a dive shop in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. What at first seems confusing is like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship is better understood later in the film) are racing through the desert on their motorcycle. He then appears as a terribly quiet and sometimes grumpy character in the presence of the arrivals. <br /> <br /> We know that one thing is certain and this is McGregor's kind of spiritual sense, his view of danger and such - his clairvoyance is only slightly relevant to history, most of which relates to three diamond thieves who break the car and trust Tom to help them get out of the way without getting in the way. Of course, Tom falls in love with one of the thieves, a young girl named Charlie, and suddenly puts the three allies already suspicious against each other. But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie seems to want to build something meaningful, but in fact it does not. Even the ending, which unfolds like a banal tale of fire (and that really reveals many flaws in the narrative), is almost as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It might be worth trying if you do not. remember the terribly slow pace, but at least you want something a little different from the usual.
