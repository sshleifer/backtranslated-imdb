Although the lead actress is beautifully beautiful, the plot is unlikely to be accepted because many disturbing details face the audience as the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> You can believe that middle-class teenage girls in the 1950s donated their virginity without thinking of marrying 30-year-olds they hardly know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> One might believe that high school teens are highly self-confident and self-confident when interacting with older people in complex social situations, but my experience has been, for the most part, very difficult for teens and act clumsily as they experiment in the adult world. <br /> <br /> You may believe that an experienced doctor does not know the stinging oder of Stroptomycin - the stinking byproduct of the fermentation of occupied earth microbes - and does not detect that some lifeless powder is false, but I do not think . <br /> <br /> One can believe that troublemakers in their 30s can get in, and stay inside, in a public school during a social school and cause problems, but I think that social schools are traditionally a protected environment and parents, staff and school staff would be around to avoid this. <br /> <br /> An end, throughout Hey Babu Riba, the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the quartet. There is probably an explanation why FIVE were FOUR, but as never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie did not seem true to me.
