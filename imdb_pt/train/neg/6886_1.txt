John Heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie. I felt like I was watching a bad college kid act the first time in a student movie. Anna Farris was par for the course, not good but not awful (plus she is cute). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in this movie (although it was also a bad judgment on his part). <br /> <br /> In all, I would avoid this at all costs. I'm glad I did not pay to see! <br /> <br /> John Heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of 'the dorky kid', unless he does some SERIOUS work on his acting skills.
