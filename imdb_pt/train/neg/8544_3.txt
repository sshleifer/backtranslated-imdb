I was never sure where this thing was going. These people seem interested in what is happening on some mountain. They investigate, they have narrow escapes, they leave, they return, they go out, they put each other in danger, they sleepwalk, they are attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes, etc., etc. The guy seems to like the girl, but leaves her unprotected countless times. She is withdrawn, he takes it back, leaves it again. You understood. The whole thing seems to come to some kind of sacrifice, I guess, but I'm not sure, or turn people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the impression is so bad that there are times when twenty seconds of darkness are not uncommon. This is caused by age or excessive use of night filters.
