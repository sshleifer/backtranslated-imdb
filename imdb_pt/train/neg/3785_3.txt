Spoken like a true and hard-boiled gangsta u'an. The story is no worse than any number of gangster movies, but never confuse this movie with Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It's not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is that all these Italian Americans brag about dropping bad gangster lines in an even worse accent. Pacino would have been great if they could just have nicknamed him. I was eager to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their steenky accents ruined the fun. <br /> <br /> Ah, well, the script is not too hot either. Don Corleone would have made it disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him all the time.
