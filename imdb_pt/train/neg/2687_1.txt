Eleven "big" filmmakers, eleven pieces of garbage. Eleven minutes, each of pure boredom, sophistry, condescension, self-indulgence. It deals with people of all nations. Yussef Chahine from Egypt giving a "hip hip hooray!" for the terorismo in its amateur segment. Across the green line, we have Amos Gitai from Israel using his eleven minutes to show off a terrorist act and focus on a spasmodic presenter. Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu of Mexico focused on the Twin Towers, but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn did not know there were no buildings shaded by the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring the whole thing. Claude Lelouch, concentrating on a case of trivial love and cliché. Ken Loach, from the UK, is focused on Chile. Etc etc.
