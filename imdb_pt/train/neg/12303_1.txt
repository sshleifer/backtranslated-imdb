This movie is so bad that it's good - in an unintentionally funny way. I could not stop watching, I was laughing so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, an oppressive preacher's wife who falls in love with Luke (Corey Sevier), a handsome and mysterious bum who we eventually learned was in prison; the only thing Sevier is guilty of, though, is bad acting! Remember, he is no worse than the other actors. You have the feeling that the actors do not have the idea that they are in a really horrible movie; they are playing right. Everything about the film is bad: the acting, the script, the scenes of love, the rhythm, the twists, the choice of the music. The climax scenes are so ridiculous - first the church shooting, then Luke's final words to Emily - I was howling with laughter. <br /> <br /> Evidently Luke did a lot of weight lifting and sit-ups in prison, and we got to see a lot of his naked torso. This is probably the highlight of the movie.
