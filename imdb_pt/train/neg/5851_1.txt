I doubt that Jigsaw was taken off even at the time, the whole LSD theme, married to a murder mystery, a seemingly obvious attempt to win a young audience of the age without, at the very least, showing any understanding of the counterculture of the sixties. Leaving aside the dated look, Jigsaw suffers from many problems including exaggerated acting, foolish and flamboyant dialogues, LSD flashbacks that linger endlessly even after the point has been hammered in the first 60 seconds, a failure to create any real suspense the plot real is, on paper, a great vehicle to do just that, and an ending that is so banal and predictable (not to mention a number of bad television shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it were a better movie, we might be able to suspend disbelief in some things that would help pleasure, but the weaknesses are so obvious that they serve only to highlight improbabilities that viewers might ignore. I've seen Jigsaw on television and it's definitely the late night TV fare aimed at filling the airspace and spending time to kill someone's insomnia instead of anything that someone should actively look for. At best, three out of ten.
