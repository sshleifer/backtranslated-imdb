This movie is incarnated, a straight 11/10 on the scale of falsehood. The falseness of the accents as well as the tightening of the spandex cardigan pants are just astonishing. Although the real Scotland is so colorful, if you go there, do not expect to get a chance to "dance" controversy with the locals. Also, do not try to influence local opinion through the art of giving a touch otherwise. <br /> <br /> There are some catchy singing and dancing scenes, but the plot is overly flamboyant and linear, and the dialogue is often very weak. I also doubt that anyone wants to be trapped in a 18th-century Scottish village entangled in the boondocks rather than in the gay city of New York. Perhaps it was not such a great sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon, perhaps he was just trying to get out of that warehouse. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the beautiful alternative reality view of what a parade of Christopher Streed in Scotland would look like with LSD. Also, I would only recommend it to the Hollywood musical experts.
