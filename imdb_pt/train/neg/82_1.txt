This movie sucks. It was really a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long and long story short, these people are "terrified" by this pathetic "mad murderer", but they completely fail to react anyway. And this is after they take a raft in a camp, without equipment, and appear in a camp that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and headphones of the daughters. In addition, after the boat disappears, they panic at being trapped in the woods, but their daughter's boyfriend eventually appears and apparently never consider that they could just leave the forest as he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend convince you to watch her.
