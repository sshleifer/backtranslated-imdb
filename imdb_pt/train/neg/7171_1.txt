This movie seems to be completely useless. There is no reason for anything to happen, as if it had been written by a small child who got bored in half and thought "how can I end this?" And what were Jared Harris and Christopher Walken thinking? Did they do it for a bet? I could not tell you the plot, I'm not entirely sure there's one that's quite frank, but if it exists, you have not registered. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she descends the stairs as she attacks, as you do. They go to a house with a very annoying little girl, they find Christopher Walken who unearthed an old woman preserved in peat. He brings her back to life for no other reason than the story continues and she shows her gratitude by immediately freezing him. From there everything gets a bit silly. A couple of hours of my life I would return!
