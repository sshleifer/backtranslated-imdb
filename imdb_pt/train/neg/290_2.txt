Killer Tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor - you love or hate it. I personally like this, but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone. The tomatoes are not the same, the jokes are thighs, even the actors are not so funny. Because that's the only thing this kind of movie should be - funny. <br /> <br /> So following the script made for laughing is annoying. They really should not have done the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
