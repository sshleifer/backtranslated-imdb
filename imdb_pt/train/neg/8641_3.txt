Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This mediocre mystery 'B' was one of five films released in 1942 with Simon as director. . Surely he could have made another Red Skelton movie or two in his schedule! Anyway, the Grand Central Murder is a shameless movie from the Thin Man movies, minus the wit, charm and chemistry of the protagonists. We are treated to a thin plot of paper that can barely sustain its 73 minutes, bad jokes and poor performance. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nick and Nora Char, er, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is a detective and she is his wife and research partner. They engage in "humorous" jokes with each other. Watch? It's completely different now. Heflin is the only one here who insinuates bigger and better things, even though he's very close to being an idiot in that. Virginia Gray was in Another Thin Man, but again, let me emphasize: THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING LIKE THAT, no sir. And in case we start to think that this movie is nothing like another movie (say, THE THIN MAN) that we really like, Sam Levene appears as the head detective who is kind of gloomy and has to have Van Heflin subtly directing him for all important clues. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Quickly, the 'murder' is that of the intriguing Mida King, who likes to trade with wealthy men until she finds a richer one. She is played by Patricia Dane, who is like a C version of Hedy Lamarr until she opens her mouth and turns into an F. There are a number of eccentric suspects, all with their own motivation to want dead Mida. There's the kind of society, the harsh talking ladies, the thug, the ex-lover, and a dark theater impresario (Tom Conway, here by the unlikely name of 'Frankie Ciro'). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous and agitated type, something I believe he has done before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiot cop who, in a joke that will not give up, can not stop thinking about the ass that is waiting for him when this case ends (Millard Mitchell, swordsman). Finally, in a completely novel method of telling stories, something we've never seen before, all the suspects are gathered in a place where they tell their stories (like flashbacks) to the detective, while Rocky takes mental notes, until finally a guilty person is forced to let out a confession. <br /> <br /> On top of the actual picture being a failure, I naively thought there might be a couple of rental photos from the Grand Grand from 1942 Central, but unfortunately not. There is only a very brief shot at the beginning. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. So, to sum up, a bit stereotyped, but Heflin was fine. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
