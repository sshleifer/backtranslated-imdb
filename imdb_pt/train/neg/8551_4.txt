It is 1982, two years after the siege of the Iranian embassy that involved the dramatic SAS Rescue from the Balconys, and a war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands that are currently taking place, what better film to make than a "SAS" Gung movie -Ho? - created the siege of the Iranian hostages while wearing the British number one action hero of the day, Lewis Collins. Play Edward Woodward and some other well-known actors and you have a winner in your hands? Well, maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while the acting is pretty good. It's like a long episode in the movie "The Professionals," but without the formula. This movie is not fast at all and is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this movie and decided to abandon Lewis Collins as Touted James Bond Replacement by Roger Moore. Watch if you are a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS in general, if not, save your time.
