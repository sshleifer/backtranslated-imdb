This movie was programmed to be a blockbuster movie, and it really is. This is the kind of movie that is made to eat popcorn and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind, the film offers, perhaps not as well as the ultra-guy Iron Man, but well enough. Out of the action of chewing popcorn and special effects, the film falls off the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. Many viewers, including myself, will complain about how most characters have been severely altered, but this only makes the film a bad adaptation, not a bad movie. This movie is unsatisfactory for other reasons. Creators focused more on making it attractive to the eyes than to the mind. The characters that were expected and promoted are reduced to appearances of 4 scenes. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Liev Schriber. The rest of the characters are thrown to the side of the path to make way for all the important eyes. The character of Wolverine is fully developed after 30 minutes, as is Sabertooth, although Victor makes some surprises at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The "final boss" of the film is a distorted and perverse adaptation of the film. original character and barely gets any development to show just because he is just the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a moody character who could do whatever they wanted and name a popular character. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
