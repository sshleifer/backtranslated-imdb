Salvage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a horror movie from the Christian Coalition. Okay, maybe it's not that bad. But it's close. Claire (played by Alicia Silverstone, Lauren Currie Lewis) is chased and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, who is quite menacing and brutal). I say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dream ?? Or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem with the movie is that these fifteen minutes of plot (well done the first time) are repeated several times. And as Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or an alternate reality, I stopped caring about what happened to Claire and began to wonder what the turnaround would be in the end. <br /> <br /> I was cheering for a session (which honestly would have made more sense), but instead got one of those obvious obvious by surprise endings (Think of the Village or Below) Yes, the movie goes into collapse faster than the directors of Donnie Darko cut. All Great Finalizations in Horror Films The Sixth Sense, The Invasion of the Body Thieves, Happy Birthday for Me worked because the public did not expect a field explanation on the left. (Even the canoe ending in the original Friday 13 was worth a jolt.) <br /> <br /> The rescue, on the other hand, screams and ends at every scene change. Other uncomfortable glitches are the only soundtrack to the piano (although the featured songs were decent) the obvious time (Claire washing the dishes, Claire's mother subplots), the way Claire says "hello is someone there" whenever she thinks there's a series <br /> <br /> Also some of the supporting roles (in particular Maureen Olander's mother who resembles a zombie from Mary Kay) shows the first time the actor has roots in Low budget. <br /> <br /> Both are very clever in half and are not so smart enough. Salvage keeps their interest just to see how they will fix this mess. The problem is they really do not.
