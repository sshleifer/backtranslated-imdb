I do not know what would be so good about this movie. Worse still, why should anyone bother to see it? First of all, there is no story. It could be said that even without a story, a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some kind of strong feeling (laughs, crying, fear, ...), but in my opinion, this movie does not do that either. <br /> <br /> You are only viewing images for +/- 2 hours. There are more useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I think you could say that the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it does not have it all. But is it worth 2 hours of your valuable time and 7 euros of your money? For me, the answer is: no.
