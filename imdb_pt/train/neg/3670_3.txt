For a scientific scare movie to work well, it must be truly original or very good. This movie is neither. Of course there is a pseudo-original twist in which the guy kills people because of a toxin and not because of an illness, but that's a very small turnaround. There is the angle of conspiracy of the government, the protagonist of the Crusaders who has personal experience ... <br /> <br /> And a real disadvantage of this film is that the infected man has no pathos. Although the character is scripted to be someone who should feel sorry for him, he is not. Without the pen, the movie is useless. The other characters are so cookie cutters that they're ridiculous. The subplots are complicated and annoying. And the saddest thing is that the film is too flat to be enjoyed as fake material. Make the movie a short 45 minutes and may be worth watching.
