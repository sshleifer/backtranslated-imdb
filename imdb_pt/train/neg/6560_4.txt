"Shadrach" was not my favorite type of movie. I found it overly sentimental and the acting was below normal. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some of the other actors did not believe. I also did not believe Paul's parents would leave and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a maid living at home. Their social classes were too far away to consider this credible. It seemed that Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. There was a scene at the beginning of the movie that showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was? Her son? What should the scene show us? Why was the scene included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was never alluded to again. It seemed free and did not fit the story. There were a lot of inconsistencies in the movie for me. The story about Shadrach was good, but I was not convinced the Dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed.
