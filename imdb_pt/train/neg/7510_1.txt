The film is a collection of clich√©s about anything out there. It has no focus, no goal, no real message. Symbolism is pushed up and stereotypes are plentiful and outrageous. This film can not resist the temptation to make drama where it does not exist. Every little exchange of words immediately turns into a long and unjustified dialogue that is so typical of a class rehearsal. Where there is no substance for this exchange, actors (no matter how good they are normally) can not help but compensate with exaggerated emotion, also known as "raising bets." More to act, for simplicity. The direction does not help here. Nothing can save this nonhistory. It is forced, faked and boring with tears. Imprecision in portaraying punk rock with The Who, piercings and flamboyant 90's outfits. The characters roam without a paper, detail and motive. Places are arbitrary. This is the Boogie Nights cum the Good Fellas cum Saturday Night Fever, with meaning and art plucked. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it. <br /> <br /> Some movies have flaws. This movie is Lee's fault. He's exhausted, like the rest of them. It became irrelevant. He has no more interest in saying. <br /> <br /> I no longer want to see anything about this guy (whom I will refrain from naming from now on).
