I knew it would be, but I gave a rental for a few laughs and maybe some nonsense fun. Anyone whose read some of my comments can see that I am very easy to please. I really did not think I would end up feeling this negatively about it. <br /> <br /> The plot is about an ancient army of dragons led by a huge snake that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes inherit the responsibility can? become one with ?? a good dragon? or something ?? I do not know. It was so stupid, I did not bother to try hard to keep it. <br /> <br /> It presents a really stupid story, full of ridiculous moments and silly concepts. So many of the events seemed totally random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I suppose there was interference in the studio or something because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story seems to be trying to be like this. big and epic but everything happens so fast and passes so fast. I feel like I've just been hit with a million stitches and action sequences in one big ball. The movie is like a punch in the face. It does not take long to establish characters or drama. Imagine the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy in 90 minutes? You could have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no buildup and you would hardly care about the outcome of these battles. Was that the case of Dragon Wars? 90 minutes of me not giving a crap, hoping it would end. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI with right direction, but horrible action, fast paced and stupid history made it very difficult to appreciate for any reason. I probably would have loved it when I was 6 years old.
