... there is no one else watching the movie. My husband and I went to see last night. It's just a small theater but there are usually a decent amount of people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the only people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The movie was by far one of the worst I've ever seen. Yes, CG was good, but that was it. The acting, script and dialogue, direction, editing, etc., was awful! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad it was, it reminded us of the powerful Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat and The Lord of the Rings. It was as if we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed representing commanders of Sauron's army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were ridiculous. You can not just introduce legions of dino / dragon / lizard things loaded with unexplained cannons. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but presents and develops them over 3 films, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The scene transitions are horrible. I did not fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was a very simple storyline, I found myself getting lost in the plot holes. <br /> <br /> The characters were American, but they spoke almost with broken English. because of the poorly written dialogue in the script. <br /> <br /> The final scene that could have salvaged some value from the movie ... failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died ... although he did not know her for a long time during this life anyway. He did not seem too upset to be left in "Mordor", not knowing where he was or how to get back. We could not for God's sake find out where he was or how he got there too, but if he was not upset we should not be either. <br /> <br /> Oh, and why the dress that Sarah's spirit was wearing looks like she borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... all 3 main characters of the hero were reincarnations brought back to finish the job. Sarah completes her task and moves on to life after death. Jack does it too. So why does Ethan screw up? He is alone without the girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help him get back. What should he do? Send out smoke signals? And if he comes home, does he get back to work? He should have received the same mercy from being killed in the movie that the other heroes had. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money on this movie. We only stayed until the end because we paid for it, but as soon as the credits arrived, we walked out the door.
