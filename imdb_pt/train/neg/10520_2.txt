Angels who got a little icky were banished from the sky and now reside in a British forest, where they seduce and cut teenagers. Talk about the high concept. On the positive side, this little mother gives us Tom Savini, but as his range of action is limited to two minutes on the screen, his presence of five minutes seems a little long. Angels run around the bare forest for most of the movie, but although they may have the body of an angel, their faces certainly look like Joan Rivers on a bad day. The mediocre acting and amateur effects do not help, and the nightly scenes fatally reminisce about Paris Hilton's most famous film. So bad that it's really bad.
