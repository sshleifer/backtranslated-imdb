Well ... I trembled, the original started in 1990 and found the film quite enjoyable to watch. however, they went on to make tremors II and III. Trust me, those movies started to decay just after they finished the first one, I mean, ass Blasters ??? Now, only God himself is able to answer the question "why, in the name of God, would they create another one of those dumpsters from a movie?" Tremors IV can not be considered a bad movie, in fact it can not be considered an epitome of a bad movie, as it does more than that. As I tried to sit down, I noticed that my eyes began to bleed, and I waited profusely for the little girl in the ring to crawl on the TV and kill me. Did they really think that dressing the people who had looked at the other movies as if we were from the Wild West would make the film (with exactly the same occurrences) better? Honestly, I would never suggest buying this movie, I mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
