Every year I watch hundreds of movies, including many low-budget amateur abominations that no one in their right mind would like to see. I have seen thousands of films in my time, many excellent, many forgettable. Zombie Nation Will I ever remember as one of the most irretrievably laughable horror movies I've ever seen ?? in fact, I have not yet recovered from the experience of watching it. <br /> <br /> The next day, it seems some kind of strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why do the police work in a warehouse? Have voodoo priestesses really recommended that zombies eat cheeseburgers? It's safe? It's safe? It's safe? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a 'good' movie, and neither would I recommend it as 'so bad, it's good'. However, what if you are entertained with the prospect of probably watching the most indefensible movie of all time? This is for you. Now, whenever someone asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I'll say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously? I think it's a bigger crime to make a boring movie than bad, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a movie that really stuns you with your ineptitude. He really is Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age, and I can not wait to see if he makes another movie as consistently ridiculous as this.
