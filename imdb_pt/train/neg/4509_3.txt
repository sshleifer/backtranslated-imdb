"Memoirs of a Geisha" is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a satire than anything to do with real people. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film defensively keeps insisting that geishas are not prostitutes or concubines, which are the embodiment of Japanese traditional beauty. But in addition to a breathtaking dance, the rest of the film degenerates into "Pretty Baby" in Storyville territory, or at least Vashti and Esther in the history of Purim, since all women's efforts of art and artifice are about much entertainment older drunken coarse men. Maybe it's the Japanese culture that's being prostituted, not just the American follies after World War II. <br /> <br /> It may be the pressure to speak in English, but Ziyi Zhang shows little of the sheer brilliance she demonstrated in "Flying Dagger House (Shi mian mai fu)" and "Hero (Ying xiong)." Michelle Yeoh occasionally manages to catch a glimpse of her guaranteed performance in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" (Wo hu cang long). Only Li Gong shows any real life. Otherwise, I kept imagining Charles Ludlam in various roles, or even Cillian Murphy, as in the kabuki theater, particularly as the plot dragged on a catfight after the catfight. The supposed love story has zero chemistry, mainly due to age differences, and I felt sorry for Ken Watanabe and hoped that his Hollywood pay would compensate for his loss of dignity as the mysterious "President." I remember more emotion in "Portrait of Jennie" when the young woman is eager to grow up in Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We have glimpsed glimpses of reality when the geisha pose with ordinary women as photographers. attractions, and how a timeless Ziyi Zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful colored kimono operation. The ending has little sense of normalcy. <br /> <br /> The score includes many traditional cut melodies, with Yo Yo Ma's cello and Yitzhack Pearlman's violin instead of traditional instrumentation, which are lovely to hear in accompaniment to lovely cinematography, as long as someone completely ignores the plot and rigid acting. As my mind wandered, I wondered how the great Japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story, which would probably have been more formal but much more emotional.
