As a player, I can not say I like this movie. The fact is I hate it. I tried to see him with an open mind, but when it comes down to it, it seems a bit insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> For me, there are several reasons why. <br /> 1. The characters seem unnatural. I have known many players, from all different lifestyles. I do not know anyone who acts like any of the characters in the movie. It's as if the film's producers have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all in 5 people. Most of the players are very social people, some with very active lives. <br /> <br /> 2. Style does not work. The mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject of the film. A real documentary about the players would work better. Although it is good-looking (I.E. together), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. Dialogue seems forced, not natural. It also seems to lack any real-world context. The players swear, I admit it, but we do not have Tourette's syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. The mood is missing. While self-deprecating humor is one of the pillars of my group and of several other groups I have encountered, it is less self-deprecating and more like bathroom humor. Likewise, a large part of the players' mood is full of jokes and anecdotes, not bathroom humor. Most players would refuse anyone who made such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: Accuracy. I do not mean rules, but they are dynamic. Invariably, this movie will be compared to the even lower budget films The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which depict players as real people playing a real game. The difference is that Gamers: The Movie presents a situation where you want to knock senseless players against The Gamers, where you can say something like, "Huh, I know a guy like that ... Yeah, that's definitely like Gary."
