They are showing this in some off the net. It sucks. While this is not as bad as the B movies they show on the Sci-fi network on Saturdays, but still a big pile of junk. The performance is passable. The plot and writing are quite below standard and the pace is very slow. Every minute of the movie seems like the part of the movie where they're wrapping things up before the credits - not the peak of the movie, the ending. Also, large parts of the cast seem old to the age group they are playing. The whole thing is predictable, annoying and not worth observing. Save your time. Nor is it worth the time it takes to watch for free.
