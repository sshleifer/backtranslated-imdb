Okay, first of all, I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I loved all of Romero's movies and enjoyed the re-make of Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard all the critics criticizing this movie, I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and although it may not be a particularly good movie, I enjoyed it if it were not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shooting with a decent half story line. This, however, is pure rubbish. Horrible dialogue, half-assed plot and video game scenes embedded in the movie. Who in their right mind thought it was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely) that I liked was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name plays originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a horrible movie and that he can do his best. Everyone acts as if they are Shakespeare. And I must add badly. Basically, the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a). It is a big fan of zombies and should see all zombies made or b.) How to play MST3K, the game at home. Watch with friends and be prepared for many unintentional laughs. <br /> <br />
