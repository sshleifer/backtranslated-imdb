David Arquette is a young and naive security guard at home <br /> <br /> vendor under the wings of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a golden boy, earning a big sale on his first call - to widow Kate Capshaw and her doped son Ryan Reynolds. Things are going well <br /> <br /> well for Arquette, he is appearing in commercials for security <br /> <br /> firm and he is falling in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> So Tucci and his right-wing wife Mary McCormack let him in on a little secret - they sometimes invade their client's homes to scare them and get their neighbors to buy company security systems. Arquette decides not to get involved, leading Capshaw to meet his family and spend his life with a silly grin on his face. Then someone invades the house of Capshaw and kills her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci, and places a series of traps, resulting in a weapon to the head of his boss while Tucci begs his innocence. <br /> <br /> Based on a play, "The Alarmist" is not wide open. The scenes in which Arquette takes the Capshaw to meet her parents are misinterpreted and completely bland. They are also out of sync with the character Capshaw is playing while she gets drunk and tells sexually explicit stories to Arquette's mother, Michael Learned. Other than these scenes, Capshaw does not have much to do, but she does a lot with how little she's given. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, similar to Terry O'Quinn, is a riot as the owner of the security company. He's an idiot who does not really understand <br /> <br /> Arquette's moral revulsion. However, when he turns into a weeping whiner after Arquette kidnaps him, he is hilarious. Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack seems to have been prepared for a larger role, but she gets closer and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds is too old to play a stupid teenager, but he's funny, especially telling his own explicit sexual story to Arquette. <br /> <br /> The script goes from romantic comedy to comedy too somber <br /> <br /> soon. Capshaw finds his parents completely unmotivated except to give him a reason to leave town so that someone can invade his house. <br /> <br /> Capshaw and Reynolds are in the movie just <br /> <br /> to give Arquette a reason to get revenge on Tucci. Arquette, who proved to be a good actor, is horrible here. He relies on the constipated assault that took him through those ads from AT & T, and he is not a strong enough presence to build this <br /> <br /> < > weak point. movie around. In fact, Reynolds could have been a better choice on paper. <br /> <br /> Dunsky's direction is good, nothing that will win an Oscar soon. <br /> <br /> Christophe Beck's jazzy score reminds us of the kind of noir movie that this movie tries to be, and it's really catchy. <br /> <br /> Despite the advantages, Arquette's failure as the lead and the schizophrenic quality of the script sank the film. I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, armed violence, some blood, <br /> <br /> strong profanity, brief female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual <br /> references and adult situations.
