For those who decide whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for an insight, I first offer these four words: Do not waste your time! "Chungking Express" was poorly filmed, crashed quickly and looks like it was designed in its entirety by someone in the queue of a Hong Kong Burger King. I do not remember watching a movie with a variety of one-dimensional characters trying to get their way through such a mundane script! It is an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialogue (a man enters his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that "tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to wipe"). The same character is also seen having a deep and meaningful relationship with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty clothes, etc. The shaky, errant, and portable camera work was another annoying feature that I could have done without. And if that's not enough to make you puke in your popcorn, we heard the old California Dreaming ode of the 60s by the Mamas and Popes playing the soundtrack again and again during a particularly long sequence. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his company Rolling Thunder Productions, although I can not, for the life of me, find out why a man with his talent would bother. He was known to have said, "I'm happy to love such a movie." Many of us, however, expect him to focus on making his audience happy with discoveries that are worthwhile in the future.
