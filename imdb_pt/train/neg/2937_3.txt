An attempt to cross to attract those who do not appreciate opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, fails greatly. All that is desirable in this film is opera, and it is better to find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who cures the throat, which has suddenly become problematic. <br /> <br /> Just because you left so long ago is largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has a stage presence beyond his talent as a singer, and nothing he does in that movie denies this view. His guilt lies in not rejecting the horrible script. Maybe because big operas might have silly stories, he tolerated this. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those involved? We need to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and banal. This movie is like creeping in the cold mud to pick up some juicy nibbles (the opera song) hanging above the mud. We have other ways of enjoying the great Pavarotti, and this is not one of them. Just take one of your many magnificent operas or recordings of vocal concerts and recognize the main tenor in which it is most appropriate. <br /> <br /> It would be one of the 100 Worst Movies of the IMDb if more people remembered and gave him some votes; it would fit neatly into a list that would include various efforts by singers, actors, models and athletes to explore their popularity through the movies. Often everything goes wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he had not shown such a superb voice. As effective as he is as an actor (the opera requires it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have rescued this turkey script. <br /> <br /> I give him a polite 3 out of 10 because someone may have become a fan of Pavarotti's singing and opera because of this movie.
