It's Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is harassed by terrorists and it's up to a police officer, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop this. <br /> <br /> A B-movie that borrows from other films and is very good with very good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these films) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as the cop and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like stupid B action movies, this is not for you.
