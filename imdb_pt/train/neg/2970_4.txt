I'm a fan of the Batman movie and TV. I loved the show (young and old) and loved all the movies. But this movie is not as good as some people expected it to be. In my opinion, it's a big disappointment. I think the problem is that there was no drama. Batman: Ghost Mask and Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker had a lot of drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had some drama. Also, I think this movie is for Batman. The only scene that seems a bit gloomy is the big fight with Bane in the end. Anyway, it's a Batman movie. But I would just rent it.
