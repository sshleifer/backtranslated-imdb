An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), Like a hot Charles Bronson walking around cleaning up the 'scum' that assaulted his parents, or grandparents or something, and impressing young chaps with his karate skills. In a crucial scene, she intervenes to stop a rape and an idiot strip throws HER into jail, so after some cool bath scenes and an aborted seduction of prison dyck she has to take the law into her own hands, blah blah blah . I think there were a lot of movies like that? The script is dumber than normal if you believe it. Mani is just the kind of showbiz that co-produced his starring role in Death Wish, and I find that kind of sporadically captivating, but the film is a dishonorable device. Competent actors would be squandered in the scandalous roles here, and would actively undermine the incompetent fantastic prosecutor and a judge who would have to be the producer's uncle.
