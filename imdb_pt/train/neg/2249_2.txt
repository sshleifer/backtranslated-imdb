This is a horrible disaster from a movie. From beginning to end, he is full of bad acting and even worse direction and editing. The only redeeming parts of the film are some Streisand numbers, because parts of Kristofferson are impossible to watch or hear. The main problem with this film is that we never see the character of Kristofferson in his prime or the character of Streisand struggling. The first must be seen in decline and the second on the rise. The final number of Streisand could have been one of the biggest finals of the film, if it was directed and edited correctly. The only framed photo of his face during the song was a terrible mistake. If the band, the audience and the big stage plans had been shown, that number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been directed and edited by an abandonment of a film school of the University of New York. The only thing worse may be the unfortunate script. The last musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even this is completely neglected by wrong technical decisions.
