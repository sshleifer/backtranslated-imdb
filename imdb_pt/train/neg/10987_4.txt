I really enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel, The Robber Bride, and I was thrilled to see that there was a film version. A woman frames a police boyfriend for her own murder, and her friend, a former police journalist, tries to clear her name by checking out the crazy friends of the dead woman. It's fortunate that the screenplay fixes Atwood's awkward plot, focusing on the story of these two men, victims of treacherous women ... Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I'm sure they're totally made for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my hardcover copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to carry the film. Zenia's manipulations are uninteresting unless we see them happen to a man, and a man's life is ruined. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories - to a man. Because it is not important if a man does not hear them. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed aside for a man's story. I do not normally look for feminist angles in the media, and I've tried to take advantage of the movie as it is. If I had not read the book, I could have liked the movie a lot more. So, if you like the cop and ex-cop, and want to read more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel if you want to enjoy a delicious prose and characterization subtly steeped in a storyline. It's the same plot: the film was dug, past and sprinkled with male anguish. It's like Zenia's revenge against Margaret Atwood.
