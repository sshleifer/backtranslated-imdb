Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. Since then, I have discredited everything I was told by this guy after seeing this movie. It's just terrible. Without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are uninteresting at best. Jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the movie (she looks good), but it's all down from there.
