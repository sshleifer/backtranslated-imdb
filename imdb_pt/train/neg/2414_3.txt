It turns out that I saw this movie on the shelf under "new releases" and found the idea of ​​a very interesting hip-hop zombie movie to pass up. That's how it was advertised in the box, and I thought to myself, "What a great idea!" Also, there is a sign of "Welcome to Oakland" on the cover as well. How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part only lasted as long as the opening theme. Neither hip-hop music nor hip-hop culture played a major role in the film. Having lived in Oakland, I know there are many aspiring hip-hop artists there, so the low budget of that movie was no excuse for not having a proper soundtrack. Any number of distressed artists would have taken the opportunity to contribute to this film. Why Quiroz Brothers did not take advantage of this is beyond me. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that happened to be completely black and Latino. You might think this would put an unusual slant on the movie ... but that did not happen. Somehow, Quiroz Brothers' view of "urban culture" boils down to shootings and dropping a bomb on every line of the film. The quick use of the word "fuck" is probably the most distinctive feature of the film; there were simple lines that contained the word three or four times and no line did not contain at least once. I have no scruples about swearing in a movie, but the feeling here is that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writers (also of the Quiroz Brothers), and the script was usually very bad. The film was generally a disappointment. It would have been interesting to see a genuinely "urban" zombie movie, but "Hood of the Living Dead" is not part of it. The characters in the film could easily have been white or Eskimo or whatever. There was no distinct flavor to the film. It's just another cheap budget film with poor acting, poor writing, amateur direction, soft cinematography, a cheap soundtrack and nothing to recommend it.
