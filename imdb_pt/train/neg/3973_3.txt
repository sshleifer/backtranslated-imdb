Acting was weak, but in a horror movie, I can live with it if the story is good. It was not. The initial event was a clumsy and obvious ploy to explore the worship of children by most people. OK Alright. Fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of ghosts. OK, cool - this will be a kind of supernatural horror story, with things rotting partially in our world, partly in ... wherever. Then the action begins to pull like a three-headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds - Is there an evil force trying to attack them directly? Is there an evil force trying to attack them directly? Do people do terrible things that they really would not do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber where environmental discord can reverberate in murder? OK, wait - maybe it's just a mentally entangled "Delbert" style caipirinha who misses his mommy and is in some kind of binge like a K-Tel Norman Bates knocks out? Ah, yes - extra points: the only Black character seems to be the grandson of a "Our Gang" charger. The actor interprets as direct as possible, given the bad dialogue, but the fact is that his goal is "All you did to get out, boss!" At least they wrote it smart enough for the GTF to get out of there. The part with the little girl being silenced and away was definitely creepy, as was the girl in the shower. Those were just two of the many really delicious nibbles in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways, like a steak bite, a chocolate bite and a bite of a Gummi bear. Each one is great by itself, but mixed? Bleah! Such potential. Wasted.
