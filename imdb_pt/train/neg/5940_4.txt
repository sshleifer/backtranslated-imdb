Look, I'm reading and reading these comments and there's a lot of what I want to say, but I'll try to summarize but clean ... First of all, let's all forget How bad this movie was made ... As he did not show anything about Notorious and I agree with most people here saying it was "Hollywood", I mean, what did you expect from a real life story? When people will wake up and see you'll never find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... It's all covered up and buried deep in the background. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm not against either 2pac or Biggie I love the two, but 2pac and Lil Kim FICO embarrassed in this movie for sure ... <br /> <br /> Next , for all of you who are saying that the movie is incredible and I can not see the truth, either You are too blind also see it because you think you know something about BIG or you do not know anything about it at all and you love movies of Hollywood for teenagers. Use your mind and see through the clouds ... There's a lot you could say when you get to this topic, I did not say 60% of what I have to say, because it's a very broad topic, but for the film I can only say it could have been a little, I mean, a much better done. But anyway I'm just a person giving their opinion .... No hard feelings ... <br /> <br /> Look, I love hip hop and I live for it, but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how anyone should live. With all respect 2pac and BIG like all other artists who make a living like this should turn to another page because you are ruining the youth .... Bringing the wrong message to the kids and this is: not going to school, but living on the streets, rushing and just taking the paper .... <br /> <br /> True hip hop is supposed to be about love and intelligence, being intelligent and all. <br /> <I know many of you will think I'm crazy, but this is just my point of view. Look, I'm maybe wrong about something and I'm not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if I'm in hip hop for 17, I still do not know anything about 2pac or Biggie, no matter how many articles I read or How much I support them and listen to their music ... Like most of you all out there. Only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this <br /> <br /> And by the end I just want to tell all of you, Biggie and Tupac fans and family, these two men were and will be the greatest ever, no matter how they lived their lives, but PLEASE, IN THE FUTURE, TRY BETTER, LEARN AND LOVE ONE TO THE OTHER, THINK GOOD FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT LIKE YOU, BECAUSE IN THE END. . NOT ON HOW MANY MONEY OR FAME YOU COULD MAKE AND HOW QUICKLY YOU COULD GET TO THE TOP, YOUR ABOUT MAKING YOURSELF THE GREATEST AND FEEDING YOUR SOUL, YOUR BODY AND MIND ... BECAUSE IF YOU MANAGE TO DO THIS, YOU WILL BE LIVING A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH !!!! PEACE AND LOVE TO EVERYTHING !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY AND THE OTHERS WHO MAKE A CHANGE IN THIS WORLD !!!!
