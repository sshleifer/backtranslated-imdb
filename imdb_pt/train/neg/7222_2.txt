Knowing Enki Bilal's comics for a long time, I had to see this movie. I thought this would be a good way for the artist as Bilal to spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought this would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I would enjoy watching ... I was wrong! The movie was a real torture to watch. The idea has potential ... but the film leaves a lot to be desired, and basically everyone who sees this film gets the impression that he could do better. I will not make any suggestions if you should see this movie or not. Chances are that if you're reading these pages you've seen, or you'll see this - but be prepared for 102 very bad minutes.
