I'm a big fan of Westerners, but this one here ... phew, damn it! I think what almost discouraged me was empty dialogue. I think I could have written a better dialogue than that when I was in eighth grade. And the poor actors! Given this terrible dialogue, none of them came upon anything like it, but ridiculous. Really, I'm not joking. Some of these things are a little better than the ones you would have in a movie by Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The greatest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably the "big" star in this movie that, if you called him B-Western, would be praising the film. This is what should be called Western B-less maybe. Pity Sterling Hayden, who appeared at other times along with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents. For him to appear in a vehicle, this poor must have been something he tried to minimize for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> One boring thing about this movie is that all men do not seem to have shaved themselves for a week and their faces are all oily. I know in the old west the guys were not always tidy, but for a man this is a movie that makes you just want to 'EWWWW!' Really, this is a hidden Western. Denver Pyle also had to live this, especially after appearances in so many westerns. Bad and bad movie.
