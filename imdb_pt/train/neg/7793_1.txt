This is actually one of the worst movies ever made. I consider myself a big fan of zombie movies and generally tolero bad acting, "stupid" special effects, an idiotic story and all that you can find in second-rate movies, as long as the movie has a good atmosphere / story / suspension or anything to offer. This basically does not have a positive aspect and is the third or fourth rate, perhaps worse. Some of my friends and I did a little movie during a week's vacation and definitely did a better job (no zombie movie). <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny, it's not talking about anything else. Really bad and redundant special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except for extra white skin pulled over their faces), MISSING fake blood (I really like realism, the combination of realism and Zombie movies being debatable, but the presented gore is simply silly). The camera gets quite long with feeding scenes, it gets boring and you can not help wondering why zombies use GUNS (!) To kill their prey. I will not go into the dubbing details (others did). Although I'm from Germany and at least a bit curious about the original version, I'm NOT going to waste any more time on this movie. <br /> <br /> Stay away as much as you can.
