If I had known that this movie was filmed in the exasperating and inducing style of Dogme 95, I would never have rented it. However, I took a dramamine to the seasickness and gave it a shot. I lasted very, very, very, forty minutes before I gave up. It's just tedious and pretentious boredom. <br /> <br /> The last French film I saw was "Romance" and it was also very sad, but at least the camera was firm and was not breathing in the neck of the characters. Time. I am puzzled by the continued popularity of Dogme 95 abroad - it will pick up in America about the same time as the next major outbreak of leprosy. (It's called Dogme 95 because that's the average number of times the actors are nudged in the eye by the camera.) <br /> <br />
