Spoilers, I guess. <br /> <br /> The absolutely absurd logic of the ending spoils the entire movie. I just could not get over it. And what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? If I suddenly found myself on a planet full of talking monkeys, I would be like "AAAAhhhhhh !!! Run for your lives! The monkeys inherited the Earth!" But he's like "talking about apes, okay, next?" This is very tired I would say. He should come across even stranger things on a regular basis. Also, this is Rick Baker's best work yet. This movie is a true testament to how far we have come in the field of monkey makeup. 3/10
