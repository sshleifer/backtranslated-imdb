It happened upon a copy of it. Not mine and if I had spent my own money on it, I would find those responsible and demand it back! All I can say is that this would be a terrible student film. Any understanding of the middle of the film is missing. To act is horrible, the story would have been rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as not original and lame, and the change of tone from the main character's reaction to the 'ghost' is laughable. <br /> <br /> I can only agree that the "brilliant" reviews of this movie are from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even fun. <br /> <br /> Amateur to the extreme! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
