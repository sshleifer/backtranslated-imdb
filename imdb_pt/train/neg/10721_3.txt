An expedition led by Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition. They know the beautiful and mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. They soon find themselves in front of a mummy of drinking blood ... and only Simira seems to know what is happening. <br /> <br /> A real snoozer. I got this on TV late at night when I was about 10 years old. Put me to sleep! Seeing this again all these years later, I can see why. It's slow, the mummy does not show up for 40 minutes (and it only takes 66 minutes!), The acting ranges from bad (Dana) to bad REAL (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood to be found. This film focuses more on second-class dramas (involving a silly love triangle) than horror. <br /> <br /> This ranks three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays it straight, there's a good performance from Diane Brewster, it's short and the mummy's attack scenes (all three) are not bad . They are not scary only slightly scary. Still, this movie is really bad. A certain fire heals for insomnia.
