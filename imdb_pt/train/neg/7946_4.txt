a boring word. <br /> <br /> the young demi looks good but she is pregnant (- point for that = D) the movie is not scary at all ... <br /> <br /> the first scenes looked a little bad , I could render better clouds with my laptop and then effects. but that was then ... and now it is now. some movies do not age well ... this is one of them. <br /> <br /> It's not worth renting or buying ... get something better instead of the exorcist, ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh, the part of the drama in the beginning, simply and simply suxor = D
