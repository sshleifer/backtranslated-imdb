I read Heinrich Harrer's book "7 years in Tibet" and I was fascinated by it. so I immediately grabbed the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it in 98, I kind of liked it. well, now I have watched again with full knowledge of the book on which it is based. and soon realized how wrong everything was said: <br /> <br /> When they enter Lhasa people begin to stick their tongues out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that it is the way to say hello in Tibet , then they greet each other ... in the book that Harrer explains, show the tongue is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty in Tibet and they can do it in front of the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for these two Europeans! not just his mother, but even the Dalai Lama himself wore spectacles in public. in the book, Harrer mentions that no one in Tibet wore glasses at that time (sorry, forgot the reason, but it is explained in the book too), the young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and how about Mao tse tung resembling, destroying the mandala in front of the young "living Buddha" ?? infant ... and the tailor made Harrer and Aufschnaiter Tibetan clothes not European designer suits! Why have so many events that really happened were eliminated from the story, just to fill the time with a fictitious love interest (the female tailor ...) that is completely unimportant? as well as the whole story about harrers son, rolf. not a word is mentioned about him or even any member of the harrer family in the book. but that was good for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about the person who shakes. it's about tibet. I am very disappointed with this "adaptation" of the famous book. and I bet heinrich harrer was also ... 3 stars, just for cinematography.
