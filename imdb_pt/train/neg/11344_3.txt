I was very impressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but this is possibly worse than the two titles. First of all, I did not enjoy the animation, much of the cartoon on Saturday morning, only worse in some scenes. I liked some of the characters, ie Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters like Cruella were mediocre. Cruella was really villain in the original, but she lost her quality in the sequel. What she said was nothing to write about and her animation was ugly. Also his fellow artist Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight. The voice talents were very good, but especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent ruined this for me. There were some good times, but the whole plot seemed bloated to me and highly suggestive of an extended episode of TV. All in all, an extremely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60's Disney films along with the Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give you a 3/10, but it was not my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
