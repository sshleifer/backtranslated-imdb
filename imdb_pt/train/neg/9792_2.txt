First I must say that I read the manga, and so my argument is based on differences. <br /> <br /> This anime disappointed me a lot because it eliminated the comedy and high-quality action of manga and OVA. What he left behind was just a shell of what could have been. Many of the characters did not have the depth that is seen in the manga. Alucard is not the nice character who secretly desires death. Walter's story does not have the betrayal. And the Nazi villains conspiring to swallow the world in war are completely absent. Instead, the anime provides Gary Stu's incognito villain who is defeated against what appear to be all odds. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not that the anime differs from the manga, but that it does such a poor job. .
