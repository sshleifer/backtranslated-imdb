Never cast Playboy models and bunnies in your movies! Bob Fosse's star 80 on Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to marry his SISTER after his murder at the hands of her poor husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the movie screen. Patty Hansen is also not an actress ... I was hoping to see some sort of lost masterpiece at Orson Welles, but instead get Audrey Hepburn playing jeans and a horrible "poodlesco" hairstyle ... Very disappointing .... "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit once. This film was reportedly not released because of the noise surrounding Mrs Stratten's gaudy death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
