I am a fan of Shakespeare and MST3K, so I waited anxiously to see this episode. I'll comment on the movie first, then the episode of MST3K. The recipe for this movie: Take talented actors, Shakespeare's rich and handsome stuff and a budget of $ 1.25. Mix well, then drain from all life and movement until it becomes dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a large stone cauldron. Film, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a bit of credit. Okay, now the episode of MST3K. I admit, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep in the middle of the road. I understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well. However, when I watched for the second time, I realized that there were a lot of smart references and good lines the first time around. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! Two views are required to capture each line. Take a second chance and you'll see what I mean. Episode MST3K: 7 1/2 of 10.
