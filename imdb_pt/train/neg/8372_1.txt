I can catogorically and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet it's the worst (supposedly childish) movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three grandchildren to see him and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the tortuous 90 minutes. The sex indenes will set out for another day, but they were as tasteless as the movie. They should pay you to watch, not you pay them. It really is truly horrible, there is no other way to describe it. The people who made this movie should be reprimanded for taking money under false pretenses. <br /> <br /> Applause for my spelling mistakes, but I'm so upset that it spoiled the time I had with my grandchildren.
