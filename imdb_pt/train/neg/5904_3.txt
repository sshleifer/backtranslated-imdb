With the success of "God's Army," all Mormons with a camera seem to be trying to make a movie now. In the case of the recent "The other side of the sky", this was not bad at all. This movie, although not great, was very good. "The Singles Ward", however, is not. Telling the story of a divorced young man pushed back into single life, the writing and filming style of "The Singles Ward" is, in many ways, very similar to the comedy of the '80s " Ferris Bueller's Day Off ". However, the similarities end there. While "Ferris Bueller" was funny, original and well-acted (as much as stupid comedies as this always is), "The Singles Ward" is quite the opposite. It's very difficult to be funny. However, 90% of the gags are weak or are cliches and jokes that you've probably heard a million times before. The other 10% seem to be played to fill the time. And the acting, while not horrible, is, at best, amaturgical. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you are not a Mormon, or very, very familiar with the Mormon culture, you will have almost nothing. at all. While "God's Army" and "The Other Side of Heaven" appealed to a wide range of viewers, both inside and outside the Mormon church, this movie is definitely a big joke inside, and even if you understand, it's just not funny .
