1940. - A visit to the Nazi-occupied Lodz ghetto in Poland, recorded by a German cameramen with the naive cooperation of the Jewish community, is combined with archive footage, international news clips and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the Jews of the world as crooks and parasites. This "documentary" interprets Jewish life from the standpoint of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A sincere and cinematic expression of racial hatred. I personally find this movie scary and highly offensive. We can only hope that images like this will never reach the screen again.
