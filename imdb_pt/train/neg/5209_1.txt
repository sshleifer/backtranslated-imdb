Ok, so I was bored and watched all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is lightweight, harmless and lackluster. The story is so sugary that it seizes the opening titles. A tail of two children "traumatized" learning about "God" the way of the fairy story that frankly left me quite traumatized. He uses Irish blarney in such a stereotypical way that no one expects a true Irishman to see him. Intended for children who, frankly, would hang up after the first attempt at an 'OIRISH' accent. All in all they pumping it.
