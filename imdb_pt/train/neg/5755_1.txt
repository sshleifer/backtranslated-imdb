I also saw this movie at the High Falls Film Festival in New York and I must say that I found a complete and terrible hole. Although it was funny in some places, the only real laugh was that there seemed to be a real plot to speak and the acting in some places was terrible and wooden, especially the "Lovely Lady" and the voice of the narrator (whom I have never heard of talk) had much to be desired. J.C.Mac was, I felt, the redeeming feature of this film, true action and determination and (out of the cast) the only real performance. I'm sure that with another cast and a stiffer reign in the direction, this could have been a decent movie. Let's just hope it's not shipped in the general release, or if you really want a copy, look in the Lidl bin.
