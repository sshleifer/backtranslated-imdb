and filmed in Vancouver with the "mountains" of South Carolina's low country visible in the background. For God's sake, they should have redefined the location. There are no coastal mountains in South Carolina. Period. <br /> <br /> Lame visions. They should have been beautiful. And the story limped. <br /> <br /> I do not really understand why it was a success as a book, although I have to admit it's a book I have not read yet. Usually I read the book and I miss the movie. There was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book, or even lend it from the library. <br /> <br /> Verdict: The Mermaid Chair looked rather shallow to moi.
