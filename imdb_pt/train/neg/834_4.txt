I thought this was a total waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always shows a lack of creativity when making "straightforward" movies - but reminiscing the original movie plot with a "new perspective" is a low of all time ... soon they will be releasing the original films with new animations and new songs and calling it "new version of the movie we all love". Nathan Lane, surprisingly, returns to his role as Timon again. Timon and Pumbaa the animated animals from the original "Lion King" world embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story of the way it REALLY happened ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah ... <br /> <br /> The musical sequences are thighs and the animation sucks. The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but again, when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane being on anything of real commercial substance? Overall, if you liked the original, you will hate it. It is insulting because it is unfair to children and adults. And that sums it all up.
