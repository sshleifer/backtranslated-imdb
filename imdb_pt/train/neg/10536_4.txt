William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director / writer credit for this fun, low-budget movie about three kids camping in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet resting on the fire and school jokes from one side to the other ... and a crooked tramp named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... of Leatherface fame) wanders and exchanges four stories of blood in exchange for food and the heat of the fire. One tale is the old retread of "The Hook," two teenagers on the runway of a lover attacked by a demented murderer with a one-handed hook. Another story has a pair of tokers needing to score some weed. They come across a guy who knows a guy who has a great # s. As they smoke a couple of bags full your skin starts to turn gray and green before it bubbles and falls. One of the best stories is about an unhappy man coming home for Christmas, who can not wait for his mother to fall dead and like to tell his nephew and niece about Satan Claus. The fourth tale of the bonfire is of a greedy sailor who arrives at the beach annoyed with an empty chest and ends up being chased in the sea by zombies. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets to the point through and it really could have been a lot worse. A bit tacky, but fun to watch, except maybe for the sailor tale. The acting is understandably not worthy of prize. Cast members include: Three Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
