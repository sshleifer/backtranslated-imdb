If you want to see a delayed homosexual karate expert beat up a bunch of tempting Mexican gangsters for an hour, then this is the movie for you. otherwise choose another DVD from Tray 20c, which is the only place this movie belongs to. the acting was so horrible that I had to force myself to watch it to the end. The cover makes it look so cool, but it's just another cheap gangster movie, type b, along the 2g lines and a key, bloody streetz and threat. I would not even buy or rent that movie, unless you're planning on getting stoned and plotting, editing, and acting really does not matter to you. is truly the worst film in the history of mankind !!!
