Daniella has some problems in her attractive exterior. She begins to lose her head when she discovers that a distant relative (with whom she resembles herself) was burned for being a werewolf. She gets a little fierce when she wears horny men and cuts her throats. She finally finds a man who helps to contain her inner beast, but when others ruin her happiness, she draws her violent and hairy revenge. <br /> <br /> "Werewolf Woman" is not a very silly movie, but it does like a good movie out of crowds. A fun time could be had by harping the bad acting / dubbing / translation and the simple simple cheesiness of the production. But by itself, it moves slowly, but has a wide nudity to keep it awake badly.
