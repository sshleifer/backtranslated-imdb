This movie is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to create a movie co-starring the guy who plays Lars in heavy weights than not doing the damn movie. I have to say that I could watch Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this point in a movie. Adam Sandler should be barred from any movie after that disgrace. Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and will gladly put his dick in the blender. Anyone with half a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a penny. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I would give it to the Lorraine Bobbitt Foundation before buying this movie.
