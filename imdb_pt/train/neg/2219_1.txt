Perhaps one of the most overrated horror classics ever made, Halloween features the memorable Michael Myers and a great performance by Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, its re-connectivity factor is very close to zero, as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent in apathy / culmination for real events. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can get away from microwave popcorn and not miss a thing. <br /> <br /> Because it has generated so many sequels, I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness Rob Zombie is redoing this. And generally, I hate reimaging. <br /> <br /> Surely it will more than make up for all the random gaps of filling time with some peculiar points of interest that the original lacks severely. <br /> <br /> It's a film that we feel we have to like, just as we are taught that we should enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Do not assume that this is a classic.
