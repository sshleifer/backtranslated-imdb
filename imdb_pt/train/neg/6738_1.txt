There have been many films based on the same theme. A cute little girl needs a cute kid to impress ex, pays him and then (guess what?) She falls in love with him, there is a bit of disruption followed by a fight before everyone makes up before the happy ending. .. has been done many times. <br /> <br /> The thing is that I knew this before I started watching. But despite that, I was still looking forward to it. In the right hands, with a good cast and a brilliant script, it can still be a pleasant way to spend a few hours. <br /> <br /> That was nothing like that. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. <br /> <br /> A protagonist lacking in charm or intelligence who could not ignite the slightest spark in me. I did not really care if she "got her man" or remained single and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A protagonist who, after some of his endless words of wisdom, I wanted to kill. Just to remove that smug look. I had no idea that leading a life as a male prostitute was the way to all-seeing omniscient illumination. <br /> <br /> A totally unreal movie, full of unreal characters. none of them seemed to have a job, they all had more money than common sense, a groom who still moves on with his marriage after learning that his bride slept with his best friend ... more "I would miss you even if we had never I met "!!!!! I could go on but I just realized that I'm wasting even more time on this slag ..... I could complain about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh with the name "woody" but actually that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the movie.
