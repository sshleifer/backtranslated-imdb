Within 15 minutes, my entire family was hoping that Goldie Hawn's character would die, or at least for the character of Steve Martin to leave her. At 40 minutes, we hung up. There are only a couple of movies a year that we try to be so annoying that we can not put up with enough for the story to settle down. <br /> <br /> I usually love both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. and I remember liking the original Neil Simon. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director of "What is the worst that can happen" and the writer of "Miss Congeniality 2," and I think that's what we ended up with.
