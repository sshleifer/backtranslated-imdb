There's a great reason why Edison went straight to the video: he would have landed in theaters with a thud. The film lasted a long time and was dangerously annoying. Just a little above the lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had two extra weeks before their next movies), the bad guys are so laughable and so close to the nonexistent performance of Justin Timberlake. I hate to beat the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all bad ... just mostly. I like the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be a chance to be the main man. He deserves. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always nice too (you can watch him swallow several times while chewing the landscape), and Freeman has the ability to elevate that movement to three stars (out of ten ... he's not that good). <br /> When all is said and done, the final mistake with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiring piece of pseudo-action poppycock that can not keep anyone awake. It also does not make someone give a crap about any of the characters. All in all, it's just annoying. That said, rent it when you are suffering from insomnia.
