Absolutely the most annoying movie I've ever spent my money on. This was a wrong choice for all those big stars to squander their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character has been portrayed in a less inspiring way. No acting talent shown - just reading a part. Alec can interpret realistic characters normally, Gwynyth has become ugly for a non-rewarding part, Annette needs to advise on how to choose the movies she chooses to play, as well as all those great stars that have left me disappointed with the way everyone allowed talents to be suffocated into a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment. "Running with Scissors" leads the audience to anticipate great acting in a movie that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion. There was not a time when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this on screen. Maybe it was the director's fault - whatever.
