I found out about this movie because the Jew Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it. Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to get in Hollywood and star in this movie. He failed thank God. <br /> <br /> The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbor Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin will not like her because she is ugly. The movie is bad for many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable, from the slapstick pieces openly to the serious, mushy parts: just that montage the three of them are having fun in and then the photograph. These two scenes made me shudder! Janeane's character is disgustingly arrogant (and guess by her role as "comedian" and real-life arch-feminist as well). She claims the film is "anti-feminist" when in fact it is only realistic. Men more often than not look for personality. It's interesting to note their hypocrisy as well. She was a feminist and "comedian" for years before taking on this role and suddenly decides after the film was bad. I imagine she hated the idea and script of this movie before it was released, but she made sure she was quiet so she could get paid for this farce in a movie. I mean, come here! She acted in this for the love of God! What this movie was really was anti-men, if anything. He portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Noelle, Uma Thurman's character. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things about this movie too, like the Ben Chaplin character. the British man every American girl thinks cute and Jamie Foxx is Chaplin's best black friend and of course Foxx had to try to imitate his accent a few times for good measure. Is this the best writers could create? They've never done this before, except for all the Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore films ever made. There is also a really horrible phone sex scene that is just grotesque and proves how cheap the movie is. The other reviews here say that Janeane Garofalo is not ugly, but actually she is beautiful. Erm I was watching the same movie as they were? She is certainly not a spectator and the only good thing about this movie is that it was correctly chosen as the ugly one. Although I said that, I can not see Uma Thurman's appeal either: she is thin and thin. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things about this movie if you have never watched: <br /> <br /> You will know what will be the end; <br /> <br /> You'll find the sex scene of the phone painfully embarrassing and; <br /> <br /> You'll be bored after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
