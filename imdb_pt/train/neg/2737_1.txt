There are no spoilers in this review. There is nothing to ruin. <br /> <br /> No plot, nothing; most clips show at least one attempt to tie the clips to the plot for some thin elongation, but that did not happen. Clips, three lines to lead to the next unending sequence of bland clips ... OK, so maybe they were short on production time, but they would have been better off skipping that episode altogether. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this was done, actually. Scrubs are usually much better at subverting the tropes, but somehow that's gone ... Thank God they were back in shape in the next episode.
