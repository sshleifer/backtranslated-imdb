This is the most confusing entry in the IMDb that I have yet to stumble. All previous reviewers act like this is the movie. This is not the movie. On the contrary, it's just a featurette which is an extra on the DVD of the movie "The One" It also is not close to being the 90 minutes that is listed here as. In fact, barely more than 13 minutes of how cool the Jet Li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the film. So yeah, this post on IMDb is a bit of a fubar. Do not listen to any of the other reviews as they are all wrong. You can trust me, because I never feed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> And that's the truth. I think you can say that I'm the "only" reviewer that matters.
