I watched the movie recently and it looks like little with the book. I blame it on bad script and direction. Some parts were forcibly introduced (the gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. In fact, I read the book after watching the movie and about 20 years after reading it for the first time. I found it difficult to read and a bit awkward. Many different ideas are introduced without any benefit ... in addition to sensational parts for the time. As it covers the material that was considered "sensitive," to say the least, during Communism, I can see the fascination it produced at the time. This is no longer the case, or I may see things differently now or a little of both. The film tries a lot to cover many aspects of the book, the result is a mixture of scenes that may make some sense to someone who reads the book. Even so, this is a movie that is difficult to watch and may never have been made.
