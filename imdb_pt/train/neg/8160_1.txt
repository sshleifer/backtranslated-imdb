and not in a fun way to watch. it's just bad. It's shocking that people have posted positive things about it here. the story sucks, the acting is bad, it is not scary, special effects are not special - oh no! the chalkboard has his hands coming out of it! oh gee - the mirror has turned into water! the hair, clothes and makeup in the 50's scenes are not accurate, and they have a middle-aged man with a thin line to play the high school version of himself. this is like nightmare later on elm street things. I like to sit to watch a cheese horror movie as much as anyone else but there are better baddies out there to choose from.
