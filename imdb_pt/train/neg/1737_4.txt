Ernst Lubitsch's latest film, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's untimely death during production, is an act of juggling and sophistication, romance and music, fantasy and dramaturgy. In a 19th century castle in southeastern Europe, a countess falls in love with her sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian revolt; she is aided by her ancestor, whose magically painted image comes to life. Betty Grable, with a long blond wig adorned with flowers, has never been so pretty, and her songs are very pleasing. Sadly, this script (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is replete with different ideas that do not fit - nor entertain. The results are beautiful, but not absorbent. * 1/2 of ****
