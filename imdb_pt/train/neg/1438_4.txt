Good! What can you say? Firstly, this adaptation is very long in 4 hours, due to the complexity (or lack thereof) of the frame. The actors go to great lengths to do something about this movie, but there is very little content for the time available. Swayzee is not really a Quatermain character. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," Swayzee did not really reach the note. This guy with the Winchester Replay Rifle lacks the strength, stature, subtlety or humor needed for the part, and is overshadowed by everyone, including the sorcerer, who, in my view, seems to be more compelling as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some of the views are nice, but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrives at the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible to the oasis, just waiting for them to enter. Exiting the mine leads to an exit (at the next outlet), nothing like the outgoing view of the passage through which they passed, etc. I was hoping Doug McClure would show up at any moment. In a way I wish he had. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians who chase Quatermain is a stereotypically evil-bred character who simply shoots everything. Swayzee does very well as the sad father, returned to London, who is unable to obtain custody of his son. Swayzee should stick to that sort of thing. He is not able to take the part of a brave gentleman with a strong heart, life experience and a sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Barely
