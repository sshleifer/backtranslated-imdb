Watching this movie for action is a waste of time, because the figures on ships act better than humans. It's a shame that Anthony Quinn can not convince anyone to let him direct other movies after that turkey. <br /> <br /> But it's full of fun value, since Yul Brynner has hair, Lorne Greene shows unconvincing behavior. The French accent and the rest of the big names stand out in the fashion of the comics.
