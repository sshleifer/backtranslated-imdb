I almost called HBO and asked for my money back for the month just because they aired this movie. I can just watch movie executives sit around saying, "Okay, we need to create something that's like the Home Alone, but we'll add a lot of money to the kid, hire the bass players, and yes, let's make it a lot less funny ! "<br /> <br /> Ok, maybe it's not the last part, but it's basically what you have here. Nor is it worth seeing if someone rents it. And like a movie for children? Forget. I would not let my children see this, not necessarily because of bad jokes, but because I would not want them to say, "What were you thinking of showing us that piece of garbage, Dad?!?!"
