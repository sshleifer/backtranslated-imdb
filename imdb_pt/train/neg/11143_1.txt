Hi, I'm a friend of werewolf movies, and when I saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves, I was like "hmm, simple and good name at least. Althou ... I wonder why I have not heard of <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie begins with breasts. Lots of tits. Breasts are pretty much all that budget for movies. Who cares about a werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots! <br /> <br /> So, about the mysterious character darkwolf (a little spoilers ahead, but who really cares ...) motorcyclist. Not even super-tough, but as the wise old woman says in the movie "He's so much more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before." Just describing her a biker-type tattooed face. Very original. I myself had looked twice when they first used the "bright red eyes" SPECIAL EFFECT! I mean my god, this "leaves-plant-red-dot-with-computer" effect has been used since the seventies. It looks ugly here! And do not get me started with the 3D-CGI werewolf. As said before, like a bad old game. <br /> <br /> And finally, how I like werewolf movies, like I said. They almost always build a werewolf legend of their own. Darkwolf also builds the world of werewolves, about some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient lineage. BUT. It's almost instantaneously after creating the rules of engagement "the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched" begins to cut randomly. What does not make the slightest sense, why even bother telling us the rules of killing, when they will not even play for them ... Aplus the taken from wolf point of view are made with a sony handycam or something of the kind filming mainly the floor and walls. Just add rumbling noises and you have a super werewolf effect. The blood is partially OK. But when the wolf cuts everyone with an open hand, simply putting a hand on the victims, it just does not do the trick for me ... <br /> <br /> Truly, WHO gives money to make these heaps of trash horrors straight into the video, they are not even a kind of bad movies, just sad.
