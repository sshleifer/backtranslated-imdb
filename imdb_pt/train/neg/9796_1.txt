Okay, I really can not think of anything worse than the public relations series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers have to be at the end of this list. Can you think of something more stupid than five and six teenagers (who do not even act like a normal teenager) dancing in identical outfits WITH DIFFERENT COLORS SO THAT YOU CAN SAY THEM APARTAMENT? Fans, have you ever come across a real person who is thrown against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting hurt? Power Rangers are for five-year-olds, and believe me, I never really liked this show even when I was five. <br /> <br /> I think you can say Dino Thunder is an exception. Teens really act as teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually acts as a mentor, or not, as a teacher. Has teenage humor, although the fight is lame, I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say Power Rangers suck, but I would not. It would be an insult to crap. So, face it, five year old boys, Power Rangers is crap.
