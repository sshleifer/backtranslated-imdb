I suppose the bad ones Laurel and Hardy are better than neither Laurel nor Hardy, but only badly. It's sad that Fox movies are the only ones getting a big DVD release, exposing people who may not be very familiar with L & H with their WORST things instead of their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again the boys are sealed. with a romantic and stupid plot about a guy who invented an invisible ray. He is in love with his boss's daughter, who hates him and prefers a smart guy. It's amazing to think that Fox's geniuses thought that's what L & H needed in their movies. <br /> <br /> Without your pancake makeup, the boys look tired and old. The only scenes that work for them in this photo are when they try to escape from the bedroom window at night and the bizarre scene where Robert Mitchum, being a classic bad guy noir, tries to sell "safe" to Oliver Hardy in Stan. otherwise this script is just a mess. Forget it and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump in Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert".
