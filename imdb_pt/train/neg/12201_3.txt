The summary sums it all up. This is far from as good as the original. With a script co-written by Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time, he was also writing Aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone. Sly was in top shape physically since he was doing this and Rocky 4 and he looks in great shape or up. to the eyes on steroids, depending on your own point of view or opinion. Rambo begins in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman, who asks him to go on a special mission that could pay him a presidential pardon. He finally agrees and goes to the training camp led by Charles Napier making a suit in Washington trying to pass himself off as former ex-forces to placate Rambo. <br /> <br /> The mission is to find out if there are shortages of prisoners of war still alive in camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking out somewhere where he had already been a prisoner. He is informed that it is not a rescue mission and is there to take only recognition photos. After a frustrated attempt to jump off an airplane he loses most of his kit, finds his contact to be a beautiful woman) and travels downstream with pirates to the camp. <br /> <br /> He thinks there are still prisoners and rescues one. While the 3 flee the half of the Vietnamese army in their boat on the river, they are betrayed by the pirates, but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to follow to the point to walk after their boat is rammed and exploded with Rambo almost Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned when Napier orders the withdrawal of the rescue helicopter. Of course Trautman returns to the base to reprimand him that no survivors were to be found. Steven Berkoff appears as a Russian Colonel Spetznatz and Rambo is tortured and ends up escaping only to be chased by more Vietnamese and Spetznatz troops. Killing many of them, Rambo finally steals a helicopter and rescues most of the prisoners to return to their base. <br /> <br /> He resists the desire to kill Napier for abandoning him, but destroys the Operations Center. <br /> <br /> A weak plot and a very weak end, as Rambo walks into the sunset as a free man.
