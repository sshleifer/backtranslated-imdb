I hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input. I know they are going for realism but to be honest I just do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can handle the low production values, hell I'm a sucker for low production values, but at least work on some good ideas. The direction only goes as far as picking up a camcorder and walking a little, but obviously I should dig this because it makes things so much more realistic. Hitchcock used to say that the drama was essentially life with the deleted bits cut off. I can only conclude that this is not a drama, not from a distance. We get to see Rosetta walking somewhere, Rosetta working at a bakery, Rosetta eating a waffle, Rosetta carrying bags from far away, Rosetta coming home, Rosetta walking somewhere ... not so much fun. There is really no deeper meaning. I got so bored that I started looking for some thoughts about life in this movie, but it's just realism, the most overrated quality in business. I think I should love it, but come on, there's nothing there.
