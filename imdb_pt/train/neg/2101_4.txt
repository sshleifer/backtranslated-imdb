Bernard Rapp passed away last year and was a highly educated journalist. Cinema was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a vast world-wide dictionary of movies) and so he should use a camera at least once in his life. But the films he left behind received lukewarm reviews: "Tiré à Part" (1996), despite the sensational performance of Terence Stamp, was very caricatured in the characters' depiction, "une Affaire De Goût" (2000) was a slick affair even if Bernard Giraudeau had a perverse performance, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another disappointment and "un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" is as disappointing as its predecessors. Their comic potential is exploited in a fragile way. <br /> <br /> And yet the initial idea envisioned a spinning spiritual comedy. A couple of Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain, who invited their friends, are in full swing in a lewd mansion. To play with their guests, they pretend to separate from each other. And things do not go as planned because the announcement of their separation does not surprise them. The two lovers begin to reflect on the validity of their couple. <br /> <br /> Despite the exuberant scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal, Rapp's indistinct leadership can not bring this game to life. unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well worn pattern with characters having well-known specific functions and masks that are revealed about who they really are. The comic, verbal, or situational effects are often insignificant. A bad edit narrows down the film a bit with this bad habit of Rapp to abruptly cut many sequences. Even the sincere contribution of the actors in the enterprise is debatable. They seem to be bored and recite their texts than live them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience is soon caught in a deep torpor. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate to say: Bernard Rapp's films have never matched his intentions as "Un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence" witness.
