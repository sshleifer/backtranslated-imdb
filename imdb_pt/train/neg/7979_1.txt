This film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted to the land of the ham. Redgrave's character was unpleasant as the 60-year-old woman trying to compete with Thurman's 20 something for the Fox character's love (why she's beyond me). The title of the film should have been "shallow people on the lake." The actors played as if they were in rehearsal. A terribly predictable end to boot. I can not believe this is on this site as a comedy!
