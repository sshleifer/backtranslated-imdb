Maybe I'm missing something because I've read more positive things about the man who cheated than read bad comments - and I just do not get it. I like my noirs to have a little style for them with characters who speak, look and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb. His wrinkled, curled gaze out of bed is the furthest from the bold, soft-spoken archetype you will find. Or, take Jane Wyatt as the femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miscasting I've seen in a while. She is not convincing on paper. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is tired and has no real surprises or something new for the genre. I could have predicted the outcome of the man who made a mistake after five minutes. And this final cat-and-mouse chase scene is simply bland. Ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined whatever rhythm the movie may have gone for it.
