Rob Schneider is a famous comedian, cause of his movements, facials and performances of "nonhumans". This time he's the beast. Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day no one attends a man who is attacked, so Marvin has to accept this case and save the man attacked. But on the way to the crime scene, he hits the car and gets really damaged. He does not remember what happens and the next day, his life is not the same when he discovers that he has animal instincts. Of course, we have our female that our main character is trying to reach, but her attempts are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character is fate if I could use that metaphor. Marvin should figure out how to become a normal human being again. By the way, your animal instincts, helps you in some situations. Schneider's performance is more or less. The film is so unreal that it gets stupid at times, but it's one of those movies, called nonsense fun, as I wrote above. So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider, but it's definitely not one of the best comedies of all time or one of the best movies that Schneider appears. He is a great comedian, but this is not his best film.
