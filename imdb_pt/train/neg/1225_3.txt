Well, let me start by saying how Hilarious this movie is, I just could not help but laugh at the stupidity of it. Do not get me wrong, it's particularly well interpreted by Bassinger, but the script is fair, well, the mind truly confuses itself. <br /> <br /> The premise is good and until Della actually witnesses the murder is engaging, but after that, it just goes down the hill. In the middle of the movie, the protagonist picks up her toolbox and, of course, instead of throwing it at the guy's head, she decides to remove a screwdriver, a monkey and finally a flag to kill her victims. <br /> <br /> So, there's the final line that I promise, if I do not have you on points, then I'll eat my own left foot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to those who simply want to laugh at a good, old-fashioned film production. I could also suggest that you keep an eye on the scene in the junkyard, with the face falling from the wooden plank of a foot, it catches me every time.
