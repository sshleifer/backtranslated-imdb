The plot is plausible but banal, that is, the beautiful and neglected wife of the rich and powerful man has an affair with a psychotic piece, then tries to cover it up while the psychopath hunts and blackmails. But what develops from there is stupidly illogical. Despite the resources that are available to the couple who have money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine seem to have only one domestic servant, his lawyer and the local police (who say they can not do anything) at his disposal as they struggle with suspense and terror. They do not have private security personnel (just a sophisticated security system that they mistreat), house or land officials, drivers, etc. Not even, apparently, the funds to hire private nurses 24 hours a day to care for the hero when he suffers. life-threatening injuries, leaving the man and the wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is portrayed as having the brain of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most unlikely and irrational way. The production is an insult to viewers who lost their time with this nonsense and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what were they thinking?). And shame on Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its audience by this insipid offer.
