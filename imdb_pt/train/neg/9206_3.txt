The subject looks very dated today. Adapted to TV from Rona Jaffe's book; we stumble and stumble into a fantasy existence. Four college students are deeply involved in a live version of the Mazes and Dragons board game (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world very deep. Your co-players should come to your rescue and save you from self-inflicted damage. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace complete the game's quartet. The support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this date, it seems heavy and meek. But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his "Bosom Buddies" salad days and his big splash on SPLASH on the silver screen. The younger the spectator will have more pleasure.
