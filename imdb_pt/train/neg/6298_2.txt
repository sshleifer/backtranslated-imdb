A terrible plot (Amis at its worst), meaningless and self-conscious 'decadence', obvious tactics of shock and jerky acting make this film (something like 'Rancid Aluminum') incorporate everything that went wrong with the highly praised revival of British cinema . Humor is at best flaccid, and the pretense of the whole set-up (including some kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, as a contemporary) really begins to squeak. <br /> <br /> Final summary - a half-bitch attempt to be "nervous" that does not favor anyone. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
