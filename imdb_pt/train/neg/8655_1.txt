What a terrible movie. He sucked. It was terrible. I do not know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from a critic with a nail in the ass. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh .. It's not Roger Corman that I hate, it's this horrible movie. Well, really? But what you can expect from a movie with homoeric computer graphics. What is otherwise, the CGI was sucked out loud; I hate this movie terribly. This is arguably the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably the most gay B-Movie movie as well. It's --- it's DINOCRAP! Sorry, I must have offended some nerds at those times. It's just a horrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
