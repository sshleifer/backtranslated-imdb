There is a UK edition for this show, which is a lot less extravagant than the US version. The person in question will have a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have. The American version of this show is all that the reality show should not be. Instead of making some improvements in a house that the occupants could not afford or do, the whole house is rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a bad welfare system there is in the US or if you beg enough, you will get it. The very common product placement that occurs, particularly by Sears, is also unnecessary. Rather than turning a family into a needy area for potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole rather than spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a home, build something for the whole community ... maybe a place where diy and powerful tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit if they wish. Giving everything to one person can cause huge resentment among the rest of the local community that still lives in the same dilapidated homes.
