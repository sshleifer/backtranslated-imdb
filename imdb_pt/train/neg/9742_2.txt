This is a rather boring film about a scientist who creates a teleporter device and gets terribly disfigured when he uses the machine to transport himself. Simple plot made before in the fly and others. It not only gets disfigured, but it can also electrocute people with a twist. What's really stupid about this movie is that we must believe that the place where this guy works is against him. He could probably earn millions for the institution he is working in, but the director of the institution tries to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way. In the end, the projected man electrocute three people for no reason, then goes after those who have harmed him.
