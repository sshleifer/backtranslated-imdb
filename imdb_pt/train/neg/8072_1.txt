(A possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is possibly the worst movie ever released. Nothing makes sense, there is some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. The whole movie is just a bunch of random scenes of things that do not really fit at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is non-existent, the camera work is patchy and the script is so confusing that it just makes the film even harder to watch. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to tie the movie together, but nothing came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
