There is only one problem with this site, you can not give a negative rating. Also, one partner rated it as a D grade movie. I say he was being really cool. A piece of wood could show more excitement than the actors in this movie, and the money used to produce that movie would have been better used to start a fire. This is absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life that any person who endure this untalented bloodbath will never return. After watching 5 minutes, me and the boys would ask me if sinking heavy would make it more fun. Half card and a bottle of 151 after I finally found some of this class G acting remotely funny. It is an insult to the whole planet that the director thought someone could find something beneficial from this, he should buy a rope. And for the actors in this movie, I hope you've been well paid to be in this joke, because I doubt you'll get back to work. In summary, I thank everyone in this 100 grand movie and 12 demerits points out of their acting license.
