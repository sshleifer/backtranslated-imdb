I have not seen such fabulous classifications in IMDb, but I've been seeing it anyway, because I'm a big fan of Bible-related material. The first thing that bothered me was a little too much from the Indiana Jones movie, but it also seemed that Casper Van Dien had not seen these Jones films (but he should). I believe he tried his best, but the script just stank. The song also tried to be Jones style. Great job, but for this movie it seemed like a lot of work, as the video part did not deserve all that good music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script was bringing everything down. "Jokes" are old school, somewhere in their twenties; They just brought a cynical smile to my face. There are some very poor camera angels, SFX seems homely and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea about the story (in my opinion, but I love those stories), but things just did not work out in the end. Maybe he should put it on a piece of paper when it was still fresh in his head. When I (in the first few minutes) saw the movie as one of those "low-budget films," I expected it to at least "hear" a good story, but sometimes the films disappoint.
