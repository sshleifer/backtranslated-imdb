After watching a dozen episodes, I decided to give up this program because it describes in an unrealistic way what is mathematical modeling. In episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, I thought that my profession was being joked about. I'm not a mathematician, but a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to the "make-believe" of fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even he would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model, specifically to try to guess what someone would do or where he would be in the near future. Individuals are erratic and random, there is no modeling for them. Isaac Asimov even wrote about it in the 1950s. Even if there was a model for a specific type of individual, it would be a probabilistic (stoic) model, which means that it has a good chance of making a wrong prediction. <br /> <br /> Second, assuming the right model for someone or someone. a situation is encountered, the model parameters must be known. These parameters are the constants of the equations, such as acceleration of gravity (9.8 m / s2), and are often not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses. And after the model and parameters were chosen, they would have to be tested. Strangely, they are not, and by miracle, they fit exactly in the predicted situation. <br /> <br /> Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not just by numbers, but also by science. -fi films: the computational effort required to solve these models. Try to have Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and find a Herculean job. Even though Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models, he may be stuck with hardware that will be awfully slow. And even with the right combination of software / hardware, the solution model can take days to be achieved. It solves immediately! I could use your computer in my research work, I would be very happy. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it's far from the best show. The characters are a bit stereotypical, but not remotely funny like the Big Bang Theory. The crimes are monotonous and the way Charlie Eppes resolves them sometimes makes the FBI seem quite incompetent. <br /> <br /> For some laymen, the program may work. For others, the way things are treated hampers the intake!
