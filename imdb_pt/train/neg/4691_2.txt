A real blast of the movie literally. This British movie is made boring. <br /> <br /> What an exciting plot! A terrorist puts bombs on a train. How could the writers and producers of this stinker turn that into such a dull story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, as the expert called to disarm the bomb, gets horrible writing material to work with. Of course, as he is called, his wife, Anne Vernon, is about to leave him. No wonder we have never heard of Miss Vernon. After that movie, it would be enough to end his career. <br /> <br /> That old man who loved to train and interfere is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I found it very insulting to show this man, even in the end.
