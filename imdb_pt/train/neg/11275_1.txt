This is a truly abysmal 'LOCK STOCK' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script. I have no idea why so many well-known British actors sign up for this garbage, they must have been bribed. A wrong start of a storyline continues forever and, if I had not paid good money, I would have hung up after 10 minutes. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, that honor goes to the truly pathetic bogroll used in a movie (I use the term loosely) GUMMO (I feel like I've processed that director's call for the lost hour and a half of my life), but this garbage is almost there. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. Things like this remind Hollywood that they do not have the really horrible monopoly of movies.
