Two movies are useful to scare people to God, this is 'Event Horizon'. One has a meaningful and moving message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious movie can get. Too bad that Paul Anderson went to the cursed Resident Evil movies, he really had something going on. Night Thief is hampered by many obvious attributes of independent films (acting, storytelling, dialogue and persuasion) and It is obvious what the intentions of the film are from the outset. The Christian film industry has not learned from the failures of this, so we're stuck with The Omega Code, Left Behind and the other Tribulation films. Their underlying element is that they are so worried about selling their message: "Stay safe, guys!" that everything else comes in second place to hit the audience in the head with a bible. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not believe I'm writing so much about such an ineffective movie. Hop over and go back to Sam Neil's eyebrows. 1 out of 5
