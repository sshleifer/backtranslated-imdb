Back then, when I was renting videos for free, I chose that one. OOPS The things I wanted to mention outside of the summary already given were these. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sickly fascination for food, was rude and unnecessary. 2: There's some kind of soundtrack at the bottom of the movie that seems to be there all the time and by the way I felt for days after seeing this crap I think they had something subliminal going on the track. Either that or it was just traumatically bad or both. Many times throughout the film you can tell the writer and director that they do not have much experience or talent. And do not even ask about acting.
