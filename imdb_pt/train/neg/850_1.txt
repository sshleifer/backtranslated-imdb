This has to be the stupidest movie I've ever seen (spoilers ahead)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The boy is strange and they move to a hotel because his father is his caretaker. We think the boy has a present, the "Shining." This gift has nothing to do with anything except to make the kid look cool. So the movie gets boring and boring until the man finally gets crazy. He goes in a riot to kill the boy and his wife because ... well, he feels that way. Why else would he do that? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the bathtub. The man kisses her and realizes that he is kissing a corpse, which is totally disgusting. Somehow, a black man enters the hotel and is struck with an ax. Then the boy and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies in a matter of minutes of hypothermia. Most movies are not a complete waste of time, but this fits into that category. The music is useless, the characters are sentimental (except Jack Nicholson who is a good actor), the plot is distorted and fits the description of the vomit, the ending is very predictable, the plot is slow, tedious and boring. This movie is extremely overrated. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. I'm surprised you got such a high rating on IMDb.
