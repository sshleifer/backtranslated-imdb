This is the worst adaptation of a classic story I have ever seen. They modernize unnecessarily and some points are really sick. <br /> <br /> Songs rarely move throughout history. They seem to be randomly played. The flying scene with Marley is useless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's definitely the worst musical I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is probably only considered a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic does not mean that some cheap adaptation is.
