What a long movie, meaningless and meaningless. I'm sure historically this movie is delicious, but as entertainment, it just does not make the note. Ralph Fiennes has been in some fantastic films, the English Patient, Schindler's List, but this one was so disappointing. She did not seem to be going anywhere, her character at first so shallow and tense that it amazed me that her "sister" had ever been interested. Do not bother paying to rent this movie, buy a copy of the English Patient.
