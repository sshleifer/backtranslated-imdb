As many agree, Origin is a beautiful anime artistically. The music, graphics and created world are gorgeous and really stand above most other modern animated works. However, if you are looking for more than that, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Beauty falls short of its appearance, and when it really comes down to plot and characters, there is nothing special about it. The action is slow and minimal and people are flat, cheeky at times and do not act realistically. Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there ... So in summary, oh my God, I've never seen an anime as beautiful as this; and oh my God, it's like ... -poke- people do not act like that. It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few steps back to times of bad characterization, and unfortunately, there's not even a lot of action to make up for it ...
