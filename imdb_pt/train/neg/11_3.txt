If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, there is apparently a movie called "Reload" in production (June 2008) in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all, how such a bad movie can win a sequel ... and second, Sebastian was not killed at the end of "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I watched it in the early hours of the morning when I was struggling with insomnia, and so I was going in and out while I was on. I'm sure I missed some of the plot, but overall, it seemed very weak. Large's performance was (to me) one of the strongest parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised by all the people commenting on the pretty girls, since I thought the actress playing Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.
