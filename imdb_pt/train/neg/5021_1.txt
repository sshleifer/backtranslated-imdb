This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious and the act of acting was a hindrance. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a movie school homework project, but it certainly played like one. It is not even particularly successful in its core concept of trying to appear as a single continuous take. Horizontal camera pans are an inexpensive and little original way of hiding the cuts.
