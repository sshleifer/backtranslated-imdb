Dialogue: stilted, cliché; Performance: hammy, cliché; Plot: predictable, cliché. <br /> <br /> What is Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this "B" trash? Plummer was well established decades before this movie was made, Kinski had masterpieces like "Tess" and "Cat People" behind her ... Must have been desperate. <br /> <br /> Bad guys all have bandit accents - * bad * evil type accents! (Plummer especially! Where * did * he learned to do "German"?) And most of them have villainous disdain as well. The innocent bystanders exaggerate enough to make you laugh. The good boy survives, among other things: * a 5-inch throwing knife buried in his shoulder - just pulls out and seconds later is using his arm without any difficulty; * Marines machine gun fire (I think someone referred to a .50) on the leg he separated by tying a bandage around the leg of his pants and after that he barely limped; * several fights in the fist in which he punches several punches in the face, in addition to being executed with the skull - first in a door stop; a fall backward from what appears to be the third floor to the paving, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other insignificant inconvenience. The script has exactly three smart lines, the rest time is all so monotonous and boring. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not all bad. Plummer brings a certain class to his part and is undoubtedly the best actor in this film. a lot, but it can make the villain insensitive without resorting to the ham techniques that most villains use here. Fie with his lines "Ve haff vays and meance" with some threat but you are always aware that you are watching Christopher Plummer acting like the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste of time. The acting, as it is, is a kind of delivery of movie lines from the '70s and' 00s, which caters to Bruce Lee's very obviously fake fighting scenes, but it's not even as good as Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee movie . Do not bother yourself.
