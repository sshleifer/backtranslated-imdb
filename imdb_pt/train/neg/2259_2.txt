For my life, I can not understand why they would like to make a movie about the "Jerry Springer Show". It's so incredibly useless. Some ways, unfortunately, is a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It is part of our pop culture. I saw this in the USA recently. Is very bad. I'll admit it. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant by acting. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is on it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover, Kid Rock. It would have been perfect then. So I'd recommend jumping "Ringmaster". Just watch the "Jerry Springer Show". It's nicer than that. <br /> <br /> 2/10
