I watched free money last night and it was the longest 90 minutes of my life. With such an intriguing cast, I actually thought I was in for a surprise - especially since I'm a fan of Brando. WRONG! What a waste of talent. It's almost embarrassing to watch at times (like the cattle scene), and there were so many missed opportunities for humorous mounts (why did not they show Charlie Sheen's character coming back to tow Brando's truck?) Ugh. It tries to be a comedy of clowning, but I was not believing it. Skip this one. Just for Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I'm giving 2 out of 10 because I still think the worst film ever made was Skidoo.
