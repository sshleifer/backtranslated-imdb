That's the best way I can describe this movie that focuses on a newly married couple who moves into a home that is haunted by the husband's first wife who died in mysterious circumstances. That sounds good and good, but what happens is an hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the funny things about this movie is that there is a warning at the beginning of the movie that promises to anyone who dies of fear a free coffin. Well, trust me, no one has ever accepted this offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardeners and doors being slammed. And the music is the worst, it consists of constant tuba music that sounds like it's being played by some sixth grader. And you will discover the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking. Someone dies while running and bangs his head and the police are never called to investigate. Yes, in the end, this is a slow pace (which is really bad, considering the movie is only slightly over an hour), annoying little tale that is easily discovered by the average person. Apparently, none of the characters in this movie were the average person.
