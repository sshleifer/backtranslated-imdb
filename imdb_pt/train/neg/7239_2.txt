This movie is heralded as a clever romantic comedy. It's neither smart nor romantic and definitely not an effective comedy. The luck of the well-meaning and pathetic character, "Tom," ranges from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another. The only saving graces are the competent performance of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we glimpse the pleasant face of Paltrow. Overall, it should be avoided!
