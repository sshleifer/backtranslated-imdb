The original "Cube" is a fantastic B movie, rich in paranoia, meat characterization and excellent exaggerated performances. It's scary, enigmatic and cool. And it's perfectly fine, by itself, without a stupid sequel like "Cube Zero." <br /> <br /> This third (!) film of the Cube series is part retreaded (most pitfalls are sadly recycled), part aberration. One must take the bold step of explaining what the cube is - something that was never revealed in the first film - but, as this explanation is insipid, I prefer to keep it a secret. There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside the hub, but they never develop beyond clues about some kind of totalitarian political-religious state. So the small social commentary that exists is flat and unfocused. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. The acting is purely amateur, the rhythm is slow (how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen?), And the bloody effects, while revolting, can not convince. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of a fan-fic "Cube", a sloppy clone and suffering from a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel.
