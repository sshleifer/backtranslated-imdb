I can not believe some people really like this. Still, they call themselves Batman fans. Even going so far as to say that it is better than the BTAS. Which is not. It must be plagiarism for them to use Batman's name for this crap. It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole premise of the show is "if you can not defeat someone, get a bigger gun to help you." Batman is not just about guns. He uses his batarang and hook and batmobile, that's it. He does not create a new and ingenious technology every time he can not hit someone. I do not know where the hell they got the idea of ​​a Batbot. as you wish. They ruined all the villains. Mr. Freeze went from a sympathetic scientist to an insignificant criminal who fell into something frosty. Catwoman is now a woman of 40 or 50 with a dumb fantasy. Penguin is now a ninja with a top hat 50 feet high. The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, making the doll the centerpiece of the character. They even had a stupid idea to make him a giant! wtf and the two worst character changes are that of The Joker and Riddler. they changed the Riddler to a gothic / retro teen freak. and the Joker for an acrobat with dreadlocks. He looks like a bob marley wannabe. They have completely and utterly ruined Batman even more than B & R did! I wish I could find the creators and / or writers and animators of this show so I could hit their heads with a metal baseball bat.
