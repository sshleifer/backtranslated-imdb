(NOTE: I thought I'd be the one to write down what I did below, but I see the others here agreeing.) I think it was pretty obvious - that was overdoing the bait-the-cat part. what I had written :) <br /> <br /> The owners went on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cat (Sylvester) alone and locked in the house. That means there is no milk, but the cat, to its relief, finds a lot of tinned tuna. However, to his amazement, he can not find the opener. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the house mouse has it ... and attacks the cat with it. This is a medium rodent that continues to provoke Sylvester with the opener and then pulling it at the last second. Sylvester tries everything to open the tuna can, but he can not. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story, and why they make the sadistic mouse the "good guy" is beyond me. It's like some of Tom and Jerry's drawings, where poor Tom always gets the worst, though the mouse often starts the conflict!
