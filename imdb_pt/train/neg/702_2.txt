Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines on this sleepy slasher, and the light disappears quickly. If not her, than another reason to watch this. Five college students signed up to prepare an old dormitory for their demolition date. Problems are occurring automatically when a homeless stranger is requesting, and the group has few people. Then a murderer is on the loose. I honestly wanted to say that I would enjoy it. It had a fair mount, or maybe it was just Daphne Zuniga. The movie is very slow and almost as silent as a library. Most of the acting is below average, and the moments of the "point of view" are so old news. Acclaimed composer Christopher Young, from films such as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment", marked this in a repetitive line that was best made for a TV movie. Still, it looks bigger than the movie deserves. Then, besides Young and Zuniga, this one shaves the bottom of the barrel.
