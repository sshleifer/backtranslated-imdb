1. Aliens resemble plush toys and hand puppets, while they have arms that do not work. <br /> <br /> 2. The aliens dominate the intergalactic space travel, but they do not know how to open an open safe door, but they can open a door being closed by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. Former security guards know how to get hold of the C4, and are just waiting for the right time to use it, say, when they are suddenly fired for no explainable reason. <br /> <br /> 4. Apparently, the US Army training camp in the 1980s involved several "gardening tools" sessions, including the death pirouette. <br /> <br /> 5. To impress your sweet girlfriend, you have to "save the world ... err ... neighborhood" of the aliens. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are vagabonds, openly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Evening nightclubs look like bad diners. <br /> <br /> 8. The "scoffing" waitresses are double as dancers of The Fontanelles (how they were convinced of this?), who can only do bad dance moves of the 60s. 9. The secret military dreams of being Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. The grenades seem to have a "flash-bang" scenario. <br /> <br /> 11. Being burned alive apparently leaves only one with small burns on the arms. <br /> <br /> 12. It seems that the US Army Sergeants are always in the area and do nothing about aliens in the area. <br /> <br /> 13. Aliens seemingly always "go home," meaning that back to the safe they were unlocked. <br /> <br /> 14. Aliens are attracted by bright lights, which apparently means that in the Los Angeles area, the protagonist's home is the brightest in the area. <br /> <br /> 15. Showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the public cry for more. <br /> <br /> 16. Vans of the 80's seem to have horrible suspension systems. <br /> <br /> 17. Comedy should happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 18. The horror must happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 19. Parodies and tributes should happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 20. This movie cures insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Apparently gardening tools make electronic keyboard noises whenever they are used, not just in fights (tell me I'm not the only one who noticed this). <br /> <br /> The simple truth is that this movie just went wrong. Period. There is not much meat on the bone, nor does anything really good. Same average. Is bad. However, I've seen much worse, and the rake fight scene is pure gold comedy, intentional or not. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse than that. At least the film was never taken seriously.
