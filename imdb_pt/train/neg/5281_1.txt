The mood in Who's Your Daddy is so bad that I actually closed my eyes on certain scenes. Close ups of semen are not funny! Nobody thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so disgusting and to hide their nervousness, they laugh. Watching who your father gave me was a disgusting nervous feeling.
