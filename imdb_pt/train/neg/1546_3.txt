I rented this movie for a few laughs. I had never seen SNL, but with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, it could not have been so bad, could it? The answer: it was. This film was hardly a way to relax after a hard day at work. I just kept waiting for a plot and a funny part, but there was none. The highlight was thieson amber tiffany, and that's just about it.
