A boy sees his mother being killed and his father hanging himself. 20 years later, he gets a lot of friends to perform an exorcism on himself, so he is not like the father. All the characters of the actions are in place: the beautiful couple; the "funny" face; the tough (but sensitive) hood; the smart girl (she wears glasses - that's how we know); the nerd and two blondes with no personality. It all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes alive (do not ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when, after a big opening scene, we jumped for 20 years later - ALL bad horror movies do that! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is atrocious, the acting is bad (except Betsy). Palmer - why Betsy?) And the murders are stupid and / or unimaginative. My favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy out of the bed to show that he is fully dressed! A real incoherent and stupid horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
