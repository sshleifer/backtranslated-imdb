I made a special effort to see this film and was totally disappointed with the result. On paper, the script looks promising, and the choice of actors leaves one with hope - I liked Pacino in Scent of a Woman and saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other 70/80 films. But I had forgotten how much dialogue a part can be important in a movie, and in this movie they are absolute ..... rubbish! The filming locations were also attractive, but the desperate, pretentious and forced dialogues took the whole thing to a level below zero. In addition, I am quite allergic to the world of motorsport and I have no interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in "Love Story" were better than the ones in this movie (and that's saying something !!). I was really expecting better from this movie and was very disappointed to have been disappointed.
