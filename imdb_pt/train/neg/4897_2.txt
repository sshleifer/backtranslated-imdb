This movie comes as the final defeat in Tsai Ming-Liang to me. He exudes the laziness of all his pictures. So I will not analyze it completely either. But some observations: 1. If the premise is drought, why can we see landscapes of the city with flowering green trees? I wonder if this should mean anything in the metaphorical context of the film (where thirst notifies desire for intimacy and watermelon, trivial substitute, sex). Or it's just a matter of making bad movies, not giving a damn about being consistent. <br /> <br /> 2. We do not know what happened to the porn actress because she's unconscious or presumably dead. It seems an unimportant matter as long as the message of supreme alienation succeeds (bombastically), but in retrospect, its inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical trick, a pretext? as free and exploitative as the activity in which it is employed. <br /> <br /> 3. Is not anything expressed in this film that Antonioni has not expressed better 40 years ago? and without unnecessarily humiliating its actors. <br /> <br /> 4. The musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') looked like the idea of ​​an artistic counterpoint to a secondary student, executed at that same high school skill level. If that was the point, the point sucked.
