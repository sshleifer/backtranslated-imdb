I was forced to watch the movie for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I got paid), but I still found the film much more than average. The jokes were idiots, the two main actresses ... well, to use the "First Wives Club" division of the women's era in Hollywood, they are no longer the "hotties" age, but more in the age "searcher". What irritated me most about the movie was the main plot, which practically plagiarized "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(in which the boys are excited about some guy offering them money to "make the wife" without realizing it is expected to assassinate her). All in all, a lousy piece of crap.
