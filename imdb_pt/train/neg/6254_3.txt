A friend of mine was in the cast as an agent of the FEDS (a part that does not speak, if I remember correctly). He brought it on DVD so I could watch. It was "interesting," but it looked like an amateur movie. An amateur movie well done, though. Really annoying and poorly written. It was probably fun to do and be involved, but it definitely did not deserve any kind of ample release. Maybe in Omaha they liked it, but this California girl was bored and honestly half embarrassed by my friend's involvement. <br /> <br /> If this filmmaker made or makes more movies, he really should try to have a really interesting story and GOOD actors. I'm sure this was a great learning tool for them. I wish them good luck in the future and hope they can improve their film production.
