Full marks for the content of this film, as a Brit I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during World War II. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction is non-existent, the acting is wood and the script is just a clich√© after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I sat down and cringed from the beginning to the end, in the very bad way this had been set up. This could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way it was set up. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been wasted on a misdirected, low-budget film. I just hope that sometime in the future, one of the biggest studios will accept this theme and do justice to it.
