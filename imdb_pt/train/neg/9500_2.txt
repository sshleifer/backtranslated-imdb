This movie is really bad. The acting is horrible except for Michael Ironside. I did not understand the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc-gangs. He arrives in a town and is suddenly chosen to fight bad people who want to have indigenous lands. On the cover, he said that he was an Indian who also returned to his hometown, I did not hear it in the film, if it is, it was not clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco was a hell of a bad actor. Stiff and ugly. He said his lines too. And we do not talk about Sean Young, she has not been one of my favorites, but in this movie she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She's horrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented, I chose between this one and the Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I chose this one because Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this, unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorcycle with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> Soon I will increase the cast list because I have at home. I wrote it after watching the movie.
