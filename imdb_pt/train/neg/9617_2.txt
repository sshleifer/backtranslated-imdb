Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) was partying on the lake with her friends when her brother fell off a boat and drowned. Rachel's friends think it's time she stopped blaming herself for something she had no control over. Then get the drink and something to chew and go back to the same lake that is in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, a bloodbath has already begun when two of the friends are splashed before even going to the party. This movie has the feel of a high school play where everyone forgot their lines and 'flew' ... really bad! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself the burlyest role of being Rachel's boyfriend, Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel, there's a very lame acting and some characters you'd like to stifle before they're "run". Giving attention to more players who had the courage to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is a MEMORIAL DAY that you would not mind losing.
