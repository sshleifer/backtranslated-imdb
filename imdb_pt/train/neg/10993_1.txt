Of course, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we actually like them, however, it was not a guilty pleasure at all, it was just crap. One guy, vince offer, who is convinced enough to become the main character while probably getting drunk / high - probably both - and thought it was a great idea to make a movie. He then began to show his script to equally tall / drunk individuals. Overall, this movie was so bad, predictable and unoriginal that I could not get through 20 minutes before turning it off. That makes You Got Served look like Citizen Kane. Bat Man? WTF ... A guy who walks around with a bat, very original. Almost as good as calling him Fat Man, and having a fat guy walking in a superhero costume.
