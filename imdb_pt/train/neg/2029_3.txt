I do not see enough TV shows to understand the attraction of SHOW ME THE MONEY, but I suppose it has some appeal to less demanding audiences. Ostensibly a question-and-answer program, gives participants huge amounts of money to answer a few simple questions. However, their test elements play only a small role in the process, which I find tortuously complicated. For example, before answering a question, a contestant selects which question should be asked by choosing between random options "A", "B" or "C". Is this for any other purpose that does not slow down the game? It would be much faster to simply start with "A." Participants can ask questions but must answer one of three questions in each category. After answering a question, the competitor is asked to "lock" the answer - another delay tactic. The competitor's next task is to name which woman of about a dozen dancers in cages is to reveal a letter that indicates how much the question is worth. A correct answer adds the card's dollar figure to the total of competitive races; a wrong answer subtracts the same sum. This time-consuming stage really has some entertaining value, as it allows the audience to closely watch the half-naked, uniformly beautiful dancers. Meanwhile, the competitor is reminded that an unfortunate selection of "killer card" will end the game instantly. This naturally makes the competitor sweat and causes further delays while the nervous contender contemplates the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is that the possibility of a sudden disaster is the appeal of the program's main audience. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the whole process is further delayed by many empty jokes between presenter William Shatner and the competitor, along with occasional routines by caged dancers. All of these delays run out so long that it may be possible for the audience to forget what the original question is when the correct answer is revealed. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute episode of JEOPARDY often passes up to 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM I watched went through just six questions (many of which belonged to other TV shows). No one in their right mind would attend this program because it is fun to play together by answering questions at home. This leaves three possible reasons to watch the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how a competitor responds to being about to earn up to a million dollars, only to lose everything at once. <br /> <br /> B. Look at beautiful young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines. <br /> <br /> C. To appreciate William Shatner's glittering jokes. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but women are not on camera long enough to justify suffering for an hour of this show.
