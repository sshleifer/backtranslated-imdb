I am completely stumped on why this film is even appreciated, much less held in such high regard, especially by so many critics who otherwise are quite sensible. <br /> <br /> There is a key word that describes this. film at its core - irritating. The most easily explained example of this is the use of the director - or, more precisely, abuse - of music. In the first half, a really dull reggae song is played about three times (when it is very frequent once). But in the second half, "Mommas and the Popes" "California Dreamin '" is played at least seven times, usually at maximum volume. Godsakes, whether you liked the song or not beforehand, you'd be pretty tired of it until the end. Just think, some people claim to have seen this movie four or five times. That means they've heard the California Dreamin 28 or 35 times ... <br /> <br /> All this unnecessary hyper-repetition (nothing contributes to the story) could be waived if the remainder of the film had some prolonged merit, or if the story somehow involved. <br /> <br /> But it is not. <br /> <br /> The only aspect that I found pleasant was that Bridgette Lin was walking around. and still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. Even this quickly dissipated. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the undeserved reputation of this movie will convince many freaks to come and see it. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you've never seen a HK movie before, do not start with this one. <br /> <br /> If you feel compelled to watch it, avoid at all costs seeing it in a movie theater. Fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here. <br /> <br /> You've been warned!
