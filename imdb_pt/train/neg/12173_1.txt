Me and my friend rented this movie for $ 2.50. And we both agreed on one thing: THIS IS THE WORST FILM NEVER MADE! <br /> <br /> Also my friend and I counted 475 face pictures. (Which makes up 95% of the film). <br /> <br /> So, in other words: SEE THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WASTE MONEY! And I do! <br /> <br />
