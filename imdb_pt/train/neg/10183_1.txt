This is a very terrible production. The general consensus has always been that although Princess Margaret might have been spoiled and spoiled and may have revealed the excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest point of the production, the actress failed to do so. It also seemed that the production budget could not be extended to a hairdresser - from the outset, the hairs of Princess Margaret's character had a bird's nest that looked disorganized and seemed to have been swept away by a bush. The actor who represented the Duke of Edinburgh seemed to have prepared for his role by watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and it was a farce. <br /> <br /> The production was a flaw, full of cliches, an embarrassing load of rubbish. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
