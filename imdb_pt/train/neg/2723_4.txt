Claire Denis's films seem to fall into one of two categories: violent and bloody or quiet and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely falls into the first category, but it's not as bad as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil". <br /> <br /> Now, since I've seen "Chocolat", I made sure to see every new film that Denis does. And I've always been disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. She has not made a movie as personal and as exciting as the first. <br /> <br /> You get a lot of Denis's regulars: an older, but still magnificent, Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie just to show off his fleshy lips, the space between his teeth, his ample neckline and a pair of beautiful coats; the black "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Grégoire Colin, and that Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michel Subor's character was interesting enough, but the camera remained in it to such an extent that I was annoyed with that curly hair hanging from his forehead and was relieved when, somewhere in Korea, he finally cut. Certainly there was some action - terrible murders, the search for a man for a child - and there might even have been a plot, but one observation was not enough to find out, and two visions I fear, I'm out of question. On the one hand, the score was shocking and intrusive (as in "Beau Travail"). On the other hand, the seasons changed very abruptly, leaving you even more confused about what was happening. Oh, there were some beautiful photos, and if you liked "Friday Evening" with your photos of the folds in heavy curtains and sheets, you can appreciate the aesthetics of "L'Intrus". Otherwise, avoid. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in French and it is possible that I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a Denis film rarely reaches more than five pages, double-spaced, and wide margins. In "Chocolat" silence is sublime; in "L'Intrus", is just boring.
