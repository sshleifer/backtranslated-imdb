This muffled melodrama is easily the worst film starring Ingrid Bergman I've ever seen. Even its presence on the bright screen can not save this unbearably slow and sinuous film that is almost impossible to sit without advancing too much. <br /> <br /> Just for the stubborn Bergman fans; others are very likely to fall asleep. I suggest you watch "For Whom the Bell Tolls" instead.
