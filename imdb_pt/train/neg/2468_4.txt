That was not so good. Not terrible or hateful or anything, just forgettable. He had a kind of hesitant, diluted air, as if he never knew whether he wanted to laugh, sweet or satirical. So we got a faint mix of the three. The actors seemed a little lost. <br /> <br /> In addition, the ideas were really tired and recycled, almost buzzing. How many times have we been told that the 1950s in the United States were infected by a banal sense of conformity? And was this perpetuated by aggressive consumerism? And that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing? Old hat. <br /> <br /> His greatest crime, however, was how detached he was from reality. I know it was a comedy and everything but - especially in a full-length movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for an extended period - you still need some sort of emotional anchor, some related guide through history, the surrounding. For the 'hero' kid watching an old woman, two school friends and finally his father die painfully in the hands of zombies or anything and for him to greet everything with a cheerful smile and a shrug, so I just fight for handle it in any positive way. The mother was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhumane at this level, then you risk losing me and that's what happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of that kind of apple pie suburb. That captured well enough, it was a beautiful movie, especially some of those wide-angle shots of the street and inside the Robinsons' house. Also, the opening news was cute, in a way that was done before, but still funny. <br /> <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly was fine and this comes from someone who is not Billy Connolly's Big Fan: Movie Star. I only had this fear that he was trying to stop and tried to steal all the scenes, but he played quite discreetly for him and probably left as the nicest character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, not great though.
