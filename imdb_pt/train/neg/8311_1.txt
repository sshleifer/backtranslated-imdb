What this film fails to answer is how this war is wrong (and most of the US wars were recently made just to get some oil). <br /> <br /> How many innocent civilian victims have there been, how many lives perished and how blatantly <br /> <br /> So, let me ask if the American soldier killed women and children besides the enemy, alright , but if the government accidentally kills its own forces with deadly chemicals while kills many civilians as well, does not it? Your logic fails, gentleman. <br /> <br /> I'll give 5 for solid performance and 1 for all the rest, 3 in total.
