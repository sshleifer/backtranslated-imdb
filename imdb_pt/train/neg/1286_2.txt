How does a Scottish kilt make love in the purple heather? Very, very carefully.Now I have the distinct advantage over many other reviewers in that I was born in Scotland.Many many Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously.It's a joke, people, "four good legs - two bad legs", as Orwell had. Jessica Lange has an accent that the production of "Brigadoon" by Wells - next - the - sea Amateur Dramatic Society would refuse. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with women - uses his kilt with all the authority of a man whose Great Grandmother got off the train at Edinburgh Waverley. And the Auld Enemy? Where would the Scots be without them to hate and blame everything? Messrs. Roth, Cox, and Hurt should be ashamed to indulge in such racist stereotypes. "Robin Hood - Prince of thieves" looks like a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
