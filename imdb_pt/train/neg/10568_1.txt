Wow. I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this really takes the cake. It's the worst movie I've seen in the last decade - no exaggeration. As a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I found it almost impossible to finish watching this ridiculous movie, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt at "authenticity" anywhere of the movie. Not so much as the smallest fragment. It looked like it had been written by an 8-year-old who took all his notions of war (and military behavior) directly from comic books. The film was made in Honduras, which should have been a clue, but even that can not fully explain the atrocious production values ​​of this cliché rubbish. <br /> <br /> I could try to list all the endless technical glitches, but that would take virtually forever. Of the old unit's shoulder patches that have not been seen or used since World War II, and character badges such as "ColCollins" (used by the character "Colonel Collins"), which was written using the inverted image "N "from the Russian alphabet (not from the American alphabet) the list goes on. The uniforms, the equipment, the plot, and more especially the behavior of the characters themselves - each scene was filled with ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies and clichés completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> Nor the plot itself. nor were the characters at all credible or credible. It was all ridiculously childlike, to the extreme. This was obviously a movie that should appeal strictly to prepubescent boys, and I have little doubt that even they find this film totally absurd. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie has absolutely no redeeming quality. at all. It's a total waste of time. I strongly advise that someone read this to pass this garbage through; Not worth wasting a single moment of your time.
