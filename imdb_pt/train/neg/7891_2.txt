The IMDb plot summary does not describe the essence of this film. He should have read, "Be prepared to be catapulted back to the third bench in the back of your family church at the age of 8, listening to the preacher speak about God's will while all you can think about is come back home." your Lego '. <br /> <br /> Begins well-intentioned, constructing intrigue planting some real and surreal clues, like Renny's, "how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?" time. Then he slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing his plot completely in an evangelistic-induced gossip wash. I believe I counted the use of the word "pray" about 53 times in a five minute interval near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word into its synonym, 'prey'. Unfortunately, my little mental game made the film at least bearable in the last 20 minutes. Also, it made me laugh whenever a character said 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) when it became totally crazy. In fact, even my Catholic wife sank into her chair of boredom, almost to the point of falling to the ground. <br /> <br /> For all the salivating Christians who have rated this film 8-10 stars, I suggest staying with their security standards that reinforce theology, such as Circle Square, the Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and related. Stay away from more challenging subjects in such films as Jesus' Camp, The God Who Was not There, What Jesus Would Buy, Or The Religous About To Be Released. <br /> <br /> Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better.
