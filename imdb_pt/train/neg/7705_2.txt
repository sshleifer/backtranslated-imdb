(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I should have thought. The DVD did not even show the time or how long it took. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I've ever seen. This is much worse. Does not make sense. Played plot together. All so we can see huge breasts in a figure that does not support them. It had to be a student film. This must have gotten a C rating. <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I figured out it was not going to end). The ending did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Replayable: 0/10
