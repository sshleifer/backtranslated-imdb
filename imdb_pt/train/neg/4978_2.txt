This movie got me lost with the beast RPG (rocket propelled grenade). It was as if someone cut and pasted a Robocop scene. I half expected Beowulf to say exclaim, "I LIKED IT!" <br /> <br /> I watched this because I like Chris Bruno from the TV show "The Dead Zone" and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least kept it consistent throughout the film - unlike any of his coadjutants. They continued to enter all kinds of discourse, from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already many comments about how this film is different from the source material. However, even on its own, the plot of this movie is not good. It's just boring, which even low budget does not justify. Having a low budget means you need to at least have a good history, dialogue and decent acting. These things do not cost much. Instead, they spent their money on CGI and some decent costumes and scenarios. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
