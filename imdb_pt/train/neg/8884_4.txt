"Dominique" is one of those films that the term "slow-as-molasses" must have been invented. Many endless and repetitive sequences (how many times do we see Robertson walking down the stairs slowly because he can hear someone playing the piano?). It is almost redeemed at the end by an amazing turnaround, which, unfortunately, is followed by a second turnaround that can only leave a bad taste in our mouths. It's not a very nice movie.
