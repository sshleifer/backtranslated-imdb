Yikes made this movie explode. The characters were weak, the plot weaker. I realized that this could not be so bad because it has Christoper Walken, oops. He must have done it because he was bored and needed the money. The characters were supposed to be Irish, but no one had an Irish accent. I'm desperately trying to find something cool about this, I can not, except that Walken did a good job with a wooden character. Find something to read or see the discovery, never see this movie.
