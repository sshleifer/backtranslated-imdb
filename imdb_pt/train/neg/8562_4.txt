CAMILLE 2000 Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> While visiting Rome, a loving nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a handsome young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but his unlikely romance has the opposition of the rich father of Castelnuovo (Massimo Serato), and fate deals with a tragic blow ... <br /> < > A sexualizing love story for the swinging sixties, adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas 'La Dame aux Camelias') by screenwriter Michael DeForrest, and directed with a free touch by Radley Metzger who, along with names like Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of "adult" cinema throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Using the scope format for the last time in his career, Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' is rich in visual excess note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), although the sexual sincerity of the film seems timid the modern standards. The production values ​​are beautiful and the performances are engaging and human (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite weak post-sync synchronization. Although set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's scenary projects pinpoint the film firmly in its period, and Piero Piccioni's "wah-wah" soundtrack became a cult item among devotees of the exploration. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of the director's elegant erotic erotica will not be disappointed. Metzger's next move was THE LICKER QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film.
