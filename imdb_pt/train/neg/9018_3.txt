This is a science fiction movie of formula B, and the director did not comment on that. It is about a dragon that is restored to life by a scientific team. Everything done is something you've seen many times before. It's a weak script, with no real characters. In fact, it's full of characters and stereotyped situations. The director attacks this just by making a formula movie, with no attempt to fool us, and this gives the film a soft appeal, but it's not something you'll probably remember for some time. It is best to watch while you are cooking, cleaning, working out. Kind of pointless fun. It has its place in entertainment, but it's certainly not something you feel with your friends to watch, unless you're all drunk and do not mind. The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I do not think it's as bad as most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the posts found it spectacular. This really deceives me, since I see no attempt to make a memorable movie.
