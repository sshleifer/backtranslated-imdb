From everything I read about the film, I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme. Everything about the film was done in a very unprofessional way. Especially the writing! Without good writing, a movie has no chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he did not want to reveal how the title relates to the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I've been waiting for the teenage / young adult story to unfold, but it never happened. As someone who went through a divorce, I was very disappointed. This movie would have been no comfort to me when I went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!
