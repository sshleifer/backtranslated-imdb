I really like Brad Pitt. He is an actor with intelligence and intelligence, not to mention the face, the pectorals, and everything else. Ever since I saw him in "Thelma and Louise" a thought has bothered me, of whom does he remind me? "Troy" did it for me. He's the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious, of course. Male, American etc, but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind, however. He is so handsome that he is more effective when he plays against him. "Kalifornia" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" His self-deprecating humor makes him human, almost approachable. Luckily "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Just photos with Pitt, semi nude in sweeping sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans. Strange, "Das Boot" is one of the great films of the second part of the twentieth century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing to direct this? Well, I suppose it would be very difficult to say no to the chance to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
