This movie had the potential to be so much more than it was. But it not only fails to deliver, but also brings the preaching nefarious and just at the same time. <br /> <br /> John Cusack is even flatter than at midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he should have a southern accent, which he notably loses several times in each scene . <br /> <br /> Al Pacino makes his shtick, but seems to be walking in this movie and collecting a payout. He is good, as usual, but hardly stands out. Support Cast - Launches female romantic interest that added little, if anything, to the story. Speaking of the story, a tale of "who really cares," where Cusack is the mayor's boy who has only to look for the "right thing" to do. <br /> <br /> People do not act. this way. The character of Cusack loses all credibility in the end, of which without revealing it, is to preach and nauseate. The final scene makes the penultimate nonsense seem profound. It is also completely inaccurate, but I will not enter into law. <br /> <br /> This is bad, by the movie of the numbers. It seems interesting in the first 40 minutes and so it really is a proselytizing film, self-justification for the last hour. Better with nonsense shit than this pile of crap.
