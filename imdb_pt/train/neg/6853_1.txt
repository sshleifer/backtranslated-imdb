Another trashy Grade Z quickie from prolific Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson's 13-inch space-station-type police officer chases an ugly flying head (!) To Earth and engages in a gang war in the South Bronx! Mercifully short, but deadly monotonous, with the most corny effects since 50Ft Woman's Attack. They should have fired the continuity guy too: Notice how Thomerson's sunglasses disappear and reappear with every second shot. Laughably bad, but that's why we watch those movies, is not it? Sequel'Dollman vs. Demonic Toys' is supposed to be even worse, if that's possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (from ****) <br /> <br />
