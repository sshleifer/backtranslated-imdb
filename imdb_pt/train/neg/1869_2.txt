Veteran Bruno Mattei is again involved with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes Joel Schumacher's 8MM. But as expected, Mattei makes his film on a tiny budget - so it already seems unclear when it's released recently. <br /> <br /> After her daughter is abducted, a mother enters the obscure world of underground pornography because the hijackers belong to an international organization that runs snuff movies as long as exclusive customers pay well. The search for her daughter not only leads her mother to Europe, but also to prostitution. She goes to bed with some guys to get her clues. When she finally gets in touch with the snuff organization led by the mysterious Doctor Hades, she herself is becoming a major danger. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about it, even if it starts promising. The problem is that the film is not as sleazy or explicit as one might expect from the director who made films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!) Is neither bloody enough nor contains the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention. The plot is not so special except perhaps for the surprisingly many different locations across Europe. The ending is extremely disappointing. The acting is not really remarkable, except for Anita Auer, who plays Dr. Hades: She looks and acts extremely frighteningly. You do not want to meet her like that in a dark alley (or in your room). <br /> <br /> All in all, SNUFF TRAP attracts only the collectors of Bruno Mattei's films. But it's good to see the man back at the helm again: it was his first thriller since 1994, the giallo GLI OCCHI INSIDE.
