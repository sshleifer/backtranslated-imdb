This movie certainly has one of the strangest themes in history - right there, with Ed Wood's passionate defense of cross-dressing in "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> <br /> The subject: play bridge. The Park Avenue set touches that; the Bohemians do it. Russians - who speak very "Russian" and have inconsistent accents when they speak English - play in the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If anyone is not interested in bridge, one - - despite the great cast - is not likely to be very interested in this bizarre movie. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghostwriter - as Lukas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishist script.
