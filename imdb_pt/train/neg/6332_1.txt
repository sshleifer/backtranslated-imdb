I was anxious to see this movie when it came out, since I was a big SNL fan. When my boyfriend and I went to see him, people coming out of the first show shouted, "Do not waste your money!" But of course we had to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Although there were some funny parts (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most looked like it could have been severely edited until a fun 1 hour show. It was really bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer arrived, many people got up and left. It made me laugh because I realized that O'Donoghue was just pushing people's buttons on purpose with this movie. Or else he was just insane. Whatever it is - you do not have to waste your time watching it, it's so bad.
