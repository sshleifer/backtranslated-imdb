I really did not like this movie ... mainly because of the main characters! Both are immature, selfish, self-centered people. They hurt ALL around them playing their silly game. The visual effects were good, but what good they are if there are characters with which you connect or an interesting storyline. Should I be happy when these two psychic people finally consume their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie I was thinking "Is this the biggest hit in France?" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> As for the end: BOA RIDDANCE! Both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
