In a good review, loleralacartelort7890 says, "The truth is that Americans use a secret alloy of anti-radiation aluminum." It is not well known. If they were in a space race with the Russians, then it would be too stupid to reveal that they had a new technology that could protect the crew from radiation. "This is completely incorrect. There is (and was) no" secret " "for the radiation protection at Apollo.The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has been publicly available for a long time.It uses a lightweight honeycomb made of aluminum and stainless steel.The entire outer surface (except windows , of course) is covered with a heat shield made of a thicker, phenolic resin at the bottom that faces forward during re-entry. These materials are actually better at stopping the type of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is more suitable for stopping ionizing photons such as X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Space radiation is a definite problem for long-term space flight because of the risk of large solar explosions. But it simply was not a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The command module gave them good protection during their brief passage (half an hour or more) for the Van Allen belts. They all carried dosimeters to know exactly how much radiation they received: no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the moon (12 of whom landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died of heart attacks, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are really pretty good statistics for a group of men now in the late 70's (Shepard would be 86).
