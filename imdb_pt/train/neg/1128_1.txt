This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. Pure drivel. How one could develop a connection with heroin, or empathize with it, is beyond me. I felt that I was witnessing a clinical case of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder. Simply terrible. In its most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt at production and an "art" film - except that I could not, for my life, find any art in it at all. If this woman had lived in the world today, she would have been taken to a psychiatric institution and treated for a few days with antipsychotic medications. That, or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a woman purse. Why other characters in this film have found something that has rescued her - and tried to help her in her quest to become an actress - speak more about her pathology than about any convincing features that made her worth the effort.
