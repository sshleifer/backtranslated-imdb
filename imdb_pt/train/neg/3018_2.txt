What you get when you mix a bunch of clich√©s with a non-directional rhythm and a bunch of characters you do not care about and a frustrated attempt to create a compelling visual style and a lot of even bigger cliches and a poor sense of humor ? and a really big budget? Why, you have one of the most endless movies ever made! I'm referring, of course, to Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things people can say while watching this movie: "Ooh, wow, the story is said out of sequence, it was not made a billion "Wow, look at all the flashing lights and texture of the grainy film and work out transitions! The director is trying so hard to make things look artistic and establish a visual style! <br /> <br /> It's a shame that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they are in, and it's also very bad that most of them seem annoying! "<br /> <br /> "I've heard this exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand films before!" <br /> <br /> "I've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before!" <br /> <br /> "This too "<br /> <br />" Uh, they did not reveal this 'twist' a half hour ago? What should be surprising? "<br /> <br />" If this movie is to be showing a ga hard route 'walking around kicking her ass ... when why does not she do a lot of it? "<br /> <br />" I can not believe how unprecedented this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long is this thing? I feel like I've been watching for over four hours already. "<br /> <br />" I have no idea what happened, but also, I particularly do not feel motivated to try to figure this out. "<br /> <br />" Is it over yet? "<br /> <br />" I want my money back. "<br /> <br />" The songs on this soundtrack seem so misused here. "<br /> <br />" It's ironic that all the booties they use really lessen the impact of each one of them. "<br /> <br /> And finally," I might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me. " If your home is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that is not flammable, you should seriously consider being burned alive. /> <br /> (If I look bitter, it's because I spent more than two hours watching this movie and, uh, I did not like it very much.)
