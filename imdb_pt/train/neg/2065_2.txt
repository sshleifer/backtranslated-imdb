Rented last night. Opening (2001) ran WAAAAAAAAAY for a long time. The ride scene was no good. Some sketches were only delayed. I knew beforehand, Chevy Chase was in less than 2 minutes. No problems. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield music <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material from a 75-minute movie <br /> All the rest was either unfunny or stupid as hell. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some advice: If you want a rough movie spoofing TV and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want a less crass movie that fakes TV and movies, rent "AMAZON WOMEN IN THE MOON" or "UHF". Otherwise, do not bother renting this movie. You will save 2 to 3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best picture is still "Modern Problems"
