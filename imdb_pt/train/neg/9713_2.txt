The first time I watched Cold Case was after running for about a year on Danish television. By the time he hit the TV, he nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other American crime programs on the air at about the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw and got bored to death. The below-standard actors, with moralistic faces and moralism, were a pain in the back. The whole premise that so much money has been given to a team of investigators to solve murders dating to 10 to 20 or even 60 years seems so unlikely. <br /> <br /> Time is also a factor, as they only have 50-60 mins to tell the story, which means they get a break at just the right time to solve the case and bring justice to the surviving members if they are still alive. This combined with the "personal" problems and relationships of the investigators there has to be time to leave the show a complete lackluster. <br /> <br /> I give it a rating of 2 stars because of the song at the end that is really the only reason to watch it .... what you, of course, will not do as this is VERY a reason to watch this crap.
