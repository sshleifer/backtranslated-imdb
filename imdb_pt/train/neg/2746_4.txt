I was scared to take my nephews to this movie because I did not think it would be well done. Children, ages 6 and 10 were set to see this, so I relented. I must admit it was not as bad as I thought, but it was still a long way from the book. The film seemed to have the ten-year-old's understanding and sense of humor. I discovered that the 6-year-old understood what was happening and was presenting solutions to the problems that were occurring. Eventually I had to explain that sometimes movies do not show the best solutions to problems, because it's more fun to see what happens if they make "foolish" or "stupid" choices.
