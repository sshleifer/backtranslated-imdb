This is not Michael Madsen's fault, he was hardly in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and get bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words can not describe how stupid it is. Sorry, Michael. The cinematography was dark. All other actors are unknown. While watching it, it looks like a soft porn, but without nudity or heated scenes. This movie had sexual connotations as it is about an underground S & M killer. The acting was bad except for the parts of Michael Madsen. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he was well paid for this bad movie. It's something I would not be proud of. It's not even a B-movie for the cable, it's more like an F and should never be displayed, ever.
