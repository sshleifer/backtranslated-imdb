The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, which is different from the other movie consists of alien strangers. <br /> <br /> It is my belief that this movie would be # One of the worst movies about IMDb - if anyone actually watched. The plot is disconnected and, in several instances (many), makes absolutely no sense. The real wonder here is because in the world it was this sequel created for such an unsuccessful and horrendous movie (but still a little better). <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you like watching terrible movies for a good movie. laugh.
