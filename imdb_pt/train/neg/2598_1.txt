Even in a bad movie, there's usually some redeeming feature, something you might say was terrible, but there was this performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, that was just awful. The acting was laughable, the script terrible, complete with many inexplicable references from Breakfast at Tiffany, and even the special effects were of poor quality at best. This was a very bad movie and that even Drew Barrymore's desires were eliminated from the story. Watch if you want: a) Suffering severe pain inflicted. b) See how bad a movie can be. This is a movie where I can use the clich√© "There are ninety minutes of my life I will never come back" with any justification!
