What a weekend. Two days ago I watched the first half of "War 2 Games: Dead Code", now "While she was away". I'm trying to come up with a decision that was worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching. I think, "While she was away" it was worse. <br /> <br /> Everything has been said before in other comments: Irrealistic, illogical, etc. - the only thing I really have to add is that at some point I started to feel more for the bad guys than for the woman because I would recommend her for a Darwin award if she really died (I only watched the first time, so I do not know ). Soon I was in two Darwin awards (if that's possible) for his immense stupidity. <br /> <br /> Hey,: Produced by Kim Basinger? So she not only knew the script, but was also responsible for bringing that waste of money to us, the people? I consider humans who waste considerable amounts of evil money because the money could have been used to feed and clothe some people instead of hurting 80% of those who saw the movies and give 20%, who are idiots, a good opportunity to show how stupid they are.
