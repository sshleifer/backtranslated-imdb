This movie comes straight from the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This producer gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 1990s producing terribly bad and cheesy horror films. The most famous disasters in his ear are "Subspecies", "Seeding" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended and neither is Doctor Mordrid, actually. Hyperactive director Charles Band came to the right company for his film. Dr. Mordrid is incredibly stupid and tacky and almost completely humorless. I only saw it because it's starring Jeffrey Combs. I have learned that it can have several disadvantages if you are a fan of it. For every good movie, it looks like it made 5 bottoms. Anyway, the story is about the battle between two old wizards. A good person who has been here for 150 years to protect humans (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and a villain named Kabal. He wants to destroy every human form of life for some reason I've forgotten. Combs receives his mentor's instructions. This "face" only exists from a pair of eyes in space. Very very corny, that's it! Every once in a while, a bright light is shown on the screen, but that's the only form of special effects this movie has. The whole thing is just a cry and irritation and when the two wizards finally face it, it ends before you know it ... I would have expected the wicked wizard to at least fight a little, but nooooooo .. In some scenes, you really can detect some originality and creativity (such as Jeffrey's talk about the influence of the moon on criminals) and if you really pay attention, you might even find some small but nice aspects (like the raven). which is called Edgar Allen), but overall, it is a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he sure does not have to put on a stupid swimsuit for that.
