Possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> Although there was some good acting - particularly Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the comedy - this simply was not an engaging movie. The segues between the comedy part and the tragedy part were strange or sometimes not obvious. This spectator was initially confused by the fact that the support cast differs in the two halves; I thought with the way things were set out in the opening scene that the people around Melinda would be the same people, just reacting differently (another premise of "He Said, She Said"). However, what we have are two totally different stories and two totally different women, both represented by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> The two playwrights in the opening scene - the comedian and the tragic - supposedly take the same premise and go from there, but the two stories are only minutely related. They do little to support the topic of the discussion, which is that almost anything can be regarded as comedy or tragedy. Nice cast, but a disappointing movie.
