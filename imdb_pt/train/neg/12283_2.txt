University student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is plagued by nightmares of a ghoul who lives in the cellar at Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting his own hand, spitting out an earthworm, a ghoul ripping his chest and being roasted over open fire. After his friends see him levitating "6 feet" on his bed, an occult obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) suggests that they infiltrate Alcatraz to confront their fears. Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of control! <br /> <br /> The group got stuck, Alex's brother Richard (Tom Reilly) gets possessed and starts killing everyone. . Toni Basil of "Mickey" fame appears as the useful ghost of Sammy Mitchell, lead singer of the group "Bodybag". She teaches Alex to levitate out of his body and inserts a rock dance with repetition of nightmare scenes to accompany the execution time. All the victims appear like crazy ghosts to the personage Griffin Dunne in Werewolf in London. The script is full of holes, cheesy dialogues and idiotic comedy attempts. Good FX work and legal opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that earn any merit. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
