Whatever the classification I give BOOM is only because of the excellent location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for the hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (their downward phase) and RICHARD BURTON (their phase of miscegenation). Tennessee Williams wrote "The milk train does not stop here anymore" and supposedly very fond of this adaptation of his play - but apparently he was the only one. Taylor supposedly hated it and Burton needed the money. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is, it means a hill of beans with Taylor's posture and steaming in its strident way, exploding in the servants and exchanging bad conversations with nothing less. than NOEL COWARD, who seems to be a visitor to another movie when he finally shows up. <br /> <br /> It's so exaggerated that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a "must see." But if you can sit through this without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. Unfortunately, this is the movie that meant the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a movie actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally disastrous and critics called it BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
