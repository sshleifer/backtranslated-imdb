I did my personal mission of persecuting those responsible for this movie. I even got the rental company to give me my money back because I argued that they perpetrated misleading advertising. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that the movie itself is a p.o.s., but the cover art is what sold me. I did better makeup effects on my kids on Halloween than what the movie actually portrays versus the cover art. Can you say "raccoon eyes?" <br /> <br /> I will not waste more of my time going into the full details, but come on, the main character in the movie is a LA cop who was born and raised in Alabama - but has a German accent! It is beyond insulting.
