I always thought people were a bit cynical about those old Andy Hardy movies. Some of them were not bad. Modern movie critics are not those who generally prefer good to nasty movies, so two such shoe films are rarely praised. <br /> <br /> However, I can not defend this movie either. You can still have a dated dialogue, but still laugh and cry about the story. Watching this, you just shake your head and ask, "How stupid can you get?" This is thicker than corny if you know what I mean. It is so tacky that I can not understand many people sitting for the whole hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The story is basically "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get off the jam because he invents some story about getting involved with some New York City debutante as if that were the maximum. People were much more socially aware in the old days. You would hear the term "social climber" as if meeting rich or beautiful people was the greatest achievement you could make in life. It's all silly, of course, and it seems even more so today. <br /> <br /> However, it's such an innocent and clean story and series (there were half a dozen of these Andy Hardy movies made) could find. Also, if you like to hear Judy Garland sing, then this is your ticket, while she sings some songs here and she enters the heart of Andy. Oh man, I almost vomited even writing about it!
