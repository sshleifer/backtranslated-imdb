Boy-girl love affair / sequel with songs, only this time she's the punkte and he's the straight arrow. Do movie buffs really like this movie? Do you have fans? I must say, the coil mind ... "Grease 2" is a truly lame venture that does not even have the courage, moxy or sheer courage to catch the memory of its burning predecessor (such as "Jaws 2" or "Jaws 2" or "Exorcist II"). No, he whimpers in slow motion and often just plays dead. It looks and feels cheap, with a great cast lost amidst a confusing direction and blurry handling. This was the first time a substantial audience had caught a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and, although she is not ashamed, it is a role worth forgetting. An ignition fault at the lowest level. NO STARS of ****
