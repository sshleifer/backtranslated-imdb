I just watched The Convent for the second time. I'd enjoyed this before and figured this would make a good drunken Friday night movie, some blood, some style, some humor, and stuff like that. I was sad to find that I could no longer enjoy it. It seemed as if someone had been willing to revisit "Night of the Demons" epics to a modern audience, but lost the things that made the original worthwhile. For the record, I'm not even a big fan of Night of the Demons, but there were a few things I actually did about it. The convent makes the cheese but not the good either. In addition to the character (a nice performance by Joanna Canton), the gothic girl and a sweet cameo by Adrienne Barbeau, virtually every character was terribly unpleasant, purulent at the lowest levels of idiotic and offensive jockhood. The film is then severely hampered by the complete lack of free nudity, which means that given the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to see the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film. The evil nuns are original in design and have many good scenes, though they are not scary, and certainly the film also has a fair amount of pure blood. In the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene, the film becomes quite entertaining, because all the obnoxious people are dead and an evil nun in frenzy. The stylized direction also occasionally produces good results, although sometimes the camera only moves too fast. In short, this was a film in which, for me, the positives just can not make up for the things I hated. Those who like this kind of movie more can enjoy it a lot, but for me it was not a good time.
