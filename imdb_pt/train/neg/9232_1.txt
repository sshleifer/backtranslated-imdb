Maximily manipulative Anabel Sims (Betsy Drake) leaves to arrest her ideal man, aided by her co-worker, Julie. Pediatrician estimated Madison Brown (Cary Grant) goes from confused to promised in the space of 90 minutes in the film, but for the viewer is all eternity. Can a movie receive less than one star? This is an excellent candidate.
