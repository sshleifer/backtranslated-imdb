I've seen bad movies before, but this one takes the "Worst Movie of a Lifetime" award by far !! Anthony Hopkins has to be mentally ill to have his name attached to this - anywhere! I'll never see another movie with him, driving, etc., etc.! I can not believe the other actors and actresses that I liked, (in this photo), who lowered themselves so low to be part of this disaster! There must be some great drugs out there! For those who are not ashamed to be part of this film, it is beyond me! Save money on this! HUGE FLOP from start to finish! Shame on you, Mr. Hopkins! Also, ashamed of Christian Slater! I can not believe you put your reputation on the line for this!
