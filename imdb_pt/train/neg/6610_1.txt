This film should not be seen as it should be a failure. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of the Bollywood classic film "Sholay", but after having problems with the original creators decided to go ahead with the project and ... I think I leave all the good parts of the movie (acting , script, music, music, comedy, action etc) and shoot the movie just because he has already hired the team. Waste of money, waste of time. After making films like Rangeela, Satya and Company, he took a Coppola (godfather) from us; What were you thinking about RGV? Anyway, the story is, though hard to follow, it's almost like old Sholay. Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, Sholay) and Ajay, new kid on the block playing Ajay (Jay, Sholay). Both "bad and funny" friends help a cop capture a bad guy first. Later in the film, the retired police officer hires them as personal security and safeguard from the hands of a much sought after Bubban, played by Amitabh Bachan. If you have not watched Bollywood movies, the good ones win at the end. I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
