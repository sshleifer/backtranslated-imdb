One of the five worst movies I've ever seen. And I'm not exaggerating. In fact, I recommend watching so you can have the same sense of disbelief you can see watching Showgirls. <br /> <br /> From 400 votes, the film gets a rating of 5.3 / 10. But there are a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 10/10, probably because of the film's message - nuclear weapons are the ruin of mankind. Chuck Murdock is an elite league pitcher who relinquishes baseball because there are nuclear weapons. Soon "Amazing Grace" Smith is a Boston Celtic star who draws on Chuck's story and gives up basketball. Soon all sports leagues, from the professional to the college level, from high school to small league, are dismantled in a worldwide protest. Later, all the children of the world go on a strike of silence. This inspires the president of the United States to meet with the Soviet premier, who eventually agrees to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of next season's Little League. The film ends with Chuck about to throw out the first pitch, with the president telling his new best friend, Chuck, not to worry about eliminating each dough since he has not played a baseball in a year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Somewhere along the line, a nefarious boss of the underworld kills Amazing Grace. When the president finds out he is told the FBI can check the killer, but will never be able to prove it. Then the president calls the boss of the underworld ("But it's one of them" "I do not care, put him on the line") and tell him that he must resign from all the boards of companies in which he sits and sell all shares that he has. And not to leave the line again. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie was so bad that I could not turn it off. It was on TV from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. and I watched it all. I was not turned off by anti-nuclear weapons propaganda. I was turned off by the implausible breakdown of all organized sports. I do not even understand why "Amazing Grace" Smith was killed. And with all these famous athletes becoming friends with Chuck, why was the father constantly upset with his son assuming a position of principle. And there was the clich√© moment near the end when his father tells Chuck, "I never told you that, but I'm proud of you." Hint of hint.
