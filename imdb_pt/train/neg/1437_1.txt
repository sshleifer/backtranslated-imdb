I missed the first 10 minutes of the movie, but I do not think watching it from the beginning would have made any difference. I found the film extremely annoying and was disappointed with the acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in prominent roles, but all of them disappointed because of a very weak script. "Kind Solomon's Mines" ... the very short part of the movie inside the "mines" was as exciting as watching paint dry and I doubt even a preschooler would be fascinated watching the warriors fight. " It reminded me of a cheap American TV series. Give me Indiana Jones any day!
