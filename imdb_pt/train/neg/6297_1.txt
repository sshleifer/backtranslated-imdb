I am a big fan of Martin Amis, whose book this movie is based on. Unfortunately, the director could not translate the book to the screen. The novel is completely postmodern and highly artificial in its wildly uncontrolled characters and the disintegration of the traditional plot and character development. It is a hilarious survey of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of the most moralistic contemporary British writers. The director of the film completely missed the purpose of the novel. In his hands, the film screams at full speed, indulging in all the familiar tricks and possible "odd" camera angles. He's like Ken Russell in acid, and suffers from the self-indulgence of that older director to a hundred. Not even the (brief) glimpse of the beautiful actor Christian Solimeno's penis was enough to save this miserable movie for me. Abysmal!
