Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same era, and like that earlier film, bears little resemblance to the literary character of Burroughs. But while the Tarzan of 1932 was reduced to the speech "Tarzan-Jane", this Tarzan, interpreted by Miles O'Keeffe, does not speak nor grumble. He makes the Tarzan scream a few times, which sounds like it was a sample from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan interprets Bo Derek's second banana as Jane. Or rather, like the third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and right breast. This movie has no point but to show Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The two action scenes in the movie are presented in slow motion, and are really bad. More evidence that no one cared. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this movie. Maybe he would meet in Sumatra car with the Indian elephants who are also on display.
