This movie made me very angry because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I've been living in Iowa for 29 years and I know people do not have a southern accent here. This movie is about a guy who does meth and I do not know the real plot or what the movie should be. It has some pretty graphic drug use and is really an insult, so see these people use meth as if it were sugar. I lost my brother to methamphetamine and this movie makes me sick to the stomach because it glamorizes the drug. The movie makes it look cool to use the drug, but I was happy in the end when the guy almost crossed the state border. I also know that most women who suffer a traumatic rape do not want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day. The movie is wrong in all directions. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if I were to suggest a drug film.
