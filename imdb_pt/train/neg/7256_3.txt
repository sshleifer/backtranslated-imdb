I bought this movie in blu-ray because it promised great visual and musical features. I was also a big fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is very stylized after Baraka, wide angles, very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage at each shot. Even some of the scenes were identical (the street with traffic). While Baraka told a great story, juxtaposing nature, man-made environments, spirituality and world horrors in a captivating way and good music, this movie jumped from flat shot without comprehensive storyline, mediocre musical score and afterwards. ... POOF, it's over! I thought there should be some kind of mistake! History of the world? Half of the movie is Egypt and scenery (looks like Arizona, but I did not bother to check it out). Serious people, this is horrible, rent it if you need it, but do not buy it. Filmmakers should be ashamed to put it into practice.
