I do not know what you're talking about, the first time I watched this movie with two friends of mine, we could not stop crying. This is one of the funniest I've ever seen. This comment about pornography is so certain though hahahaha. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually the worst, but it brought tears to my eyes due to fake characters, bad dialogue and acting. Not to mention the expensive cameras that they used to film this?! It looks like one of those movies came out of my drivers. class. The props seem to have come out of a school theater show. The song sounds like it was from an original Nintendo system game. The only thing that came close to scaring me about this movie was that it had a killer clown that, who is not scared by fat and lurking clowns? hahaha, if anyone saw this, they had to look for verbal errors by the actors, like chattering in words and some of their facial expressions. Hahaha, I died. <br /> <br /> SUSAN
