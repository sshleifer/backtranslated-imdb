T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who can not mature with changing times, styles and fashions. He's like he's stuck in the same old-fashioned style of making movies. <br /> <br /> The actors are not bad, they are not good either. Anil Kapoor usually acts convincingly in both his father and son roles, but the failed script makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she is always good, and here she is nothing more than that. She does the best she's given, but she always does. In conclusion, nothing great at all. Raveena is OK, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. Maybe it's a late movie? Well, anyway, it would still be below standard. The script is terrible, the film is exaggerated, and the story does not get anywhere. It looks like a movie made in the early 90's, but the script makes it look even older, the style is as of the 50's. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend unless you're a big fan the starring actors.
