When converting a book into a film, it is usually a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or convey concepts, rather than completely ignoring the author. Although it is clear that the director had access to and followed the advice of Elinore Stewart's children, it is important to note that the children believed that their mother was a complete liar in relation to the good, enriching and empowering experiences of their land. . The book details her life in the adjacent estates of her and her husband, on the vast Wyoming border; she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances, though they lived tens of miles away. The film, however, takes a standard stance for the time it was made, portraying this woman's experience as harsh, relentless and almost meaningless. Perhaps the director was bringing some of his experiences in the Vietnam War with him to this film (as some film aficionados have said), but it seems to be a lousy excuse to take away all the joy and beauty of the book and turn it into a gloomy place , an odious landscape devoid of friends or hope. Do not waste time with this movie; read the book instead.
