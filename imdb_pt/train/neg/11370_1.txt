This video contains a smarter way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It's a shame that the people who did this really believe that the American people are so stupid to believe in him, perhaps as an American citizen, every person should protest against this kind of crap. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... The Qur'an is public! you can read for yourself and decide if what they say is true or false ... <br /> <br /> The video uses many audio-visual strategies aimed at manipulating and associating things that are not even related. The music used in some spots prepares the audience to hate what they see, even if they do not understand what is going on there. They use images that are shifted from their original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment, I would like to make a reflection ... Do not you think you can do the same movie with all the religions in the world? world?
