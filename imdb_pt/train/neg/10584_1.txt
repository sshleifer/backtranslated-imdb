The only redeeming quality of this film is that it was bad enough to be comical. Everyone in this movie looks like an abandoned porn industry. I've seen better acting in low budget pornography. I thought I'd actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: Watch your butt Nick: You watch yours (together): I will not leave you behind! <br /> <br /> The first action sequence shows how horrible the production is but it's really funny: good guys have transformer weapons! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 submachine guns. Next scene, AK-47 replicas! And then, most of all, they make some gun changes between scenes with a couple of M-16s !! I think they had a budget shortage for guns, not enough to get around the good guys and thugs. The fight scenes are badly co-ordinated and false like all hell. You have to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own. You can not fire a missile launched of any kind while you are inside a helicopter. Weapons you throw away suddenly do not reappear. When a gun is without bullets, throwing it away is still very stupid. Unless you have no idea how to recharge them ... The big, slow trucks on the first gear make nasty action shots. I really do not believe movies like this are actually produced. This movie would be hilarious in nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk.
