This movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can write and direct their own movie. Face it, you can not. Because that way there's no one around to tell you when you make big holes in your plot, have insignificant transitions, banal, unmemorable dialog, and manages to turn a pretty cool Korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid dung. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie as a useless popcorn movie, I really liked it; I like a lot of bad movies. But once I was forced to wonder what the hell just happened and WHY, DEAR LORD, WHY? more than a few times, I really can not stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> Besides, I'd love for someone to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene.
