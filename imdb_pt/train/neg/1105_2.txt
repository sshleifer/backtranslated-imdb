Oh my. How they can make films of such beauty, but they are terribly bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll does not do crap like that. There is not even a hint of a decent story, multi-layered characters or attraction. It's just a random sequence of useless talk put together to make a "movie." I suppose only children up to 3 years of age could appreciate it, given that the world is so totally dimensionless and the story so incoherent that any older person would be bothered by it. But again, it is very scary for anyone under 6 years of age, there is probably no one who should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay away from this movie. Your little girl can create a better plot, and although she probably can not take such beautiful pictures, it's worth listening to her stories. And please, on behalf of whom you believe, do not expose your children to this piece of wood. I'll give 2 out of 10, and this is exclusively for the graphics, because the story and character development are so bad that they deserve a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to watch it anyway ... remember that I warned you.
