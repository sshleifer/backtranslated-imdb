I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway, God knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy comes from this experience live in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he would have to rethink "Chorus" to the screen, but he could never figure out how to do it. If the man who came up with the show is baffled - that should answer your question. There are some shows that are meant to be watched live - with an audience. However, Richard Attenborough, rescued from the musical work of "Ghandi" and dancing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle", eventually directed this film that had little or no resemblance to the show on stage. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), Great songs were released or given to other characters (which did not make sense). Michael Douglas was mis-cast. People who did not know how to dance tried to act and there was the sexy Landers who could not sing, dance or dance - I think she had just been Ghandi's wife. The dances of Jeffrey Hornaday seem nothing more than schlock of "Flashdance" rejects and nothing works. I stood there, stunned at how something so fascinating and emotional could be drained for nothing. If you really love this show and are coming back to Broadway in 2006 - see, but do not think that the long musical event that was "A Chorus Line" has something to do with this movie.
