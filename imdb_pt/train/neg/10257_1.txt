This film had a great cast: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey and Lew Ayres - actors of solid b movies. But this film did not use any of them for any kind of advantage, and none of its characters were even on screen (although Christopher Lee has to perform differently in several scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change in the fall of a hat. First, they just want to fix the ship and leave, then they activate the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets the crucial part they need. Then, out of nowhere, this "peaceful" race decides that it has to destroy the planet because it causes many "diseases" (though they offer the main character and the wife a place in their society). Most of the film is spent watching the man and the woman drive or walk or stand or sit at tables doing nothing. You almost wish they had been taken out with the rest of the planet in the end, only in revenge for boring us to death. <br /> <br /> Unless you really like Chris Lee or the low-budget science fiction seventies, I would give this a miss. It falls into this narrow band of celluloid wasted between Odyssey Star and UFO: Target Land.
