I bought this movie because this was Shah rukh khans Debut. And I also enjoyed seeing how it would do. I must say that he is excellent in his role. Debbie Bharathi is excellent in this film. Rishi does a wonderful job.Susham supported Seth Well .Alok nath was good in his role.Amish and Mohnish did their share well as well.Dalip was also good in his small role.Actors shine in a mediocre movie.The direction is average.The editing is poor.The story is boring. He tells us about Ravi a famous pop singer. He has many female fans. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married. Ravi is killed by his cousins. Kaaal becomes a widow. To escape Primos Ravis. go to Bombay. She comes across Raja. She falls in love with him and gets married. Ravi returns. The story is predictable. The climax is predictable. The first half bores. It also drags a lot. But it is saved by the actors and by the music. The second half entertains. The music is captivating with some beautiful songs. The cinematography seems outdated in t he first half but seems unimaginable. The music images are dull except for "Sochenge Tum Pyar" and a rain song. The costumes are outdated. Any way to watch this just for the actors and music Rating-4/10
