Well, what to say. GOLDEN CHILD falls into the category "so bad, it's good". Eddie Murphy is having some funny (and sometimes boring) lines, but you're still entertained. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as the villain Sardo Numspa (what name is that?). <br /> <br /> Who should watch THE GOLDEN CHILD ... hm ... It's hard to say, but my best guess would be people who like embarrassing movies and could have fun with bad acting, bad plots and a dialogue yet more embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
