I saw this movie in the mystery science theater when it was called "live by night". This title is far less misleading than "Batpeople". In fact, it would be more accurately called Batperson. This movie is about a doctor who studies bats I'm thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies. This is not very clear. What is clear is that he and his wife are touring a cave and he is bitten by a bat. Why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me. He should not be able to go in alone. Well, after being bitten, he and his wife are going on their honeymoon where he starts having bouts. They go to the worst doctor of all time. The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. In the end, the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife is next to him and you should be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.
