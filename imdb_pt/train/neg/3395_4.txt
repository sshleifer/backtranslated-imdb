Nothing in this movie interested me. I thought the actors were sleeping while they were performing. This is not a laid-back method of Stanislofsky, that's just walking and saying lines, I'm afraid. Kidman's performance is sad. The story is, however, slightly entertaining if you want to endure the bad acting.
