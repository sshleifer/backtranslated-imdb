This movie was supposed to be happening in and around Seattle. Why is Porteau Cove Park Shown? Provincial parks are in Canada, not in the United States. The inspector uses a full Palm Pilot with pen to "read" that someone invaded the computer of the bridal shop. I did not know this was possible using a database storage device. A woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced. We learned in the middle of the movie that this woman works in the District Attorney's office. Then, in the correctional center, a guard actually PRECEDA Jenks through a door and stands with his back to the offender !! This would never happen in a real correctional environment. The director really messed it up - it does not happen in real life. The performance is adequate. The lot is good. Cinematography is good. However, the many errors found in continuity lead to 3 out of 10 votes.
