John Candy. Need I say more? He is the main reason for you to see this movie. Most people do not realize how talented he was as an actor. Witness him changing from poor and stupid to naughty. Just a simple (subtle) facial change and there we go. There are many big chunks in this movie and lots of really dumb bits. The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes, as well as the great moment when John (in a trance) takes the stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend - that's how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure reading this, you may think that this sequence seems very rude. Yeah, but it's also very funny especially because it's John Candy who's doing it. The story in general is pretty lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV alumni with Candy) do not have enough to make the movie. Levy has his moments, especially filming the wedding at the end (think Rod Serling) and the great scene when he's talking to his mother on the phone. Overall, a good movie if you had a hard day and need to put your brain in stupid. I give this 4 out of 10.
