Anyone who has studied some physics or cognitive science will come out disgusted after 40 minutes like me and my wife. The ignorant masses can be entertained by the arguments of renunciation of the hand and the absurd "conclusions" taken (without even an attempt of a logical reason) of the real science. I am offended by this absurdity presented under the guise of "science." I can only conclude that the writers took a quantum physics book, did not understand a word of it, then watched the Matrix about a thousand times and started writing this movie. <br /> <br /> For example, the crime experiment in Washington DC was conducted by The Transcendental Meditation Program. A brief survey will reveal the science of your methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
