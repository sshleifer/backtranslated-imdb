This is a horrible little movie - and unfortunately the company that made this short did several others. The short is essentially an idea of ​​a joke that was not funny to start with and can also offend you. This certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children (mostly appeared about 2 years old) cavorting on and pretending to be adults - in this case a dancehall girl and bar patrons. It's the kind of humor you might be forced to laugh at at your own kids if they pretend to be adults, but I do not see anyone wanting to see it - especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed up and acts like a vampire !! And then, other kids act like adults in some pretty adult situations. At the time, I'm sure they were not trying to attract pedophiles, but by looking at it today, that's what immediately comes to mind! Because of this, this annoying movie also scared me and I hope to never see it again !! Very strange and very awful.
