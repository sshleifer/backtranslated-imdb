While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat that causes some alarming side effects ... Occasionally, the scary atmosphere and some decent (though little used) makeup effects do not save . B horror movie to be a sub-par of man-if-creature tale. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night suffers from its senseless story that is awkwardly hatched and lackluster in rhythm. The plot never seems to go very far and the film never offers an explanation for what happens, or even a satisfactory conclusion to all of this. The cast is quite mediocre in their performances. <br /> <br /> Still, I give the film some points for its haunting theme song and great shooting locations. The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is also very good, but there is not much showcase here. A missed opportunity, for sure. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the smaller movies of man creatures out there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
