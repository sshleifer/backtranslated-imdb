I think there are some out there that remind Nicole Eggert of her little girl days on TV shows like T.J. Hooker, Charles in charge and who's the boss? You pervert, you! Maybe you'll remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and had breast implants. No matter, you'll surely forget about it in this supposed comedy about aliens who ate men. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained. How did she recognize the alien? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon? Why did not the alien eat it? You take the picture. <br /> <br /> Before the foreigner eats his boyfriend and takes over his identity, you can see her in Alex Meneses' body. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to see this crap. Stay for the shower scene and the boyfriend, and keep talking about your business.
