The concept for Sarafina seems to be a sound, that is, beyond the musical perspective. He tries to combine optimistic African music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that blacks were forced to endure at the time the film was set. The contradictions of each of the two elements are very glaring and the film never justifies such rapid changes between jubilation and terror. If it had been simply a drama that reflected these conditions, it may have been a good movie, however, scenes of schoolchildren being slaughtered by soldiers are not exactly on the side of the songs. <br /> <br /> In addition to the poor premise that acting is not the best either, Goldberg gives a mediocre performance, just like the rest of the cast. Overall a disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
