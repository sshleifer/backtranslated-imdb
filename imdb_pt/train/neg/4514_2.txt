The problem with the book, Memoirs of a Geisha, is that it had Japanese surfaces, but underneath the surfaces, it was all American man's way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with good music, scenery and costumes, though made by farm animals dressed in these costumes - so far from the Japanese ways of thinking were the characters. <br /> <br /> The film is about Japan or the real geisha. It is a story about some misconceptions of some Americans about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it is not about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy like so many people have said? Yes, but then why turn it into an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture in which there are no puritan tendencies or connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex treated in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri furrowing his nose and grimacing in disgust for five seconds, as if the man trying to ride her had knocked over a handful of roaches in his groin. <br /> <br /> Does anyone really like sex in this movie? No. A character is considered to be promiscuous, but all we see is that she is pushing away her lover because it seems she does not want to be caught doing something dirty. This typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Did Sayuri enjoy her first rapture by an old actress after her cherry was auctioned off? No. She stands there like a slice of cold meat in a cutting block. Of course she should not like that. And that's what I mean about this movie. Why could not they give her something to enjoy? Why does all sex have to be sinful and wrong? Behind Mameha, the president was Sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of his virginity. He could have defrauded the auction and conquered it himself. Nobu did not even bid. So why did the president let that old knocker win it and, smelling of old stench, put his fingers all over her naked body? Would any woman really forgive a man for that? <br /> <br /> Let's try to understand this. For being behind Mameha, the president incurred debt for the training of Sayuri geisha. In order to recover his debts, the president had had Sayuri sold to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha, the President sold Sayuri's sexual favors to that old man so that the President could earn some money from her. The president was not his patron. He was his pimp! A romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is beautiful, but it's like the beauty of a cute and attractive transvestite, whose voice, appearance and every touch are thrilling. But beneath this very feminine surface is a sinister secret. Underneath the Japanese surface of the movie, which appears incorrectly, it hides the ominous secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film are entirely American and masculine. It's not the best thing to be if you're trying to be different from lying, distorting and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Refined, elegant simplicity. Style MOAG ?? Beijing Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Sweaty hair. Geisha of MOAG ?? Loose hair that surely must have been all rolled up in the thick white make-up paste. Japanese scraped ice - the Japanese are quite strict about seasonal observances. Scraped ice is strictly a summer treat. Scraped Ice MOAG - The president buys Chiyo, the young Sayuri played by the wonderful Suzuka Ohgo, this delight during the cherry blossoming season. The thought made my whole body shiver with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Trained and skilled artists. MOIG Geisha - sluts. <br /> <br /> Japanese wind bell - Used in summer because, listening to the sound it makes, thanks to the breeze, the Japanese feel colder. MOAG wind chime - a door bell! If a person were in front of someone else's house and made noises with a sound of wind, he would be considered a lunatic, and would not gain entrance. <br /> <br /> Japan? Emphasis on human relations, group oriented. MOAG ?? "I want a life that is mine" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Traditional Japanese dance ?? Refined elegance. An almost geometric and mechanical precision. Dance MOAG ?? Martha Graham going crazy with LSD while wearing a not very auspicious white Japanese funeral parlor. Taken by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Haha ha! Is it a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha? <br /> <br /> The fire in the house of Japan? Setting or even allowing a fire to happen is worse than murder, because it poses such a terrible threat to the community. Fires can tear apart these wooden villages, towns and cities by destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people as possible. MOAG house fire - Great addition to a fighting scene, but there are no ramifications and, as it is no longer necessary, the fire out of control miraculously goes out. Technically, the film ended here because at least Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among the people who never heard of her again. Which is where both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall are to be exiled. Enough. The movie smells bad.
