DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love sports movies GOOD {Not much in baseball, but hey, your sports movies, right? I was expecting a lot more for this movie. It seems that everything started well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes (whom I really do not like) is very good as the spoiled star. Barkin's role, to me, was fine. She is a good actress, but she seemed out of place in that role. To me, they always seemed to rush into the scenes, and then it creeps a little in some places. It seemed to me uncle to be so unequal! Considering the cast and plot, it could have been a lot better. I rated a '4', and I was being generous ~ I'm a tough guy with numbers!
