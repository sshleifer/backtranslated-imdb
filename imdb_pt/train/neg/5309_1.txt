I saw the movie late one night at the cable and could not believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad movies, but this one was so revolting that it was not even fun. Some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music that is constantly playing throughout the movie, the heinous special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun they become neon green and promptly disintegrate), and disgusting acting. The acting, in fact, is what I feel steals the show. I did not recognize any of the actors in the movie, and I hope I never have to see any of them again. Overall, I highly recommend renting this movie (if you can find it; I can not imagine a video store carrying this crap) just so you can learn to enjoy quality movies after seeing this crap.
