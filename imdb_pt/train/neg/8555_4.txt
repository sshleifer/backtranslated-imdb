This is a very old and cheap movie - a typical low-budget B-Western in many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early John Wayne films that were made for the "poverty" studios. With both actors, his family style and personality were not yet fully formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not look exactly like the Cooper of only a few years later (he speaks faster in this initial film, among other things). <br /> <br /> However, unlike the average B movie of the time, there are at least some interesting elements that make the movie unique (if not good). If you want to see the woman who has been married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita stars as the female love interest and this is a casting very, very strange since she has a strong accent (she was French) and was not even close to being a beautiful movie star. Incidentally, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and weird aspect of the movie is the seemingly gay subplot - like a 1930s BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (and we thought that was a NEW idea). The character of Gary Cooper was created by two men who hate women and do everything they can in much of the film to keep Cooper away from women. This misogyny alone does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues throughout the film that the creators of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, at the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and avoids death long enough to crawl into the body of his fallen friend and then falls - with his arms wrapped around him! This was very edgy for the time and I think this makes this boring movie really fascinating today! As far as Cooper and the plot go, the film is a bit disappointing and very skippable. Unless you're curious about Damita or homosexual tones, do yourself a favor and find a better Westerner.
