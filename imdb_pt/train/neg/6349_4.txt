Woody Allen did some of the biggest comedies of all time and I would seriously consider saying that Annie Hall is the biggest movie ever, but if I really think about it I'll probably think of one or two that are better, but it would be difficult. He had, of course, a few movies that are not good but not as bad as Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he's never had a movie as bad as Melinda and Melinda. Not so tired and so bland, his films are usually spirited and hilarious, but how did this happen, is it still our good old Woody? The plot revolves around four friends who are dining together. Two are writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers. It's about a young woman who pops up unexpectedly at a dinner party. We never listen to the rest because the two writers begin to debate whether this would bring a better comedy or tragedy. From which we begin to see the two points of view. Both focus on this woman named Melinda, who is having problems with drugs and her ex-husband. In the tragedy, she is an old family friend who, after attempting suicide, decided to show up at the front door of her best friends for no apparent reason. The comedy is about Melida, who stumbles upon dinner after taking 28 sleeping pills. Both go in a wild whirlwind of events that really do not make sense or fit, or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some nice performances from Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can not fit on their own. They do not stop sinking more than most other films this year.
