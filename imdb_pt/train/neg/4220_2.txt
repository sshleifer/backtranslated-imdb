A brief review, but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, a complete waste of 90mins. At the end of the movie I was not the wiser about what actually happened. It's full of appearances (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 seconds), the girls "Philadelphia") and some vaguely recognizable people, but that does not make any sense. If the story just got lost in the issue I do not know now, but damn ... <br /> <br /> Put a DVD or go to bed and get some rest !!! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for cameos and a Morris Minor car chase) <br /> <br />
