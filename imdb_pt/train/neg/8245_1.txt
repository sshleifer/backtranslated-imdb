I can not believe anyone liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low budget indie movies but this one absolutely sucks. Low budget does not mean the film has to be time consuming. Horror does not mean that the movie has to be insane. There was nothing scary about this movie. It was just a bloody party, and particularly disturbing. The performance was medium, considering that they were unpublished actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The movie tries to come out as "artistic," or something. This is not one of those really big indie movies that cost just a few thousand dollars to make, but they are incredibly well made. This was no more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions in the movies. Other reviews here have also said that the soundtrack was a drug ... because most were written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the screenwriters of the film. There were no redeeming qualities for this film. A complete waste of my time and money.
