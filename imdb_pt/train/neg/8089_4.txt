I do not know what it is about Donald Sutherland's acting style, or vocal style, but he always seems to be acting behind a lot of soggy Kleenex. He's just ... I do not know, THICK? Sonic? In medicine? Weird. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I just saw the movie again for the first time since its original release, and frankly, I do not remember ending anything like that. A bad ending too, because nothing is tied. And the husband dead? The boring child (and was the boy dubbed?)? Scotland Yard and the military pursuers? I would have liked something wrapped up and giving a dramatic closure to all this, not just the great panoramic tear. <br /> <br /> And what woman sleeps with the man she knows who just killed her husband? Even though she was trying to calm the suspicions of Needle to protect her son, she could always have had a headache. This last meeting made me feel very itchy and uncomfortable ...
