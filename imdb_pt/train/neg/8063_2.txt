I've been waiting for the various Sci-Fi movies and thriller this summer, but I was so disappointed with that particular movie. While some people left the film, I decided to stay, just to laugh along with the other viewers in the acting, lack of suspense, ridiculous ending and difficult to follow the plot. I found myself almost as confused as the main character in the movie. The only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack. This is one of those movie stars that they later regretted doing. In retrospect, I would not even rent this, the more you pay over $ 5 to see.
