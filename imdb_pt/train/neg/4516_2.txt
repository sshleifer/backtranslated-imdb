I bought this DVD set, invisible vision, and wish I had not. The script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book. The lighting is awful, not much polished, but if it were just me I could ignore it. The script does not focus enough on the characters ... there is hardly an introduction to several characters, making it difficult to distinguish who is who (especially on airplanes - has no idea who dies when). <br /> <I've long felt the key to a good movie is to make the audience worry about the characters; if you do not have it you have nothing. There was no focus on the characters - you never knew them - who they were, what they liked ... what made them do the things they do. The series is 5 hours long and is divided into 6 parts ... I bet you're wondering what they did with all this time if they did not detail the characters - they put a lot of stuff into it ... I'm going to say that at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off on their LOL planes (I mean, do we really need to see this again and again ???). I would have given a much higher rating if they had improved the knowledge of the characters.
