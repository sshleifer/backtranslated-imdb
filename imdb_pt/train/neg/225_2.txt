SPOILER: Young lover Jed is expelled by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell) because she mistakenly believes Jed is having an affair with one of her two girlfriends. Kate thought she caught them in flagrante delicto. Kate throws Jed's shoes through the door. Jed reluctantly leaves and then sits down in the middle of the road to put on his shoes. So he gets hit by a truck ("Crushed", one of the meanings of the title). And die. <br /> <br /> "And then he gets hit by a truck." Can you imagine a screenwriter actually sending a screenplay with this element of the plot? Until then, it's a comedy that pretends to be frothy, but it has no real effect. Everyone except Jed is just boring. And then they kill Jed, and everyone's upset, to the very end, where girls learn to love each other and be supportive, rather than destructive. I give 2 ugh's.
