A strange mix of traditional-80s, smartassy, ​​Chevy Chase-type, "every ten lines-you-get-a-funny-one" humbug and black sickie comedy. Slightly fun on points, but totally tasteless. There is a skiing sequence that includes the oddest-looking rear projections since "His Majesty's Secret Service." (**)
