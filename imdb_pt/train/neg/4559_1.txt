I am surprised that anyone involved with the production of this series actually admitted responsibility. The script is so bland it must have been written by someone who failed the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union admission exam (and that's saying something!). Grab your binoculars if you want, but there's nothing like a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been broken to sink with this garbage. The rest of the cast is so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability that I was struck by having passed the first episode - correction, beyond the auditions. All I can say to those who amuse themselves is that they must be very easily entertained. And it's obvious that production costs must have been all 100 per episode. And in case anyone thinks I'm commenting on a foreigner who is not familiar with English humor, I must add that I am indeed English.
