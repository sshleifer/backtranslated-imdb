Hello. I'm Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack from WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this horrible movie that continued Adam Sandler's career but was scanned shortly thereafter. <br /> Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler, who gets a job on a cruise ship. and failed ... or so I thought. Sandler finds babies who like World History, Part 1 and Rebound. Babies should be engaged, but in fact they are run by Sawtooth, the cruelest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler did poorly on Going Overboard, but did better on Big Daddy, Billy Madison and Jen Leone's favorites, 50 First Dates. Drew, Barrymore was a hot girl. Spanglish is on fire, going overboard is not Dooley squatting! End of file.
