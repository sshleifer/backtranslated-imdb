for all the subtle charms that this student film might contain, was anyone else bored to death waiting for WENDINGO to show off his macho paper face? <br /> <br /> The anti-climax practically ruined whatever kind of momentum we had to develop. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm exploring the low point of America, but this is a thunder that gives only a nod to the fact that p. Clarkson looks hot taking it. <br /> <br /> Sadly, from a face of wings. <br /> <br /> The best 2 minutes the movie has to offer. <br /> <br /> If you felt like ripping out the delivery, you could do better.
