A cheap exploration film about a search for mothers by their daughter who was kidnapped by people who make porn movies with snuff. The track takes her mother all over Europe as she searches for her son and we, in the audience, struggle to continue sleeping. <br /> <br /> This is one of the countless sleaze movies that are made for people who want the excitement of porn without the stigma or danger of appearing on your credit card bill. Personally I'd rather have the stigma, since these films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we're seeing. This is supposed to be a sexy thriller, but it's not. Most people talk about things followed by many walks from one place to another and lead to leadership. Periodically through the film several people take their clothes off and everything has more than a touch of S & M in the procedures. The material of violence and fetish is the kind that causes laughter instead of horror or even excitement, it's all so incredibly fake. Worse yet there is not enough nudity to keep it interesting. (Basically par for the course for many of these movies) <br /> <br /> You will forgive my lack of detail but it is simply a boring movie that I stayed at the end expecting something remotely prurient to occur but there was nothing . The most interesting thing was the blonde hair villain with the huge bite and nose the size of a Buick. I watched her with a morbid fascination imagining how she was when she was young and wondering if she had had plastic surgery, not the kind of thing you should be thinking about in an exciting thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
