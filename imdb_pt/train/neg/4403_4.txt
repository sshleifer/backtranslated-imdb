Whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the film shows local residents in Iran speaking Arabic, rather than Persian. This is enough to lose credibility for those who have the least knowledge of the area or the country. The landscape could not be more different from the current one. <br /> <br /> Other factual errors: A train is running in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan has no railroads. The Turkish ambassador is wearing a Fez (the red hat), while Fez was banned by Turkey long before the time the film was set. The daughter of the Turkish ambassador is dressed like an Indian, and Indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers wanted to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic.
