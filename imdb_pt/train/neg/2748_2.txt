this movie only gets a second star because I work downtown and I enjoyed seeing it destroyed. the effects were very good - I heard it was the most expensive Korean movie ever made. being the most expensive and yet utterly horrible makes a huge waste of money. I rented it so I will not complain much about what I paid, but it was a couple of hours I will never go back. the plot holes are plentiful. terrible performance across the board. I do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie, life is too short. If your friends want to watch, run away. I can not emphasize how bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> Where the hell came the second dragon? Why did not he show up earlier? How did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs only 500 years ago?
