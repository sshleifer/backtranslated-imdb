Steven Seagal .... how could you be part of such a horrible movie? I rented this movie because its movies are usually well cleaned. I've lost a lot of respect for you being in a horrible movie like this. Very, very bad taste! I'm ashamed to have even rented this movie. Steven, if you continue acting in movies like this, I believe your career is over. My husband and I like to watch a lot of your movies because you can always "get the bad guy" with some hand maneuvers and make it clean ... and also the language is pretty clean in your movies ... but this one and something else. I'll think twice before renting another movie of yours.
