A singularly dull musical comedy that artificially tries to marry the explosion of avant-garde rock'n'roll with the sensibility of the middle class of a suburban sitcom. The result is a rancorous mishmash that will not satisfy the audience who chose the song but who will at least keep their parents satisfied. <br /> <br /> A quick look at the article about promotion. the back of the video release should give an idea of ​​the content. Tom Ewell is a drunk, exaggerated agent with so little comic ability that you almost expect him to yell "hi honey, I'm home!" The synopsis says he's "so funny in 'The 7 Year Itch.'" Sounds almost like an excuse. What other movie would be sold in the fact that a major player was good at something else? He says, "So funny in 'The 7 Year Itch' ... but he sucks at it." <br /> <br /> Mansfield, a pretty girl with 50-inch rumors, is, unfortunately, a bargain basement. Monroe with all the acting ability and timing comic of a rotten haddock. Its timber delivery combined with Ewell's OTT dual jacks make this a Hell-Comedy partnership. For its part, the sale gives us: "[Jayne Mansfield], whose most obvious talents are the cause of many of the film's biggest laughs!" As you can see, a movie sold with the idea that lead has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things. Most of this "humor" is the man literally falling on himself, his glasses breaking on the Mansfield site, etc. Only the Freudian nightmare of an overflowing milk bottle raises doubts about its "U" certificate. <br /> <br /> On the musical side, most adenine players are chosen. Would you really like to see Eddie Fontaine offer: "I love your eyes, I love your lips, they taste even better than french fries" in a song called "Cool It, Baby"? Only the incendiary Little Richard leaves the MOR, although he is forced to sing some of his more father-friendly songs in a four-minute sequence. And how do all acts sing without a single microphone? Attempts at satire in the industry are broad and childish in its conception. <br /> <br /> Technically, the image was quite advanced, with special effects (including a Julie London ghost) and deluxe color (which now looks flat and indeed with its bleeding reds and fake-looking skin tones , it resembles a colored film). Direction, however, is not great, and the sound quality is also quite poor. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's about being so old. At a time when men were still smoking on the screen, sickly, cute child actors made adult comments, and black servants could only cook and dance. (Everything that happens here). However, Some Like It Hot, The African Queen, Ben Hur and many more are examples of period films that can still be enjoyed today, so the "good in time" argument does not really hold. In her heart The Girl Can not Help It is a cynical and paternalistic enterprise that does not inspire closely. 4/10. <br /> <br />
