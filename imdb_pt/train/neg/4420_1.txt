"Everything a great documentary could be"? Yes, if someone is deaf, dumb and blind. Everything except meaning, intelligence, visual style and interesting subject matter. Apart from that. . <br /> <br /> Seriously, volken. This is a completely inauthentic movie. A doc of adventure without adventure, a war doc with no feeling of war, an exaggerated conversation with no trace of humor. It means nothing, it seems nothing, and carries the implied message that nothing matters at all. No wonder he has so many IMDb fans! Of course, going on you know that a movie starring the great Skip Lipman will have no culture, intelligence, wit (plus a corrosive teenage prank), and no recognizable human emotion ?? Just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are many real documentaries and very little time in life to waste it on bathrooms like "Darkon".
