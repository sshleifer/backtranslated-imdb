This really does not do the blues justice. Does it begin badly with pictures of the voyager probe and the blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone blind anyway) apparently narrating from outer space (?) And telling us the life stories of various blues musicians. As it is, this may be the most visually interesting part of this documentary. After that, the only thing to see is actors singing incompetently the classic songs, filmed in fake 20-year black and white interspersed with the likes of Beck and Shemekia Copeland rapping the same songs later. This is a good device to show us why the great Blues hits were really great, but not for a convincing vision. There is practically nothing here that can justify making a movie and not a radio piece. No one should be forced to see these badly made scenarios. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for the Blues. Avoid at all costs.
