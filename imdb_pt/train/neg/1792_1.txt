Let me start this review by saying this: I love vampire movies. They can suck, and I'll still love them because vampires are cool in movies. Van Helsing, considered by many as a pile of crap, was pleasing to me because of the fact that there were vampires. You may ask, "What does this have to do with this movie?" The answer is that I intend to inform you of how horrible this movie really is, that even a sucker (harharhar) for vampire movies like me can despise both a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The film starring Van Helsing, a college professor who is not at all convincing. He is a terrible actor, like everyone else in this movie, and he wrote, to add salt to the wound. I honestly did not want to offend him, and I'm sure everyone had fun making this movie, but watching it was really painful. I'm not sure why I watched the whole thing; maybe it was a morbid fascination, like watching an impending landing gear: it's awful, but you can not force yourself to look away. His main flaw is that it's so annoying, and his plot is so ridiculous, even for a science fiction horror movie. <br /> <br /> But I disagree. By the way, Van Helsing has sex with his mother. Of course, he does not know who she is at the time; he just thinks he's one of his students (which is still illegal and all, but not so disgusting and scary). <br /> <br /> If I were Van Helsing, I would at least take an Oedipus when I found out I did something so disgusting. He would have done something funny if he'd just made some comment about it, but no. The point is not even raised by any of the characters. It's as if the writer did not even think about it. I would have at least another character laughing at him and saying "Ha ha, you had sex with your mother," which would be slightly humorous (though blatantly immature). I'm probably running out of space, so a few more words to dissuade you from watching this movie: there's a ninja vampire fight with an old man. It would be funny, but filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. Nor is it worth watching the movie to see how bad it is. Stay away, far from it, if you value your time. <br /> <br /> I'm going to say one positive thing about the movie: the guy who plays Van Helsing is very clever with that knife. There is a one minute thread where it spins around your knife and actually does some pretty tricks. It would be annoying in any other movie, but here, unfortunately, was the highlight.
