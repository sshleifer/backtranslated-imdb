This mini-operetta insists on a prototype of Eddy-McDonald in a scenario of Valentino is so bad that it becomes a resistance exercise after five minutes. It's nonsense from the beginning, because this brevity opens two military officers discussing the lack of masculinity in the son of one of the police. In less than a minute he is sent to Morrocco, where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe who prefers to sing than to fight. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have fine opera voices (with little acting ability) and there's a decent bass there, but the acting is so random scenes so poorly prepared that you have the feeling that they they are making things up as they go along. <br /> <br /> This roll was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. With more space for parody and warble the show may have had some entertainment values, but this quickie quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation.
