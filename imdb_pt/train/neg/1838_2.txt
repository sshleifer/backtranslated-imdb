"Envy" is bad for several reasons. Yes, there are characters that can not be loved. This is not the problem. It's that they are nasty and we do not care about them. "The War of the Roses" featured unpleasant characters, but due to appropriate presentations, we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their destiny, while in "Envy" the presentation is thin, the characters are never believable, and the plot only worsens things. Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I am a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller campaigned for this to be released directly to the video and now I can see why. The film proposes that he is "best friends" with Jack Black, but in the first five minutes we receive images that seem to indicate that Stiller hates Black. I thought this would develop into some kind of unilateral relationship (a la "The Cable Guy"), but never, instead, Stiller insists that he is his "best friend" and I felt confused as he treated Black as , well, "poop." The plot of the film is ridiculous, but it does not matter, because it is a tale of exaggerated morality. Unfortunately the message is lost in the mess. Walken gives a good performance, but Black is out of tune and boring (and I usually find him very funny). No, it's not a horrible movie, but I still can not believe Barry Levinson ("Rainers") is responsible for this - it's not one of the worst movies ever, but it certainly could be a lot better. I wanted Va-Poo-Rize to exist - so we could make this movie disappear forever ....
