That makes the actors at Hollyoaks resemble the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is jaw-dropping on how horrible it is. Turning off the DVD player was not a sufficient course of action. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap their faces. I'll never get that time back. Never. How can you create such a banal, boring, soulless movie? I could not think of a course of action that would relieve boredom. Writing the ten necessary lines is incredibly difficult for such a shameful piece of film. What more can you say than to reiterate how terrible the acting is? Please, avoid.
