This Italian film is basically a soap opera. <br /> <br /> The VHS box said it was rated "R", but the on the actual tape said it was "X". The latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking. Even in the dark, you could see Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers having all sex with this guy - and, yes, you could see his cock in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time a "leading actress" did something like this on screen. <br /> <br /> Detmers parades naked in various scenes, but his face is even better than his body. She was beautiful. Unfortunately, the film is ugly ... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite the appearance of Detmers.
