Who am I? I am not kidding. That's what it really says in the video case. <br /> <br /> Plot; short version: Pretty woman is standing around smiling. This, for some reason, causes all men to kill themselves. <br /> <br /> "Find Ariel ... Where's Ariel ... I can not find Ariel ..." She's right behind you, you idiot. <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this horrible Space Opera has already been said, it seems. <br /> <br /> A bunch of cheesy actors playing most of the damned comes after the first. The selection of actors is eliminated very quickly. Then they are knocked down in the same way. Each scene is broadcast almost fifteen minutes in advance. Maybe it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had more time on the screen and higher salary. The alien virus / hologram / witch VR / glitch looks physically impotent and does nothing. Why can not she stay on the computer instead of doing her "teleported vampire" routine? (Actually, it would be more interesting if she were a vampire, or it was more than just looking at people, which is all she does, that's enough to make all men kill themselves ...) This is not really a space movie. There are many more photos of the old western trail, the Easy Rider trail of the 50s, the night scene of Film noir, even a run on the beach in fantasy lands, none of which has real depth or even makes sense. The nightclub scene is black and white, of course. He worked with "The Wizard of Oz." It does not work so well here. That's probably a good thing, since the few photos that show of space are depressing. You'll probably cry during those times, especially when you see that whirling "spacecraft," which seems about three inches long. <br /> <br /> Nothing is felt for any of the characters, not because they are doomed or have no personality, but because they are in serious need of acting classes, with the exception of Billy Dee Williams who actually looks depressed and at a loss, probably for being at work ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that, when viewed with friends, will cause some extremely "loud" silences, especially when the nerd throws away his attempt to comics (including the line about kissing a meteor in French ...? I heard that? right? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original girls of virtual reality are "dead", which does not mean anything, since they are not even real to begin with. Well, the other "characters" are not either, but this is not the case. Haha. <br /> <br /> What's funny is that the scene that graces the video box is sort of something like an alien horror skull (green filter added on top of that, to give more than one ... uh ... look green) which is actually the android after it is dead and finally has nothing to do with anything else in progress. <br /> <br /> Another strange thing I noticed. Whenever there's a blast (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything gets highly pixilated. I do not mean a LITTLE pixelated, I mean huge blocks about 1 / 16th the size of the screen. Wow.
