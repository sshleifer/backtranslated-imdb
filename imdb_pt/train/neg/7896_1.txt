I do not know why this movie seems to have received any great reviews. <br /> <br /> While watching "Bang" one night on TV, I found myself bored with the nonsensical plot that was taking place on the screen. The entire film seems to be no more than an exercise in self-indulgence, meaningless and artistic on the part of the filmmaker. The fact that the director / writer uses only one name only reinforces this sense of pretense. <br /> <br /> Those interested in indie movies would be better off looking for something better written and daring, more fun than this complete waste of time.
