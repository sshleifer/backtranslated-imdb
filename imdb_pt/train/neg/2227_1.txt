From time to time, someone out of nowhere looks at me sideways and asks, "What is SNITCH'D?" I know immediately that they have a badly hidden amusement + horror affair. You see, I was the film's director of photography. <br /> <br /> Let me clarify a few points about this "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. . I met James Cahill in July 1999, the day after I put on the TRIANGLE SQUARE, an excellent 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the time was never distributed, despite the festival's accolades ... it was the eternal victim of the fine print of SAG. notorious contract of experimental characteristics. But I disagree ... <br /> <br /> I thought I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little 16mm gangster movie with a budget of about $ 25,000, not wanting to break the beat I took it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... I also believed in the myth of the time. <br /> <br /> Let's just consider "film school" for many involved, including myself. SNITCH'D was filmed for two weeks in August 1999 in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama at a high school in the city (yes, he is an English and drama teacher ... consider this while watching the movie, or even notes the use of the apostrophe in the title), hence the cast and location. A note from her cast was the only known dramatic appearance of the girl from Channel 2 Morning News, Vera Jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and was so anxious to get a movie on her curriculum. I must say that her professional dedication, focus and attitude "Let's do it" inspired me and was a shadow of her stardom still to come. SNITCH'D suffered from low optics, few lights or electricity, several operators of lance du jour and delivery of an offline uncorrected for duplication. None of this obfuscates the actual content, which speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in 2003, the movie was sold to distributors (with a net loss, I understand) that inexplicably did not have photos of Eva in the box (so she was a name on the rise, working) , but managed to get a clear picture of what appears to be an authentic Latin villain to give SNITCH'D credibility. Since Cahill's other passion is dealing with old books, it seems to confirm that he believes you can, in fact, judge a book by its cover ... since many chose this DVD based on its cover. ----------------- A year later, Eva, now in a soap, and I met James for a day to film a simple short that he invented, SPLIT SECOND, I guess who has never seen any game despite the intention of the festival. <br /> <br /> 6 years later, I was hired to film another Cahill movie titled JUAREZ in Mexico. I thought he had worked the process; my participation depended on cast, script and control of the team, and the resulting film looked promising in the newspapers, so it was ... a cheap detective story about the mass murder of girls in Juarez; Despite the allegations here and elsewhere, the film NEVER appeared in any festival or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed that the film has distribution and was just waiting for the release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio shots on it subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER CITY.
