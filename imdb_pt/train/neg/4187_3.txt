A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" is little more than an 87-minute video clip for a doxen or more of the composer's works. Instead of dialogue, the film relies exclusively on Young's lyrics, which are heavily mingled with sociopolitical comments, to tell the story while the actors act out of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Given the hammy performances and the poor quality granulation of the photo, the effect is the equivalent of Young blowing some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption. Although there is supposedly a "story" throughout the film, we really have no idea what's going on, thanks mainly to the unpolished aspect of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateur ineptitude of acting. All we get for eighty-seven minutes is a bunch of elderly hippies playing silently through an incoherent narrative, while Young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. The whole thing turns into a tedious exercise in self-indulgence. "Greendale" gives poor quality to Hollywood's low budget film.
