I have to say that I was very curious to see this movie, and was considered a notorious disaster when it was released by 20th Century Fox in the 1970s. It also appeared in several critics lists of bad movies, and this only increased an interest, as I only I had to see what made this movie so bad. Seeing this, I think I have my answers. Although I say that this is curious, the acting, the direction and the script are so laughable, that the supposed satire is completely absent. Racquel Welch seems to try to take the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex change operation, the film goes so far that she can not handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner certainly does not help as he licks and looks at the screen, sometimes it seems he wonders what he is doing there. Rex Reed recovers as Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his own masturbation scene celebrated. Bravo for debut shows! Farrah Fawcett plays a blonde ass; she certainly seemed convincing in that role. But, of course, no doubt the most notorious role was to the west of Mae. The sight of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more appropriate for a horror movie. I do not intend to put that cast down personally; but in this movie no one goes well. The direction seems so unprotected and non-existent, that the film is not only bad but also tedious. Add some old footage of old stars and make the movie even more disconnected. For every one of you, to anyone who would like that, and I was glad to at least have seen it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that has always been regarded as being from the beginning.
