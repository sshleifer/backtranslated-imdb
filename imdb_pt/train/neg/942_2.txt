I saw it late one night at the cable. At the time I did not know that the girl advertised as "Shannon Wilsey" was actually a porn star like Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and she was so often naked, thank God) that I really sat down with that bullshit. I like cheese movies as much as the next guy - more than the next guy, actually - but that was far beyond cheesy and more rancid. The fact that the mad scientist and the virtually total inefficiency of the director's people, writers, and special effects, the virtually total incompetence of people, undermine the free nudity that is the movie's only saving grace. Savannah, before turning into the plasticized Barbie Doll that has become a porn queen, is really interesting to watch - she's unbelievably gorgeous, she explodes in uncontrollable laughter sometimes, looks out of the camera and laughs and generally seems to be having a good time, which is more than can be said to the public. For although Savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this naked picture, she still can not hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, badly made, and annoying movie. If you know someone who has it on video, or if it is cabled some night, check it out, but do not waste your money on a rental.
