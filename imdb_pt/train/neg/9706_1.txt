... and I actually gave a ZERO on my personal scale of 1-10. I've been watching movies since 1952 and I've seen well over 1000 people in the movies (I do not classify movies that I see only on TV). This is the only film I have ever rated ZERO. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (then ages 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the children thought it was terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who warned me about this site (amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4+). <br /> <br /> The animation of the dinosaurs seemed amateur at the time. (and even worse in hindsight), the acting (particularly by Sean Young) is atrocious and the plot is just silly. <br /> <br />
