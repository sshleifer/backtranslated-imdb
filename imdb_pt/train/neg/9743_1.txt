With this line begins a British and boring science fiction film. The Great Vorelli of the movie "Doll of the Devil" builds a teleportation machine only to have its financing cut by Blanchard, a bearded man who likes butterfly ties and men with big eyebrows. When his experiment fails, the good doctor discovers that Lembach, the man who controls all the world's concessions, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to project himself into Blanchard's house with the help of his handsome lab assistant, Sheila. Needless to say, something is wrong and it ends up looking like a mouse. The rest of the film is dedicated to the good orange-haired doctor walking around London shocking people with his mutant hand and wearing a diaper on his face. There are a few more murders, some modest paperwork, and finally the doctor disappears where the doctors face. Luckily no one decided to make a sequel.
