It seems that the cast must ensure at least one medium movie. And so I sat for 102 minutes of disbelief. Alongside Ed Harris, no one seems to possess the acting skills. Even Sean Connery, who I usually love, must have had a day off during the whole Just Case shoot. Not once throughout the movie could an actor convince me. <br /> <br /> That made this movie look cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> The story does a little. It's exciting, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> The conclusion only watches this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do.
