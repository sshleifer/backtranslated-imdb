I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were in it, so it looked promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on the scene. He is a very bad actor and should not be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he's one of the most boring and uninspired actors I've ever seen. He puts absolutely no emotion on any of his lines. Why on earth has he been cast as Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so annoying that it sounds like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It may sound legal, but trust me, it's not. <br /> <br /> Now, the acting of Dylan McDermott is very good. It's about one of the few good things about this movie. He is just inspired. <br /> Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. He has some nice lines. <br /> <br /> About the story, although it was a bit obvious and overdone at times, it was good. I was expecting a major turnaround when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.
