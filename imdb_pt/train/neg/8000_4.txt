I already know that critics and some audiences say it was a satire, there were numerous political and social messages, names refer to a few other names, and so on. Can be. I can not perceive such things (I do not want to do it anyway) because I'm not interested in, I'm interested in 'cinema'. As for the film itself, it is again said that the film is clever and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything we do not see in the monster movies except the scene that happens in an office in the second time. Yes, this scene says something about humanity, but it does not make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining (moderately) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw in the movie, it's the visual effects. It was shocking, I could not compose myself for a while because I expected a realistic monster, because it is not one of Gojira's old movies, it was made in 2006, but it was not. It's like you do not believe there's a monster, you can not care. If you agree with me on this, I strongly recommend Cloverfield which is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics talk about it as if it were a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it's more of a drama than a suspense or an action, but it should not mean that it's dramatically powerful. I do not want to compare The Host with other monster movies, but I try to say that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not. By the way, it may be that some people call the film's masterpiece because of its sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I also like Asian cinema, but that's the fact.
