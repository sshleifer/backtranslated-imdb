In the sixth grade, all the teachers decided that it would be a great idea to make this film the curriculum for a whole semester. Each class had something to do with this terrible show. We watch in English and write in newspapers as if we were one of the characters. In math we talk about graphics and other crap. In science, we talked about whales (which was actually quite interesting, so it was not a 100% waste of time). Every day was torture. Not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day, making us watch it in the study hall as well. I could see if this was a new series or something, but it was like '93. I'm still trying to block this.
