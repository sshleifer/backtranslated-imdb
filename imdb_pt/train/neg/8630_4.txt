I know that in this episode there are other things besides what I'm going to discuss, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, the fact that we received a very negative opinion from Jin when we saw Sun's flashbacks in "The House of the Rising Sun", we get to see Jin's side and get a new and more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is one element in this story that has left me so deeply uncomfortable that it has greatly undermined the enjoyment of the whole episode. Earlier, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it had been suggested that Sun's father was someone who enriched by obscure and illegal methods. I thought maybe he was a mob boss, even; Peas operate in Korea, as in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode, we learn that Sun's father is indeed the chief (or top executive) of a Korean automotive company, and that Jin was physically attacking a government official (who would actually be murdered) <br /> I may be especially sensitive to this because I work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is SPECTACULAR offensive and racist even to suggest that this sort of thing happens in Korea. ; that big and serious companies such as Hyundai or Kia (which should be the model for this fictitious car company as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) operate with these mafia methods rather than any normal automotive industry automobile industry. West is unbelievable to me that writers would dare to write something like that in history, and that there was no uproar in Korea because of it. It seems strange to "buy American!" propaganda, portraying foreign car companies as criminals, untrustworthy, third world clothing.
