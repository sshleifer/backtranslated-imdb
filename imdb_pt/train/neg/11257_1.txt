This movie seems so empty. In all scenes of the movie, the maximum number of actors on the screen is 10. As everything was filmed in front of a blue screen, there are never any extras and the movie looks strange. <br /> <br /> ACTING WAS HORRIBLE! It is so obvious that this was in front of a blue screen because all the action scenes you can see the actor / actress wondering around half a race when they should be running for their lives .. Looking at the ground for their marks. Spoilers: You'll also see yourself banging your head watching the movie. At one point at the base of Captain Sky they have 100 airplanes sitting on the landing strip. They advanced warning that an attack is coming ... So what do they do? anything. All the planes are blown up and once again the ONLY person who is fighting back is Sky Captain ... <br /> <br /> EVERYBODY is under attack and he is the ONLY person who has ever fought against . At the end of the movie you see hundreds of plains finally taking off ... but what do they do? Nothing ... the movie is over ...
