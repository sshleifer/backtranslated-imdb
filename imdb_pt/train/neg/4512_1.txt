Having lived in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even come close to explaining what it is to be a geisha. Unfortunately, a great opportunity was lost to bring Japanese culture closer to the wider Western audience and help demystify the country of origin of Zen, Samurai, the world of Kyoto geisha. Some of the film's most poignant moments are when Americans are shown in Japanese environments. The geisha dances were not authentic. There was much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: the proper use of the incense was nowhere to be found. The scenes of Sakura were almost obscenely kitschy! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese people.
