My friends and I rented it for "Bad Movie Night" with high hopes, but The Brain was a disappointment. The brain itself is gloriously like a fool, but for the most part just sits on its small platform. Who thought it would be cool if the brain only started chewing three people for 94 minutes? This film has a number of things at the beginning, including a protagonist of Estevez who plays a rebellious genius (we are told that his enormous intellect is misdirected in his elaborate play and school acrobatics, which include putting crazy glue on someone's chair). He also has some great lines, a hilariously out-of-shape and breathless hustler who can barely be everywhere, and yes, some girl gets naked. However, the director desperately needs some education in the art of rhythm. During the last half, things start to drag on, with at least 3 or 4 nonsensical chase scenes that make up the middle third of the plot. The scenes inside the PRI complex are especially bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same ladder. I could have corrected the script for this thing in half an hour - more cheese, more blood, more nudity, more brain action. If you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cool to look at while my superego is turned off. Maybe the director was really trying to bring audiences to his movie - I started to feel like one of the zombie dwellers at the end of this crapfest.
