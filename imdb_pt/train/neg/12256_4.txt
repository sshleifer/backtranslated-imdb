Oh God, I must have seen it when I was only 11 or 12 years old (do not ask how) I may have been young, but I was not stupid. Anyone can see that this is a bad movie, unpleasant, coarse, shameless and very silly. I've seen more stunning effects at Disneyland, I've seen better performances in a school play, and I've seen more compelling crocodiles at the zoo where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring kids hitting the glass <br /> /> The story takes place in Northern Australia. A handful of ambitious youngsters are experimenting with a new water sport, surfing in shark-filled waters. It soon becomes apparent that something more dangerous is in the water. Once they learn what, they get the help of a middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge their family's food. <br /> <br /> I think I've seen all the crocodile films made in the past. fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc movie I think, with Primeval and Crocodile following behind. <br /> <br /> The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in over one hundred. injury or death each year. Films like Blood Surf spoil not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the spectator's life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
