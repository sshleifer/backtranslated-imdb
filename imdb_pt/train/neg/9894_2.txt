I missed the beginning of this movie, which may explain why I did not like it that much. On the other hand, I studied the fall of the Roman republic for years, so I know the story. So again, this may also be the reason why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate that I do not think they have made an attempt for it to be correct, in which case it can be forgiven. The curious thing is that sometimes they strive to be historically accurate and end up getting confused. How to play Antonius's marriage with Octavia, and then take him away two scenes later. Why even bring it if it does not fit the plot and Octavia is never seen? And how to call Antonius by his real name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Despite historical inaccuracies aside, the film could still have been a fun watch if it were not for the protagonist. There is not an ounce of dignity in it. She is hysterical, dramatic and completely without control of herself. Instead of being an intelligent and composed queen, Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a severe case of PMS. 95% of this comes from bad acting, but 5% is also poor writing. Many stupid dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you were not watching Antonius and Cleopatra, you were watching immature versions of Dawson and Joey from "Dawson's Creek". <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something about this period, see ... anything beyond that.
