I still can not believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of crap. This movie is worse than "Deadly Friend". The plot is stupid, the acting is mediocre and the movie is deadly bland. I do not know why Wes Craven hates his debut "Last House on the Left," an absolute masterpiece of the genre and (probably) likes this turkey. Do not get me wrong, I really like some of your movies, but it was a real torture sitting and watching this.
