Disappointing and undeniably boring true crime film that has barely cast character actor Jeremy Renner languidly mumbled the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most well-known degenerate / serial killers of the last century. Launched directly into the video in early 2003, "Dahmer" is a snore-boring, boring, boring, misrepresented, and virtually bloodless drama of a truth that never delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the mass murderer. as if it had the perfectly good potential to do! What he does, however, try to do for reasons unknown to me is to evoke some kind of sympathy in the viewer for man, portraying him to be what is ultimately a lonely, nebulous and severely socially unfit homosexual loser who was simply looking out for love in all the wrong places, as opposed to the sick and cold, calculating and depraved he was! Overall, 2003's "Dahmer" is one that fans of real crimes everywhere can also skip because I'm not joking when I say it's one of the worst biopsies of serial killers ever made! It's even sadder than other junk straight into the pathetic video and explorer like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
