Ok, I absolutely love Ben Stiller, although I'm warm with Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act in the least. Every movie or sitcom I've seen in it is very difficult to overcome its false acting. Looks like she's just reading the script. This movie only had one good thing about it, and that's what Ben Stiller was into it. This plot is so used and abused that it's ridiculous. How many movies have this same type of plot? Can we say "Forces of Nature ??" It's not just the storyline so old, but the result is so predictable that it's annoying. I knew everything that would happen before that. It was annoying, but watching Stiller is always a delight !!!
