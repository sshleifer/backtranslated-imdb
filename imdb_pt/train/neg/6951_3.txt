You do not just hate it when you order steak, but does the restaurant give you chicken? <br /> <br /> That's how I felt by watching this so-called "Battlestar Galactica". Arguments can be made about their quality, but the fact remains, NOT what the fans asked for. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you were sitting in that proverbial restaurant I mentioned. You waited years for them to bring back the famous New York steak you loved. When your meal arrives, you think they applied the name "New York Strip" on a chicken dish. You complain, but the waiter merely states "but ze cheeken, ees really good zir"! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted New York Strip - a steak! The waiter then explains: "You zee zir, ze chef wanted to do, as you zay, zomezing NEW. We felt ze cheek would be more popular zo, gave him the name of our delicious previous deesh." You ask if you will ever find the original New York Strip on the menu in the future but are told that because the restaurant has a dish called "New York Strip" now on the menu you will never see the original New York Strip - /> <br /> Such is the case of creating something NEW and beating the namesake of "Battlestar Galactica". <br /> <br /> * This miniseries is an affront to all fans of the series. original show * It is a pity that the production team in charge of this new version has despised the original. The team in charge of resurrecting BG should have loved the original series - looking to improve what fans loved, and not try to blatantly sell this new series by exploiting the name Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> If the science fiction channel wanted to give us a new show, then do it! Give a new name! Do not use the name that we fondly remember in an attempt to attract viewers. This effectively robs us of the chance to see any resemblance of the original in the future. <br /> <br /> We've been waiting 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we like something about the original! We did not simply want the NAME and the remnants of the basic concept. There are things we LOVED about the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, probably the BEST elements of the original were those that were omitted. Of course, the original BG was flawed and could have used some update. This miniseries, however, was not an improvement in every respect, but the special effects (which were good but not uncommon by today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will discuss the quality of this material. NEW show, but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> That said ... I will offer some comments on the merits of this new mini by itself (not compared to the original): <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were the best part. Effort was obviously put into making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look to that effect". I would not say that these sequences were exceptional by today's standards, but they were in keeping with the original films made. What was the problem with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some views have tried to fake the effect of a "real" camera with delayed tracking and uneven zooms. However, it was overused considering there was no apparent SOURCE from these cameras. The infinitely smarter series, Babylon 5, is the only time I've seen such "live cameras" being used effectively, when we were supposed to be witnessing Security Cams action. <br /> <br /> The script, you ask? The script seemed to have been written by a teenager to other teenagers. The characters looked cardboard and stereotyped. In fact, the whole story fitted from other well-known stereotypes. The only good features of the whole story were the few elements that were preserved from the original series. He was obviously "stupid" for the digestion of his average TV audience. <br /> <br /> Human interaction was regrettable. Instead of drama based on subtle looks, expressions and perfect timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious that they lost all ability to move any refined viewer. Such was obvious in any interaction between Adama and son. The director must have tried to ensure that the most dense and insensitive spectator did not miss even if he paid no attention. Sorry, but real humans do not behave like the continuum. <br /> <br /> I would not have considered this a BAD show if it were on its own. Nothing great; he will never be revered by true science fiction fans or artisans, but would be assisted by the masses. I personally could have lived without it, though. I just watched to see how it really captured the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> How this miniseries will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been left aside to attract larger numbers. As even the SciFi channel "dumbed down" their productions to cater to the masses as opposed to their true niche market, fans of Science Fiction. It will be the time we ordered steak and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave you with just one thought - <br /> <br /> DO NOT "MOORE". <br /> <br />
