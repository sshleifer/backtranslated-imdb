This is a confused and incoherent confusion of endless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. This is no exaggeration: you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to get involved with it. <br /> <br /> I honestly thought Fassbinder would do something interesting to say why Erwin / Elvira's suicides at the end but instead, in each scene someone is trying to explain: "When he was young, it happened ... "and" he just came back from Casablanca and had everything cut there ... ", etc. Briefly in the film, Erwin / Elvira is in a slaughterhouse talking to a friend of the prostitute (certainly a slaughterhouse is the best place for a pleasant little talk), and as she tells the story of Elvira's life, Fassbinder shows the death of a cow after another. It is difficult to choose between paying attention to disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying. Of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of "I have suffered much in my life and am about to die." <br /> <br /> In one of the sparse moments in which something really happens, Erwin / Elvira meets an ex-lover, who only after performing an extremely gay choreography with two other guys (as if seeking the necessary level of homosexuality) is that he recognizes Elvira. There are some interesting plans and ideas, I must admit (as when the nun tells the story of young Erwin), but everything in the film is wasted because of Fassbinder's self-indulgence.
