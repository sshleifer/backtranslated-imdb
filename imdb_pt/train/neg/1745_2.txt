The first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters. however, all of a sudden, everything was happening too fast, a bad reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very loudly acting both by Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the movie, Paresh Rawal did well, but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. Overall, this movie was the film's biggest disappointment does not do its trailer justice. save your money and do not watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br /> Summing up: a cheap stage performance show and appearance to the film no story or substance, the plot was extraordinarily no- Feel good music from Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom! keeps! film filmed in a room, newcomers (female cast) were fine since it was their first movie, but established actors like Akshey and John were totally disappointed with an established director like Priyadarshan who made his worst movie ever!
