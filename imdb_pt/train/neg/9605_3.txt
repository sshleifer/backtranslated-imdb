This 70's Italian movie is NOT even in the class with Dog Soldiers, The Howl, or even that terrible American Werewolf in Paris, BUT ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a gorgeous blonde, go crazy in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic nudity, complete ... it's obvious she's a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is a joke, SFX is childish and acting (most of the time) stinks. The only redeeming value of this film is all (and there are MUCH) scenes of nudity and sex. Tame by HBO standards, but still fun to watch when you meet without a date on Saturday night. OK ... HERE'S THE SPOILER ... THERE IS NO werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine's ancestor.) The girl just imagines she's a werewolf ... in other words, a clinical lycanthrope.
