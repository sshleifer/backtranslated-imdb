I'm not a big fan of slasher movies as a genre, but even by the low budget exploitation standards, this is really ridiculous. Even on a level of nudity and gore, it's incredibly annoying (there are some of the two, but it's all kinda ... meh). Before the domestic video revolution, it could not even have been released in theaters (although it may have been, after all, Plan 9 From Outer Space was shown in theaters). There is precisely a good line (and competently delivered) throughout the film; I suppose they stole it from somewhere. <br /> <br /> The acting is among the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had some competent actors, and the rest tended to be ridiculously hammy, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of their actors could pass as literate. Here, those who do not read their lines, like the Indians in the cigar store, seem to have learned phonetically. And this film has a distinction: it manages to be malicious for most of the movie, and then too derided for the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have chosen the actress playing the receptionist as a She is not no way out of wood. Not that she is good, but she certainly is not of wood.) <br /> <br /> Even the worst horror films are usually good for some Puritan meditations in their grotesque offensiveness, but with this, it seems like there's nothing there to create moral outrage. <br /> <br /> And you know the funniest thing? They clearly hoped to make a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a strange way. I sat through the video wondering why anyone would bother doing it.
