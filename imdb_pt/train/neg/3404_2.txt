I'm not going to get this movie through all the myriad techniques, it would take two days to describe how the whole thing is not remotely possible. Others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities. Given all this, I still might have liked it if they had not included all the sentimental, nauseating, infuriating, Disney crap, which is so out of place anywhere, but nowhere else. that in space, where the slightest mistake can mean instant death. The "crew" as well as the "real" astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their stupid nonsense ahead of all the rest. This completely ruined whatever value production may have left. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that NASA has left this garbage aside so that so many people have so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you have not seen it yet, save yourself the irritation. Watch Apollo 13 again. At least this tried to be half real.
