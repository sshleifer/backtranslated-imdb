(Dir - Harold Young): The third film of the Universal mummy is about the same as the first two, as well as the final result from the point of view of the viewer. The story is similar and the results are discouraging. This time the location of the story is in the US when the new follower of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country in the hope that it can revive it to kill offspring of those who opened the original tomb. This time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (which does not make much of a difference because he is not really asked to do much acting for this character). The new priest becomes a morgue keeper in the city and sends the mummy to do his dirty actions after giving him the tanna leaf juice. Again, a girl gets in the way, when the priest falls in love with one of the couple's grooms and wants her, yes - be immortal with him (have not we heard that before?). The plan is of course frustrated when the inhabitants hunt the mummy with torches (similar to the Frankenstein monster) and the burning of the creature ends the story ... how do they get a sequel ?? I think you'll find out with the next series? or not.....
