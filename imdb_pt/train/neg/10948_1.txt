What were they thinking of "Cannes"? One of the most annoying movies of all time. Every detail of this film, no matter how insignificant it has been shown. If I had to watch her put on her boots one more time, I think I would have screamed. If the purpose of this film was to show how pathetic a Rosetta's life was, then it was covered in the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits were supposed to be running. But no, we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over again. The whole thing was full of unfriendly and unfriendly characters. They deserved the misery that was Rosetta. And to think that I went through "Tumbleweeds" to see this super boring movie. It was like watching the grass grow, only it is more exciting.
