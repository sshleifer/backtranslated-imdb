Even if you sign the commercial anti-free policy of this movie, it's still just the same tired note, played over and over and over and over again. Clink clink clink. Even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles, Reverend Billy is very difficult to see as a serious figure. The clownish Reverend is the kind of person who wakes up every morning without a more ethereal aspiration than seeing his own face on TV before going back to bed that night. He has a beautiful wife, I have to admit, but it would take a lot more than that to save that mess of a movie. The endless bus rides are the worst part - with the progress shown - can you guess? - by a colored line moving on a map. Ah, you guessed it. Well, it has the virtue of being short. Is that the only good thing I can say? Hmmmm Yes, afraid of that.
