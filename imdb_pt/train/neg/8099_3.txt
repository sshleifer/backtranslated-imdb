This was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great movie were definitely there. But casting decisions completely destroyed the film. Hanks is a great actor for sure, but he does not have the ambitious and morally necessary features for the lead role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. Placing Melanie Griffiths for reasons of eye drops is understandable, but again she has not portrayed depth or ambivalence, so it is necessary to do so. <Br /> <br /> This film is a great example of how all decisions, even the first ones in filmmaking, can make or break a file.
