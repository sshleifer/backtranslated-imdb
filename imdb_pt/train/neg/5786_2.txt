When you look at this now and hear all the language here, it's amazing that this is classified as "PG", but that's the 1970s rating system for you. Peter Falk vomits the Lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! However, few people find this offensive, and certainly not the cheaters who make films or the people who "evaluate" them. The cast is a hint of how profane this movie might be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly actors you would not find in "The Sound of Music". <br /> <br /> I like assault movies, and many director films. William Friedkin, but this script does not deliver and has much of what the '70s' Sleazy do, visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk on TV's "Columbo," it must be a shock to hear him use both profanity and movies. This is far from the only case.
