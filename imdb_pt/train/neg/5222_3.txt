This is really a very bad movie. Because? First of all, the story is bad. It's an artificial story, combining all kinds of things that do not make sense. It just seems like a bad experiment. Second, actors can not play realistically. They can not even talk like an actor should. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do with it now?
