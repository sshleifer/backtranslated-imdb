I did not feel like I was raped like I did with the ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS, but BELLE'S MAGIC WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, though not to such an extreme degree. It's ugly, non-canonical, idiot, and the writing is horribly bad. None of the stories work. These are not the characters we love from BATB, they are a bunch of pod people. I wanted to dissect him, but after a few minutes I gave up, because no one in his right mind would take this claptrap seriously. What we have here are three stories. "The Perfect Word" is a preponderant and thoughtful study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Folly" only works if you can accept that the name of Babette is actually Fifi and that she is a villain in the James Bond wardrobe and that Lumiere is an idiot with regard to women. "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind" as I like to call it) is probably the most hideous of the group. Does the beast hate birds? Since when? Do not watch this crap - all copies of this video deserve to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and the human soul.
