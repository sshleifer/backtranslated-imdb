DD movies were damn, they looked stupid and had a plot that looked very thin, but in those days they were a plot at least. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a comedy but a mixture of melodrama, romance , all <All drama scenes are disproportionate <br /> <br /> Comedy is funny, but also tacky <br /> However, the movie keeps you entertained, in those days Govinda's movies were loud, coarse, but they had some funny moments where people liked <br /> <br /> David Dhawan does a good job Music is fine <br /> <br /> Govinda acts well in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in parts and bothers in parts Kader is as always Gulshan, Prem Chopra is typecast Shakti is hilarious
