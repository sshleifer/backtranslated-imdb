I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico and ended up watching one about the Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I do not see the 50% that live in poverty. When I see people in difficulties, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently arrived on the island. There is no such thing as Spanglish ... or you speak Spanish, or you do not ... and from what I heard ... you do not speak. Pedro Albizo Campos is not MLK for me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence, which is 1%. For the rest he's as crazy as Osama Bin Laden. Puerto Ricans who want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want some proof for all of you, dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico, see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all of South America, Central America and Mexico. Its worked wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about the Nuyoricanos and their struggles. <br /> <br /> For the person who complains that Africa was not enough was on the show ... it was supposed to be about Puerto Rico ... it's not Africa. Denzel will make one soon for you. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... for all those ignorant whites who think we need green cards to come to the US, and want to learn how the PM manages things. , this is not a good documentary on the culture of Puertorican. Tell your children to pay attention to Geography and History classes. <br /> <br /> *** *** *** *** Bocabonita ... "doc." it was about Nuyoricans. She promoted as if it was how we all feel. It should have been titled ... "yo soy nuyorican ... lunche ... can not speak Spanish." PLEASE STOP USING PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA OR ANYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH PR WITH THIS NUYORICAN HISTORICAL LESSON. God forbid they throw it on the island.
