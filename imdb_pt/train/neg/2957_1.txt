What a mess!! Why was this movie made? This and other films of their "caliber" should be teaching tools on how not to make a movie. Children may enjoy it, but anyone over the age of 10 can or will disapprove. To make matters worse, it was the fact that such talent as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were totally wasted in a movie unworthy of any prior notice.
