This movie of very low budget comedy reaches only low budget. Dialogue is incredibly stupid, chase scenes are evenly annoying, and most of the money on the screen seems to have been saved by a series of accidents and explosions in a parking lot during the last five minutes of the movie (a pen-cap briefly glimpsed). at the beginning of this scene is certain that wrecked and vomit crap in the main villain of the film - there is no support here without a purpose). The whole film is depressing reminiscent of those who occasionally leave the studio of Rodger Corman when he first gave a director a few dollars and a camera - but without the discipline that Corman would impose.
