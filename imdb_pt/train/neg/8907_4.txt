I rented this on DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a kind of "character study" of the movie, so I struggled to watch it about an hour before I hit the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with a theme character study, I just could not get into that movie. Maybe it was my mood to want to see something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but leaving that aside, I tried my best to finish watching, but I gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the overall combination did not come together to keep my interest. The only interesting thing was that the sergeant's weapon had been stolen and he hurried to buy another, and the spray painted black to look like a police matter. I think this movie should be entitled, "Who Stole the Sergeant's Gun?" Scenes were well done, but by joining them I once again felt stolen by something cohesive to keep me watching. As I have not finished watching it, I would say that there is some merit in renting this movie. .. perhaps. For me, it was a waste of good visualization effort and time. I'll leave it to you to try, but it's not one I highly recommend.
