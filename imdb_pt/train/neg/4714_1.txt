I really want to give this piece of GARBAGE a scratch, unfortunately there is not, so I had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly awful this family cartoon impostor really is! The characters look like they were designed by preschoolers, no, wait, I've seen preschoolers do better! I prefer "Misadventures of Flapjack" to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I'm probably saying what the others said, two words: RIP OFF !! Remember that episode of Dexter's Laboratory when they raced kart for the volcano? Yes, Mr. Fellows even took that idea and failed! They even stole Shadow Lugia in that episode that parodyed Pok√©mon (he even won with that franchise!) That character is a cheap Mandark theft from Dexter's Lab! Mister Fellows needs to be sued for legal infraction for this piece of crap !! Everyone has their own opinion, but those who like Johnny's (RIP-OFF) test are lying to themselves. Do yourself a favor, change the channel when this theft tries to embarrass your screen!
