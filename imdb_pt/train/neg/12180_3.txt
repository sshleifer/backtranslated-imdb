This movie is absolutely horrible, but even so, it can be hilarious, although this humor is totally unintentional. <br /> <br /> The plot went beyond ridicule. I do not even think a 2-year-old would be convinced by the ridiculous idiocy that the filmmakers tried to put together in a story. On the positive side, however, some of the horrible plot twists provide a great deal of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in your backyard!" It gets worse (and even funnier), but I'll spare you. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally laughable. Most of the children's roles are kind of cute, but not very convincing. On the other hand, Annie is very bad. Adults do not take their roles seriously, but that's largely a good thing. If they tried to be believable, the film would have been even worse. Which is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> As soon as you surpass the overall quality of the movie, there are actually some highlights from near-no-crap. The scene in which Lady Hogbottom's son runs off with the maid is surprisingly hilarious, though it is an annoying disappointment when caught by the police. The butler's character, though much smaller, is a ray of sunshine that hardly ever penetrates the darkness. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie really caused me physical pain. However, there were some redemptive parts that made her almost watchable without starting the bleeding internally. Judged on its good parts alone, the film would be about 5; unfortunately, the rest of the film hardly deserves a 1. So I give a 3. <br /> <br /> That's very generous I would say.
