As if there were not enough people floating around yet, we have another clone of GODFATHER's lame GODFATHER director IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) I had seen earlier this year. The name of the trademark at that time is Telly Savalas, who belatedly enters the process and is seen for the first time behind, preferring to camp to the flowers and wearing a beret in the style of the French painters! Besides not seeming Sicilian minimally, he has no accent other than his well-known accent. Antonio Sabato then creates an unlikely gangster - as well as being a tough leader; his relationship with Savalas, who becomes paternal in the blink of an eye, is not convincing either (especially since he subsequently romantically engages the thrilled teenage niece)! Also, for a gangster movie, there is precious little action and none of it is memorable (although the end in a clinic is well treated); moreover, Francesco De Masi's score is useful, but nothing more. By the way, the DVD that I rented at the beginning of the business starts in the middle of the credits, so none of the cast members - or even the movie title - are listed!
