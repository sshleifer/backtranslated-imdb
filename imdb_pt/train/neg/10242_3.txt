This film was made by a bunch of white guys who studied together. Well, there's nothing wrong with that except it looks like it was done by a bunch of white guys who went to school together. 90% of the cast are white males of the same age. It's almost like watching a bunch of guys at the boys' camp who turned on the camera. The movie has no plot. Simply repeat the same action of the blood bath after the blood bath. There are some funny scenes and pieces of comedy. But they do not rescue flat monotony. <br /> <br /> Graphic drawing scenes are used to cover material that was obviously beyond your budget or features to make, and not very well done. All that can not be done with white faces running on the beach covered in blood is made with cheap animation. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino. piece. Well, the trailer footage is as good as it already was. The rest repeats the same kind of mundane, mindless comedy. It works sometimes, but it gets annoying after the same thing comes to you several times. It's more like a string of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie. It's a kind of comedy. I can see where the idea of ​​the story is intriguing. But in this post-apocalyptic film, America is very much like medieval England. In fact, Wheatlry says that the ideas of history came from that time. He plans to do a part 2. I think he thinks it's Tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing. At the LA opening, Wheatley mentioned that he will bring back practically the same cast in part 2. He was asked if he could consider a more diverse cast in the next, to which he replied, well yes, clear.
