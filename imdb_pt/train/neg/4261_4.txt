Pathetic. This is what happens when the director comes to work just because someone else is paying him. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, great locations and scenarios for a film of epic proportions. But performance, dammit! I swear, in some scenes you can see extras in the background looking at the camera, or looking at the actors, because nobody told them what they should do when they heard "Action!". The battle scenes are so bad you imagine - are these people real? They could have done more damage just by hugging. In slow motion scenes, you can see people on the battlefield walking or just standing, shaking hands. <br /> <br /> Only the action in the foreground is emphasized in some way. But for what? The story is so illogical and discontinuous, it seems like random situations in chronological order, sometimes not even that. The dialogues are stupid, the plot of love is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million, and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, at best, the end result of all this huge effort is a shiny round disk in the thin cover placed. on the shelf in the video store.
