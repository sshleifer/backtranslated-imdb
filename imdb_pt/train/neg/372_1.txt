I've seen this movie once a long time, and I do not feel like seeing it again. <br /> <br /> This film is about Preston Waters, a difficult pre-teenager who seems always to be neglected by his film. family and that always seems to be with little money. All this changes when a bank robber runs over Preston's bicycle and passes him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to cash out $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a mansion and says he is working as an assistant to a mysterious and wealthy sponsor named Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that, he just goes crazy with the money. <br /> <br /> On paper, this sounds like a great idea. However, on screen, it's one of the most empty films I've ever seen. On the one hand, it's unbelievable. I know some parts of the movie should be unbelievable, but I draw the line for a twelve-year-old boy hanging out with a thirty-year-old woman and being in charge of the small fortune of an imaginary person. In addition, this was a superficial film with weak acting, a predictable plot and characters that are less than memorable. The characters were either extravagant, exaggerated, annoying or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
