I got pissed when I could not see this movie when it was shown at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw it being broadcast tonight, I put it on as soon as I could. So it was worth the wait? Well let's back off a bit as I still have to give you the plot. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know what his path is in life. Enter Duke (George Wendt), who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray totally hammered asks Sean to turn off the guy they had Sean running around. And it continues from there. Which brings me back to the question. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the buildup was very good and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He just picked up the ball and ran with it. But it's not nearly as violent as I was led to believe and somewhere along the time of the movies the ball is not just knocked over, but messy and taken in the other direction. I know where that point happened exactly, but I can not say without ruining the movie. But needless to say, it happened. The ending does not save the movie either. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be good as "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My notes: C <br /> <br /> Where I've seen: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows his ta-tas in a fantasy and in then in the next ta'tas and below and ... OH MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
