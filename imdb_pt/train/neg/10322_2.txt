If you want to be offended or amused or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really is not even very thought-provoking other than redoing the usual silly cliches. At the end of the second episode, I felt a little embarrassed for actually going through the fabricated mess. <br /> <br /> In addition to the disguised and disguised premise that drew all the initial attention to it, first of all it's just another lame, harmless and antiseptic attempt at comments and entertainment that CBC typically outperforms in production. And once the "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" The hype arouses your welcome, the show is likely to follow for the canceling ether because it is so perfunctory when judged on its merits alone. <br /> <br /> Unless you are obsessed with Muslim culture in the West and / or It is easy to have fun with the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject. I really do not see how LMOTP is enjoyable besides satisfying the curiosity that originated from the hype. Other programs have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multiethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.
