This British cauldron has one thing to do: the boys are uniformly handsome. Older men are opinionated, right-wing thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the Reagan / Thatcher years. Young or old, however, the moral in this three-part mini-series is universally suspect and no one comes out particularly well. <br /> <br /> Nick is a handsome young gay, just out of Oxford. It is not essential to the story, but it has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair, which makes it much easier to watch this small talk. Nick arrives in London with a friend, whose father Gerald is a wealthy conservative politician, and takes care of his sister Cat while the family has fun in the south of France. They fail to inform you that when annoyed, the Cat cuts itself with a variety of knives and other kitchen utensils. Nick confuses his "gratitude" for affection and draws near, discovering too late how much they despise him and sponsor him. Inexplicably, Nick has lived in this house for four years, but as the plot depends on that point, it's best not to question it. <br /> <br /> Although Nick is nicer to see, he is unbearably obsequious. His demure subjection to wealthy fanatics soon made me climb the walls. Deeply closed, except for Cat (she guesses her great secret in sight), he likes a little anonymous sex just to know that he is really gay. Although it hardly seems possible, Nick takes a lover who is even more closed than him. <br /> <br /> The supercilious Tories despise and insult the two blacks in the film, so imagine the poison that vomits when Nick's sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid. Gerald, in true conservative fashion, got involved in a number of personal and financial scandals, so the revelations about Nick heighten his embarrassment. This gives Gerald one last chance to punish the unfortunate boy. <br /> <br /> Except for a brief moment of indignation, Nick takes the abuse against him in silence and tacit agreement. Denial, self-loathing, naivety or ignorance? You decide, if you can sit with this whole thing without playing something on the set.
