When I first saw the film's cover (a giant insect chasing some nurses) And the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I was not in any big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheeseball movie, which always does a good job in whatever role he faces. The FX is pretty rough, there's not much plot, and I'm still not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey because there is nothing in this movie to do with the monkey. But come people, what did you expect? It's not as bad as it sounds .... If you like the old 50's black and white bug attack movies, this is basically an updated version without the FX special updates
