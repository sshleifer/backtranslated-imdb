This comedy has something tolerably funny, surrounded by many bland things. Just about every scene involving the castle's servants and their antics is a waste of time. And plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming it, or if they were just making it all up as they went along. (* 1/2)
