It really started the 1980s trend of disgusting violence disguised as a "horror movie." I was the target audience for this garbage repellent and I was disgusted as now. <br /> <br /> Oh, where do we start. Let's see, the setup: You can bring people back to live IF they died a violent death. So this ridiculously weak premise is the excuse to kill people horribly, because, well, that's necessary to bring them back to life! This could have worked if thrown over to black laughter at the Re-Animator or something. But no, it's played straight. There is a whole family terrified in a cart that is hunted, one of the few scenes at least where death is off the screen. However, virtually everything is on the screen. In fact, there is a scene where a young woman who is walking is beaten and killed by people from the zombie city, who are filming and smiling with several cameras. Then there is a close-up of his face as filmmakers love - and consume time - reveal in the time-lapse photograph their beat face being carved into a skull and rebuilt to look "normal" again. This was made, of course, by Jack Albertson as the undertaker behind everything. He likes driving in an ambulance / hearse playing Tommy Dorcey's old songs, I think this should be cute. <br /> <br /> In the end, of course, even the sheriff is undead and the doctor graciously offers to fix rotten hands. It is not clear why the sheriff is not out with the other people in town killing children cheerfully and cutting their faces, sticking needles into the eyes of victims of burns, etc. <br /> <br /> I wonder, do I really wonder, what people see a geek shows like this to give any kind of rating at all. It's not scary, the twists and turns are laughable and overall it's kind of sickly. It's not even enough to "see in a challenge" or enjoy a level that you can watch a bad movie from HG Lewis. It's just awful crap, made for people who get on with this kind of nonsense, and made by people who are looking for a paycheck. <br /> <br /> It's sad that Albertson was involved.
