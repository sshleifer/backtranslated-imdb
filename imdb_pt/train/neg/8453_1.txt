This movie is a confused miscellany of recent movie clich√©s. There are some promising ideas there, but while the director was clearly trying to do away with an astonishingly ambiguous film, what he ended up was a messy mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job, but without a central theme, it seems he does not have much to work with. In addition, the film is largely stripped of scares (although, to be fair, there are some scary moments in the midst of grueling work). <br /> <br /> * SOFT SPOILERS * We have the mysterious death. a strange twin, devilish librarians, spooky love interests, identity confusion, death by wild monkeys, Oedipus conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and criminal gang connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is that although the brother's death by monkeys is heavily featured on the cover of the DVD, the act itself is never portrayed directly. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be a stock of monkeys - not too scary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Avoid that one. For an excellent tale of psychological and ambiguous horror, check out the Korean movie A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
