I went to this movie believing it had good reviews. First of all, it's ridiculous that they're releasing a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later, in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even for 2001, the film seems to have been made with a shoe string budget. There is a scene in which a taxi reaches a man to work out how low budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he's doing in the movie. He ends up giving a long monologue to the end. If the film had sparks sparkling during the scene, I missed it when I was sleeping in my place. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt resembles a devil. She wears basic and awkward clothes for random kids. As for Alec Baldwin, a scene in which he meets Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins correctly put it, "Go home and write better!"
