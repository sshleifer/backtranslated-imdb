I read reviews about this being the best Chinese movie of all time. Maybe if the only Chinese movies you've seen do not contain any dialogue, long glances and distant silences, and hacking the edit, then you're in the right place. <br /> <br /> Complicated history? Difficultly. Try juvenile and amateur. Exquisite humor and haunting memories? Difficultly. Try boring and banal flat-out. <br /> <br /> That was horrible. I could not wait for it to end. Particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of "How are you?" "I'm fine, are you sure?" Wow!! What depth of character. I think the incessant cigarette should speak for them. As a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed in that. Even Zhang's sentimentally mellow "The Road Home" was better than that.
