I'm not interested in The Pallbearer, it's not so bad, but just too slow at times. While the film continues, it gets a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but sometimes I do not care about her and she's right here. The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like the leads then you can have fun.
