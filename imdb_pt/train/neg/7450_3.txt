I've seen this film in the movies for many years, and one thing struck me so negatively that I could not see redemptive virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a cop who never smiles or smiles while his smile and smile are two of his marks recorded. Danny Glover was chosen as the villain, but - once again - the imagination of most viewers could not go far enough to believe him in that role. In addition, Jared Leto was not credible as the former medical student. The tension was simply not there, since the killer was known very early on. The end was again neither dramatic nor tense: no one around me cared what would happen next. All we could hope for was the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing night spent at the movies.
