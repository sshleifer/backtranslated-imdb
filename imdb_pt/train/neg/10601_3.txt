This is the official sequel to the sci-fi action thriller '92. In the original, Van Damme was among several veterans killed in the Vietnam War revived to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). Nessa, I think, about twelve years later, since Van Damme has a daughter of that age. Now he is working with the government on a classified facility to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site supercomputer (called Seth - as the "King Cobra" snake in the same year) goes insane, takes over the Unisols and even transfers his computer brain to a new super-Unisol body Jai White). We are looking at the next step in evolution, folks! Most of Van Damme's fights are with a particularly wicked Unisol (professional wrestling fighter Goldberg) who just keeps coming: knock him out of a building - not good; Run it down with a truck - do not go! Shoot him, burn him - forget it! Much of the humor is connected to how Van Damme is now out of style and out of class (he's getting gray at the edges). But although he takes a lick, he keeps kicking! Most such sequences are weak imitations of the originals, and while this is certainly not a stroke of genius, it can be consistently fun, especially if you're a fan of wrestling.
