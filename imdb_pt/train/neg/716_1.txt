This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no plot, the gags are only for retarded and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching. In all of the movie Fredi (oh my god what a funny name. Ha ha) do not ask ONCE how it came from a plane to Middle Earth. There are plenty of stupid and totally bland characters whose names must sound funny. for example. : Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I did not even smile once during the whole movie. The jokes seem to have been made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is stuck in the door (this happens about 5 times), then this movie is perhaps for you. Another funny scene: they try to guess the code word for a closed door (do not ask why - never ask "why" in this movie) and the code word is (ha ha): manure. So if you laughed at this example, you might like this movie. For everyone else: go to YouTube and watch "Lord of the Weed": it's much, much more fun.
