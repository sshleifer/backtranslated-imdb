This movie is incomprehensibly bad. It starts with several random bursts and then cuts to a stocking puppet of a T-Rex that speaks (!) To the audience. He goes back and forth between the sock puppets and all the animation, probably because the filmmakers could not afford actors to live. I will spare you the long, tiresome and relentless plot that drags this pitiful movie by brutal 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video in a hobby shop somewhere that sells off prints b-movies, and he bought them for the sole purpose of making fun of him, but as it turns out , our intervention was not necessary. This movie makes fun of yourself better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from Outer Space" was the cutest movie ever, but I let the Japanese / Lego / Sock puppets outta it. If you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and worth many, many good laughs.
