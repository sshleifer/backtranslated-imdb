I do not quite understand the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was very kind giving it 4 out of 10. What could have been a wonderful story with a set of more or less decent actors became a total sham my eyes. There are so many cliches in this movie, women's hair is horrible and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or false. There is no real passion in this movie, but a lot of actors overcoming any limit it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to actually play, so in my eyes, it's no good. Watching, I could not believe how something like that came to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But ... maybe it was still okay and only lost in the translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen and this certainly is not in a good way! Excuse.
