One of my sister friends lent me this game, and it's very difficult! It bears the appearance of a children's game, but you have to learn how to make tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and place your hands in all sorts of strange positions, and you have to look for seemingly infinite levels for 100 notes. improve your 'score'! You also have to find those pieces of impossibly hidden puzzles that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! And I'm only up to stage three !!!!! Maybe if you have no life, you can stay at home all the time, you can have some fun with it, but otherwise stay away! AND IT IS NOT DEFINED, RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN - THEY WILL PULL YOUR HAIR WITHIN THE TIME!
