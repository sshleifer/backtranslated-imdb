One would think that a movie about a young person coming to terms with their growing homosexuality would be anything but annoying. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it is about ten times more potent than any sleep aid on the market. It's almost as if the filmmaker * considered * making a movie, but becoming lazy and deciding instead to run a series of random images (and randomly GHOSTS) and go nowhere, to cast some real scenes with real acting, to pretend that good lighting is not important in the process of producing films, and wrapping it under the auspices of an "art" film. This is exactly the kind of low quality product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional filmmakers to poop with the motion of indie movies, and that prevents the general public from embracing indie movies more easily. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in films about this subject, it would be much better to tune into some of the great short films available on Logo's website or rent Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip that piece of keg.
