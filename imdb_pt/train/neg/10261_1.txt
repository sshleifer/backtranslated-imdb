Wow, I just saw this on TV as one of the "scary" movies that they show around Halloween. This was rated as G? There was really nothing to make this movie scary, or worth watching. Also, other people say this is a fake, but I do not think so. For a parody, you need something called "humor". This low-budget party had no humor, and it also did not make much sense. You basically have a silly looking monster coming out of closets, killing people, I guess, since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath. The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I guess that's good enough. <br /> <br /> The military tries weakly to kill the monster, who is not much bigger than a man. They have a very bad goal. Then the military fly! Wow, did this movie make the US military look pathetic or what? The monster, though difficult to kill, does not do much more than shuffle and roar. Oh, and occasionally a second head comes out of his mouth and screams. It was a slightly interesting but total alien rip. <br /> <br /> What was the deal with the scientist who is playing the xylophone to attract the monster? It was difficult to understand much of the dialogue because of the poor sound quality. Also, why did the monster charge the main guy for so long? Why did not the monster come into the closet when it had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to understand the fool?
