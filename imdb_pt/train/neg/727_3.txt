I'm really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started doing some of the most incredibly annoying cartoons I've ever seen. I did not laugh once over this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny, for goodness sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Unfortunately, this short ends up being Good Night Elmer (another incredibly annoying Jones shorts) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign of a bland cartoon is always without gag payment. Good night Elmer was boring because he dragged the same two jokes forever with predictable reward. This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull caricature: there is a lot of dialogue. The drawing at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most seem longer than thanks to the immense cushioning of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes dinner, and comments, "That was pretty good," possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in later Woody Woodpecker cartoons). does not count in my book). Even though this cartoon has only 8 minutes, it looks like 20 thanks to a redundant dialogue like this. <br /> <br /> Elmer's pet bunny was not a fun drawing for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to recognize that he's directed a few clunkers during his career, you can have fun.
