A cowboy who sympathizes with the situation of a nearby Indian tribe is unjustly accused of rape and murder of the chief's daughter, leading to much hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> This feature of nerds is fun to see, though completely impossible to defend at any artistic level. The horrible costumes and the fact that all Indians are obviously white make it look more like a live action design than the serious production the newspapers claim to be. <br /> <br /> In short, plentiful nudity (the real reason to watch this) is good. Everything else is not. There are definitely better examples of both genders. <br /> <br /> More interesting is that the Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who were probably already in the murder can at the moment in which it hit the stained soda screens of the Pussycat Theater!
