I had a crush on this Kari girl for a while, and how far she looked in this movie, no complaints. But after picking it up last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I'm sure: that's the only thing in the movie that is not inferior. The script is horrible, the acting is horrible, the direction is awful. I saw in another comment someone commenting how great the sex scenes were ... what? Not at all. When a movie is so bad you can turn it into softcore porn, but instead I see a white guy grazing preventing me from seeing Wuhrer's body and scenes that offer me nothing more than a tease. They should have gone only cinex so the movie was not a complete waste of time, but no. With such a bad script, they should have taken advantage of Wuhrer's appearance, since this is the only defender of the film. 2/10, just because she looked so hot.
