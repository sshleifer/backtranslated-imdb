A long awaited film .. But this disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day ... The trailers looked like an action movie, but ended up being a comedy out and out (a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting of these professional actors, they did very well their part of the film. Good acting, but I do not think I can save the movie. India was filmed beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) They were all saturated with color, alright. However, the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was filmed made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-) <br /> <br /> The action sequences were filmed with much shame, no one could make out head and tail of acrobatics, they used Akki (akshay kumar) very well, but could have been made much better .. <br /> <br /> The animation is the worst I've seen in recent movies (The 90s movies had better animated scenes, I think (the initial scene where the car is falling 'fly should be a better word' the road to the lake). And the name of the movie has been mentioned almost every 20 to 30 minutes, just to make sure the audience does not forget the name of the movie, I think ..
