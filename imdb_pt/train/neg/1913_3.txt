"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Considering the people involved, it should have been several times better. <br /> <br /> Watching, if you're at least a bit tied to the faith that's going to get better, will probably make you cry. It's one of those movies that had potential, but it was stolen from that potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad deeds, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss, but whom I care so much about. I do not even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only grace of the film is the strange vocabulary it introduces. I found myself thinking about it again and again as I watched more of the crime. This is the only reason I gave the film a 3. The plot is tedious, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily offensive and highly unpleasant. They are in constant state of agonizing stress and are all so annoying that I have celebrated their obstacles. They yell at each other and curse crassly. The dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid on its low points. <br /> <br /> I think Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for this. They should be tried for war crimes if one really remembers that crap long enough to care.
