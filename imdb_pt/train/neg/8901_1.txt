I'll make it short and sweet .... this movie sucked !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest movies of all time, gave 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought maybe parts 2 and 3 were good sequences, I was wrong. This movie bored me to death and was so different from the first, that the plot continued and that was it. It was like bad exits from the first part or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him here. I was so happy with Glenn Danzig being in this movie, but do not blink you'll miss him. There was a cast full of bad actors and people I do not like, like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he is one of the funniest people on Earth. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you like the first one a little less, so do not watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself by being a fan of part 1. I'll wait a few days before watching the part 3 and I pray it's better than this crap. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the movie with lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown in the film. Fast forward or skip to that, if you can not stomach the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - this was horrible!
