I really like asylum films. I created the habit of seeing as many as possible. Even the scams they did were legal as EXORCISM AND WHEN A KILLER FLAMES. This is simply lame. I can not believe the same people who did DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE really made this movie too !!! It's not at all ridiculous like Jolly Roger or Alien Abduction (which, by the way, are pretty bad). That's just bad! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an Asylum movie, but this movie takes itself very seriously. I really hope SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better. Now this is a movie that I can not wait to see.
