Although this is "better" than the first Mulva (which does not say much anyway, I'd rather watch the paint dry) it still sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these guys from Low Budget Pictures. I was sucked into buying some dvds to support some indy filmmakers and I regretted it. Some have not yet been officially "released" (not illegally bought by the producers themselves) and I can not even list how bad they all are. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them as they appear in other small indy movies that they are friends with. If you're friends with these guys, chances are you were in your movies and having fun doing it. But for those who had to watch them? No way. Bad video, bad audio, bad acting, bad plot ... etc etc. These are not even funny. I gave this one a 2 because Debbie Rochon is in it and that's about it. Maybe it does not even deserve the 2. About a 1 1 / 16th star to show it was a bit better than the first (which I would have rated negative). If you want a decent budget film, go get some of the LBP "friends" at Freak Productions, like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes. These are really decent.
