I saw this recently with my wife and found out that it's better than Caine believes, even though it's not much of a cop. Britain's greatest film actor of all time does not seem very interested in this role, which is a pity, since he could have raised him with more conviction in his game. Rex Harrison seems even less bothered, perhaps unsurprisingly, since his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his time on the screen is fleeting and, once again, his character is not well scripted. Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen but has very little to do. The film may have gained a lot by focusing more on its story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically playing a comic book character completely out of the serious tone of the film. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many senseless cameos (his career has been based on it for decades). Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively, he was an annoyingly unpredictable film director, and this is one of his weaker films.
