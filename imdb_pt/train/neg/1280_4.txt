When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "The Harvey Girls". It is not. It is a pudding that overcooked, hit the kitchen ceiling, and was plucked and patched. No music and not a play of the period, but completely improbable. <br /> <br /> It begins with Patriarch James Woods telling the eldest of his three daughters, a small child growing up to be Barbara Stanwyck, that she should keep the family name. and at home. <br /> <br /> We think, therefore, that it will be an intergenerational historical history. And it is for a brief moment. Then it turns into the story of Stanwyck's fight against the lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead against him? Well, why else? As we learned in a strange sequence of flashbacks narrated by Stanwyck, she had thought she could inherit some money (both for her sisters and for herself, of course) by getting married. She found someone she considered to be a country hick, who was actually Brent's attorney Brent. <br /> <br /> So that no one thinks that the child they had, a young man of eight or more at the time of the main plot, is - well, you know ... They had a hasty marriage and during the short space of time they were together, it was conceived. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young, who is played by Gig Young. The other sister tries to take him away. Etc., etc. <br /> <br /> It's a strident, uncompromising mess - well crafted, but without a trace of logic or plausibility.
