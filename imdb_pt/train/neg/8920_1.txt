... but this has to be the worst An adaptation of Christmas Carol of all time. And it takes some time, with the likes of the various efforts of Lifetime. Do not get me wrong - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I liked her tremendously in other roles (see Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script gives him no choice but to chew the scene. And chew on what she does, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim joining a Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Give me the classics at any time: Alastair Yes, 1951. With the exception of perhaps Scrooged, all others are just exaggerated efforts to understand the past, present, or future Spirit of Christmas.
