Watch Live by Night makes you wonder, just who in the world gives the green light to this crap. A newly married couple will caving in on their honeymoon, is attacked by bats and her husband starts running in pajamas attacking several people. And where exactly are they? They are in the desert so they are skiing so they are in a small town that seems to have mountains nearby. The city is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal revenge against the crying doctor. The ski hospital is run by a really stylish guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you full of anger. Make-up guru and special effects Stan Winston made the effects for this film. I think you have to start somewhere.
