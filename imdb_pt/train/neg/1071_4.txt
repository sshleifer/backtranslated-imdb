A very weak film, mainly because of a poor story, but also of bad acting in the case of Robert Downey Jr., and irrational behavior of many of the characters. If you are someone who likes to change your mind and simply watch a movie for your creativity or acting criteria then you may like this movie. Personally I can not do this with a drama and I find this very exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I am particularly annoyed when a main character, who is supposed to be a smart person, acts continuously like a complete jerk. In that film, if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in such situations, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> The first highly improbable act is when the main character, a successful lawyer named Magruder. , played by Kenneth Branagh, is leaving a party and happens to a girl, Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, who is screaming that his car was stolen. They are standing in a tropical storm while he gets her to take a ride home. <br /> <br /> She tells him about her strange father who belongs to some kind of strange cult and does crazy things. When they arrive at their ruined hut in the poorest part of town, they realize that their car is in the garage. Also the house lights are on and some household objects have been broken. <br /> <br /> Things are very strange, she is strange (looking like a slut, she undresses in front of him until she is completely naked? oh yes!). Besides, the father is strange, the house is a disaster - everything should have said to Magruder: "Hey, this is very strange to me, I'm out of here!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with her and then, motivated by his history and sex, assumes the case of trying to have his father engaged. Everything screams set-up! <br /> <br /> So, being the top Flight Lawyer he is, he arrives late in the office wearing the same shirt he had the night before, (a fact that all women in the office notice). It is likely that a successful lawyer would act as a Magruder 16 bothered the police in some of their cases, so when he goes to the police claiming with ample evidence that his father is terrorizing them, the police ignore him, I might have believed in assistance. at all - not likely! <br /> <br /> It's very unlikely.
