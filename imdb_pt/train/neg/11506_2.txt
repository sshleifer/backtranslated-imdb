This movie story is bad enough, which can happen in real life. I am very unable to understand when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is some reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and can do everything she wants, then why did she fall in love with that bad man? 2. How is the story's script so weak? She was so rich, she can do everything she wants, but she does not dare to divorce her husband, which is very impossible. <br /> <br /> The words I LOVE YOU mean nothing in this movie.
