In short: this is a romantic comedy that really wants and is something more. She wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, to graduate. You want to be deep and human. It has interesting camera captures, lighting, music, editing, everything that gives you the feel of an important movie. Dialogue is smart - sometimes. There are some moments of "loud laughter". <br /> <br /> But here's what prevents it from being anything other than a formidable early morning, in-flight, time-killer cable: <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - How often can Joe sad dog staring into space with his mouth open before starting to get annoying? Maybe some drool helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - she's really flat here and not just in the chest. Your role should be this cheerful, kind and caring girl who ends up getting into the wrong situations, and is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad bag loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her. But Gwenneth makes it very annoying. Combine this with the puppy dog's dump (above) and you have very little chemistry to worry about. <br /> <br /> (I kept imagining someone else in that role - Kate Hudson, for example). 3. The script and the plot - the things that happen basically do not seem true; all the problems are solved at the end with a bow so neat and tidy that it sounds like a hoot and the writers just said "oops, time to finish, catch a train to catch!" So they got the Hollywood formula book, checked all the boxes and went home.
