Well, what can I say? "What the Bleep we know" has reached the near impossible - leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master", "Merlin", and thus fourth, will go down in history as the only worst movie I've ever seen in its entirety. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is really impressive, because I've seen a lot of bad movies. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two intertwined parts, alternating between a silly and planned story about an extremely annoying movie. a photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take antidepressants to survive, and a lot of talking heads talking about how quantum physics supposedly justifies her new pseudo-philosophy. Basically, if you start your day meditating with names like Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a sizable portion of good herb, then this movie is for you as well. Otherwise, stay away. Take my word for it. The first thing that struck me about "What you know about Bleep" is that it seems to be edited and assembled by the same types of people filming cheap wedding on camera, complete with pink heart effects, sparkles generated by computer through the screen and other assorted nonsense. Whoever leaves these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me. I think that's what Kenny G does a lot with you. The film was permeated with GCI tacky, tastes that you or I can produce on our own computer via video editing software without prescription, but never would, because it is too ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The script was obviously written by someone with no writing experience. Not only were all the characters and conversations uncomfortable and imaginary, but the "writers" felt that they had to push all the relevant information, or rather the misinformation, which is what most of the film was about, to the end. your throat. Well, given the target audience, this may not have been a bad idea. The main character, for example, spends half of the movie pills. Apparently, however, it was not considered convincing enough, so there are at least some dialogues throughout the text, which specifically refer to their anti-anxiety pills, in case the viewers can not connect their exaggerated pain with suffering. Small white pills that she takes whenever she feels down. The acting ... Well, I've seen better acting in Ed Wood movies, and no, that's not an exaggeration. Heck, the little piece I was in when I was 12 was performing a lot more inspiring than that. It really happened. <br /> <br /> History is interrupted here and there with a lot of talking heads, a strange mix of eccentric scientists, eccentric physicians and self-proclaimed mystics, who talk about how quantum physics supposedly provides an "explanation" for the way the man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life. The reality, you see, is a probability field of a lot of different possibilities, and it is only set in stone when the Observer chose to notice it. What happens when more than one Observer observes that they did not say, but again, who cares. Listen to Enya, meditate, observe, and you will be God, and no one cares about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. Every reason is immediately discarded when people are stuck in their ways and unable to reach a goal. "paradigm shift" and "down the rabbit hole." Moreover, the Heidelberg Principle of Uncertainty is supposed to be a positive proof of alternative realities, parallel universes, and such. Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the film. All these people keep talking about rabbit holes. I'm not sure what this has to do with anything else they were saying or showing, but one thing I'm sure of is that it somehow involves anal sex. In fact, the movie is _extremely_ anti-sex. All the time, sex is presented as dirty, ugly and anti-enlightening. <br /> <br /> In any case, the talking heads speak, the main character achieves harmony and illumination by painting hearts all over the body with a magic marker. , and continues to walk with an even more stupid look in her glazed eyes than she started. <br /> <br /> I want 2 hours of my life back. <br /> <br /> Here are a couple of random quotes that I remembered: <br /> <br /> "What I find unreal has become much more real to me, and this, which I used to consider real, is often much less real than the unreal. " - Some talk about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does it take for a man to have an erection? It takes only a thought. Nothing changes from the outside, all changes are in. Yet he has an erection" - Some self- proclaimed mystics, head of their own school of enlightenment. <br /> <br /> [while looking in the mirror] "I hate you! I hate you! Fat! You're ugly! I have you!" - main character, the fat and ugly photographer.
