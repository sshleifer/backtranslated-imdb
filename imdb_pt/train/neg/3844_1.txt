First of all, I would just like to tell everyone that they saw this film, that the actor who played "Travesti" is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is a great actor, although he does not say much about his filmography, he has been in various plays and musicals. Currently residing in the Terrace BC is where I come from, he comes to our house almost every Saturday * laughs * Ok, now about the movie, I do not recommend this to anyone who has not seen it since it is not a movie worth watching , The main reason I thought it was a bad movie is that it never stays in place, it keeps coming back in between the time, so it's kinda hard to follow in some points, and second, it's really annoying * laughs * Although the acting is great, the movie just does not compare.
