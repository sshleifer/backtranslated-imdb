Although I use this site quite often to see how other people rated what I think are challenging or just enjoyable movies, after watching this movie at Cinema Four last night I felt compelled to write something, even if it helped me The main characters played by Danny Dyer (23 years old - are you sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy). will always be Spock) had no real substance on them - I'm not sure if the first half hour of the movie did not make the final cut, but certainly in a revenge movie would you like some empathy with the victims ... here I could not I care less. In fact, the only character I seemed to care about was the dog, with the deer coming in second. And both animals reacted Dire (sic) and Scully, who were downright terrible. I think you are as good as the script you are given, and I would like to warmly thank the writers, producers, director and all the cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity.
