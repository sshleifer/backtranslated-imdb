Man oh man! What a horrible piece of film! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood, even though I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the Cupertino border) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system. And they basically showed the same movie over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell into lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved their adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is bad, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, much dialogue that is so bad that is good and a good Carole King song played on the final credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to really enjoy this movie. And hey, everyone knows there's no gold in the Grand Canyon!
