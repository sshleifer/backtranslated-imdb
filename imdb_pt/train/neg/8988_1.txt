So far, the worst movie I've ever seen was Ben & Arthur. You really should check out the comments for this movie instead of this one. The review statistics of this film have been positively distorted through a relentless and unscrupulous effort by some of the people involved in doing so, evidence for which it is fairly easy to find out online. At least the people who made Ben & Arthur were honored enough to let this happen by themselves rather than unscrupulously promote it for people like me to buy. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the cast, the acting, the direction, the photography, the edition, the music ... what else goes into a movie? Whatever it is, here it is as bad as it sounds. If it was not so unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. I kept watching thinking that I needed to improve because I had not yet discovered that none of the positive reviews were reliable. <br /> <br /> It does not take much money to make a great movie, nor does a low budget mean that a movie has to be bad. My favorite example of a low-budget masterpiece is Gus Van Sant's incredible Mala Noche, but there are many others. Secrets of the lateral line The cut of the director or original is not bad because the people that did it did not have money, but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything, except for the autopromotion.
