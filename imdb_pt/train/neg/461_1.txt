Warning: Avoid this super duper terrible movie ... if you watched you will be SOOOOOOOOO disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are grandma now what are they doing? Trying SO hard to be innocent and sexy young, simply is not working at all. Pam and Denise act so horribly in this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the script is absolutely atrocious, I can not believe anyone can get away with these bad ideas. With the development of the film industry, film lovers are not as easy to satisfy as those of the last century. I bet cinema-goers of the last century will hate that too. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this. I think watching 2004's "White Chicks" is so much better than that ... do not make mistakes back then, I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
