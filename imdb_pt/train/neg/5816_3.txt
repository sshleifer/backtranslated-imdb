From critical acclaim, I expected more from this film and from Tamara Jenkins. The story just snaked and did not seem to have a dot or a plot. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (matures for her age or not) would be as indifferent as "losing her virginity." Maybe I was too young to relate (I was four years old in 1976) but I had no problem connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful and I was not alive for any of these settings. The cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not allow them to engage the audience. Overall, Slums had his moments, but unless you're eager to reminisce about tops and socks, I'd say skip this one.
