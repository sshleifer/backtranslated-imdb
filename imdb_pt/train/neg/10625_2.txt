I am a junior high school student. In my Current World Affairs class, a boy in my class had this video and suggested that we watch. Then we did. I firmly believe that we went to the moon, and my father works for NASA. Even though I think this movie is the biggest crap I've ever seen, the guy who created it has some serious balls. First of all, did he have to show JFK a shot? And how dare you use all those Bible quotations? The only good thing about this movie is that it raises debates, which is good b / c in my class, we have weekly debates. This movie did nothing to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should be working together and making another movie. Michael Moore's next film could be called "A Funny Thing Happened on September 11" or "A funny thing happened on the way to the White House."
