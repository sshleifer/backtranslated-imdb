I saw it, I agree with it 100%, but I did not call for delivery of it. He just came off as an idiot in a poorly edited and poorly edited youth defamation campaign. Edit cuts galore, etc ... The camera would be focused on it, and you would see 2 or 3 editing cuts over a minute or two of dialogue. Add boom microphones to the camera, which is not a movie. <br /> <br /> This documentary addresses a topic with so many angles, so many interesting stories, that the film is so easy to do. . Choosing religious fanatics is like picking up the retarded kid. It's so easy, it's wrong. I mean, how hard is it to make these people look crazy? To make them contradict one another, let them recite more than one or two verses. I like it when he jumped back between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradictory. <br /> <br /> I just think he could have done something a little more creative. The part with the neurologist talking about brain activity has never been developed. Could it have been interesting to show brain exams of people during religious attacks compared to drugs, or sex, or? He could have touched more of the women who rejoiced over the Passion piece that looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie. More could have gotten into the story of John Smith, the Mormon founder who had a very colorful past. Immerse yourself in science vs. religion. One is a very methodical and very rigorous process to increase confidence in theories. It builds from a solid background, a new layer on top of a more proven layer. An enormous burden of proof is needed every step of the way. The other starts at the top and comes with undeniable claims. It's like this, because well? I said that. <br /> <br /> Done right? Would I say turn it into an original HBO series? Reach a different religion every week. <br /> <br /> It was an eye opener on one thing. I must have been blind. Good ole G.W.Bush ... no wonder he was elected. He had a religious majority. And well ... now it's the blind that leads the blind. <br /> Bill Moyer .. Well ... what can I expect from a guy who distributes the Sutra on Newport Beach?
