While watching this movie, I tried to find out why they bothered to do this. Although the main plot of the movie is potentially good, there are all kinds of unrelated / unnecessary subframes. Marketing people in Hollywood must have dictated the multiple bandits, perpetual double-crosses, and the man and woman who come too close and have sex. It's strange to see more of them having sex than the president and his mistress. The many undertones and subplots make the movie very broad and none of the characters is developed properly - I did not really feel I knew any characters except that everyone is corrupt and evil. The ending is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what could have been, but what it should be. In the end, there is really no explanation as to why someone does what they do except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double-cross. I'm surprised that so many established (and good) actors have agreed to make such a hollow movie. This looked like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time unless you are in a film class and want to be an example of what not to do when making a movie.
