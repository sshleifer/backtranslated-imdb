Did someone else feel betrayed like me? The first hour was pretty solid, but the last. Oh my God. It seemed to be predictable and tacky. Not grand and epic as the whole race of the show was. Most of the reviews read were brilliant, but I really can not understand why. I had seriously anticipated the overall ending of WAY ​​at the beginning, but then portrayed because I thought "No, they would never do that, this is very lame." I can hardly bear it. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm about to walk out the door to go and sell every season that I own. Someone please. Change your mind. I want to love this. So bad. Somebody tell me why I'm wrong. Great show. Terrible end.
