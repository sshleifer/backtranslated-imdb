Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. Surviving a relentless series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger to the nearest targets. <br /> <br /> When she sees the violence transformed and discipline-focused into a decaying boxing club, she knows she has found her home. <br /> <br /> The film progresses from there, while Diana learns the usual lessons about age alongside the skills needed for boxing success. Michelle Rodriguez is very good at the role, particularly when it conveys the concentrated anger of a young woman surrounded on all sides and struggling not just against personal circumstances but against entrenched sexism. <br /> <br /> The photo could use some subtlety in its direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the older and more experienced cast. There are many breaks in the script, which lessens the dramatic tension. The overall stillness of the film drains its intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a good image to see once, only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the "see again and again" category.
