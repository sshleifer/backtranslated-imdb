The Treasure Island DVD should be seen on any movie production course! It is an example of a didactic book on how not to make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the writer / director's comment graphically demonstrates the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a medium of communication, and the communication is not complete if the audience does not know what the hell the director is talking about. The director's stated goal is to make a movie without "Hollywood conventions." Among these conventions, unfortunately, there is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that the public often does not understand the points at which he purposely avoided a "Hollywood cliché." However, he never seems to understand the idea that clichés exist for a reason. They are an abbreviated way to convey complex ideas quickly and clearly. It is good to avoid them, but they need to be replaced by another way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich in potential. Two puppets are designed to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that will be used on a misinformation mission in the final days of World War II. Soon everyone begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes more and more real for them. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood convention" of traditional narrative could create a wonderful movie with this idea. This movie certainly is not it! Puppets do everything they can to give consistency to these characters, but they are often defeated by the confused and confusing script. In particular, I'm getting more and more impressed with Gonzo, who plays the animated body. In several muppets movies, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
