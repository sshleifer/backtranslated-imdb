That was not what I wanted to see. I bought this on DVD and under the film I found myself angry and turned off the movie for a moment. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did not like: <br /> <br /> 1 They were filming for the father <br /> <br /> 2 The tribes were really annoying <br /> < (mostly) seemed pretended <br /> <br /> 4 The bad scientist well, he was boring <br /> <br /> 5 The picture quality on the DVD was really bad <br /> <br /> What I liked: <br /> <br /> 1 The music of Jerry Goldsmith. This song is really great. I have the bootleg soundtrack of this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but it's okay for your time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see the dinosaurs, they inspire a kind of awe. <br /> <br /> 3 Baby's kind of cute when he's in the water and he's playing <br /> <br /> 4 That funny scene with the tent. <br /> <br /> 5 The children who watched this movie, we hope they learn that evil always loses.
