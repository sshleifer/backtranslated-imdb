this movie was a horrible excuse for ... a movie. First of all, the cast could have been better; Katelyn, the main character, did not look anything like the mother of the TV. Also, the plot was pathological. was extremely clich√© and predictable. the end was very disappointing and tacky. But that 's all I'm gonna say about it. The nail in the bag, though, was a scene where Katelyn (jordan hinson) must have been crying, but the girl could not cry at the helm! There were no tears running down his face, just a few unbelievable sobs. she is not a dynamic actress. she gave the same identical laughter as hillary duff in lizzie Maguire (sp?). was when the movie went from not so good to simply bad. It seemed she was acting. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this movie was really bad! it was kind of a mix of every cliche movie of 90's kids that everyone is tired of - just worse! <br /> <br /> I give an 'F' because it was very difficult to sit (b / t / w, I was babysitting when I saw this). <br /> <br /> however, you might like it if its 9 or less. ;)
