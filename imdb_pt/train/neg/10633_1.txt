I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I wasted no money buying this. The cover of the video has a scene from the 1975 movie Capricorn One. The movie begins with several clips of rocket explosions, most unrelated to manned flight. Sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast. He edits in his own voice instead of letting us hear what the staff had to say. The video ends curiously with a screening of the movie Zapruder. His claims about radiation, shielding, star photography and others lead me to believe he is extremely ignorant or has some kind of ax against NASA, astronauts, or the American at large. Your science is bad, and this is the video.
