5 minutes in this movie I was hyperventilating, shaking and squirming in pain. And not on the right path. The story is about a troupe of idiot kids making calls to a psychopath who is always a good idea. It turns out that psychotics do not like joking calls because in 2 minutes he's at their door killing the poor mother and father of Williams. Well, skip 15 years and guess what? Still joking phone calling people. Yes, you'd think a horrible murder would stop them from doing it again, but no. Then, after about two hours later, I realized that this movie did not give me anything but a terrible taste in my mouth and a strong desire to take my own life. This piece of shit is not even worth laughing at the poor production, the "acting" or Rutger having his career less and less. I love bad horror movies, but that's the most unsatisfactory part I've ever seen. Just do not do it.
