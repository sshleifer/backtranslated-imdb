This movie was fun sometimes, sometimes hell was even downright funny. <br /> <br /> The underlying message I got from the movie, though, was that women are responsible for all the man's problems. Every time a woman is portrayed in the movie, she is being lazy, being a scoundrel or criticizing a poor guy for no apparent reason. I do not think the message involved is good for gay men or women. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy and a work of art, so it's simply someone's point of view. Even if I do not agree with this, they are still entitled to this. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, but some of the comments others have made are simply stupid. Best movie, my foot.
