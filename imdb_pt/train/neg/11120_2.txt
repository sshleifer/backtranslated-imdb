You know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of "Jeopardy!". <br /> <br /> The saddest White Men Can not Jump is that he had tremendous potential. For several years, I lived in an area similar to the one depicted in this film; racial tensions were high and basketball meant everything to everyone. A film about the members of this "basketball culture" might have been very interesting, but the mediocre acting and poor script of White Men Can not Job left something to be desired. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events in the film. is cyclic. First, Billy wins or loses money by playing basketball. He then returns to his home and relaxes with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories come to a climax of some sort, but the "climax" I saw was just another sequence in that repetition (in this case, "Billy wins or loses money playing basketball"). <br /> For a plan to develop, some dilemma must be solved; and this dilemma should be interesting if the film is interesting as well. Apparently, the writers of White Men Can not Jump have forgotten this rule, since the plot can be summarized as "Billy needs to pay the bills". I enjoyed the change of pace from other sports movies, but - I'm sorry - that was just awful. I could have cared less if Billy had money to pay his apartment rent. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, White Men Can not Jump is a hit movie. Apparently, some inflexible sports fans reject the terrible writing for some scenes with a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, were attracted to the big names playing the lead roles. It makes me think, if the cast was replaced by unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced by lacrosse, would anyone have bothered to watch this movie? I really do not think so. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie two of the ten stars; the extra star is for "Jeopardy!" scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. Thank you Trebek.
