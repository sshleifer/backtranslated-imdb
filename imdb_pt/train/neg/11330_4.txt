"Giant" is one of the most boring and overly long Hollywood gadgets of all time. Many scenes look totally bogus and powerless. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this great Hollywood production. A central notion of this film, that a farmer would never resist drilling oil in his land, is absurd, and I know this because I'm from Houston. A couple of scenes, especially Dean serving Taylor's coffee, rescue this annoying movie another way. For a much more accurate and interesting description of how modernism has changed the farms in Texas, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's greatest performances) or "The Last Picture Show."
