I've never seen the original film in the series ... I just hope it was a much better film than this or the sequel made in the 1980s as if it was not like these two terrible sequels were justified. This movie had a good lead when they were advertising to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. Anyway, it looked like it would be a good horror movie. It was, however, a movie that would make some Walt Disney films look bleak. Actually, this movie was just a handful of light downs with practically no marshy creature to be seen. The only real sight is near the end when you see your shape during a very heavy storm, plus there is virtually no sign of the creature that was really disappointing as a child. The story is basically that the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are behind the creature of the marshy brook and the children are there to help, or just some random hairy face in the jungle who likes to pull random boats through the water. It really is not worth watching, but I would like to see the original granted to the creator of what would make the also horrible marshy creature of the 80s, but he also made a good horror movie in the '70s, "The Town the Dreaded Sundown" .
