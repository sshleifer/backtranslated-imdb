I have no idea why they did this version of "Persuasion" when they already had that miniseries with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose they wanted to do a long version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; in fact, what ended up on the floor of the court was all that humor and humor, leaving a film that was mere melodrama, rather than a fun exposition of the English manners and customs of the countryside. <br /> <br /> The characters were also shallow and uninteresting. They had poor Anne running through the streets after Captain Wentworth was a silly modern teenager (and if you're a silly and modern teenager reading this, let me say: chasing after a male like a woman in heat is NOT cool) . This is something a well-educated woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this wise heroine. <br /> <br /> Some said they found this somewhat comical; my reaction was not laughter but outrage. The very idea of ​​such corruption of a work of Austen is despicable. It was ghastly.
