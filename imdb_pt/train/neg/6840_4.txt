Although this tour certainly does not match its predecessor, it has more than its share of memorable moments. My personal favorite, right after devouring one block from the city with his "Videodisc Cannon", we see a close-up of Nimoy's face. As a single tear poured from his left eye, we know that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine. The viewer can not help but be pulled into his emotional turbulence and we understand that his formerly flat affection was only a facade. Absolute brilliance !!! The sex scenes show a good balance, carnal, but not pornographic. Afterwards, I felt I had a good understanding of how to work with the Magnavision Videodisc Player. Too bad they have not produced them in over 25 years.
