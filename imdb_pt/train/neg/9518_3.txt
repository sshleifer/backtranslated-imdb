Poor performance by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Extremely underdeveloped support characters. Talky annoying no real plot. Finishing leaves you flatter than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could string in four strings (that is, if you cared about these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real asset. That penultimate sequence in which the "Chicago hood" looks for Sinatra's character is laughable. The music in this sequence is also bad. And in the final scene, when Martin's character takes off the hat of the woman he called a "pig," he almost made me go out and find a rock to shoot on my television screen.
