Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter and cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained. He travels to this small town where it is said that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. <br /> <br /> His car stands still and he takes refuge in a small building, and meets a beautiful and mysterious girl. Suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her, and the town is wondering who murdered this woman ... who I think was the witch, but I'm not sure. Ivan is now being pursued by his spirit, or something, and he must have faith, or something, to overcome him. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with idiot actors, stupid plot and minimal effects. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian movie ... but also a foreign film. Ivan's announcer made the film more comical than terrifying, because it's so raucous and tearful. You will not lose much by losing this movie.
