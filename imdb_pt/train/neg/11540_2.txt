It reminded me a lot of Michael Winner's dirty garbage, 'Dirty Weekend', with its bad budget feeling in England. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that I am a fan of serious films and exploitation. I appreciate, let's say, "Demented" by her ineptitude and "Last House on the Left" for her pure shameless brutality. And any number of inventive and increasingly brutal Italian spin-offs. <br /> <br /> That was simply useless. More or less as a British budget director thought: "Let's redo 'I spit on your grave' without leaving too distressing now that the horror has come back to fashion with the Hostel. The whole thing does not fit. or have a point.What about the rapist's daughter? Why bother having the man who specializes in security cameras?
