The crime-drama of blaxploitation, poorly done, targeted the black urban market of the early 1970s. Pam Grier stars in the title role, that of a nurse who becomes a vigilante of a single woman after gangsters who deal with drugs making Coffy's little sister an addict. Violent absurdity advances stubbornly, with canned energy and excitement; only Grier's explosive temper shakes the narrative (she is not much of an actress here, but connects with the audience in a primitive way). Not unlike what Charles Bronson was doing at the moment, the film was marketed and advertised as a crass exploration, but still managed to find a considerable audience in the city center. Today, however, it is only a footnote in the history of 1970s cinema, and lacks the far-reaching appeal of other films of that genre. * 1/2 of ****
