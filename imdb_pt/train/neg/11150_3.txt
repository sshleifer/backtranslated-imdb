I watched this movie alone, in the dark, and it was full moon out there! I did not do it on purpose, it just happened that way. So all the elements were there for this movie to scare the hell out of me !! Well, this did not happen, in fact I wanted to turn off the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but I thought, let's give it a chance, unfortunately I did. The performance was horrible, the only one with decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you're a horror fan, then it's just the same thing you've seen many times before. Some scenes did not make sense, and you get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie more! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. The (scary) scenes seemed to belong to an 80's horror movie when there was not enough technology, but some good movies were made back then! I was surprised to see the name of a major producer at the beginning of the movie, I thought they could not put some money in it and make it decent? !! I could not agree more with the ratings that the movie has, it's also my rating for it, 3 out of 10.
