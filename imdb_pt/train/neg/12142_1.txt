Please, for God's sake, do not watch. Now saying this, I know what you're thinking, can not it be that bad? If everyone says it's as bad as they say, I have to watch it! Do not do it! It's going to be like looking at a horrible accident involving babies and a gas tank! You will have scars for life ... the image will never leave you! I could only watch half an hour before I was violently ill. The acting is the worst I've seen, and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you risk ripping your eyes and renting this movie ... do not say I did not warn you! The cover and the plot are a trap !! Zombies Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This movie must be the same .... right? NOT!! The writing = direction of garbage = act of garbage = there was no action. Still not convinced? Then forever your soul will be tormented !!!
