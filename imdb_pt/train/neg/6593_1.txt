Even if it were remotely funny, this moldy wax work would still be disrespectful. Stopping very close to unearthing the corpses of the boys and reenacting 'Weekend At Bernie's' ?? but only ?? Producer Larry Harmon and director of the films "Ernest" use copyrights as an excuse for the entire legacy of Stan and Ollie. Gailard Sartain does a fair imitation of Ollie, but Bronson Pinchot would not reach tenth in a contest similar to Stan; even if both were in the movie, would not be less hateful. The less said about the surrounding catastrophe, the better. It makes "Utopia" seem like a swan song.
