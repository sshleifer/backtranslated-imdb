I finally got to take a look at this experimental Lynch soon after waiting for so long ... and unfortunately it was not worth it! Even to a zealot for Lynch, I find this very tedious ... nothing happens, there are long, long and painful breaks where nothing happens, long monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing ends with the viewer not knowing, or caring, what the hell happened, what happened before and what happened next. There was an allusion to Mulholland Drive - the blonde and the brunette were very Diane and Rita-esque, and a moment of Lost Highway with allusions to some significant event that happened, but it can not be spoken clearly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's all very uninteresting and very annoying, nothing happens, it's very forgettable and I think I'll delete it from my computer and forget I've already watched it. Sorry, David!
