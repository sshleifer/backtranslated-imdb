The movie is as fun as looking at the sun. Sheriff Pataki is a total retarded who loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat back making a ring of smoke from his swollen cigars and drink alcohol while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking up everything that is called of "Blood," which actually looked like a fruit punch. <br /> <br /> Above all, the plot looked very horrible until I called this piece of crap a movie. The rest of the characters in this movie are total waste of time, the ending was horrible, the outlines were cheesy, and the scenes were terrible. What else should I say to you spectators out there? My advice would be to get your anti-rabies vaccine if you have ever watched the movie. This film can give you foam in your mouth if you do not have your photos updated.
