Ronald Colman won an Academy Award for Best Actor for a spectacular performance as a popular actor who is completely lost in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. George Cukor's acclaimed film has a wonderful pedigree, having been written by the esteemed team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witticism is so embarrassing here, and the behind-the-scenes business is super ripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for her punctuation, and Shelley Winters has some good times as a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman gives her a breathless sigh, she asks, "What are you, some kind of crazy?"). Otherwise, this scenario is very obvious, surprisingly arrogant and not very funny. * 1/2 of ****
