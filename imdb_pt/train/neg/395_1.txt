When I asked the Blockbuster site, I had no idea it was as terrible as it was. Who knows? Maybe I forgot to take my pills that day. I know that from the moment the cast arrived in his pickup truck, dressed in the late '70s style wide-boned, bell-studded and feathered hair, I knew that this disco-era jewel was meant for the bin. <br /> <br /> The first prediction of how bad things should be was the narration at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic forces were at stake to wreak havoc on the universe, forcing the quality of polyester and porn music into the possible viewer. From the opening scene with the ill-made effects to the otherworldly "monsters" and then the house jumping from universe to universe was as painfully painful as watching a production of Vagina Monologues in elementary school. <br /> <Throughout the movie, the sure sign that something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear. The "ship" was made up of something suspicious of what looked like old VCR parts and camcorders and attacked anyone on its way. Of course, if moved more slowly than the affected bowels of Bob Barker, but it had menacing and thin armor like pencils and the ability to cast a menacing green glow that could stop the bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting the mere balsa wood in an hour or two (with some help). <br /> <br /> Moving on ... As the strangeness and the background of the bells continue ... We discover that they are trapped in a "Space Time Warp." How can we join this little nugget of scientific information? Because the older male leader tells his son that in a more or less improvised way, he remembers how "you won the big game" with a cup of coffee or a chilled bottle of refreshing Coca-Cola. Was a scientist pop? No, but he knew about horses and apparently intruded as an amateur on string theory and Einstein's theories. <br /> <br /> The recording I watched on DVD was almost a pirate quality. The sound was muddy and the transfer seemed to have been taken from a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone, moreover it was very, very, very bad. (There is not enough 'really' to describe it, really). <br /> <br /> I know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics. I've never seen this movie in its original release, but even then I think it would come to the same conclusion: bury it quickly.
