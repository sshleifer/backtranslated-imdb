I'm one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and I've probably reviewed more of Buster Keaton's films for IMDb than anyone else. Every movie that he did from the beginning of his career to the early 1930s with only two exceptions I reviewed, so you can say that I'm a big fan. That's why I found this episode so painful and difficult to watch. I loved the movies of this guy and I kept thinking "Buster, how could you ?!". Well, now that I think about it, I think I can see why Buster Keaton starred in this horrible episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. He lost much of his fortune after a troubled divorce in the early 1930s and his cinematic career as a protagonist is also gone. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity, so he prostituted himself with anyone he was willing to pay - appearing in Beach movies and this mess of an episode of a great series. <br /> The biggest problem with the episode is that it is terribly written and Buster deserved much better. The show is supposed to be funny, but it's not, and instead of paying tribute to silent films it's just painful to watch - particularly with Keaton putting that stupid travel helmet back in time, as well as all the badly executed antics. Do yourself a favor, SKIP THIS ONE - it's a pale imitation of the greatness that once was Keaton's career !!!
