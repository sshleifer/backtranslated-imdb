There's absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the smallest amount of talent. No one has ever tried to act before, even the extras in the cafe seem to have been glued in place. Nothing seems rehearsed. The quality of the film is terrible. Most of the "action" happens in narrow aisles or apartments with the cameraman clogged as a belated reflection, swinging an inexpensive camera back and forth between "actors" as they deliver their lines. No tripod and no proper microphone, the sound quality is terrible. Even the 'Manos' rates were better than that, at least they had adequate equipment. What a plot there is simply lost in the production mess. <br /> <br /> Stick to home videos, preferably made by some 5 year old boy experiencing the video feature on Daddy's new camera phone. You will have a long search to find a movie more inept than that.
