Can any movie become more naive than that? you can not believe a piece of this script. and its predictable ssooooo that you can tell the plot and the end of the first 10 minutes. the lead actress seems like she wants to be Barbie (but she does not, the doll has MORE acting skills). <br /> <br /> The ease that the character goes through and stays in the music school makes the ghost of the opera novel seem like a historical biography. I will not even comment on the superficiality of the characters, but the only good thing about the movie is the performance of Madsen, who manages to bring life to a one-dimensional character like a melo. <br /> <br /> The film is so tacky that it sticks to your teeth. I can think of some girls obsessed with 13-year-old Britney shouting "O, give us a break! If we want fairy tales, there's always the Brothers Grimm's book hidden somewhere in the attic." I gave 2 instead of 1 just for Virginia Madsen.
