Unless you are between 10 and 14 years old (with the exception of the R rating), there are very few things to like here. One or two lines by Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she may be considering her surroundings, but alas, that's it. Poor plot. Bad performance. Worst writing and delivery. The special effects are bleak. As much as the whole situation is a strange and terrible joke, the significant individual situations are all equally terrible. If we consider the action portions, well, there are unbelievable action sequences in some movies that make you dizzy and there are some that make you moan. This movie contains only the last type. That leaves little to the left. I'm so glad I did not pay for it. <br /> <br /> Despite all the hype, I can read and think, just as I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but I was a bit worried about entering. However, like a train accident, one can not simply look away. And even without expectations, I was disappointed. Bad. Not even 'so bad, it's good' stuff. I'm very tolerant of bad movies, but that makes the "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) worthy of an Oscar. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of CGI rubbish is in the same company as the Battlefield. Earth, little man and Gigli. As this is currently rated as 7.2, it leaves me completely confused. Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all I can think of as answers. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that tonight I witnessed a train accident. I need to go wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
