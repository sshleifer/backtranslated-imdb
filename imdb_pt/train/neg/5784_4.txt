I was not as passionate about it as many other reviewers. Of course, there are a couple of pretty girls playing erotic and lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two lovely razor-bladed mermaids who run to cars on a road out of the way, go to their house (at dusk) and invite their prey ... sex hungry men for their boudoir . What happens there ... well, after they undress and kiss, they kill their visitors. Director Jos√© Ramon Larraz has some flashes of brightness with his camera. Some scenes are very strange and effectively filmed, but sex alone does not support a movie (no pun intended ... at least consciously). There is not really much history here. We have both girls. We are shown an inexplicable and inexplicable beginning, where we see them shot with pistol. Because? Which means "Why do we have the guy who stays for several days greeting a guy in the hotel who insists he has known him for years? Does that have a purpose? Of course I have even more general questions like what a couple of girls are of good-looking doing like vampires in the interior of England and having a wine cellar full of Carpathian wine? then go to bed in the crypt The end continues with some more juicy scenes but it is anti-climatic There are, as I said, some effective scenes from the director ... I particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the forest and the two girls are like me said very kind.Marianne Morris in particular stands out - in more ways than one. Bessie Love's bear has a brief appearance at the end of the film.
