This movie was spectacular. I was so emotionally uninvolved in each character that the biggest antagonist of the movies was actually myself. I played beautifully everywhere; promising myself that I would leave, but only drinking another beer waiting for her to turn into something magical along the way. Even in this state, I could not fail to note that Cuba's performance was as fragile as vegetable paper. His obsessive dedication to his work was made unconvincingly, as was his one-night stand after the failure of his own idiot standards. Burt appeared on the screen as a general, that's right, a general (who uses a lot of makeup). I fell into a frighteningly fast spree to rival that of Cuba except that mine was real and I erased my toe. Reward! Reward my stubbed toe!
