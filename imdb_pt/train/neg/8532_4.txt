Composer Robert Taylor (as Terry) is "dizzy, happy with slaps" and can not see directly supernatural Norma Shearer (as Consuelo). "It makes the sun shine even when it's raining," Taylor explains. But Mr. Taylor gets a lump in his throat every time he approaches Miss. Shearer. Finally, at the Palm Beach Casino Shearer, Taylor proclaims "I love you!" Shearer avoids him because she is engaged to George Sanders (as Tony). However, to settle a gambling debt, Shearer hires Taylor to pose as "Her Cardboard Lover", to leave Mr. Sanders jealous. <br /> <br /> The title of this film invites the obvious and appropriate criticism of three words: "She Movie Card". It is more notable as the last film appearance of Shearer, one of the greatest stars in the world of "He Who Gets Slapped" (1924, playing another Consuelo) for "The Women" (1939). To be fair, this was probably the kind of Shearer movie MGM believed the audience wanted to see. However, the part is not flattering. Shaved and energized, Taylor and Shearer got better at "The Escape" (1940). If Shearer had continued, she might have become a better actress than "protagonist"; apparently she was no longer interested and certainly did not need the money. Taylor has a great scene, reciting Christina Rossetti's "When I Am Dead," while threatening to jump off Shearer's balcony, as directed by George Cukor. <br /> <br /> **** Cardboard Lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
