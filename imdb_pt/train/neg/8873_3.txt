Did anyone stop to realize what kind of movie they were producing here? Now let's be a former marine officer who becomes a group of kids in a cadet school, so this should be a family comedy, right? Wrong This is just a raw comedy intended for teenagers with many distasteful moments. It could have been stupidly watchable at the moment, but I found Damon Wayans' voice too annoying. Does he talk like that in real life? If he does, then he has my sympathy, but he will not get any of my money watching his movies
