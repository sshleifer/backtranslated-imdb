I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I could go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the film a 2 rather than a 1 is that the story has some new story elements, although it never reaches the level of being interesting. This movie has all the signs of being made for the drive-in movie market - ultra-low budget, amateur acting and a liberal dose of sex (for a 1960s movie). In fact, I wonder if maybe the only reason the movie was made was to make a quick buck and because somebody knew some strippers they could use as extras. The movie is about a crazy doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's severed head into the body of an unsuspecting giver. Most potential donors are strippers or a model - whose only real purpose in the movie is to excite them when they take out most of their clothes. However, they go on too long to make the film worthwhile for the daring little ones and the film is not bad enough to merit the attention of movie fans.
