OK, I just saw the movie, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was generally a decent movie, except for the plot, which was stupid and horrible ... First of all, we never know anything about the creatures , why did they appear, what are they doing in our world, and really, were they on Earth before we were or did they just come from space? Second, the butcher's role in maintaining order is so obviously created ... Really, how big could a substation's underground be? There were just so many of these creatures, so I guess instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have planted some tactical bombs, or maybe clean things up and a Nuke would have done the job. I know it sounds funny and it is, but I do not see the killing of people as being NECESSARY ... Thirdly, Leon acts as Superman jumping on the train and fighting with Vinnie Jones, who was taller and taller in stature. Then again, when he confronts the driver, he does nothing and acts like a coward, observing all abominations. I mean, OK, the conductor had scary help (laughs), but if Leon was so brave, he would have gone all the way ... I mean, he risked his life first, so he does not do anything exactly when he should. He could have died as a hero, but lives like a coward ... this may be the case, but not after showing so much bravery soon ... So the cop thing ... come on! This was a city having a subway, I bet there must have been other cops, except that lady, other police stations, that was really kind of silly ... All in all, great performance from Vinnie Jones, interesting idea to the reason behind which is not really built at all ... By the way, what did the signs in the chest mean? Vinnie Jones can not make up for the rest ...
