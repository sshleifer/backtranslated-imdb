Why, the 'WHY! ... I chose this one? Well ... I needed a no-brainer in the summer heat, and the cape looked cool. <br /> <br /> Of course I should have known better. This is a very, very bad movie. And it gets embarrassing when the manufacturers know it's bad, and they try to cover it up by adding some sexy / pretty women and some sex scenes. Well, guys ... he does not cut it, does he? <br /> <br /> If you would like a cool movie about a great reptile that is really very, very good, well touched and funny: go rent Lake Placid! (this is a request)
