This movie is so bad that you almost feel contaminated by it. In fact, there is a strong sense of relief when it ends, the relief is that now you can put the tape back on the rewinder and RUSH back to the store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection. I suggested teasing when we rented what looked like the kind of movie that William Hurt would "call" for his performance. I meant that he would not be pushing hard. But behold, in a great number of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is really ON THE PHONE! Our understanding of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess. Cinematography and editing are obscure and confusing, the story is chaotic and the soundtrack is almost inaudible. There is a slight resemblance to "Falling Down," but the film had a daringly disturbing story, great writing and acting, and an engaging soundtrack. "Contaminated Man" is just a kind of old European tourist trap, and seeing it is like driving down an unknown road in an unfamiliar country where you do not speak the language in a constant rain just after dark, like the foggy windshield . Can you get the photo? Do not take this one.
