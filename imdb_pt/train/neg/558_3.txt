It's been 14 years since Sharon Stone gave viewers a crossing that twisted the minds of many people. And now, God knows why, she's in the game again. "Wild Instinct 2" is the continuation of the erotic "Wild Instinct," featuring a sexy Stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, fans of the original may not even come close to it, since "Instinct 2" is a painful film, as mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones murdered the legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie begins when a car explosion begins right at the beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to look vigorously sexy) is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a horrible David Morrisey) is apt to examine her, but eventually falls in love with an intimate game of seduction. <br /> <br /> And there is, without further explanation, the basic force that moves this "instinct." "Nothing is much explained and we have to sit in a sleazy class C erotic film. Sharon Stone stars in her first role, in which she is most often a turn-off. The movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a menage a trois scene has been cut so it would not be classified as NC-17) than the first entry in the series. a compelling torture. <br /> <br /> To complete, everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting here is very bad <br /> Sharon Stone has some highlights but here she "Instinct 2" is a horrible way to continue an original series that has managed to put thriller with erotica Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you .... "Wild Instinct 2" never sounded like a good movie, and in fact, it's not. Some movies should never get off the paper, and that's the feeling you have after watching it. Now, it's much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg gave up, and why Sharon Stone was expecting a huge salary for it ...... ----- 3/10
