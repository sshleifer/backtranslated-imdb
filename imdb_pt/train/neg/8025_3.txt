Yes, even as a fan of shows like the survivor and the apprentice, this show is very bad. I did not mind the first couple of shows, but then I realized just how pathetic everyone was to go to the show in the first place. The antics of Alex and Aaron giving men a bad name in the way they betrayed or abandoned their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look at the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. She had the most annoying voice I've ever heard on television, and she was definitely not the smartest girl in the world (very media savvy, but I doubt there's much else there). <br /> <br /> I have not really watched any of the shows since then, apart from the occasional re-run on daytime TV. I think TV's purpose is to treat it as "fun junk". Watch as something you can laugh at, and do not need to think too much about it (I do not see CSI as a tired reality TV and cliché, but you have to think a lot anyway while watching). <Br /> <br /> A couple of thoughts about some reasons to go to the show. In the first 'the woman tells everyone' Woman like Amy (who had a lot of class on her) remarked that she had tried every scene aka the bar scene and club meet a guy and it was not happening for her. Hey Amy, how about joining a club - doing a hobby - doing a charity job - switching your job to one where you find the most guys, all I know is that going to a bar is not the place to find a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many other girls seemed obsessed with the idea of ​​knowing "the perfect man." Tip for ladies: it does not exist. There are, however, many cool guys out there who would make great husbands, some who might be good for you! they may not earn six digits a year or be a junior junior, but they are great guys the same way. The superficiality of the woman in this show is unbelievable. I am still a young man, was led to believe that the woman gradually grew out of her shallowness as she aged and more realistic about her future partner. This show is proving otherwise. <br /> <br /> Overall, this program does much to confirm many stereotypes of how women view men in society. It really is a terrible show and I think all these kinds of shows should stop being made. The best dating shows for a country mile are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun. Nothing is busier among the "couples" than a simple night out. the bachelor, unfortunately, takes himself too seriously.
