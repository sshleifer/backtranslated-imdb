It seems that the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this somewhere abroad, perhaps to Earth Mediocre? "PP" reminds me of any of the many tedious, promising at first but predictable within a season of David Kelly (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so strange they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. And that's what really makes good medical dramas marked - dramatic situations that you're afraid of: "This could be me" feeling. They are not funny either. <br /> <br /> The actors are very good, but the plot is dead and can not be brought back to life. I am a therapist, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the incredibly incompetent, unethical and untrained therapist. Anyone who writes her things has flunked courses on ethics and transference / countertransference at Stanford. Someone should give them a Code of Ethics to read (the episode with the wife with bleeding in the nose and the involvement of the therapist in her). No therapist is that bad. <br /> <br /> Women longing for men who moved on - were killed, we all formed "Sex and the City." Addison in her youthful aggression toward the guy she likes - very inappropriate for age, seems so unnatural to a woman over 40, and this talented actress does not believe in herself and does not deliver her very well. The only successful / palatable developments are Addison struggling with his decision to move to Los Angeles, and the "Voodoo Dr" and his coping with widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept can work with a new team of copywriters.
