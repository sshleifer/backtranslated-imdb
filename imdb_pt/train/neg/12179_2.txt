Nor is it worth watching this spooky spoiler ruin everything about 'Annie'. The characters seem almost trivialized by the poorly written plot and by the feeling of low quality production. It was very clearly made for TV, but if I found it on my television, I would go over it. The children in the film do a good job, but the acting adults are unbelievable and so the film can not lure it. This movie did not have the music / dance numbers that made the original brilliant and really takes the shine out of Annie. All love. Johnson, as Annie is sometimes annoying and over-gifted ... you can not convince yourself that she really is Annie. The differences in the character's appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film. It's sad to say that this sequel was a total failure.
