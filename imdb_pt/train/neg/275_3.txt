It's absolutely incredible to me that anyone can comment that this movie is not a pest. It is not only overwhelmingly preaching but absurd, staged onstage, dramatically attached to the body and painfully exhausted. Observing, it seems that an 8 year old is punished for having to write "I will not become a fascist" on the board 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that this was done during the high WW2, and was designed to be a brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he brought, (no one would applaud with all my heart) and I have certainty that accurately captured the climate of the day. But it is presented in such an immature, overly obvious way that it does not function as a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his work. role as a silently heroic antifascist; and Lucile Watson as the playfully richly rude grandmother who slowly comes to realize just how dangerous the world has become. Although their rootless education has subjected them to all sorts of difficulties, children are ridiculously shown to be little robotically well-behaved little bitches. They do not even remotely resemble real humans. And Bette Davis, an excellent actress, is so dimensionally noble here that I shrink every time she shows up on the screen. Every word of her, all her gestures are meant to show how supportive and understanding she is of the SACRIFICES her husband has to do and the great cause for which he is struggling, that she must have been electrocuted to receive a painful electric shock if daring allowed any hint of doubt or shading to appear in his portrait. <br /> <br /> So, yeah, this is a very IMPORTANT movie, but not very good.
