This reboot is like a processed McDonald's meal compared to Ang Lee's very good but highly underrated 2003, "The Incredible Hulk." <br /> <br /> Ang Lee's "The Hulk" is a comic book for the thinking person. The Hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he sees it, we see the conflict at the core of our protagonist. He does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he gives in to his anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this to Edward Norton's turn, where there is no show of conflict. in his personality, and he turns into the Hulk whenever he gets excited and his pulse rate reaches 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). For this reviewer, this is similar to the introduction of midi-chlorians in The Phantom Menace, which tells how strong the "force" is with one, as if the mystical abilities could be assessed through a blood test. In the 2008 film, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner has to do is keep his heart rate below 200 as monitored by a device stuck on his wrist. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get someone's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exciting race, especially for a physically fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions direct Eric Bana's Hulk. He suppressed memories of his mother's death and the role of his father in his early years. On the surface, he is calm but underneath there is significant anger, enough anger to fuel the Hulk when he is released. But the Hulk never kills intentionally, not even its attackers. Mostly, he just wants to stay away from or near Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He incapacitates his shooters and, in a critical scene, saves a fighter jet that haunts him from a collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 film, the visual effects are there, but if necessary. The action scenes (and there are many of them) are necessary for the plot, unlike the 2008 film, where the action is inserted as a matter of action. <br /> <br /> In his quest to turn it into a "fugitive" story, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. For him, the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment that went awry. And Louis Leterrier, the director taking the cut of Ed Norton, does not add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summed up as: Banner is chased and Hulk kicks ass, Banner is puckered and Hulk kicks the butt. Repeat as necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the 2003 film is that it may not be as true to comics as the 2008 version. However, even being a comic book fan, I would prefer a film that is not as true to comics as a fanboy's dream, but to have a heart about the 2008 version that is fair but fabricated and soulless on any given day. <br /> <br /> Maybe Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a film that is true to its roots and has heart.
