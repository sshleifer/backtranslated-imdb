"Iowa" wants to be "Requiem for a Dream" for methamphetamine from the American Midwest, but it looks like a "Reefer Madness." <br /> <br /> Yes, drugs are bad, and meth is terribly pernicious, like an addiction, and how it destroys people, families, and communities. But these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the blinding storyline do not teach this lesson to anyone. While writer / director / star Matt Farnsworth has a bit of on-screen charisma, his partner Diane Foster plays an innocent, wide-eyed, drug-corrupted, already lampooned Susan Sarandon in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show ". "I really pitied her for all the utterly unnecessary nudity she went through. It was not until the end of the movie that I realized that I should think these two were high school graduates to explain a little of their naivety, already that we are bombarded by the photos of their school, but if so, they even looked older than the people in "The OC."

Weiss, who was so good at TV's "The Pretender," is completely ridiculous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is simply crazy, as her character virtually ruined any social significance for the film.Rabanna Arquette has to be even more sloppy than she has rolled by David Cronenberg as a very low rent Livia Soprano.John Savage still has the mouth of the old baby boo I'm sorry about I made pot, but this is worse. A gothic girl appears, with the strange explanation that she is a stripper from Des Moines. Does the mandatory Latino drug trafficker appear - in Iowa? <br /> <br /> With a limited budget, the inner vision of methamphetamine use is portrayed quite vividly, with hallucinations quite frightening. We certainly see them crazed. While Iowa locations are used very well (including a fun scene of a propane robbery), the accents and references of the church are confusingly Southern Baptist. Guns appear to be used by law-abiding laws and break citizens here more than in any downtown drug-trafficking film. <br /> <br /> The songs of Iowa's best-known bard, Greg Brown, are used everywhere, but strangely they are not listed in the credits. I hope they have been used with permission. <br /> <br /> I caught it in your NYC commercial because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival where it was a considerable buzz - and inexplicable.
