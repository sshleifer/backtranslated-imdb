What a disappointment! I hated the mummy, but this one was even worse! It was very tiring and unbelievable and at one point I found myself sighing and yawning all the time. I can not believe people really liked this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very convincing. The whole movie seemed like a great tour of America's most wanted buildings. The flow of never-ending tips and combinations was also not very convincing. I stopped paying attention in about 30 minutes. What should have been a happy night has become a total disappointment. What a drag ... I think I just saw many movies to enjoy the National Treasure.
