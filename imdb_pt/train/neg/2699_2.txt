I have not read a single IMDb commentary for this movie that mentions how the Jewish character in this film jumped up and down like a baby while a gun is pointed at his face by a racist skinhead while the main character in the film stared at him the barrel of a gun. <br /> <br /> I do not know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced description of college life. I agree that universities are not bastions of tolerance as they should be and that the title would be appropriate if Singleton did not make his characters so caricatured. <br /> <br /> On the surface, he tries to portray the character of Ice Cube. like a bad guy, causing Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who forms at the end of the film's redeeming epilogue? It seems that Singleton points to the white as incapable of empathy (I did not say sympathize!) With his fellow black student or just able to follow the path of a racist skinhead. Many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Even women who have been raped do not immediately turn to lesbianism, which is portrayed more as a cult than as a way of life. Honestly, what was the point?
