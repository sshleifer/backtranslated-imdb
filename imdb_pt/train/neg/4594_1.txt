I had countless problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> It contains some basic factual information about quantum mechanics, which is good. Although quantum physics has been around for more than 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying, "You're not in awe of it!" Well, not really. These are no more earthly revelations. Anyway, I was already familiar with quantum theory, and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations, etc., is not new. The main problem I have with this movie, however, is how these people use quantum theory as a way to provide a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics really has nothing to do with these things, and should be kept separate. The people they interviewed for this movie begin with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking of something you can change the subject around you should think positively in order to have a positive impact in the world and make our lives better. The reasoning is completely ridiculous, and the conclusions do not follow logically from quantum theory. For every "expert" they interviewed for this movie, there are dozens of theoretically physicists who would disagree completely. They rightly point out that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not support mystical notions about our spiritual connection. <br /> <br /> It makes me sick that people see this movie and eat it completely. because it leaves them with a good positive feeling. The main objective of the film is based on a total misunderstanding of the quantum theory, and is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify the organized religion with similar pseudoscientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point one of the "experts" says that since the beginning of history most of the assumptions made about the world have turned out to be false, so the assumptions we now have about the world are also false. There is? This totally does not follow. And even if that happened, I do not see how that helps your argument. I mean, if their ideas became common assumptions, then I think we would have to assume that they are false too, based on their own reasoning.
