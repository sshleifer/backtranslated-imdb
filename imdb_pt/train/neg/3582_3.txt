No, it's not the horror movie ... This is, in fact, a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a silent film of 1927 showing two boxers and the woman standing between them. She loves the boxer known as "One Round" Jack. She loves him until the champion shows up. Even though she marries One Round, she begins flirting openly with the champion until the end of the boxing match between One Round and the champion. She returns to the corner of One Round when things seem more daunting, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win back his wife. <br /> <br /> This movie was very early in Hitch's career, but the limitations of time should not have made it a lasting movie. Although there are special movie tricks and some comedy relief, this movie does not hold up in any of his later work. It must have been extremely risky for the time period, however, with the adulterous wife without shame. This may have been the drawback of 1927. When looking through all these old movies, it's amazing how I think they could be redone on today's screen and really will come out. Maybe I should be the one ... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie unless you're planning to watch all the Hitchcock movies. You could fall asleep in the middle.
