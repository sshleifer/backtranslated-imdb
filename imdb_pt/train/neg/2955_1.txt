Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a friend's dinner and she adds a comment to the ongoing deep political discussion. People just look at her and say, "Oh, what do you know, you were the star of 'Theodore Rex.'" How could anyone take her seriously after she stooped down to be the star of this terrible crap? Even little children would be shrinking in horror at this Thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'Sigmund And The Sea Monsters'. In fact, he came to think of it, 'Sigmund' was far superior to that. <br /> <br /> And how was it done? For exercising the producer with an illegal substance before talking about it? Observe this heinous abomination at your own risk.
