This film is a pathetic attempt, apparently, to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do this, they put a 19-year-old boy - well, probably not "to do that." There was no way they could have a boy of 12 or 13 as the boy, because the love scenes would have raised everyone (if they had been allowed to do them) - as they should. Mary Ann's boyfriend was my nephew's age, making her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of pedophile does not have to include many children - all you need is one. <br /> <br /> I do not really care about your upbringing or your unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility to her students that she was not up to it. The reason given is that she is bipolar, rejected the diagnosis and refused to take the medication. It is understandable, then, that she was not thinking rationally. She is expected to understand her actions now. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray that she is taking her medications and thinking clearly. <br /> <br /> All this aside, Penelope Ann Miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role.
