"Three Daring Daughters" is a sickly, pink look at divorce, remarriage and the lives of single parents. Obviously, social issues and economic hardship do not take place in the perfect life of a single parent who feels exhausted, cruises, and then dates and marries a band conductor. Even when the phrase "it's just a movie" excuses the script from addressing real-life problems, "Daughters" suffers from many incoherent songs, children whose personalities are not based on real children and the band leader Hose Iturbi interpreting himself. Is not it bizarre for any real person to star in a movie in which their supposed real self marries? <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was released in the 1940s. Only a love of old-fashioned Hollywood romance and comedy could make Daughters a tolerable movie.
