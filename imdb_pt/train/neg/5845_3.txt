well after watching this I can say that it is not the worst movie ever made, yes folks there is worse than that, there are some good points for the movie, you get to watch drunk teens, have horrible deaths, and cute looking mice eating some scientific experiment, and getting grotesquely huge, the drunken janitor, the cranky doctor, but a girl in thong panties who has absolutely no shame, idiot idiots, I could not wait for the rat to eat these drunken fools, I was cheering for the time the ntire time, had a good premise, the first part of the film, was interesting, although with the scientific explant on the rats, and the little story back, but I think ruined when drunk teens dumb idiots enter at stake, the mouse in my opinion, what to get lost, her name is Brenda, was so fake, must have been a cgi mouse, looked like a guy dressed in a beaver suit, this was too schlocky, lame, but not totally horrible,
