Obviously made to show the famous talent of stripper Misty Ayers of the 50's. It's a shame she can not act. <br /> <br /> An upset tale about sweet innocent Sally Down (Ayers) being drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she meets the nice Tommy Cole, who instantly falls in love with her. He wants to help her escape, but can he? You really will not care. <br /> <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayers simply undresses slowly down to her panties (twice). The rest is just a boring tale of bad acting, atrocious "comedy" (I never thought prostitution was funny, but what do I know?) And terrible post-nicknamed dialogue. I admit there was a turnaround in the end that I did not see coming, but that is not enough to get through it. Also Ayers attempts to act are hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid.
