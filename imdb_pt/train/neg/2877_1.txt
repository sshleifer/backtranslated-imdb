My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention sharing an office with him. When it was announced that he was BTK, she was shocked. All day long it was just her telling stories about how she'd never have seen him as the Wichita killer. I heard her re-tell them many times. I asked her about many things, and went to all the interviews she was invited to go. I read the entire book written about Raider, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas. There was another BTK movie on TV not long ago, and I thought this would be better in portraying the murders of Dennis, maybe even have some clever touches on his motives. <br /> <br /> I will be very frank with the flaws in this movie. This is based on my mother's picture of him, all my readings on him, and the videotapes I saw of him speaking. <br /> <br /> First of all, the camera angles were horrible. It looked like it had been filmed on a home video camera. The acting was terrible and I could not bear to watch it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider has never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and was "follow the rule book" type. He was not as good as the movie made him look, he was very polite and abrupt, like business. The same goes for your murders, as we all know. If you have seen your confession in court, you can already guess. <br /> <br /> What about the obsession with the slaughterhouse? No. I've never read or Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with cruelty to animals or to people who crush insects. In fact, he practiced cats and dogs for suffocating methods. However, throughout the film he was putting animals on the faces of his victim and acting as if he cared about their welfare. Dennis Raider never killed the people he knew, he confessed it, but in the movie on his first murder he tells the girl that he knows her too. <br /> <br /> I really do not even want to go to this movie, and I'm already complaining. This is not what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual events of BTK. This is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. If you want a half-filmed half-porn with some slaughter scenes served next, then this is your type of movie.
