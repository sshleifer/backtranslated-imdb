Yes, there are worse movies out there. Most of them are made for fun, on a shoe string budget, or as a t.v. movie of the week, but even if this were the "movie of the week", it would be no more than two stars. It is a poor film about a serious subject that characterizes an abused woman who escapes of the king of the mud for the protective arms of the king of the town. (If this is an attempt to show that she does not need a man to protect her than the man who is the superfluuto of the film and should not be in it.) It has no suspense, character development, and a heroine that could be outdone by an onion rotton. (I think she releases her wedding ring on a boat with an independent tank instead of just leaving it at sea (where her body should be) and after her husband finds her, demonstrating that she is an idiot, she still makes childish assumptions that lead to almost killing her.) I always wonder when I see the sort of generally high rating of a movie like that and it makes me realize that Dr. Seuss still has a huge untapped market of people who would be challenged for your work. After I finish laughing at humanity, I cry.
