Typical Thriller, was done many times before. Simple plot outline; police officer Liotta becomes obsessed with Russell's wife, and he tries to beat the good old Kurt so he can have her. This is beyond predictable, does not even try to make you guess, the plot is the plot and there is no thought outside the box here. I think the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops, but nothing is done originally or interestingly. There is really nothing to say about this movie, it is not particularly bad, but there are also no good points. Russell plays Russell and you know what you'll get when you see him in a movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an irritating voice from Cher. I read the outline of the plot and I could see the movie in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I watched and rolled in front of my eyes just like I imagined. I did not feel a drop of emotion everywhere. I do not have any feelings about this movie, it's like I've never watched it. Considering this, it's a pretty nonsensical movie, is not it? Still, I'll give it 3/10 for some reason.
