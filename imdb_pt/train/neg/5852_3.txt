Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene; having partial amnesia (or "global amnesia," which a character claims to describe as an elective loss of memory), the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hope of reconstituting his life. Abominable mix very loosely based on Walter Ericson's book "Fallen Angel" (filmed in 1965 as "Mirage" with Gregory Peck). It was probably too daring for television - which with drugs and hippies added to the mix - that NBC initially refused to show it, and that's how this low-budgeter ended up in theaters. Director James Goldstone is weird with hyperkinetic visuals and camera tricks, while editor Edward A. Biery goes crazy with zigzag cuts. Unfortunately, his admittedly colorful tricks can not cover up the weaknesses of this up-to-date plot, and the acting is regrettably mature. Dillman, under pressure to reminisce about the events of the night in question, goes through an Actor Seminar of tics, stutterers, nose wipes, and half-crazy laughs, while spitting dialogues like, "Dream ... a dream ... drugs. .. yeah, drugs ... that sound ... bells ... help! "As a scientist villain with a Cheshire cat smile, Pat Hingle almost overshadows Dillman in Grand Thespian department, continually addressing everyone in baby talk, parading like a middle-aged peacock and twisting his mouth in agony. Hope Lange's scientist / love interest gets a little attention, but not before she screams with the indifferent lover Dillman: "What do I have to do, talk Monkey Man? I Want You!" This is a frenetic "Jigsaw"! * 1/2 of ****
