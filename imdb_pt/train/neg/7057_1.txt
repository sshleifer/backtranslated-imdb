This is one of the most annoying and tasteless movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Every time he started to look like he was getting better, there were more sepia flashbacks, followed by paranoid idiocy disguised as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a so-called manipulative rebel, who lives in a mansion apparently without parents or responsibilities. The support cast is much more enjoyable and interesting, but unfortunately it is never developed. Nor do we really understand the character of John Stanton supposedly influencing Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought "Aha! Maddox is just crazy and is secretly doing all those Stanton patient mental communications escaped! Now we're getting somewhere!" but of course this is not the case and the whole movie turns out to be useless, both from the perspective of Maddox and the viewer. Where is Ferris Bueller when we need him?
