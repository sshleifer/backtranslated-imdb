About three minutes later, I began to move quickly, stopping only during nudity (why do bad films always include such beautiful women?). In ten minutes I was ready and wishing I could get my money back from the store. The people who write these films must be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on, writers - bandits ALWAYS get in the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote! This is how it has been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! In addition, to add insult to injury, the "turnaround" in the end was so stereotyped that it could have come from any action movie written in the last 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should focus on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - run away! To run away!
