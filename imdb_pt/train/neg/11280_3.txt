This movie is about the life of a man going wrong. His business is failing, and he can not conceive his wife despite several attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is a complete chaos. It simply does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the movie makes sense. The story is so badly told that I just could not understand it. It's a shame because the sets and the costumes are well made and are visually stimulating enough. The shots are well composed throughout the film. However, these redeeming features still can not compensate for the bad plot and poor storytelling. I'm impressed by the big names who agreed to star in this movie. It's a waste of your talents. This movie is really bad. Avoid it !!
