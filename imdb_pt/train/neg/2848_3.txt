... so I thought I'd drop some words about William McNamara. Not a bad way to spend a few hours if you want to see it in your tight whits - it's obvious that he struggled for this role and he looks pretty good on them - or less. There is an extensive sequence in a cave where he has to undress for his panties. There is a good part where he has to run after Miss Eleniak, with only his hands cupped over his crotch. William McNamara is naturally a bit skinny, but he has a good, generous handful of booty. Also, there is a time when he is getting out of bed and if you stop the action at the right time, you can see the whole enchilada. If you are inclined to do so, and come, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy men on a "road trip" are. I would like to thank Dennis Hopper for his free nudity of equal opportunity. Can William McNamara take action? Hell, if I know.
