"Plants are the most astute and cruelest of all life forms," ​​informs a doped victim in "The Seedpeople," a silly, flabby remake of "Invasion of the Bodysnatchers," "Day of the Triffids," and a thousand moovies of the udder. And why are seeds more dangerous than plants, you may ask? Because, according to the same idiot, "the seeds can chase us." Yes, I remember a horrible incident when MooCow was just a calf, being chased all the way home from school by voracious dandylion seeds ... Yeah, right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" in this kind of little turkey look like small muppets, some rolling like rotting herbs, others roping on ropes. There is not the slightest trace of terror or suspense to be found here. For reasons left unexplained, seed monsters are knocked out by 50-volt ultraviolet lamps, even if they can walk in daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000,000 times more uv energy. As you can see, little thought was put on this cow flop. MooCow says it will take care of your garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
