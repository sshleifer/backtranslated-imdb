(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /> <br /> Usually a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to watch tonight. I had to turn it off before the second hour because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for the daughter or mother. Both seemed absorbed with little regard for others, with the daughter also adding rude, disrespectful and reckless to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, "At least we will not have to see her any more." Keaton did a good job of getting into his stunned state and mourning, but it was a long way off for me by then. I just did not like it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the protagonist, you need to care about the characters much earlier - if it's almost an hour and I do not care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> Support The cast was sincere and well-touched - I felt for them! * - and the best gay friend was wonderful, but even matched, that was not enough to get the movie for me.
