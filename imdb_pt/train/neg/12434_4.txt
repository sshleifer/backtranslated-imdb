In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Plans, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy? the best thing he's ever done. Ten years later, he reduced himself to once again recycling the 'Home Alone' plot in this second sequence, which is not connected to the other films, but is also uninspired and sadistic. The four bad guys? That's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change into the series! ??? are electrocuted with metal chairs, dumbbell hooks and blind ink, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is still less charming than Culkin. You would think that the departure of almost all the main actors in the first two films would prevent Hughes from fossilizing the same old routines, but the only surprise is that even he did not appear in 'Home Alone 4'.
