I watched this movie purely for the scenario. It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns. The plot was predictable, the acting was mediocre, at best the scares were all coarse, not real scares. <br /> <br /> I do not remember much of the plot, and I think it's because there was not. t lots of one to remember. They do not even use the hotel to their full potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula. At low tide, you can walk almost 1/4 mile to the bay, which is actually a strange sight in the first hour of the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The best One way to see this movie is with the remote control in your hand so you can quickly move through the action scenes (and I'm using that term freely) and pause in the beauty of the environment !
