Okay, first of all, Seagal's voice is dubbed by about 50% of the movie ... Why? Because apparently they had to rewrite the script and the story while they were filming and they needed to change their dialogue for the continuity of the story, since they have several versions. From the start, you just scratch your head because overdubs are not only distracting, but they do not make sense. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the story is still a drug and does not make the slightest sense. When I got to the end, I was just scratching my head because the film was so useless and the ending did not even make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. This movie made me stop watching Seagal directly for video movies because they only got worse and worse.
