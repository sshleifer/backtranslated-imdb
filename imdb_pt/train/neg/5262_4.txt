We had to go on a date, so we turned on the DVR to record the ending. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?" He shook his head. I said, "So you made me watch the end of this movie and I have no idea what happened." He did not "make me", but you know. <br /> <br /> The film's own body was very good. There was a lot of suspense. That made you think. Then came the end. The end was ... well finished. You were not told what happened or why. Even the credits I kept thinking that something would happen to explain, but it never happened. So I came here expecting someone to find out and I just was not paying attention. No. Here, four years later, I am as ignorant as the seraglio. I still have no idea what happened. I'm glad I did not spend any $$ to buy it, because I sure would have been crazy. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! Got it! The end of the movie is what disappeared! ROFL
