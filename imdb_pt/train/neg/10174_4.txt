I saw it in '94 when it was finally released. Apparently because the photos of Orion were bankrupt, I think, the film had not been released a few years before. <br /> <br /> I have trouble remembering details in part because I have not seen you in a long time, but I remember it as a very annoying movie. I kept debating whether it would come out of it. The store was not at all interesting or engaging. It was a 3rd rate America Graffiti imitation. <br /> <br /> None of the performances are worth watching as well. One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper critic gave it a high rating.
