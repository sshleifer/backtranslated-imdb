Dir-Tobe Hooper: Scary, but sadistic portrait (which makes sense) of a relative of the Marquis de Sade performing the same sadistic acts and taking advantage of what his predecessor supposedly did . This film Tobe Hooper really does not do much different from his similar style Freddy Krueger movies with the same star (himself Freddy - Robert Englund) playing a double role (the Marquis De Sade and his relative). It also seems that he really wants to criticize Christianity, but then loses it, ultimately, to my chagrin, but leaves an inconsistent feeling in the film. It could have been much worse if the excesses were taken in sex and violence, but they try to keep it to a minimum, despite some disgusting scenes. My last thought is why Hooper wants to make this movie. Obviously it took a while to be distributed, so it has to be announced with horror and with Hooper's name on the title to earn some money in his name and his blood. Obviously this did not work.
