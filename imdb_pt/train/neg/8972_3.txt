<br /> <br /> The main question I put about this movie is: how do you shoot a musical cole porter and use only 3 of your 15 songs! merman and lahr played the lead roles on broadway, here they are replaced by the red skelton and the weaker lucille ball. lot changes abound and fun is lost. <br /> <br /> SKIP IT.
