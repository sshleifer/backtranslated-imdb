This movie is incredible. I watched the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said that everything was fine, but I think RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and intelligent. He made a totally different movie from those terrible Hollywood movies, like Matrix and Stop, or my mother is going to film. It could have been better, though. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like this great claw that the funny man uses. I think he's the coolest guy ever since that Domino Pizza clay guy. Not only does this movie look really cool, like those out of focus movies that my dad made from my birthday when I turned 6. He tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated, but they all meet in the end. It's cool how this web is woven to make everything lie. I wish Ted V. Mikels would do a continuation. But you need more aliens. And a pirate.
