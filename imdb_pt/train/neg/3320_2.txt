Honestly, I had high expectations when I first started watching this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> First of all, the pace is incredibly slow. , so it seems much longer than it is (and is not short). I'm sure that when Jane Austen wrote the book, she made several pages, filled it in with description, and did not want people to read it one day, or she could drag and lose her appeal, which "Emma" certainly did. Now "Sense and Sensibility" had this failure of a slow pace, but at least had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> This leads me to flaw # 2, of course, the acting. Although I do not care about basically anyone involved in this movie, I'm sure they are capable of a good job, but I have not seen much of this in this movie. It was as if people were trying hard to be witty, very difficult to be "upper class," very difficult to be British (well, some of them), so they all sounded like a lot of actors and not as people. <br /> <br /> # 3. The cast, like I said, looked just like actors, not like the people who were playing. Maybe it's a good thing, because the people they played really were not that cool. Why does everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Of course, she was cool with the rich and beautiful people in front of them, but she was a horrible gossip on their backs. If her friends were "ugly", she did not even bother going behind her back. So why is this girl so good? Why do people have to tell stories "just to make her laugh?" Of course the snob could not even do it right. I have enough trouble with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her "Emma" did not exactly change my opinion. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I do not care. I'm sure it's a lovely book and all, but some books are not meant to be made for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
