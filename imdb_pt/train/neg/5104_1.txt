Now, what's wrong with the actors who participated in this crap? Michael Dorn should keep the Star Trek merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember him in Miami Vice? I liked him there ... Well, whatever - what can you expect from a movie with one of the baywatch life guards in the lead? Nothing, and that's what we got. None of the characters are really nice, the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a joke (very bad). There is no logic whatsoever for what is happening. I had the feeling that the filmmakers were experiencing some kind of thing "Attack of the Assassin Tomatoes". Especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of closet ... <br /> <br /> If you happen to see on TV, change channels - your TV will be grateful.
