This is possibly the most annoying movie in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd rather see the Three Amigos than watch this movie again. It went immediately from the DVD player directly to the trash. My apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie, however, you probably liked New Coke as well. I can not understand why anyone would have liked this movie, it's slow, bland and no real plot. You wait 105 minutes for the movie to begin. I understand this was done in 1976 however this was a time of poor television around. Thank God disco and three company are gone along with stop sign goggles and the Bay City rollers. Well, just my thoughts.
