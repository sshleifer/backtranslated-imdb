This movie is a 90 minute Ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute hassle. What kind of high school is that anyway? <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big fan of Ramones, DO NOT repeat and DO NOT waste your time as I did. This is totally impractical from start to finish. This movie must be called the Ramone Fever. Everyone seems to like them in this movie. There is no plot to be found in this movie. As far as teenage comedies are concerned, you're scraping the bottom of the barrel with this.
