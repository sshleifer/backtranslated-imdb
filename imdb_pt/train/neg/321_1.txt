Shecky, you're a damn legend, make no mistake. Until recently, I worked for a HiFi & Video retail chain in the UK running the testing department. We would like to go through many new beginners, they would be expected to learn to fail to find the various debris that returns as non-functional in one form or another of the stores. Now, to test the resolution of these new team members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We've had hundreds of copies of this movie because whenever someone who bought a particular DVD model of Goodmans who had this movie as a free gift was able to send their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back as well. Our new team would be forced to use only the Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they found one or two discs to test. <br /> <br /> Now, why is this movie so bad? Adam Sandler, who can be as, very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the wedding singer, must have had a hell of a day off. The rest of the crew stink, and what about Billy Zane? His name appears in several of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. Production quality is absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would be inclined to give a zero if I could, because they did not even dare call her by her full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' at launch. Even so, it's worth a watch so you can see how far Sandler has come and how much he can go.
