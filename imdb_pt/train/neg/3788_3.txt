There is much to like here. The actors are first-rate and the script provides a good dialogue, better capturing the atmosphere of a friendly and close family. However, for this reason, the movie does not sound true. We see Leo, who apparently just knew of his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially reacting in a way that is not in tune with the supporting atmosphere to which he is. In addition, the film abruptly ends by avoiding what Leo, his brother, and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in the light of his love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as is usually the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the writers could not decide whether they wanted an insightful dissertation about the effects of HIV on a functional and attractive family or about the devastation that HIV has over the victim - so that indicates only the two. While this film provides food for thought leaves the viewer wanting much more than surrender.
