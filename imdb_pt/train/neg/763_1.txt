I love Columbus and saw pretty much every episode, but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot. A pile of incontestable, nonsensical and confusing nonsense that loses both the time of audience and the talents of Peter Falk, who look extremely bored. The 'plot', as it is, seems to be invented, since the film does not accompany even the slightest hint of the formula ingredients that made the show such a brilliant success to begin with. One part of the process that I found extremely intriguing (or possibly annoying) was the character of Peter Falk being introduced to guests at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If producers insist on keeping Columbus's first name secret, why could not they omit this line, since it seems ridiculous? As I said, these are the holes and all true Columbus fans would do well to avoid this like the plague.
