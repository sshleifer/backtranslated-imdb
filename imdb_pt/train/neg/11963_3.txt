I like Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be fun watching this movie, since I know he admired Alan King and they would be funny together. I thought I'd seen all of Billy's movies, but I could not remember this, and now I know why. It is so full of cliches and false emotion; you can smell every scene coming (and going!). Billy does not even get to be funny very often. He's too busy trying to cry fake tears or showing his anguish how badly his father let him down. Alan King himself is quite nice, as is the sub-story about being an extra in the movies. But what a coincidence happens when Billy visits his father at the moment when a major health crisis happens, etc. etc. Or that two busy doctors may simply end their practices to fight in Los Angeles. And when the end comes, boy, come soon! Almost as if the writers had realized that they had turned into a corner and that the only way out was to make a death scene. Mostly disappointing with some glimpses of good humor.
