Being a big fan of Corman's horror films, I expected a little more from his western than I received. Well, I was entertained all right. I had almost as many laughs as watching Mel Brooks Burning Selections. <br /> <br /> See the spectacle of moving tire tracks on the old west prairie. You can kill time by telling them if there is a boring scene. And the horses seem to have gears on them too, considered quick pursuits. See also the queens of the bar swinging from the traditional hall of the wild west making a number reminiscent of a 1920s fashion dance, here decades before the style was invented. I hope the hall around them does not disintegrate. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this, the main actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all very well. A special compliment to them for doing their best with the material that seems to have been taken from Johnny's guitar, but it does not impress in the same way. But there's really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this. Just like a really bad horror movie, it can fail one way, but it manages to bring joy anyway. That's one of the reasons Corman's work appeals to me and that's why I dare recommend you try this movie if you get the chance.
