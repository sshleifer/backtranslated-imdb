Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie she has ever seen ... Since I thought it was pretty bad it also made me think - which movie was the worst movie I've ever seen and that was the The only movie that came to mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's been a couple of years since I've seen it, but I remember the horribly miscast Dean Cain as arrogant military man (Cain's handsome boy does not do too arrogant well). The odd deal with the CGI helicopter, when it would probably be cheaper to rent a helicopter than to hire some CGI guys to do it, but my guess is they found the helicopter as a free sample for some CGI program or the producer's son liked play with your new computer. And how was it? Horrible. And when the dragon loads through the corridors of the complex, then reuse the same shots repeatedly - it seems VERY cheap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - it's really horrible ...
