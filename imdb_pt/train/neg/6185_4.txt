My first review of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love exploring hidden treasures at the bottom of a local reef. One day after a day of exploration, they are approached by a couple of David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about the hidden treasure of Columbus that is reported on the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day the four dives bottom of the reef and roughly after a full day of diving they find nothing. A few days later and the two hired divers discovered that they are part of a great mortal plot in which they can not escape, otherwise they will be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a nucleus. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a story about another person (main character's brother) trying to fix things with his girlfriend, I think this part of the story was a waste of time, this also includes a scene from very hot sex between the couple that for me is a complete waste and was not necessary to be shown. <br /> <br /> However, in addition, this film has a good underwater photograph and the colors blend well and that's why it gets 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel by name only. None of the original actors or characters return, have a stupid plot, stupid characters and a boring climax.
