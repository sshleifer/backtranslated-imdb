This movie is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers. His malicious behavior of "Law and Order" transitions into a failed comedy attempt. Charlie Sheen is the only one left unharmed in this horrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing out of this mess is the wedding of Charlie and Denise. I hope this effort yields better results.
