I went to see this movie hoping to see some Jet Li flashes in which we were impressed in Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately many of their fighting maneuvers are so clearly false that it even took away the pleasure of it. Flying kicks would be far more impressive if you could not see the wires holding it as it flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 shots. <br /> <br /> Too caricatured and very disappointing.
