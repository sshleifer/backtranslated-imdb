Although in some ways the Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative styles, Gabriele Muccino's design is rather mediocre. The film becomes increasingly foolish and manipulative as it approaches the end: human and emotional hearts, physical and metaphorical eyes. Seven Pounds is another amateur imitation of Amores Perros and 21 Grams by Alejandro González Iñárritu, with many and many flashbacks. The problem is that the story is pretty predictable from VERY easy through the movie. That's too bad, because Seven Pounds could have been so authentically "good" if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands.
