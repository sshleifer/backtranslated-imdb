This is one of the worst films ever made. Banal. Predictable. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that assessed one point was that there were some nice scenes highlighting Barcelona. I would imagine they would use movies like this at Guantanamo or some other secret CIA / NSA prison to torture suspects. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies have some redeeming features, that's nothing. If I were in it or would work, I would change my name. Truly a poop. Hard to write more than that, but I feel like the moviegoers in the world needed a head for it. On the other hand, it will be a great gift for people you do not support. <br /> <br /> You could send it to politicians you do not like, laws, ex-wives, teachers you hated, ex-employees, Dick. Cheney, W., and a host of others.
