I still do not know why I forced myself to sit with the whole thing. This "movie" was not worth the Memorex DVD-R on which it was recorded; I thought I was watching the end result of a group of high school students stealing the camcorder from their parents. This is by far the worst movie ever made. I really, from the bottom of my heart, I want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life. <br /> <br /> So, apparently, this must be bad on purpose; However, if you end up in Hell and are forced to watch 90 minutes of doo-doo, you'll see that Yamasato is really trying to make an incredible movie. The actors try dramatic performances comparable to those of Crimson Tide, but they approach The Marine. <br /> <br /> Crap is just the tip of the iceberg. The angles of the camera are terrible. The story is about C movie at best - the plot is not good enough to be considered a B-caliber movie. The dialogue tries to be dynamic and witty, but it sucks like everything else. Rumor has it that a copy of the script really attracts flies. Also, the techno score is annoying ... not because it's techno, but because it's NON-STOP. That's right, the song plays deep in ALL TIME, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I do not care what the statement says, I do not buy it. BOTS was not so bad on purpose, because it takes itself too seriously for what it was: a joke. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was a very low budget. But that's no excuse for its record suction factor. Great movies are born of substance, not budget. BOTS had none. <br /> <br /> Let me articulate even more the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if I were having a trio with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Samurai Blood came, I would be out of there faster than Steven Seagal in executive decision. <br /> <br /> No doubt some people will try to defend the film. Two, maybe three. They'll say, "It's chop-socky grindhouse!" or "tacky in a good way!" or "it's so bad, it's good!" These people are idiots. A movie is good or bad. There is no good bad movie. But there are things like idiots who like bad movies. Do not misunderstand me; There are many movies of not being taken seriously which are enjoyable and fun. Slither is one of them. BOTS is not. <br /> <br /> This suckfest lasts about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion, it's 90 minutes more. The best thing about this "movie" is the DVD cover, so the next time you're near the Wal-Mart DVD dump, take a look at it - DO NOT TOUCH IT, just watch - and walk away in silence.
