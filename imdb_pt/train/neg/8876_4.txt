A kind of family parody mixing "An Officer and a Gentleman," "Broken Heart Ridge," "Full Metal Jacket" (and arguably other movies I can not remember right now) into a rather boring movie with some bright spots. The jokes are always there where you'd expect them, and Damon Wayans lines are, well, predictable. As I said, unfortunately this movie never surprises you ...
