As usual, I went to watch this movie for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to finish his film career with this film as it would be successful. But fortunately or unfortunately, the film was a failure. After that, he made a success with Chandramukhi. I am eagerly waiting for your coming from Shivaji. <br /> I read the other user's comment about Rajni. I found it interesting how the user is from TN as well. Rajni is an actor who acts, I think, from his heart and not from his mind. He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we need to appreciate Rajni for his strength at his age. <br /> <br /> Any way, I need to fill 10 lines for this comment ... then I wish good luck Rajni ...... .....
