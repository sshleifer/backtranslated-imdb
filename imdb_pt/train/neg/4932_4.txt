Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the last of the series, and as part 4, has no relation with the top three, except for the title and the fact of being a horror film with Christmas theme. <br /> <br /> Other, there are some obvious things going on here ... Mickey Rooney plays a toy maker named Joe Petto and the name of his scary son is Pino. Ring a bell, anyone? Now a boy named Derek heard a knock on the door one night, and opened it to find a present at the door for him. Even saying "do not open until Christmas," he starts to open it anyway, but is interrupted by his father, who rebukes him and sends him to bed, and opens the gift in person. Inside is a small red ball that sprouts Santa's arms and head, and continues to kill his father. Oops, maybe he should have left enough alone. Of course Derek has been traumatized by the incident since he attended the ladder, but he did not grow up to be a killer Santa Claus, he just stops talking. <br /> <br /> There's a mysterious stranger lurking around, who seems very interested in the toys that Joe Petto does. We even see him buying a lot when Derek's mother takes him to the store to find a gift for him to get him out of the trauma. And what exactly is this guy doing? Well, we are not sure, but he seems to be dismantling these toys to see what makes them work. He prevents his landlord from dismissing him by promising to pay cash the next day and presents him with a toy "Larry the Larvae" for his son, but of course "Larry" is not a good toy and leaves the market. box in the car and of course, well, things are not pretty. <br /> <br /> Anyway, eventually what's happening to Joe Petto and Pino is of course revealed, and as with the old story, Pino is not a "real boy." Pin is probably even more agitated and disobedient because he suffers from "Kenitalia" (a smooth plastic groin) so that he could explain his bad ways. And the identity of the stranger on the prowl is also revealed, and there is even a sort of happy ending. Whee. <br /> <br /> One step up from part 4, but not much of one. Again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Screaming Mad George, then some decent special effects, but not enough to make it great. Some leftovers from part 4 are also out there, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that does not make any difference. Anyway, now I've seen the whole series out of my system. Now, if I could get some of it out of my brain. 4 out of 5
