I saw the movie as a kid when it was released in the theater and it was so bad it became the result of a familiar joke. If the rating had a zero, that movie would be the result. The dinosaurs were terrible. The plot was ridiculous. The acting does not really qualify to be called actuation. The only reason I even remember the name of the movie is because my family still talks about how bad it really was.
