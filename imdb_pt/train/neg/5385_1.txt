I do not know where to start. The cast is full of people who have never done anything before or after. Scott Debralee is listed in cover boxes but does not appear in the movie. Writing is very bad, even for college movies. It is obviously very low budget, with a scene in the fraternity house having extremely unstable editing. <br /> <br /> The characters are very typical of college movies - shy face, nerd, soft black face, tough guys, face with mustache Attractive girl, small town girl, etc. The featured teacher is about what you would expect ... middle-aged and heavy guy who is easily distracted. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see a Flick college, be clear on that. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
