I saw this by surprise two days before the official opening, and I must say I was extremely disappointed. And I have to put most of those issues in the decision to put Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think about the Danes, she has been horribly miscast, or is so far over her head that she should be the initial favorite for the 2007 Razzie for the Worst Actress. I think we should be sympathetic to her. Instead, it is completely unpleasant. The other "big" actresses do a good job, but they certainly do not light the screen. Of all the "great" actresses in this movie, I would say that the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture, and only appears near the end. <br /> <br /> Horrible script too. It appears more like reading lines than actually being "in character."
