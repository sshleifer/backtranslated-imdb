That's right. A film written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and his family. (Fred should have known better, having worked the sets of 'Titantic' and 'Dogma'). <br /> <br /> So, the plot. There are some scientists and some rangers and a hot girl with huge fake breasts. They are all very bad at their jobs, including hot (which I think is supposed to be a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). One of the rangers comments that scientists are "professional", which is good, because it would be horrible if they were larvae or professional jelly beans or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They are walking through the woods in search of some strange monkey-like bones, and no one even mentioned once that the bones could be those of the infamous Bigfoot. They just wander around and one of the rangers blatantly hits the hottie. We all hope he will die soon (along with his sister, who is cute but naive but really annoying). Then they, * sigh *, find a Sasqu ... I mean, Animal Burial Ground. Of course, it does not mention that they may just be big bones with which they are stirring ... I think scientists and rangers simply do not think about these kinds of things. <br /> <br /> So Sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we do not like, chases the other losers and buries his great aunt Muriel and her cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident ) again. <br /> <br /> Insipid, annoying dialogue (I zoned several times), inane plot, nasty characters, bad CGI (a man in a monkey suit would look better), and acting that just was not very good, everything would end to make a movie that I would not be watching again. <br /> <br /> You check it out; is good for some unintentional laughter.
