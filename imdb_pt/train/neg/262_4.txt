Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel he sold to win his first major major role in the budget. Foxx follows in the footsteps of artists like Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have seen their talents squandered by stereotypical producers who think black men committing crimes are a funny concept (see Money Talks, Blue Streak). <br /> <br /> Okay, I laughed a few times and I agreed that all these comedians continue to take on hilarious roles, but I'd love to see these guys branch out to Marlon Wayans in Requiem to a Dream. Or Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans, who play performances in Spike Lee's satire, Bamboozled.
