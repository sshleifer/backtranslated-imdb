I saw this movie when it was very small. It's by far one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Now, normally, I like weird movies, but that was a bit much. <br /> <br /> There is not much plot in the movie. If anything, start as Toy Story where the toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend, Babette. From there, the madness follows. There are the greedy ones, the Looneys, a sea monster called Gazooks, and a bunch of pirates singing tunes from shows that have made the movie even stranger. Besides, I can not help feeling that Babette is annoying and a little whiny. She definitely did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, although I did not like this movie, there were some cute parts. I liked camel music. Even if it was a song about being lonely, it had a friendly feeling. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most of the Looneys were simply crazy, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. King Koo Koo was just a little sack that made Dr. Mal look like a serious villain. In addition, there was the Raggedy Andy song, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely good music for boys who wanted to act tough. But honestly, even these things did not make the movie any better. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) Although I personally did not recommend this movie, even I have to admit, it has its lovely moments. See if you're interested, but only if you're in the mood for something "really" out of the ordinary.
