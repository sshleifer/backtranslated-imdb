There was no original idea in this story. Themes have been drawn from various sources; some being The Ninth Gate, The Mouth of Madness (another Carpenter's movie) and The Ring. He even presented the same brilliant circle of The Ring and used it as the film's namesake. Cody Carpenter's soundtrack was taken from Suspiria. I hope no one will object to this comment, spitting the word HOMAGE around. Yes, I saw that the theater was playing Argento's Deep Red. Claiming a tribute would be bullshit. This was the bottom of the barrel. Throwing blood and "disturbing" images into the pot does not make a good horror movie. Carpenter used to know that. He should disappear into obscurity or acquire a time machine.
