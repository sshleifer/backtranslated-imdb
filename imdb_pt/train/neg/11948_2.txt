Horrible bragging of a classic. <br /> <br /> It was not written convincingly because Mary should develop this sympathy for Bates. He may be more stable until he starts playing matches with him, but he still does not help himself with his actions. (inviting a comparative stranger to be alone with him in his newly abandoned motel, telling the attractive young woman his past mental problems, lying on the knives, etc.). This, in addition to his previous knowledge, should have kept Mary extremely cautious with him, but this somehow does not just happen so they can play the 'wrong identity' murder game later. What is also ridiculous in itself: 'So-and-so is the real murderer - plus so is he - too! There were many artificial twists in order to put a story on the screen when the narrative did not have to be extended. It was good to see Perkins reprise his famous role again, but that's the only little pleasure. to be had. It's definitely not a patch on Hitchcock, and if you have no intention of even trying to get close, you should not be bothering.
