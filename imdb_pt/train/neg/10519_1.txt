I've seen a lot of movies and rarely would I rate a movie as "1", but this movie went beyond the awful. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually, when I watch horror movies, I think it's DUMB when the characters hear a noise at home / forest / school / etc and then yell "hello, is anyone there?" - but at least they are believable when they do it .. This movie could not even hit that. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will make other horror films B like Venom and The Fog seem academy award winning works. <br /> <br /> I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and I write this comment so anyone who is thinking of watching this movie will think again . It's horrible!
