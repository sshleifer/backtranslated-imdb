There are a couple of previous comments here that have opined about the abundance of clich√©s in this film over - and I completely agree, both with regard to the characters and the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I read about Elizabeth Berkly's terrible performance on the equally terrible "Showgirls" that I've never seen - and her performance here, though not horrible, is only up to Lifetime's worst rate standards. There was no suggestion of depth to his character, but he probably should not have existed. If so, it would have put the film completely out of balance, since there was a touch of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any character, performer or portrait. <br /> <br /> The director dealt with Liz's initial complaint after her wardrobe kissed her down the hallway was laughable. The initial reaction and advice of her husband were the same (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in his car, provided a more realistic and intelligent action and, damn, he was mentally challenged). The sarcastic, unctuous lawyer (sorry for redundancy) the liar student's father actually performed something probably praiseworthy in his performance: he was at once laughable and utterly annoying, no feat. Her lawyer was another callous nerd, also not unknown to the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and frankly, I really enjoyed that part), the police were a collection of insulting idiots, that you instead rely on Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle the whole application of law and research in their community. I know that real-looking cops are a little short of the sharpness, intelligence, and empathy of the level displayed by most of the characters in the "Law and Order" series, and things like that - but that level's dole seems to be. In the end, I I found a kind of "story within a story" fascination with Josh's invention of being the "victim" of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than its overall performance in the main story. That was an achievement, like going from "F" to "F-minus". <br /> <br /> This whole situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, after a realistic meeting. between teacher and school authorities, with the husband involved. But then that would have prevented the drama invented and left the film blank for an hour on camera. <br /> <br /> But the writer (s) here, proven by their end, they could do even worse. When the situation was finally "resolved" and "corrected," this was achieved in all 45 seconds, with no indication of what measures could have been taken in any "real world" context for the perpetrator and his parents, or if they could have been able to find some kind of way toward redemption. <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation; the second "*" because it has a slight "fascination".
