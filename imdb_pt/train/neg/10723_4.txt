The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he can punish all involved in the desecration of his grave. The transfer of the soul makes the young man grow old at a tremendous rate until he even resembles a mummy. One by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the dig. <br /> <br /> To be as brief as possible, the Pharaoh's Curse is a dull subject. While the film presents some good and original ideas (blood sucking mummy, soul transfer, interesting makeup effects, arm ripping scene, etc.) and some atmospheric moments, direction and rhythm are the very definition of labyrinth . To make matters worse, the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66-minute runtime consist of nothing more than padding. I usually go for those mummy movies that move slowly, but the Pharaoh's Curse tests even my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the lonely plus point - I wish the film could have focused more on its mysterious character), the cast is as bleak as the script. Finally, I do not know whose idea it was to put the mummy-like servant in what appears to be pajamas, but it is a laughable and ridiculous look at a creature that should instill fear in the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite my negative comments about the Pharaoh's Curse, I'm going to give it a 4/10 rating. Not a good rating to be sure, but generous, given all the problems I have with the movie.
