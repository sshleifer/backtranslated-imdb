This movie was bizarre, completely unexplained and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a large empty house. I really love the opening material with Lisa wandering lost in a beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic European location, though perhaps not in a low budget horror film. I definitely get the ending where there are strangely non-sexual sex scenes that have been cut (on my DVD copy anyway). Do not try to understand it, just go ahead and watch out for the strange parts ... that's all. Do not watch this if you really want plotting or characterization or anything to make sense. Very cute, but you can give it up and decide to watch a horror movie like Dead Alive.
