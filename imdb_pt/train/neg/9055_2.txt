Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton, and the diversity of his abilities, I noticed this movie listed, and was surprised not to have heard of it. <br /> <br /> I traveled more than usual during the period filming in 2000, and when it hit theaters more than 2-1 / 2 years later (this passage of time is the first clue, everything was not well with the production). <br /> <br /> Now Patrick Swayze can not act for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to make up the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is someone who would be glad to see, even if it showed that she was seeing paint dry. <br /> <br /> Being curious, I checked the production information of this site. He made a whopping <$ 600 per screen over the opening weekend, and just over $ 400 apiece, after his month of operation in 2002. The gross total was $ 261,000, which I doubt he could cover the cast and crew for a week. location. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty benign, and even the use of Reno's generally interesting location is as monotonous as the rest of the events. <br /> <br /> It's something like several SNL bits together, none individually very big at all, and the overall presentation even worse. Be that as it may, the expenses for this production had to be considerable - even if they all worked for less than usual. fees - so the only thing that made her almost tolerable was the quality of the film and Billy Bob's present (although understandably somewhat laconic here compared to his usual work.) Think of the three proud, totally different characters he portrayed in "Sling Blade," "Bandits," and "Bad Santa," and you know he realized that wa s work was substandard, long before viewers had the opportunity to confirm that. star for him, even here, and one because the production was better than, say, the typical "Lifetime."
