I was drawn to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment, this has turned into more comedy than horror. The acting, the dialogue and the flow of the film were all very poorly done. A lot of it made no sense. For example, there is a party with about 30 people and they are all terrified of a person, although they are in a secret location and have a healthy appearance of young adults, and the guy who threatens them seems to be down. I kept thinking, maybe this was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it seem horrible - emphasis on trying. <br /> <br /> Blood and blood are also badly made. I've seen Halloween costumes seem more believable than that. A guy with a severed head ... looked clean - signs, bones, flesh, blood, and even his head were missing. A strong downward attack with an ax on a corpse should lodge in something ... it looked like the guy was swinging a baton instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Revealing who the main villain should be a turnaround, but contradicting other parts of the story. What was going on in the guy's mind to come out like that? If there was a turnaround, you should at least create more mystery and suspense.
