I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a movie magazine. It was not highly recommended by the reviewer. The plot is different and I'm sure it could have been a good movie if it was in the right hands. Driving and acting were terrible !! I had the feeling of watching a movie that was made a lot of amateurs. Although the film began promisingly, it got worse and worse. I think this is an unoriginal movie with strange characters .. I still think it's worth watching as I have not seen movies subject to gay porn. Do not keep your expectations high so you will be very disappointed. * outside of *****
