CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it is becoming clear that the series has come to a natural end with the best entries such as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING being from the middle to the late 60's. <br /> <br /> In itself even MATRON is by no means just that we've seen all this before with a fine plot (A bunch of spies trying to invade a hospital to steal a supply of birth control pills that they plan to sell to third world countries) surrounded by gags of a nature a little fun, though unsophisticated. I think that's where the problem lies - The jokes are not so much fun with unsophisticated nature that it begins to show its age. Do we need another movie that uses a man dressed as a woman to direct the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon less than twelve hours ago and I have a problem trying to remember a very funny line. This is a serious problem for a comedy
