I saw this movie a few days ago and boldly jumped during the scary parts. I must admit, I found it quite decent ... until I began to THINK about what the characters were saying. Logical problems: 1. Her boyfriend, who looks like a handsome guy, does not make a sound while he's dead. Do not you think he could at least have tried to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When the observation is made that the gym teacher is "in love with Lisa," I almost screamed on the screen. When your best friend's family was killed by a teacher who was in love with her, you do not make comments like that if you have half a heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks his uncle how many outlets they have at home and uncle realizes there may be danger ahead, the smartest thing to do is put Donna, her boyfriend, aunt and uncle in a car and drive away, far, then lure the house with the HRT and the police force so the killer has no way out? <br /> <br /> I could go on. And on and on. And on and on. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters were not strong enough for you to really feel any empathy when they were massacred and there were too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER. <br /> <br /> This movie might be good for teenagers, or young couples just looking for a fun night out. If you do not consider all the bullshit, it's a mediocre movie.
