This is the second time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These remarks come from someone who thinks Kane and Amberson are incredible and dignified movies. But the rest of Welles' career is unfortunately wasted on material unworthy of his talent and too fragile to resist his cinematic embroidery. And when he makes a potboiler like Shanghai, the lack of something substantial to hang his film tricks is kind of sad. I could not tell you what he was exploiting here. It's all as polite as Welle's Irish accent; which requires a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the movie. Several Welles projects became overdeveloped and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (choose a version, any version) is a similarly elaborate project. The material is inconsequential. It simply does not support the weight of all that work. For a reality-based drama trafficking director (as here), he never feels any attraction to tying his bundle of concepts to reality; or for a coherent story. The rent-killing scheme is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Welles, though, for having Hayworth cut her hair, and getting that performance out of it. The camera loves you. She is the most elegant, sophisticated, sensational, and rapturous femme fatale ever released. But her betrayal comes so late in the film that it seems like a desperate decision, made so the film has a genre that fits. The movie can not be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done in L.F.S., the convolutions are all for what? convince you that you have seen something thoughtful? give more Welles to do? make you roll your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story or to tell a story directly. It's no wonder what Shanghai has to say to anyone other than a crippled billionaire, get a quadrupled rent-killing scheme, or a fanboy in love with cinematographic concepts devoid of meaning or substance. <br /> <br /> Unpleasant, absurd, disinterested.
