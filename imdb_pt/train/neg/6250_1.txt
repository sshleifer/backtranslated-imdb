I really enjoyed this show, once. That is, until I realized all the flaws in it. It's so unrealistic. I know it's fiction, but it's not at all believable. Here's why. ** Personal spoilers ahead ... ** Should we believe that a boy like Yugi would be a descendant of a pharaoh from ancient Egypt? Come on! He is the greatest nerd on the face of the earth. And what about Pharaoh's hair (also known as Atem and / or Yami)? The last time I checked, the pharaohs were shaved (except for a small hair on the top of the head) and wore extravagant hats. <br /> <br /> And, should we be convinced that a evil and rich genius, called Seto Kaiba? , can you legally run a successful business while still having time to go to a shoddy little school like 'Domino High'? Puh-leeze! First, he would have to legally be an adult to run a company. And that would not really make him very genius, since he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why would he go to a school like 'Domino High' when his business is clearly successful enough for him to attend a sophisticated snob academy? Also, the side plots with his younger brother are so sentimental and lame. Every time you turn around, that kid is kidnapped by henchmen for the villain. * yawn * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is the poor boy, who lives with a useless father. He says Joey makes all the money to go to school, because his father is an alcoholic, but you never see Joey do anything that looks like work. He does not even mention work. And your sister Serenity is a complete idiot. Why would she choose a snob like Duke (who dressed her brother in a dog costume and humiliated him publicly on television) because of a cool guy like Tristan? Is she really that clueless? Several characters during the show, are possessed by demonic forces, get their souls stolen by demonic forces and are victims of mental illness. (Oh, this is safe for kids, NOT). Tea is the typical kind of girl next door whose sole purpose is to be Yugi / Yami's girlfriend. And while she has some cool points for her, she just does not have enough time to shine as the main character. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply awful. All the characters look sick and anorexic. The prospects are terrible (especially when they do close-ups from someone's hand) and the colors look good, but not stellar. <br /> <br /> But the worst hole in the series was the fact that Yami says that his Millennium Puzzle can send souls back to their bodies. If so, how come he did not save Yugi's grandfather first, when Pegasus stole his soul and saved himself the trouble of retrieving it? <br /> <br /> Everything that really is is a commercial for you. The only positive side is LittleKuriboh's "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Short Series". <br /> <br /> Please. Do something more valuable. Kind, watch the short version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
