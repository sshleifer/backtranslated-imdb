This movie had what sounded like a good premise: 9 people facing their fears to earn a million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are very long and meaningless as the dance scene. Some scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts. The acting is bad, but some of the lines are fun in their horror. What's really strange is that at the end of the film it turns into a 5-minute western, and in the end, the twists, of which there were several, do not make sense with the rest of the film. It seemed that the director just added things because he thought it would be cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the film up to that point. It just did not make much sense. The only scary thing was the old men dancing in the hallway, but that does not even come close to making up for the rest of this mess.
