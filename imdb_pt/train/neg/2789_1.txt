Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's more like a home video with minimal lighting and horrible acting. Not only that, the plot and script was unfortunate. I do not know why this movie was made. I've seen a lot of movies in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This made my blood boil. The situations were insane at best. If I made a film like this, it would have been short. Really because those backwood "idjits" would not be in the picture. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover in D.V.D. I am an avid observer of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually impossible to show. I do not mind movies being filmed in D.V. but if you do that, make the movie enjoyable, not a tired retread of sans Wrong Turn. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this disk waste. If you come across a gift at the rental store go through. <br /> <br /> Movies That Make Your Truly Angry Get An Automatic 1.
