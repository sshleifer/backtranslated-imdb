Pathetic ... worse than a badly made movie for TV. I can not believe Spacey and Freeman were in that movie. For some reason, Morgan Freeman's character is constantly talking and saying "pussy" when referring to the girlfriend of NSync. Morgan Freeman calling women "pussy" is just weird ... What the hell did the people behind this movie think? Many holes to imagine, combined with horrible acting, confusing camera angles, an inefficient script and cheap background music have made this movie absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> I rented this failure with low expectations ... but. .. well ... this really sucked.
