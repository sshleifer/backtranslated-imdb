There are some things I can never understand. Just like this movie. What if I created a really cheap and lousy Dino and crocodile polygon model in Maya and then cut and paste it into an amateur video making people scream and be eaten for the same thing? How can one even believe that a totally false CGI dinocroc that seems completely out of place would influence the events of this movie? I know its low budget, B-grade and all but producers could do better than make a piece of crap that no one has ever seen or sit through. It just does not make sense. Are people really so stupid that they would sit with it? Apparently yes. Why laugh? No, this thing is not even worth laughing at.
