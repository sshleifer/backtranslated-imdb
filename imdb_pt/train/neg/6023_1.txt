It reminds me of when I was a born-again believer that I was going to be a minister. I never really thought I would be a minister or even graduate high school because I was pretty sure I would be snatched up to Heaven before that happened. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a bunch of crap. I am now an atheist, and this proves that the "once saved ever saved" doctorate that Christians tell us is no more real than the elves. If it were true, then why did I leave after many years being a born-again devotee devotee? Yes, I really was saved. I prayed that sinners could pray with all my heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians read their Bible, they will find that their god thinks rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities are right according to him. They may be surprised to know that this is not where the word "rapture" is mentioned.
