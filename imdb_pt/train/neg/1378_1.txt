It's as if a bad 80's TV show loosened itself up and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh my god it was bad. The plots of each character had little relevance. The plot itself was nothing to talk about. Something about a stalker, I think. In the end, does he kill himself? It's not very clear, but somehow there is a volleyball game involved. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and they ended up wanting to move on to the scenes with him in it, which were barely attended to. Thank God I did not spend money on it, but I want that hour of my life back.
