Suggesting nothing less than a film version of the 1970s TV show "Love, American Style," adorned with flashes of nudity, "Superchick" (1973) is a carefree fluff that somehow still manages to entertain. And the main character here, Tara B. True, really is some kind of superchick. A flight attendant (non-flight attendant) who is so beautiful that even the autopilot of her plane made a pass for her (!), And with a handsome boyfriend in every port, this girl really puts the "layman "in" layover ". What with her geriatric surgeon boyfriend in New York, her gangster playboy in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star guy in Los Angeles, Tara certainly keep busy. And when she is not draining these guys from all her virile energies, as the viewer learns, she can take a karate class, clap for miles, fend off blashers and rapists, attend parties, and stop a kidnapping attempt at your plane. . Like I said, fun, and certainly good for one night when you're feeling a bit brain dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologer Joyce Jillson brings some empty charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks beautiful enough to please. Disappointingly, 1970s popular songs Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (also known as Candy Samples) are squandered here in small roles but still manage to do what they do best - show off your chesticles! Although the picture is never funny and does not have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it can be consistently fun, and I suppose it is something. Strange that the final credits should draw attention to Jillson's double body, however; Do not think I've seen this before!
