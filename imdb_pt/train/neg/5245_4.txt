I am a current A.S.L. Student and was forced to watch this movie in the classroom, and what I got was the brazen bias involved in the movie. The film is obviously tilted towards P.O.V. of "common deaf perception," there is no middle ground. In addition, the film did not mention or take into account other situations that are also under discussion in this topic. I.E. Deaf people who were born hearing and then deaf. Is it right or wrong in this case? The film is biased and practically everything in the opinion of the Deaf with a capital "D". Not that this is bad, but to be a true documentary, you must be a bit unbiased.
