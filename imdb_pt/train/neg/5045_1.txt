Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie: very long faces only shots where you most often have the feeling that the bottom half of the movie is missing (the screen is cut off) because there seems to be important actions going on but you do not you can see them. Anyway, there is already a lot of confusion in the film, so these viewing angles get worse and do not contribute to artistic visuals. <br /> <br /> I like artistically made films and unconventional camera work. I can deal with deep and slow movies. But this is a very difficult attempt to be ingenious and fails in my opinion painfully. <br /> <br /> Nothing to attach to any of the characters because they are not well made. To work with the characters, it takes more than just a few minutes, at least with this set of script + director + actors. <br /> <br /> I wonder if any of the not-so-good interpretations are due to the script. and director or due to the actors. <br /> <br /> I will stay away from films written and directed by Le You for sure in the future. <br /> <br /> What an annoying movie for someone who would be interested in that part of the story and someone who spent time in Shanghai.
