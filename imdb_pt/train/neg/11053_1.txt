This is one of those "so bad that are good" movies that you always listen to but never see! Unlike the Troma movies that are deliberately bad and extravagant (and I'm not having fun) this is 100% pure. <br /> <br /> However, with features such as a supposedly super-lethal killer robot that stands as one of the Solid Gold Dancers on an acid trip and a first magical companion who calls down the lightning bolt and turns in the Good Witch of the East the fact that if you take it seriously pushes it away on the edge of evil that makes a complete circle fun. <br /> <br /> Observable enough because of this.
