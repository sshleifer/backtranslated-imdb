Necessarily ridiculous film version of the classic literary "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with the pastor's daughter, Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival to Bennett's affection. When Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects him. He must kill the whale and win back Bennett ... <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that may have impressed the 1930 audience; particularly the scenes involving Barrymore losing his leg. The film did not age well, however; there are much better films of the time, both the 1920s and 1930s talkies. The two attractions, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett, are not at their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
