Who is Bettie Page? I certainly did not find out while watching this movie. From what I have gathered from other sources, Mrs. Page was highly requested in the post WWII period as the queen of "naughty" photos and that is exactly what the film portrays. I've never met Bettie, the woman, however. His childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid domestic life that is only hinted at. The film goes over his personal life and goes straight to the purpose of the film, the "naughty" photos. Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames, but there are picture after picture of Bettie in her bras, Bettie in her belt and stockings, Bettie in captivity ... etc. The film slides from black and white to color every time Ms. Page visits Miami Beach. So, back to your shades of gray life in New York we will. Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most idiotic young people you could meet. When Bettie confides to a friend that she misses being the high school speaker getting an A- instead of an A, it can only be assumed that there were only two students in her Senior class. The most interesting part of this film is how Ms. Page's "impertinent" photos look in 2007. It's really sad that seeing a woman tied up like a pig in a spit has neither success in My Space or You Tube. . I'm not sure if this movie was poorly written or if some crazed editor cut the thing to pieces. I would only recommend this as a source for people who study the history of strange clothes.
