What I hate about this program is how bad the leads are written. These women have no self-respect or dignity. The whole plot is them playing on faces. The talent of Amanda Bynes is completely wasted. She was brilliant at "All That" and her own show. Why would they write her and Jenny Garth as insipid, wind-headed, desperate, hunting men, aspiring "old maid" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> His plots and dialogues remind me of "The Simpsons," says Homer. whenever his cartoon character Poochie is not on the screen, "Everyone should ask, where's Poochie?" All the talk revolves around complaining about some guy, and then whining for some guy. Sometimes they change and the guy complains. So they come back together or end at the end. Both women are rich, idiots or sex addicts. The only word I can think of is "suck."
