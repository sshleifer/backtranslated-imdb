I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be cool to ruin one of the best TV shows. Do we really need a new big screen? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, took all the music and made a drama. You think they would like that! This movie does not have the same feel as the original had. Of course the original was a bit cheesy at times, but Bo and Luke were always cool, they got in trouble because they were always ready to get into trouble, and their main purpose was to help people passing through town. None of this mattered to the people who made this movie, they could never have seen the original show until the end. My big question is, what will they ruin next?
