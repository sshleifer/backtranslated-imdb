I can not believe that this leaning and jingoistic material is being passed on to the Americans as artistic material. Early on, from lines like "we want to make sure they're playing for the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting, Love Divided shows its true face. The crude manner in which Irish Catholics are shown to be hegemonic, Protestants as peaceful and oppressed, is as poor a representation of history as the first United States West, portraying the struggle between American cowboys and Indians. The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and defamation of Irish Catholics in history; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still find that they can gain moral influence by making a film so easily recognized for their obvious intent, far from trying to art. This movie has nothing to do with a legitimate cinema or library.
