I just recently discovered that Madeleine L'Engle's novel was turned into a TV movie by Disney and commissioned the DVD. The book was one of my favorites when I was a kid and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> Although some young actors do not resemble the characters described in the novel, the Murry family is well-laid out, with a nice Meg (if it's very pretty) in the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming annoying. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is quite promising, doing a good job in establishing relationships between the main characters and in defining the scene. Unfortunately, as soon as the non-human characters appear, the adaptation begins to unfold, and once the children leave the land, the whole thing falls apart. Alfre Woodward is very young and very regal as the eccentric mrs. Whatsit (think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright) and Kate Nelligan's face is so masked and unimpressive, she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in the last few years. For some reason, they do Mrs. Who looks like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have looked like a benign Wicked Witch from the West. <br /> <br /> In the end, what most disappoints are the terrible special effects and art direction. I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier. The incarnation of the centaur of Mme. Whatsits is a disaster, just like the Chewbacca suit for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a sleek, velvety creature instead of the awkward Big Foot as shown here. I could go on and on, almost every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there was not a budget big enough to do that justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and common sense. <br /> <br /> That would have really needed the sense of admiration Spielberg brought to his early films. It's a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series, no one has thought of adapting The Wrinkle in Time and its sequels to the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves.
