The highlight of this film for me was undoubtedly Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he was definitely pitted against the type and showed that he can handle a non-traditional role (for him). Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire, and twist. Sullivan was definitely not a cool guy. It is true that in the context of this film he became a bit noble - his goal was to avenge the murders of his wife and younger son. Even so, he was already a gangster and murderer before these murders. So Hanks took on a role that I would not have expected, and he did well. <br /> <br /> Hanks's good performance, after all, I certainly could not call this a nice movie. After an opening I would describe as puzzling (it was not entirely clear to me for some time when it happened), it turns into a grim movie about the complicated relationships that Sullivan developed as a gangster - largely raised by Rooney. (Paul Newman), who is a kind of mafia boss, trying to raise his own kids and keep them "clean", so to speak; isolated from your business. After the elder son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, picks up the wrong son (and the mother) and leaves Sullivan and his eldest son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a strange kind of father / son bonding movie. <br /> <br /> Although I end up on a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the general context of the story) it's actually very dark everywhere, that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being filmed in the dark and torrential rains. I have to confess that while I enjoyed Hanks' performance, the film as a whole simply did not appeal to me.
