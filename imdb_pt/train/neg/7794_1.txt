This movie is horrible. No quality for this movie. You'd think the blood would be good, but it's bad. The effects are worse and the acting, if you can call acting, is the worst I've ever seen. This film was obviously filmed on a camcorder and runs on a budget around $ 500 probably. If you want to watch a good Zombie movie than watch Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead. If you want to watch a good cheap shoot in Zombie movie video like this, but much better watch than Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is unwatchable and tasteless. You have been warned. I have nothing more to say about this stupid movie.
