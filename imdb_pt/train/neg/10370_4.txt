I regret every second of the time I lost while watching this movie, really. Unfortunately, I've always found it difficult to turn off a movie when I started watching it. Especially when it's a classic or what people call classic. I think this is one of those movies that every movie lover should have seen at least once, so that's why I watched it. Do not get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall, both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion. No really good plot, neither a spy movie nor a romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mix of both genders. The only thing that caused tension was that it was uncertain whether "Bogey" and Bacall would be together at the end or separated from each other. I think "to have and have not" is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films during the 1940s.
