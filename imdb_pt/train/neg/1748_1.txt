Do not waste your time with this movie. This is a total thrash in terms of acting, direction, sound editing, soundtrack ... There was a performance waste of some of the best actors. The film does not do justice to Paresh Rawal, who is perhaps one of Bollywood's most talented actors. Akshay Kumar, who is also an emerging star, did a very poor job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that what you call acting? I mean, he should thank God for having a pretty face, otherwise he'd be winning Razzie awards in India if there were any awards of that kind in Bollywood. Asrani a great talent, but exaggerates his part as before. <br /> <br /> The script that was not to mention a Boeing Boeing robbery of 1965 was pretty badly framed. First of all, people in Bollywood simply can not do something original. Also, they do not even copy well. The jokes of the film were so exaggerated that it was painful to sit on them. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he simply is not fit to make a decent Hindi movie. The sound editing is incredibly bad. I can continue and on this subject, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be shameful to make such a movie. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie. What is wrong with you? This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood makes more movies than Hollywood every year, however, most of the films are unreleased overseas, because of movies like this. I am an Indian and am totally shameful of Bollywood for producing this stretch. Films like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were simply fantastic. They are world class films that are timeless ... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst in this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 out of 10.
