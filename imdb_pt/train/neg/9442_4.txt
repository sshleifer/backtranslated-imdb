I tried to like this slasher, as I try to enjoy all the horror movies. I mean meaningless murder mixed with a bit of nudity and some suspense, how can you go wrong? But Unhinged I think is an example of this formula going wrong. The main issue is the horrible performance of the three top girls who landed in the house. It was as if they were under sedation, and that kept me from being interested in their situation. The film is aimed at suspense and shiver, but the direction of the numbers consumes this and leaves the film very annoying. It's a shame, because if the movie was better executed, it would have been ace. The story and the characters are pretty scary and there are some dark and bizarre moments of interaction between the mother, the girls and the daughter in the old house. There is good nudity and occasional bloodshed, but not enough to give the film the necessary kick. The ending is very distorted and fearsome, and gives a great boost to the film, but unfortunately, it's too late. So in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love obscure horror movies. There is a reasonable amount of potential, but the film offers very little to be worth.
