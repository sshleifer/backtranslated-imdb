MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS SANTO MAKES ME DISABLE THIS MOVIE! what drugs are you on? This could very well be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was on a bad acid trip all the time, I need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster. From beginning to end, strings of brilliance is a profane masterpiece of satanic cinema. When I thought of watching this movie with my best Jewish friend and his family, we thought "oh hey, this can be funny!" It will probably be bad, but still a little funny "as we were wrong, we were not prepared for how horrible movie could to be. All my friends lined up for lobotomy as soon as the film was over, and during the film one of my friends tried to hang himself with his belt while another tried to cut his wrists with a wooden spoon. I wish I had seen The Ring's video, so the pain and suffering would be over in just seven days. For everyone who wants to see this movie, YOU ARE NOT READY! you might think it's some kind of "tough guy" renting this, but this movie will break you, push you to the floor and urinate on you.
