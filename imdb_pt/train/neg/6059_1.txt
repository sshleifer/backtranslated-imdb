I have to say as being a fan of the man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best movies. <br /> <br /> So you have this POS. I can not logically think that he put any effort into it, as it did with Cigarette Burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to look at it from the point of view that it did not look like a movie. It seemed that someone else was driving him for one thing. I do not believe Carpenter made any effort at that. <br /> <br /> I was listening to the H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it was amazing, especially for the times. <BR> He was wearing a style that no one else had and it worked so well for his movies.
