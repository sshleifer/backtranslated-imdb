This is really the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever. Period. Actually, I paid 3.50 pounds to watch that steaming shit from a movie. Incredibly tedious, misinterpreted, horrendous, often incoherent script and many scenes that do not seem to have any relevance to the film in general (such as when Heath Ledger's partner is stuck to a wall by a ghost ... what was the point in that scene? answers in a postcard, please ...) <br /> <br /> I should have a medal for getting this movie all through its runtime. I'd rather have a strong kick in the crotch than sit in this movie again. <br /> <br /> This must be cast in the IMDb bottom 100. I hope my vote of 1/10 helps you on your way.
