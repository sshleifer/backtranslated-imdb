And forget that. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna act, rent "Body of Evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in it. <br /> <br /> In this movie, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to silence the dialog box. . You will not miss a thing. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop, and Madonna is so horrible, it becomes fun. Why they had to snatch the original movie in this mess, I'll never know; I think they thought it was "bankable". Madonna, as an actress, certainly is NOT. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original movie from 1979, you will like it, and the actors in it can actually act. 1/10
