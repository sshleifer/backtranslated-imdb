The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how it is possible that a culture that can produce an intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians can not produce a single film that surpasses the despicable level of garbage that this film represents so well. That's Bollywood at its best / worst, I honestly can not tell the difference. Nauseatingly sweet, kitschy clich√©s at all levels, story-line, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. To be honest, you must be a retard to have fun. I watched to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to move away, because I could not take it anymore. The only redeeming quality of the film is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
