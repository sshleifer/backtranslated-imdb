You have to love those low budget budget films. This comes complete with bad effects, props and bad acting (very bad). Also, every time I see Mercedes McNab (the sister) I'm thinking 'Watch out! She's a vampire! "- for those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a movie, the little that was spent of course. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I feel more pen of the film writer or producer who has not recovered any money. <br /> <br /> I would say it's good for kids, it's simple, but I do not know if I'd like to subject a child to it ... <br /> <br /> umm ... 1/10 because that's the smallest that goes.
