This movie really, I mean REALLY, sucks. Their plot holes are so large, and a 30-foot dragon can pass through them. Not to mention the dragon itself, which is inevitably the worst computer-generated image to be placed in the actual movie. I mean, when you see something like that, you must be thinking, "Wow, someone really made this movie. Whoever they are, I'm sure they no longer work in the movie business. <br /> <br /> When I hired this movie, it was not on DVD, so I (reluctantly) took video. The first thing to appear, was a trailer of The Lord of the Rings, for the Two Towers. This was a very smart move, putting this trailer in the video. Justify me (reluctantly) giving the film 1 star, otherwise I would have given zero stars. Maybe the producers, despite the main attraction of Dean Cain (I think that's how you write) would attract the crowds (uh, for the video store). <br /> <br /> Then they used the split-screen technique (as in the Hulk) to (I assume) to compensate for the atrocity that this piece of film is. On the cover of the box, we see a photo of our hero and the dragon. Does the dragon look exactly like the one in the Dragon's Heart, or is it just me? Anyway, the dragon in the movie looks like a rejection of Gremlins 2, and has the CGI of a Nintendo video game villain of the early '90s (maybe worse). Also, do not drag dragons while chasing their victims - it's the same monotonous movement - right leg, left leg, right leg, left leg, gift, gift, DOM, DOM F # $ king DOOOOOM! This just pisses me off. Perhaps the filmmakers thought this was exciting and would have the same effect as Jaws. Why not then have a photo of Dragon POV? Anyway, this was just funny, much like watching a Weebl toon. Dean Cain gives many intrigued looks during the film (maybe he has come to terms with the fact that this movie could end his career). Do not expect Superman here. The first time I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was an add to a PS2 game. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's so bad, my 5 year old brother can get better when he's trying to convince why he was playing in my room while I was not there. Oh, and I mentioned that I F @ # KING hate the people who made this movie CRAP ATTRONICALLY INCREDELY STUPID? !!!
