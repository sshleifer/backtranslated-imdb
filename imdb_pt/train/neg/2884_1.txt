While working at a video store, I thought it was my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen, and to let my friends and co-workers know about it. Amidst a particularly heated debate on the worst film, my friend challenged me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the entire movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he would watch. I lost. I think I even made better videos than that in high school, and those were not great deeds of a young genius. This film was not only lacking in what seemed to be the production value (it looks like it was filmed on a bad camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wood, hollow and pathetic, do not scratch the surface) as well just generally bad movie feeling. I remember a scene in which I listened to the glass, I suddenly remembered some bad pieces from the college (I know I often refer to high school here, but this movie seemed very juvenile), both in terms of the scenario, which seemed a lot false, but also as if people were reading the lines of the script, not entirely certain of what was really going on. My review does not do justice to this movie, because I can not describe how horrible the time I spent watching it. It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.
