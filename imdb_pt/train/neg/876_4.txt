Until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this is possibly Jackie Chan's worst movie (excluding his work prior to 1978, which I'm not familiar with). The final sequence of the fight has changed everything: it's long and good and intense - in fact, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get to that, you have to sit down with a lot of "comedy" that can amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! Someone threw a tomato into that guy's face) and endless "soccer" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a touch" - watch to find out what it refers to). "Dragon Lord" is worth being rented just for the final fight, but the rest of the film is only for collectors Jackie, and even then only for those who have seen at least 15 of his other films. (**)
