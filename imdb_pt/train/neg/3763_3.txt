A group of forest rangers and scientists enter the forest to find fossils. They stumble into a Bigfoot graveyard eventually (the ones they did not notice in the dark), CGI Bigfoot scenes are horrible, but better than the endless scenes. of speaking that they rarely score. I used to think that there could only be a good Bigfoot movie to be made. But now, after so many sad and sad stories about the legend, I'm having serious doubts. To shed salt in the wound watching this movie, the good-looking girl does not get naked once. And while this might be better than "Boggy Creek 2" (it's not easy), it's still sad that the best non-documentary film about Bigfoot remains "Harry and the Henriksons" <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
