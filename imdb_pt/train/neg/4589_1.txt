Remember the exposed chain smoking plumber at 60 Minutes a few years ago? This is her. Many people have reviewed this film without verifying the good faith of the filmmakers. Producers have been using fake "word of mouth" promotions very successfully without revealing the financial and philosophical foundations for this marketing scam. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, the new age and the nonsense of the day, this movie is for you. If you want a discussion about quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha is not a nutcase, so you will give him a lot of money. If you can tiptoe through Ramtha's website without howling in disbelief, then you might think that the money you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
