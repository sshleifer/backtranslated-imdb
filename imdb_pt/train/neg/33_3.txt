This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever generated. I was a kid when it came out and I still thought it was deuce, even if I liked the original drawing. <br /> <br /> There's a scene I remember when the Mafia man explains to his followers what rhetorical questions lie. It's atrocious. Many fans hate the series for including a female tortoise, but that does not bother me. So much that I did not even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all, it is miserably forgettable. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was the theme song. Pleasure guilty, they call it ... Nananana ninja ...
