First of all there is Gujarati Theater, then there is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fan following. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of the Gujarati Theater while doing a Bollywood production. He first made Aankhen (adapted from a piece of Gujarati) - which had a unique plot, but could not be considered a Hindi movie. Now he has adapted another Gujarati game and named it Waqt - a race against time. In short, emotions are strange. The development of the plot is not for Hindi movies. For example, the drama between father and son is best left for the Gujarati Theater - do not bring it to a movie in Hindi. Even the comedy track is best left for the Gujarati stage. All the performances are average - nothing to shout about - barring Shefali Chhaya Shah, which is fantastic.
