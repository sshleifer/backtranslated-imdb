This movie is just terrible. Poor John Savage had to step down to be in another movie. He stars as a rare type of vampire who is helping a lady who looks like a washed-out street-slut who is a dancer at a local strip club. She accidentally sips a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they drift across the floor of the locker room. Savage is then named by a small leader of this rare breed of vampires that looks like a cross between 1980s punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie gets all crazy with Savage pounding and dancing with a dwarf with a spider tattooed on his head, also one of the rare. He quotes Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This only receives rediculas. And then the rougher special effects they could find is Corri vomiting his organs and pulling them out of his mouth. And you can say that all this is false. Your child does not know what to do with his mother's new identity and becomes more a plague than an object of serenity. I like a good vampire movie, believe me, but I just hated this one. Even the photograph stinks in and out blurred with the camera shifting from side to side and trying to make it look like vampires move fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera is all lit up in Savage's scene chasing Corri's son around until he blinds himself. Skip this one !!
