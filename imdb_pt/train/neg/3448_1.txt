I checked this movie when it still had 6 votes and it said 7.2 or something, but seriously, this is a horrible movie. Let's split it up. The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a handheld digital camera owned by a college freshman. The next thing you'll notice is that the actors are all friends of the freshman (he probably met them at the pub the night before.) Third on the list, you'll notice that the music edition is horrible, and they try to crank a lot of Songs for this movie, 30 seconds intervals ... also the whole digital edition is made at home freshman PC ... probably using Windows Movie Maker. This movie was horrible ... pretentious, had an undeniably bad script, and acting that I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I sentence the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity.
