I bought this adaptation because I really enjoyed Anne BrontÃ«'s novel when I read it some time ago and I usually particularly like BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be that bad: the whole series made me laugh a lot more than it moved me as the romance had. <br /> <br /> First of all, music (and songs) seems totally out of place in a period drama (it seems it was written for a contemporary horror film) and, as another commentator, I was particularly annoyed at the way the cameras revolved around the actors. I've seen some scenes filmed that way in "North and South" and it all looked good there, but in The Tenant, it's definitely exaggerated and simply annoying. The camera moves can not make the wood performance lively. <br /> <br /> Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at the beginning and the script was unclear. None of the characters was properly introduced at first. The little boy gave a very good performance, he is very cute and the best feature of the film. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS Helen Graham's characterization by Tara Fitzgerald made her seem cold and harsh, leaving no emotion to pass. She does not seem to be able to cry in a realistic way. I just could not believe that Markham might have fallen in love with her and I'm not mentioning the horrible hair she got. I could not help but feel some sympathy for her husband! Getting married to such a virago ... In addition, he was the only main actor who seemed right to me. Toby Stephens I found it ok, Helen Graham's brother is not very good. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such dark affairs as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, what is just suggested and left to the reader's imagination in the book is treated with complacency in the adaptation of the TV: making both thick and comical scenes (such as when Huntingdon's eye begins to bleed) and others sexually too much for a drama period! I mean, did not we get enough of these bed scenes in contemporary dramas?
