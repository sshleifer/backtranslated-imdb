This movie was heralded as a comedy and a mystery. He fails greatly in both. The only mystery here is why someone would make such a poorly constructed film. The only comedy is the laughter I had when I saw how loud the readers here rated it. Could there be two movies with the same name? The movie I saw starred a girl with beautiful blue eyes and a plot that was not there. <br /> <br />
