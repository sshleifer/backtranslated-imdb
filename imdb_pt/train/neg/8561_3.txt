The Cowboys can get you a little sore in the saddle. It's definitely not one of Johns best movies. Do not get me wrong, with any John Wayne move there are always some good points. And this one is fair. But above all, the image moves slowly and simply does not match the aspirations it might have been. Bruce Dern again does an excellent job as the villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the film. The children in the movie were medium-sized, but could have been chosen better. This would be a good movie for cinemagoers aged eight to fifteen. <br /> <br /> This would be a nice family change to watch with your kids. Just stay tuned, there are some scenes that you may want to take a look at before letting the youngsters see it. But most of the kids I know who saw the movie like that. Maybe it's because they can see kids their own age doing all the adult work.
