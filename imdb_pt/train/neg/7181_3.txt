Now do not get me wrong, I like Christmas movies. I love his wonderful life and I really like the versions of a Christmas song with George C. Scott and Yes Alistair. but this particular movie is horrible. I think the song I love the life that the ghost of the Christmas gift sings is especially painful. albert finney sings reasonably well in annie. I do not know what's wrong with it in this movie, but it looks like someone is trying to sing through a lot of dead gerbils. the only thing that saved this movie for us was to turn off the sound and watch the dance numbers accompanied by the south park's Christmas cd.
