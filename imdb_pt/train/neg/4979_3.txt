Why, oh, why can not anyone make a decent movie out of a legendary tale? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf" with which I was disappointed in a year. But I have to say, the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel" starring Gerald Butler) was far superior to that. That was just a little disappointing. This one is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What bothered me the most? Were the useless elements of the plot they added for no particular reason (human sacrifices? Meaningless love interest?), Or bad CGI, or inconsistency of characters or uninspired acting? Even worse was the way they made the beautiful Marina Sirtis look so awful !!! And do not even talk about this ridiculous beast? <br /> <br /> And why do they continually remind us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men, and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such force throughout the film. He was thrown around by both monsters he fought, relying on his partners to save his bacon. Even when he hit the arrogant prince, he did not bring him down. He was very dependent on guns. Beo-wimp is more like that. This certainly was not the mighty Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to end on a positive note, but I can not think of anything unexpectedly. All I can say is that if you've read "Beowulf," you'll be infinitely disappointed by this somber, inaccurate excuse for an adaptation!
