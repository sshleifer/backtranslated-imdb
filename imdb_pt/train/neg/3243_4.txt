By far the most important requirement for any movie that follows the reliable cheaters is that they should at least occasionally be able to attack us as well as their stupid brands, cops, mobs and (ideally) each other. . But this movie NEVER does that. Each blow can be seen a mile away (especially the biggen!) Nor are they very interesting, intricate or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this with vulgar dialogues and complex psychological relations. If so, it failed. The lines are fine, but they are delivered in a stylized, artificial, and artificial way that I thought maybe some smart spot was being done about all of us acting all the time ... but it was not. As for the psychological complexity, the main character is a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced letters about her father, thinking she's a prostitute, but she overcomes it. I really enjoyed the street scenes. It looked like a painting by Edward Hopper.
