There are some good things about the movie. The music and the cinematography are great. Alex Wilson is hot and gives great performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. The production was very lucky to have released them because they really give value to the production of the film. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many of the movie boys who do not speak are cute too. Why is not the actress playing Amy listed on the credits? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedy performance like Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is probably the star, James Townsend. He can not act. He's also very skinny, not cool to look at. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle tone. No wonder he has to make his own film and get into it. No one else would ever put you into anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not credible as someone who would have a girlfriend because he is so gay. They should have chosen someone else as leader if they wanted the best for the movie. So again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft-core pornography, it's definitely not a real performance because he would have taken some acting lessons. Plus, anyone who does porn is on Hollywood's blacklist. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the release of a tan-skinned Latina as the mother of Devon. Sonja Fisher does not look like an actress. In short, this movie is soft-core porn and is not better than something you would see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is embarrassed by it and does not want to be associated with it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a throwaway name. Also, I met him in West Hollywood once recently and when I mentioned this movie, he just turned around and walked away. I understand. If I had worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and would not want to be associated with it either.
