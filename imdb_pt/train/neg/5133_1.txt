I had no real expectations of getting into this movie and I'm happy. Even if I expected it to be bad, I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? First, I think 15% of the film consisted of images of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle field. Got it. There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrows" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, nothing is explained about the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences. Are there many times when I was dropped off at WTF? <br /> <br /> Third, the film takes itself seriously. I'm in favor of a B movie with buckets of blood, women screaming and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But these films often know they are B movies and even feature it, such as Dead Snow (hilarious Scandanavian zombie movie) or Evil Dead 2. But this movie seems oblivious to their bad mood. <br /> <br /> Finally, it should have been more blood and / or nudity. Yeah, I said that. If you're going to have a horror movie, do it with the murder. And if you're going to have a hot girl and a semi-hard girl, one of them needs to show a minimum of foolishness. <br /> <br /> So, as the abstract says, skip "Scarecrows" and just poke in the eyes. You will thank me.
