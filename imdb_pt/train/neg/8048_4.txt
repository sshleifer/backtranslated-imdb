Suppose you have been on a desert island for the last ten years. I did not hear of Scream and left when part 1 of Halloween entered the cinema. So this movie would have been an explosion and a whole new view on the horror scene. <br /> <br /> Currently, a rating of 2.7 is in IMDb and does not deserve such a low appreciation. Cutting it all the way, like "I know what you did," and one who, when it comes to the end, convinced me of who-and-why. <br /> <br /> No big surprise, just a good movie to watch with a coke, popcorn and no desire to get a difficult, deep characters storyline. If video rentals are out of key titles, you can accept them without risk, but do not expect a masterpiece. I've seen much worse.
