This movie is horrible. The acting is a wastebasket. No crying, no action, hopeless songs. Although the scenario is great. I always wanted to go to Greece. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as for Saif, you would expect a great performance, but even he disappointed people. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar, recognized as Bollywood's pimp and the voice of Singhs. He was sensational in this movie. For this performance only, Filmfare must present another award. The personal hygiene premium for the worst performance. By the way, the trophy should be a sanitary seat. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor. She is not at all comparable to her sister Karisma. In acting, in appearance or in body. She now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her. She enters this movie wearing bikinis and short tops and shorts. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan is letting his future wife dress like that. But she must have impressed some people by dressing like that. And if you ask how, then consider that every man is having an erection watching this movie. They are dreaming of having Kareena Kapoor on the bed naked with a condom. Including me. Personally I think she dressed like a prostitute, but I really liked that. <br /> <br /> I am forced to give a 1/10, but I would really give a 0/10 to this movie. An unreachable film.
