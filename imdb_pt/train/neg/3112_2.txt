Let me start by saying that I will try not to put too many spoilers on it. Usually I like Robin Williams movies, however this gem was not one of them. It was billed as a thriller. The listener of the night was nothing. To be frank, there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, 2 left, for good reason. The film was in my opinion poorly written and directed. The performance was good, but again there was nothing to work on. The movie is about a storyteller who reads a good book about a dying boy. However * enter scary here * no one can check the existence of children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try to find the author, however all he gets is a headache and apology from the boy caretaker. That's not it, that's all. You wait about an hour and a half and the movie ends. He had as many emotions and chills as a visit to the dentist. The homosexual tones, or overtones, had really nothing to do with the story, and the film had a bit of a rant, but seemed to be played there for absolutely no reason and made little sense. In conclusion I really can not write a decent review on this movie because there was nothing, it was just as captivating as watching the paint dry. I gave a 2 because the performance for what was worth everything was well and was not directed by Uwe Boll.
