Now, I called it just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - just as you watch a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that it's a parody, but that does not must stop me by criticizing the horrible direction, action, and dialogue. Seriously, this was rated as one of the poorest movies I've ever seen - it looked like another episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a bad movie like that ... <br /> <br /> Ok - some criticism (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him, so we assume that it is a heart attack), the army then launches bombs, rockets, bullets against the monster - However, the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive (2) the army attack about 100 yards away, and we see a flamethrower being used - these things have a range of no more than 30 meters! (3) When the monster tries to take the teacher, the soldiers run into the classroom and shoot at the ceiling; the monster drops the kid, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? let's go! (4) The monster looks like something out of Power Rangers! (5) there is a scene in which the five "good guys" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the kid) look shocked and we have reactions (hand-to-mouth) one after another. - so natural! (6) the general simply flees, hour after hour (7) the general refuses to try electricity and does not listen (8) the performance is horrible (9) did I mention the monster of the rubber suit ???? (10) that horrible song, without stopping!
