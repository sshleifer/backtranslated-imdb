Yet another movie "son that does not grow up," and only the other recent as inputs. Heder in another bad wig, channeling Napoleon to, what, the third time? Anna Faris is as forgettable as ever; Jeff Daniels telephoned this from another state, at least; and Diane Keaton ... how do you become a typecast so late in a career? Do not mind. Nothing is said here that has not been covered many times. I'll say it; is about a hundred times better than "Failed to start". There are very few fun parts in the movie, unless you think Eli Wallach's witticism is funny. There is! He's old and he dropped the bomb! Tee, hee, hee. Unfortunate!
