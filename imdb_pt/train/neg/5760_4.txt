Well ... I was going to wait until it came on video to see it, and I wish I had it, actually I got the scary 2 movie on the cable the other day, and it made me yearn for more of the same, which I got was AIRPLANE in CRACK ... I mean, if you like airplane or any other vehicles Leslie nielsen, then you'll probably be in heaven, but if your used to the usual WAYANS COMEDY, then you'll be disappointed, there were much more Eye candy in a gift that will keep young teenage hormones happy, which is probably because it was a blockbuster in the first week that came out. I liked scary movie 2 ten times more than this fodder, and part one 5 times more. Strange that the best of the 3 is part 2, but again, I always liked Halloween 2 better then the original too ... maybe it's just me. The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the aliens say goodbye. But that was not worth the $ 11 I spent to get a matinee of it with my fianc√©. Save money and get Part 2 back on the cable until this is released on the videotape, and then rent, do not buy.
