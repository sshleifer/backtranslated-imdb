This was the worst movie I've ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) could not act at all! she had no emotion, it was all blah blah blah, as if she were reading a boring textbook. The smart boy and the kid who loves food (there were no names worth remembering) were so annoying that they drove me crazy. Whenever he spoke, it was about something scientific or food. Mollys Dad did not show enough emotion about his missing daughter. Molly's cop and father said the same thing four times. It was horrible. Everything was repeated to much. Beatrice should have done something wrong with her for being so mean. I only lost a moment in my life watching this movie!
