The direction had clearly stated that the idea and plot of this film is totally original ... however, for those who have read comics, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes ... < Another note is Jay Chow himself does NOT know Kung Fu, just will not impress anyone if he try to act as he can, many people today can see the differences .. Fortunately the film does not contain much of KunG Fu fight and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects ... <br /> <br /> I think Jay's acting is still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone in the movie is so much better. The only reason I think why Jay is the lead actor is simply because of his popularity. <br /> <br /> Despite how much I'd like to prevent anyone from seeing this, making this "original" movie what it should not have, has become one of the best budget movies in China for this year.
