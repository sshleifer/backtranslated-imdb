This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, the little slave, Alice and Jared Harris imitating Christopher Walken is what makes this movie fun. Alice smoking, drinking and strange way to appear when her name is called is strange and interesting. I have to applaud Jared for his imitation of Christopher Walken, and Christopher Walken for allowing it to be in the movie.
