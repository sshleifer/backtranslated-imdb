"Private Practice" is being dismembered with quite successfully and well written "Gray's Anatomy". The cast is fabulous. The premise may even work. But writing is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> The pre-pilot disguised as an episode of Gray's Anatomy should have been my first warning. The plot was simply blah. I thought maybe it was a fluke. So I set up the DVR to record the pilot and all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> As I watched the pilot, I wondered how a show with such a good cast of actors could bring together an annoying pilot. The pilot must suck people and keep them coming back for more. There must be thrill, flash, great writing, intriguing plot with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered during the rest of the season. Surprisingly, this show had none of that. <br /> <br /> To think that it was a coincidence, I just watched the second episode hoping for the best. And although marginally better, it does not come close to what needs to be interesting, can not miss the TV. <br /> <br /> I just cleaned this program from my list of programs to watch. Not worth the IMO effort, and I would be very surprised if this show still does it until the middle of the season. Pass these folks.
