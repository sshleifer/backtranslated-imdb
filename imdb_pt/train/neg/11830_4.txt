Okay, maybe a 13 year old like me was a little old for this movie. It's about this spoiled rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer rat takes him to a toilet bowl! He ends up in this city of rats and knows this mouse that has a gem that a greedy frog wants. He will do anything for this gem that he sends an entire army after these two rats. He plans to take the gem and flood the city with rats! The cool part about this movie is the slugs. They make all the sound effects. They sing, they make noises, they're incredible, they're also very funny. OK bottom line, is intended for children aged 7 years. Another sage, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. I did not think animation was a true dream art, more like WAllace and Gromit. I think they've loosened up a bit on that. The movie was just decent, not worth spending $ 9.50 for, sorry.
