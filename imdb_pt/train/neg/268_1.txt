1 How can everyone be understood perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes? The creators of this program realized that people who were taken from different parts of the earth at different times (Attilla the Hun was not a contemporary of pre-literate Hellenic cultures, nor were the contemporary Vikings of the Pyramid builders) speak different languages? and can never develop a language so similar to modern English (except for the inflections they "do not" use), which has been influenced by Latin, ancient Greek, Danish, and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences can not be overcome so easily, trust needs to be overcome, but everywhere the team arrives, it is welcomed without suspicion and begins to command people as if they were theirs leaders. Of course, real fans would remark that they are perceived as gods. The people they know should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like. <br /> <br /> 3 Historical Background: None. Visually this may vaguely remind you of the Greek or Viking culture, but anyone can dress up with a lot of tablecloths or go to a local costume rental to wear a plastic horned helmet and claim the looks. A small town theater group probably has better props. <br /> <br /> 4 Boring! Another production of Luck Canuck, which inexplicably lasted ten long years. As a show for children, this could work, but anyone who had a little knowledge about human behavior and language could not bear to watch the first twelve episodes of the first season, as I just did. I wanted very much to believe that I had found a decent science fiction show, otherwise I would close and clean my computer from this refuge after the first five minutes!
