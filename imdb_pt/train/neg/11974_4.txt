You realize you've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers coexisting on an island, but you think that after watching rambunctious, moody heroes passing through the bush with an egg in a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit with something a bit more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not even talking about the validity of the shows, which for the record I think is questionable. It's hard to suspend disbelief by "Bushy Bill" by eating a mouse when the entire team of producers and cameras is housed in a makeshift bio-dome with air conditioning, sipping moxa moxa with moxy. <br /> <br /> the appeal here? I do not care about these people or their sinuous lives. I just do not understand. But if you feel captivated by hairy and dirty people, I suggest you turn your TV off and take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people so in their true habitat. They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE and, for free, you can sit back and marvel at their incredible ability to recover several cigarette stubs from a myriad of trash cans, eventually reaching the dirt and creating a Dr. Frankenstein-style homemade cancer. At the same time, begging people for food changes when the stink of "Aqua Velva" in their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Much like Survivor, every week a member of the tribe "Leaves" the "Island" when they are sent unceremoniously to the local Institution when the scary unscheduled state of complete schizophrenia kicks in! Now this is entertainment!
