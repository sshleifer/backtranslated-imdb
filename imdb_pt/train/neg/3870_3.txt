Beneath the dense green of computer graphics, Ichikawa Someglory's amazing art and skill shone. Unfortunately, it got lost in all the slime. The scenes of Old Edo - with the courtesan, adrift in Sumida, rehearsing and performing at Nakamura-za - were thrilling and engaging, taking you back to an interesting and rich era. The action on the stage of Kabuki, in which the Somegoro stands out and excites, was more enriching than any of the absurd highs that followed. The ability, the energy in the audience, the colors of the scenery, were far more satisfying than all the absurdity of plot and performance. What a wasted opportunity! One of the best kabuki actors alive, and he gets lost in the trash.
