The long list of "big" names in this film (including the ubiquitous John Mills) did not leave me so confused that I could not judge the film by its real merits. It is full of stereotypes, cartoons and standard scenes, from the humble air hero to the flying speaker. The music track was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the movie ended: tall, growing, big flower growing and then silent, but then the film continued! I did not find any real plot, written randomly, but elegantly pressed uniforms and the cute Jean Simmons (nose job) with a little exciting ditty. I can not say that this photo has any of the ingredients that make the movie great. I found it mushy, dull and minor.
