I should have guessed that any movie with the poltergeist would not be good. It actually starts well, but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you're watching is a movie within a movie. There are people sitting in a movie theater watching this movie. A girl in the audience is so annoying that I would have turned around and strangled her. A little strange, but far from good.
