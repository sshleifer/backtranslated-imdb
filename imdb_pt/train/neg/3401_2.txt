I rented this movie after hearing about the fuss about not being put on for an Oscar, but after watching it, it's easy to see why that did not happen. Despite the beautiful photography, the film is incredibly slow, although it hardly has any plot. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a boy trying to deal with his parents' death in what he may or may not have been an accident (the movie is never clear about it), and how his grandfather used to tell him stories of fairy. Fairy tales contain the only bits of interest in the plot, but they are very short and do not seem to really have any point. The first fairy tale in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower for his girlfriend who is dying to save her life, but the kid takes time to taste the flower first for make sure it is not poisonous. In it being a few seconds late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then declares that the moral is that the boy was very impatient, but this does not make sense because it was a supercaucasian and slowness that resulted in his failure. Perfect metaphor for this movie really. <br /> <br /> Skye's picture is beautiful, but Stardust, which was released this year, is another fairy-tale film filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this.
