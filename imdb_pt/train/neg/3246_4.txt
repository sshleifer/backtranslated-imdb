The plot of House of Games is the strongest thing about it: a successful author and psychologist is fooled by a gang of swindlers, but upon discovering the bad part of herself that she likes the thrill of what she does, she finally revenge . This is about the field: but someone has to take responsibility for it, seen as being represented by dolls. It has to be the director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has had a TV career and a varied and quite stable film, so she can not perform it badly all the time. She must move from a tense, cool, controlled professional to a calculator, a quick, grumpy woman having fun, as shown by the change in the beige trousers suit (which she seems to wear for three days in a row, including underwear) sloppy floral summer dress. But everyone seems to be speaking their lines just as accurately; I imagine Mamet wanting to make sure that no syllable of her sparkling script has been lost. The effect is disturbing and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create. Sometimes the "Home of the Games" loses any connection with how humans actually behave or speak, and it becomes only a mechanism to create the plot. The soundtrack of the faux-jazz vibes'n'oboe clumsy also does not help. The bottom line is that the only entertainment to have is guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do that, the sooner you'll get bored with the two-dimensional and robotic performances. And they smoke too much !!!
