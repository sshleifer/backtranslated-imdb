Oh my, I think this may be the single most tacky movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the best films b. The first proof is that it's not a $ 5 DVD. Oh no, that's very mainstream for that. I have it on VHS, from a bin filled with rental videos at my local rental company. <br /> <br /> If I can quote the synopsis: "In seventeenth-century Japan, there lived a samurai who would define His name was Mayeda, he is sent on an epic journey around the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain While at sea a violent storm swallows its precious gold intended to buy weapons and almost takes their lives Mayeda must fight against all odds to survive and secure the fate of his beloved Japan. "Then he says:" An action epic millions of dollars on three continents. "I must have seen a different movie. This was not epic, and certainly not millions of dollars. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is really just the crazy adventures of Mayeda (Sho Kosugi) who speaks English. He's not even a Shogun, but that's not important. What is important is that he makes a very cool impression of John Cleese's repeated collection at a castle in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', and his ability to go from serious scenes to show off his samurai mind powers. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the Engrish accent of Sho Kosugi. The film may lack almost everything that makes a good movie, but it makes up for with some of the fullest lines of all time, with the coolest Engrish accent of all time. And honestly, do you really want anything else? You can advance the Shogun Mayeda until the end and repeat the last line of Kosugi over and over again. The tape will probably wear out before you tire of that line. Impressive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Very, very tacky.
