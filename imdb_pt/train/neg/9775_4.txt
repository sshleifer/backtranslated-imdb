Beautiful performances and art direction do not make a good movie. This film is so gloomy and depressing that I could feel absolutely no joy at the "happy" ending involving the union strike. Mood attempts involving Lake's pregnancy are absolutely disastrous, and any film involving a Baldwin brother already has an attack on him. On a positive note, Lang is still one of the great underrated actors of America, he alone almost makes it worth keeping on the VCR. I give it to 4.
