Wow. Some movies leave me speechless. This was undeniably one of those films. When I left the theater, no word came to my mouth. All I had was an incredible urge to bang my head against the theater wall to help me forget the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it did not work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. The mood was at the level of the first year, at best, the acting was overly silly, and the plot was astronomical and exaggerated. I promise never to see another movie starring Chris Kattan or any other cast member of SNL.
