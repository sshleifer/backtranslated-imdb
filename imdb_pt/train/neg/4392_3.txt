A young scientist is trying to accomplish the work of his dead father in limb regeneration. His authoritarian mother convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for his evil purposes. A young doctor uses reptilian DNA extracted from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes later he injects himself with his formula and grows a new killer arm ... Admittedly the special effects on Severed Ties are very good and grotesque, but the rest of the movie is horrible. The severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people. Great deal. The acting is mediocre and the climax is silly. 3 out of 10.
