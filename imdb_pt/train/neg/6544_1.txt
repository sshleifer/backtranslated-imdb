I paid a dollar for this DVD and at first I was feeling cheated, but then I started to think about it and I should be grateful. I found a Holy Grail, a true cornerstone of bad cinema. If you think the dramatic opening shots of an empty stadium fail with Evel's awkward camera monologue, then wait until the opening credits roll into the driver's butt. The script seems to be pasted together with ESL press releases and textbooks. But ... I can not believe how bad George Hamilton is. He seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says, the only internal monologue I can detect is "Gee, I bet they think I'm cute. Really cute!". This is an epiphany! I now know how bad it can be.
