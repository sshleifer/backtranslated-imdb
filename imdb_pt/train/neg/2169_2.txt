I used to like Loretta Young's early films: her acting at that time was light and cheerful, and she knew how to wear clothes. But this is just a loser of the word, except for a funny twist of Glenda Farrell. Young is a hat girl who talks about her husband writer (Paul Lukas) to become a bridge player in the championship. It is not the most cinematic of the games, and the long central part of their marriage ends the movie. <br /> <br /> But there is an interesting part. While Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk begin their climaxing match, a series of quick shots show planes, trains, football games, even a diver in the air, freezing in anticipation of the event. It's the first use of a frozen frame I saw in an American movie. We hope the rest is inventive and funny.
