Why do I constantly do this to myself? I mean, really, it's right there in the title - "The Incredible Melting Man." What else would I expect? I have to admit, I'm a sucker for pretty much anything I came across on the Monster HD channel, but the only redeeming feature of that image would be that really grotesque makeup job from the legendary Rick Baker. As for scary, I'm going to give the signal to that horny old couple sucking lemons just before the lights go out. Now they were really scary. <br /> <br /> Something I could never imagine in horror movies was why the victims of a monster would not simply run away when confronted with virtual annihilation. Like the girl in the cabin. You know, there was a fully visible door right there in the kitchen that she could have run off at any moment. Incredible Steve-O could not muster more than a quick walk, so why not just go straight through it? I do not know, maybe I'm missing out on something. <br /> <br /> This movie had the feel of an episode of 'Tales From The Crypt', but 'Tales' usually had a cool or grotesque touch, which you often did not see coming. This was a picture you could not understand. For example, in an early scene, you can clearly see that the Melted Man's eyeball fell out of your head, so how did he get around for the rest of the story? I do not think we should ask. At eighty-four minutes, this picture lasted about an hour and a half. When it was over, I was ready to accept General Perry at his earlier suggestion - "I could actually use a drink now."
