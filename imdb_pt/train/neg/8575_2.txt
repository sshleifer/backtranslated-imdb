****** SPOILERS ****** The unusual radio show host Kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre to receive a salary in this bland, parody of sporetically assaulted haunted house. Lugosi is a mystic whose sessions are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to deceive an heiress's fortune; Karloff is the butler and Lorre is a professor who exposes false psychics, but it turns out that both are in conspiracy with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and her band of 30-something boys discover the truth with as little humor as possible along the way. Not recommended for anyone, but the absolute sheer horror.
