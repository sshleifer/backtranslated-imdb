Usually, when I make an attack on the local Hollywood Video, I go toward the horror movies of the B-Horrors. For me the basics behind a B horror movie are the value of the camp, Heavy Gore, lots of unnecessary nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a packet of corn syrup and latex. I rented the Cradle of Fear strictly because I've been a fan of the band since they released their first Demo in 1995. The film started with an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stepping on an extremely obvious latex mask I laughed when I I saw the lesbian sex scene because of a lesbian sex scene I laughed even harder. I practically spent the whole movie laughing and when I was not laughing, I was shaking my head thinking about how a billionaire rock star would want to make a movie that seemed to be on a budget of several hundred dollars. The main point of this film for me seemed to appeal to the "hardcore gothic guys who think death, destruction, sex, blood, and Satan are the greatest things Lava Lamps ever invented. 5% of the things that happened in this movie just happened to be satanic. This movie had great potential and it really could have been a very good movie, but in the end this "Movie" is really just an extended Cradle of Filth Video.
