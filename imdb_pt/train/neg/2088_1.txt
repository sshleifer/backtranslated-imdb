What a horrible show. Science fiction fans seem to watch anything regardless of the quality. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts a while, while garbage as the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The acting is youthful and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clich√©s of everything that has ever existed in a bad science fiction series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than a prime time soap opera. The steering is of poor quality and the sets are terrible. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is a spin off that should never have been done.
