Looking at the other comments, I am impressed by the fact that there is no warning to prospective viewers about what they should expect when renting such crap. First, I rented this thing with the understanding that it was an Indiana Jones contest with competence. What I got was one of the most offensive films I remember trying to sit on, which is even more shocking at the comparatively high production values ​​of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a spoiler, but if it is, be warned ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​entertainment is to watch Bimbo being raped behind by the Dread Chief Tribal, while she is staring at the dead eyes of the severed head of her significant other, by all means, rent this movie. If not, I advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, this scene so succinctly summarizes the film that there is nothing else I really need to say about it.
