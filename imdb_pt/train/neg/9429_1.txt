I bought this movie for $ 5 at a used CD store, and I kind of regret it. I'll start by saying that I'm a big fan of cheesy horror movies. They provide a terribly tacky cheap entertainment. This movie entertained itself during the first half hour because it was so bad it could be done easily in an MST3K style way. Then it got boring. <br /> <br /> Acting is the scariest part of the movie. Although not to be expected, it was ridiculously bad and honestly provided all the entertainment that was to be had. This is the positive side of the movie. Where the film really fails in entertainment is writing, lighting and editing. <br /> <br /> This movie provides many "What is the% $ @ # happening?" moments. There are many moments, like the mother having a strange attack at dinner, and then this has no consequence in the film. Throughout the dinner queues, someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eating refined food for five minutes straight, without dialogue, every time a meal was served. During meals and other inappropriate times, the scene cuts through the pure darkness outside. Then cut back. And speaking of darkness outside, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the weather, where it's apparently not night, unless it's raining. And speaking in the dark, a big problem with the movie is that it's so dimly lit that you can not see what's happening in half the time, which is more of a frustration than anything. In one of the scenes of the climax, you can not even say what you should be seeing that is so shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to climactic scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I've seen people say, "Wow, that surprised me, and that's good." I can say that the great revelation surprised me, because I did not see it happening. The reason I did not see it happen is because it made absolutely no sense. I'm not going to ruin everything for you, but I'll tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding various parts of the movie to find anything that has validated this, and all we found were more things saying It was not possible. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is actually better when you watch it with the comments tracks that make fun of it. I love horror movies, but that was awesome.
