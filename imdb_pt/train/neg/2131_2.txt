I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (as this movie was praised), but this failed me miserably. For me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I quickly lost interest. I'm sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved with this movie. I will continue to be a fan of them all, but only time can heal my feeling about this. The only thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played the character of Yonica so well that I did not even recognize Hillary; I took some scenes to realize that it was her. Luckily I rented it for $ 1 per Red Box; I paid to see it on the big screen, I would be really steaming !!
