This movie is just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> From Ralph Meeker's cast as Mike Hammer to the fabled climax, the film is an exercise in wood predictability. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the true sociopaths of detective fiction. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who have pieced together pieces to solve the mystery, Hammer separates things to arrive at the truth. This film turns Hammer into a bullshit, surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to run away with anything. One of them is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a fit of popcorn. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the movie are well in the book of three stooges. Velda's dance in the barre, for example, or the thug who accidentally stabs his boss from behind. And the breaks in continuity are shameful: Frau Blucher is running down the center line of the road when the camera is tight on her legs, but she is well to the side when the camera retreats for a wider shot. The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The thug chasing the hammer passes a second after our hero, except that the clock shows that he was seven minutes behind our guy. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale. is so bad it must be seen, which is the only reason you get two points out of 10.
