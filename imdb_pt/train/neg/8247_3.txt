However, another British romantic comedy that the worldwide audience seems to have a voracious appetite for. This fragile effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clich√©d scenes are here of ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to run after trains that depart to declare someone's love. The characters are one-dimensional cartoons, except for Love-Hewitt, who manages to bring some cohesion to the film. Things threaten to get out of control in the plausibility department as the movie progresses; our humorous suspension of belief finally collapses during the absurd end. If you are looking for a Bridget Jones, Notting Hill, you will not find it here.
