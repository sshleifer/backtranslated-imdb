Watching The Tenants was an interesting experience for me. It's the first movie I've ever seen, where I've been quick on parts of (no) action - and I can usually watch anything from turgid indie action movies to the Croatian indie and find them fascinating. <br /> <br /> Tenants are frustratingly slow and over orchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is that there is little dialogue of a realistic character, in addition to the pieces in which the characters 'collide' in a well structured environment (to make it work, the film needed to feel more conceptual, which did not happen) . This leads to a lack of development of a realistic character; they all look two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The worst thing for this is the character of Bill Spear, also known as Snoop Dogg. I found your characterization very uncomfortable and very unfriendly. At one point, I even stopped the movie because I was so annoyed by the character's aggressive, violent and monotonous delivery, the lack of any personality layer other than that of the reactionary "on" switch (which actually gets predictable after a while) and I desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities. However, one reason for this jar may be the hazy scene from the film (supposedly 70, looks and looks earlier). If he had been better set in the 1970s, his character might seem more understandable. <br /> <br /> The lighting of the film was also strange. By the end, the soundtrack tries to provide a certain jazzy and sandy atmosphere that simply did not go away, largely because the scenery was very well lit. <br /> <br /> The Tenants, to me, is an unbelievable movie. It does not portray real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race, identity or the life of a writer, be they white or black. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I came away with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; his strange, clastro-phobic and obsessive appearance would have raised both the actors and the script in something quite remarkable.
