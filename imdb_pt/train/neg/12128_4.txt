In case half the footage of the film seems strangely familiar, it means you watch too much this fucking Italian cult! To you, notorious democrat Lucius Fulci not only produced this film, but also took the liberty of reusing the most sadistic murder sequences in his own (and most easily tracked) "Cat in the Brain." The opening scene, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an ax, appears in Fulci's later film, and thus another handful of killings and moments of slaughter. Andrea Bianchi's "Massacre" fails miserably like a giallo, as the quest for the sadistic murderer among a film crew filming a horror film is almost compulsive and suspenseful, but it's still good entertainment if you like rubbish horrible and cheap. . The incoherent script features a lot of disgusting characters who are all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings that Biachi presents is plausible and you can point the killer almost immediately. All that's left to enjoy are the truly misogynistic make-up effects and the hilarious acting performances of the cast. Whenever there is no shedding of blood on the screen, such as between the first and second murders, "Massacre" is a slow and almost intolerable process, with its futile dialogues and completely uninteresting photography. Fortunately, in the second half, there are women being impaled on fences and males being repeatedly stabbed with rusty tips. Music sucks and the use of movie locations is very unimaginative. My advice would be to jump this dog and go straight to the already mentioned "Cat in the Brain". That presents all the great moments of "Massacre", and then some.
