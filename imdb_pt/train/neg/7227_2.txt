While others may claim that when seeing other Bilal works, one will appreciate this film better, it fails in an important way. He does not stand alone. The plot is a mixture that confuses symbolism with substance. Here's an idea to start with a definite story. Then offer symbolism around it. We begin with two different narratives, this female that somehow becomes human, a "god" who for some reason is being tried, but who has one last case on Earth, and this mysterious character of John who seems to be developing some sort of "There's no development that wants us to empathize with any character in the story, the closest we've ever been to Jill and that's it." so the development is weak at best.Unfortunately the film is caught in the visually stunning whole (which is) but at the expense of motivational development.I would love to see this rewritten by someone who could get away from the material a bit and not feel that every image has to be in the photo.
