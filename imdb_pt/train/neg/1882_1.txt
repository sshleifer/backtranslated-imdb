What a terrible piece of rubbish !!! Who are all these people who cry about how good this is? Yes, it's "arty"; and yes, it is "foreigner", but ... this is not enough. The plot is boring and disjointed, like a reality show, but not as slippery. <br /> <br /> People are intrinsically uninteresting; but as characters they do not have depth enough to empathize with them. If they are based on real people, then I'm sorry, so much for them. <br /> <br /> The violence (and some of them are very violent) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous. It's as if the producer had visions of being Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think too much about him either. <br /> <br /> And oh yes: if I had neighbors like these, I would change!
