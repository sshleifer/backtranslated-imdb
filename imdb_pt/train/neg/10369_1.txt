As a writer, I think such bad films make a full face slap in production. Talk about insults. I was writing better stories than this in 8th grade. Bad performance, poor writing, bad targeting and when added up, the result is a complete and total failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie can do is fool the unsuspecting consumer into wasting his time. Who would give the green light to something so poorly written? Not artistic, intelligent, intelligent, full of suspense, mysterious, scary, dramatic - NOTHING. <br /> <br /> The characters are boring and boring. The plot is as recycled as an aluminum can. Somehow they have managed to play some very familiar actors who must all be desperate for work or who expect one of these low-budget independent films to be the next Pulp Fiction. This script should have been used to line up a bird cage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and last but not least, a woman of 5'2 105 pounds, of course, has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a fight and all at once . <br /> <br /> Prevent this pump from infecting you with an STD.
