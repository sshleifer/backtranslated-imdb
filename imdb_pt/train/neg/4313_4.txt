Like last year, I could not sit with the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as host was a good choice because he was loosely involved. Or rather, of all the full holes crowded into the theater, he at least was not in the Top 10 most annoying. Many of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted Top 10. I did not know that the whole thing had been done by autocue (though I knew it was in the script), but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to enter the expression , look away from the suggestion and stumble in simple words (Natalie Portman? if there is no director, she is gone). The night of extravagant dresses and boring speeches was long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles massacred some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Presenter Award. <br /> <br /> For helping me write this review, I would like to thank my mother, my father, my lawyers and my pedicure for everyone to believe in me, and I would like to point out that I have a high metabolism and, Of course, I have not been starving for a month. I will not cry ... thank you.
