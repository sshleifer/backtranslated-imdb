The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all the other spy agencies in the world should watch this movie for information on spying on people. (as the MST3k Commentary states ...) "Sanata has the dirt on everyone!" Santa's tentacles reach far and far! There is no hiding place for the Klaus Organization ") <br /> <br /> From telescopes that can spy millions of people miles to ears who can hear everything. It's incredible that the CIA does not have Santa Claus on the payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is hilarious. Pitch ... he's so useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor of this movie is tremendous. Very low budget, but so fun to watch. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version to laugh even more. <br /> <br /> You even laugh with the bad luck of the good boys. <br /> <br /> I give a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
