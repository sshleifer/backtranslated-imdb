This movie is hilarious, not in the right way. The fights are terribly poorly made, while sometimes they try to shock you by breaking a few bones, and even this happens only two or three times, definitely not enough to call it shockmovie. A shooting means that a hero can enter an open field with 10 people shooting him with uzi's, picking up a gun, start firing back and not getting hurt. <br /> <br /> The empty story, face waking up, lost his memory, starts to fight because that's what he's good at. Five years later, memories come back, blablabla revenge. <br /> <br /> It's not worth it, it's not worth it unless you're drunk and bored.
