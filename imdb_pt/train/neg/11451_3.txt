Okay, a serious movie fan is expected to watch all kinds of movies, both the bad and the good, and that movie put me to the test. I will not measure words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. In fact, I wondered why I bothered to see this rotten and rotten movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something I suspected would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a fan of films and therefore I can not avoid what should be avoided. I'm not going to waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateur movie, except to say that the acting quality was, to put it politely, to subpaar. A serious movie fan might want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie. Otherwise. stay home, do not waste time, read a book, do homework or have a good sandwich.
