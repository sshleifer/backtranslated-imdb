The worst show I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for some unexplained reason, have superpowers, and when they use some special device, they turn into strange and ill-conceived facts. The acting when they are not in the lazy-looking outfits is decent. Definitely not good, but not the worst performance I have ever seen. However, when they wear their suits, the acting of the actors goes from bad to worse; much, much worse. Hyper-animated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary moves they make. Even when they speak, it seems they are having convulsions. Villains are stupider than the Rangers. Each episode, some weak and stupid villain presents some plan to destroy the Rangers. He sends a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. The Rangers then initialize their 10-hour transformation animation, then annihilate the aliens. So the ill-designed villain, who may be an armored villain who really looks and acts evil, a humanoid creature resembling a ladybug with trumpets attached to his back showing obvious signs of mental retardation. The Power Rangers fight the villain, and then the villain turns into Godzilla, whether by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, they fire nuclear weapons against creatures and creatures become giants). The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper-animated and summon their Zords, which are obviously toys that the program's producers used special effects to make them look real. The Power Rangers win, the villain gets angry, they all teach a "valuable" lesson, and the show ends. That's it. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, fake kung fu fighting.
