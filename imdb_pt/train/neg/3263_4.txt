This is the second British Rank film to adapt Sommerset Maugham's stories to the movies. All except a 'Quartet' story, do not travel well into the contemporary era; and the actors' speech is decidedly "clipped," as only the delivery of British pre-1950 actors can be. In any case, 'Trio' seems narrower and cinematic than the first film adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that these two films can not overcome is that their original material was written 25 to 30 years before the movies. . Consequently, in the 1950s, Maughm's ("prewar") popularist narrative of "morality" seemed rather outdated, if not outright demure.
