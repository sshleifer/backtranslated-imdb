This is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. When a man says he wants to have a superpower to be able to cheer orally, I consider the film to be a 14-year-old children's fantasy. The bed-room scene was exaggerated and reduced an intimate moment to a farce of biological functions, similar to the passage of gas in public. From the beginning, all the other scenes were a discussion about how little sex they got, how long it took them since they got something, when their next sexual connection was, and who they should be with. Moreover, the dialogue and acting were very poor and very forced, not felt, and filled their lack of content with contemptible sex scenes. This could have been very funny because the concept is really interesting, but it is poorly executed here. Please do not even think about getting someone under 16 if you have to go and see him.
