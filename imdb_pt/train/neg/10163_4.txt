When thinking about the revelation that the main character in "Bubble" comes to the end of the films, I remember the last few years "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> A discreet but entirely realistic portrait of life in small towns. The title is a reason for contemplation. Perhaps, we, the target audience are the ones in the "bubble," since we are not given any return in the 90-minute films. The audience's reactions were often presumptuous and critical, clearly indicating how detached people can be by seeing any strand of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves. These characters are those people refer to as those who put George W. back in office for a second term. <br /> <br /> It is worrying to consider how the reality of television spoiled our sense of reality when we watched an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credit paper. This movie has its merits and deserves consideration for the things it does not say directly.
