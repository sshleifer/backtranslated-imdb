Can I do until I need glasses? at least proves that anyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. The people who unleashed this miserable pile of vomiting vomit in the world, lack any resemblance of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience should consist of the newly examined, and infants who play with their own feces. Anyone else would be much wiser in the world to get even a little smile from that movie. It consists of a series of sophisticated skits, in which the drill line does not extend to the obvious. It ends in ridicule. Counted jokes are the kinds of jokes that elementary school children tell (usually pumped or sexual), where they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like the one about Daddy's car and Mom's garage. To apply any more severe method of criticism would be useless, since the usual patterns of acting, writing, direction, and such have never been heard by creative "minds." behind this mess. Do not judge, but anyone who liked this movie should seriously reflect on their purpose on Earth. <br /> <br />
