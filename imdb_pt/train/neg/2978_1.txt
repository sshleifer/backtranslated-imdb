I am a big fan of horror movies, and zombie movies are one of my favorites. That said, Zombie 3 is one of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen. So it goes without saying that I really liked it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. The story bears some resemblance to Dan O'Bannon's "Return of the Living Dead," but although this film was intentionally funny, this is the opposite. It has some of the most laughable performances I've ever witnessed, especially the main character scientist. His scenes with the general were only hysterical. In addition, the effects are insignificant and, in many cases, sloppy, and death scenes are often simply stupid. This, of course, makes everything more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head, which then opens its eyes and somehow EXPULSES THE REFRIGERATOR (obviously pulled inept with a bit of rope), locking the faces neck, killing him. Do zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? It defies all the laws of physics known to man, and is one of the most absurd things ever filmed. This is just one of the many really dumb moments in the dumb mess. I can not believe it has such a high rating here. If you're a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent this sucker.
