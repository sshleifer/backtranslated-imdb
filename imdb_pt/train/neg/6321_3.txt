I can not imagine anyone in a million years wanting to watch this movie. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (it was not), but largely because it's about 20 years old and is so out of the mainstream. I was trying to figure out where I saw an actor before and it appeared. So, yes, a child stops playing minor league because he does not like nuclear weapons, this takes media attention and a quick resolution to the cold war. The end. A fantasy, of course, but such a fool would make John Lennon blush. Since terrorism replaced communism as the -ism that scares us, this movie really has no relevance, except as an (inaccurate) look back to those times. Writing, acting and film are similarly underdeveloped. The reason I rated this as well as I was because I watched this movie about 50 times while I was 5-6 years old and still have a little place in my heart for it, but now I realize that this does not quite reach decrease mustard. So if the law of big numbers is true and someone eventually decides to take a look at this movie, realize that there are much better ways to spend your time, but also the worst. (I will refrain from a speech by John Q. for now.)
