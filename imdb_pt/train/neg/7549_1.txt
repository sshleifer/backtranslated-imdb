If Edward Woodward was the movie that watched this movie, then that would be what he would scream in horror. <br /> <br /> Sorry, people, but enough. We got Carter, The Italian Job, Alfie and now this. What are the similarities? No. It's not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars are another great British actor. The main common ingredient in these originals is the britishness of the films. They were not meant to impress Hollywood. They were quirky English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that simply can not be replicated in the USA. The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult movie than to bastardize it with a remake or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a difficult task even before he hit the road. Wicker 73 is even more puzzling than other cult films; challenge the genre, the clever scripts, the A-level actors, the soundtrack, the throws of pieces that defy the description and all the stories surrounding the film. <br /> <br /> So, here comes a remake. Do not worry. No original was harmed in the making of this remake. Some important aspects of history needed to be reworked for modern USA - communications, paganism, virgins. But that's just about the whole premise. So we give the cop a Nam style traumatic past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares. So no cellphone mast on the island that commands communication - but in the real world this would not happen. Cops just do not disappear. Give him a blood link to motivation rather than belief clash and you will have the remake. Wafer thin though, is not it? <br /> <br /> It's just that everything was put up with a spatula. The name changes were simply weak, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community on the island, no downtown to steer, just a few houses scattered in a forest and that was it. Willow was just annoying for not giving any information and Cage was useless to let her escape. When he entered the pit, you knew he would lock it. The script was signaled to the end - and you just wanted it to hurry up and end. The epilogue was absolutely hilarious and did not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> This ending is probably the best way to sum up the difference between the two. One ends at the most beautiful sunset after the most horrible day. The other ends with a "explain-all-to-the-racks" type post-production conclusion. <br /> <br /> I loved the original, but I went to the movies with an open mind and I was excited to see the movie. . I'm grateful to know that this movie will probably end up on a road somewhere that just this once was mercifully forgotten forever.
