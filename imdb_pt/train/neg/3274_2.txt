Again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, a TV series is turned into a complete movie and is ruined by all the hundreds of people who watched. Basically, cousins ​​Duke, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time driving very fast on "The General Lee". But they need to unite and prevent their family's farm from being destroyed along with almost the entire city by nasty Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg (Razzie named Burt Reynolds) to make way for a huge coal mine. They get help along the way from their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzie named Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), as they are pursued by equally evil sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (CFC Gainey of Lost) and police. Also starring Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Vice-Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I give the film an extra star is because of some stunning acrobatics, and of course, Simpson's gorgeous body (I admit that her legs are not exactly Catherine Bach, but still!), But besides, it's very annoying. It was named Razzies for the worst film, worst director for Jay Chandrasekhar, worst remake or sequel, worst screen couple for Simpson & his "Daisy Dukes" and worst screenplay. Very poor!
