Watching Lady In Ermine, I wondered what Betty Grable was doing on a project that seemed to be aimed at Marlene Dietrich. Someone from 20th Century Fox may have decided that one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better. Betty plays a 19th-century Italian countess whose domain was invaded by a troop of Hungarian hussars led by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Her ghost ancestor whose portrait is in the palace along with the rest of her distinctive tree genealogist, sees no small resemblance to Doug now and another invader 300 years before with whom she dealt when the armies failed. <br /> <br /> In addition, the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion came at a very inopportune time, before things were consummated. That will give someone a bad attitude, I assert. <br /> <br /> Fresh, healthy all American Betty is not the actress to make seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich could have done with that, but Betty is flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, although Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can watch on anything. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the soundtrack for this movie and This Is The Moment Oscar nomination for Best Song. Lady At Ermine's only chance for Oscar glory was in Buttons And Bows. <br /> <br /> Ernest Lubitsch died half way through the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine. I can not believe that Lubitsch had Grable in mind by the leadership here. Not you, if you see that Lady In Ermine.
