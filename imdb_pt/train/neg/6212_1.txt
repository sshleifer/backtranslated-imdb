It used to be my thinking that movies demanded plots, or some other way to make you care about the story or whatever was going on. This movie showed me that you do not really need to have something like that. <br /> <br /> I could sum it up simply. But IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was kind of pretty. is not convincing at all. The way the characters speak in the movie makes you think it should have happened in a matter of days, but there is no passage of time and I'm sure everything happens in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to entertain yourself, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink before you vomit. It would be a much better use of your time. Time you will never go back. Jurassic Park 3 was taken out better than this movie.
