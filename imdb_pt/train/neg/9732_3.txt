First, the leader, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you are trying to take this movie seriously, then I guarantee it will ruin this for you. If you do not take him too seriously, he's really fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene in which Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - between dodging the jets of flames coming out of their arm in the car. Another big exaggerated scene was watching John Landis as a grumpy radio show producer getting dizzy and struggling around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie as a nonstop tumult - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper wanted it to be like this.
