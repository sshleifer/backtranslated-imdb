There is only one use for a movie like Bulletproof: it recalls how bad can be bad. We often see movies that we describe as "pretty awful" or "not very good," but then you come across a movie like that and you can see that while all those other films are not "good", they are not that bad. bad as bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds scouring the DVD compartment at our local store to fulfill an obligation (ie to give me a gift). It could have been a casual find, but it was not: this is so clich√©d, so poorly written, so misdirected, so misinterpreted that I am surprised that everyone involved has not been arrested and sent for 10 years. God is horrible. I suspected about 30 seconds, but I continued because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad that they can be enjoyable. This is not one of them. That's just bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow I'm going to throw it in the trash.
