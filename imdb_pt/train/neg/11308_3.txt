<br /> <br /> Get your brewskies and enjoy this flawed action movie. Speakman's considerable kempo ability (good spin kicks, decent sticks - poor couch!) Is the only redeeming quality of a movie that only cries poorly. The plot is not half bad; just performed very poorly. But if you are watching this movie for anything other than martial arts, you are missing out on the boat altogether. And for a movie that was supposed to happen in Koreatown, very few Korean actors (even extras).
