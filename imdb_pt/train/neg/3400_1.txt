This movie is self-indulgent trash. Watch this movie if you just want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy the nice soundtrack. Pay attention for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It must be charming, but it is not - it's just annoying. The characters are difficult to worry about and the acting is bad. The stories within the film are also unadorned and sinister. I was expecting a comforting family movie, but that did not appeal to my fourteen-year-old daughter either. It's rare that I can not see a movie until its conclusion, but this was the best of both of us. <br /> <br /> Although the film is set in the present times, it has the appearance of a cheap movie. European film made during the Cold War. There is not even enough of beautiful Scottish landscapes and cinematography to rescue him. A real shame because, as a film, this is an embarrassment to Scotland.
