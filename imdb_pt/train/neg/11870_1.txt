This is the most depressing movie I have ever seen. I first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really disturbs me. I know it was raised in a time when life was difficult and I know that these people were poor and the crops were vital. Yes, I understand all of this. What I find hard to accept is that I can not remember a single moment of light throughout the film. Maybe it was true in life, I do not know. I'm sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of the footage etc etc was wonderful and I know every movie can not have a happy ending but as a family movie it is terrible in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend anyone who wants to have fun with a movie. I can not emphasize enough how this movie affected me as a child. I was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came back. I think it would have all but heart failure to reach Prozac.
