"I thought it would be locked in a padded cell and they would throw away the key." (This is a fragment of a paraphrased dialogue of "State of Mind.") Forest Paula Milne and her co-writer have found the magical mushrooms they must have eaten, to create this weak whodunnit and bring such rubbish to our canvases. <br /> <br /> A padded cell should indeed be available. <br /> <br /> Niamh Cusack did his best (as well as the other actors), but surely his talent deserves a better vehicle than that: the height of absurdity has been attained, and this particular "State of Mind" is best buried and forgotten, and certainly not just "put in a box and locked in a drawer ".
