<br /> <br /> This movie sucks. This reminded me of the film Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I also found extremely boring. And "Holy Week" is, in every way, an even worse film. <br /> <br /> Only one in the cast doing something for this movie is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the great ladies in the history of European cinema. I loved his manic looks in "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time dealing with this movie. I'll say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
