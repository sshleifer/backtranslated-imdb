Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could it be that? Why did an ancient civilization buried artifacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text inconsistent? Why a nun (she certainly looked cool!) Delivered more than 20 orphans to a madman? Has there ever been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine cables come out in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly appear in Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why could not even a non-archaeologist open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why do modern computers still show grid contours of the pre-Tron green era with small beeps? And should all explosive timers have digital screens? Why does not anything in this movie make any sense?
