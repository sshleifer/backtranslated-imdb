This movie makes several mistakes. some American actors in Spain and Spanish actors speaking English. the spaniards' English is OK, but the way the acting is performed makes it all very boring. the dialogue through the whole script is very weak; may have been a Spanish script, but incorrectly translated, who knows and who cares. I can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors forced to speak English, they may be good, but not on this flop. you'll discover the movie within the first 5 minutes, that's just how pathetic it is. then the rest is just plain bad. a lot of waste of time, many lots needed for the UN. Oh I mentioned that one of the Baldwin's at it.
