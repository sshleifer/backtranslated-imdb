After the opening credits, there is a black screen for about a minute. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. After she and two college friends are driving to a rock show, after much padding, they hit something and get off the road. They wake up in a hut inhabited by an elderly woman in a wheelchair and her descendants. The murders are sadly very tame for a supposed nasty video. The turnaround ended silly and predictable. No one involved in the mess would do anything of note again. So there are still happy endings sometimes. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sara Ansley gets topless, and Laurel Munson has full frontal exposure <br /> <br /> My Note: D
