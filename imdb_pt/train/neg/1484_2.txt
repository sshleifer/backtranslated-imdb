please do not rent or even think about buying this movie. They do not even have the red box available for rent, which would cost $ 1 and I think it's worth less than that. The main reason I rented this movie. was because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 min.i will give credit that the movie had yummy and a bit of nudity, but other than that you can also buy another horror movie d that has the same thing with Ginger Lynn has more acting time in this film than Jenna and she is not even on the cover of the film nor his name. I recommend people watch zombie strippers because you see Jenna almost the whole movie and naked most of the time. the movie time.This is a big disappointment and a huge waste of time.
