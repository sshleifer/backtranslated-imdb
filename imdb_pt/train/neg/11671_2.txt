I need to say - it's a stinker! (I gave you a rating of 2) <br /> <br /> Just watch it if you suffer from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of scene chewing and dwindling, but not much else happens in this movie. There is no suspense, no deep and shocking secret revealed, no real threat to the well-being of the heroine. Some disagreements, slight increase in voices - this is very beautiful. The secrets are nothing that could not happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in the film is totally predictable to that point. The plot, as it is, revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a series of panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion for a very, very rich and old widow, and a growing mother-daughter relationship that the older woman longs for. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the daughter of the older woman, Cassandra, is dead. You can very well fit the rest of the pieces together. <br /> <br /> Even the scene with the mysterious man threatening our heroine does not advance to the point that you really fear for your safety beyond a second or two. Why he's still around for years after Cassandra's death is a good question. There is also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything - cook, clean, serve the meal, answer the door, etc. All except apparently locking the door - since that would be the only explanation of how one of the characters walks into a room where Faith is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that makes you hold the arms of the chair, and lean forward on the edge of your seat because there is no "mounting tension" in this movie - just pathetic and cheesy revelations that are played from time to time. <br /> <br />
