I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love Kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a lovely side to it. Not that I like anything. Spenny spoils this movie. He should let Kenny and his hot girlfriend release the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's pretty annoying, plus a scene with Roger Ebert. There really are not many celebrities in this movie, and most do not seem to say more than one line. Overall this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest watching it if you had it with the Kenny vs Spenny DVD season 1 (it comes free on 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out The Paper Chase.
