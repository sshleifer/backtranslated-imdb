Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was no exception. I'll try to tone it down. Let's be real !!! No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character. There was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to wonder if old Chuck can not get better. Has he declined so much that he needs to produce garbage like that and expect his reputation to carry him through the entire film? Chuck is an amazing martial artist, and as we've seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a good actor, but the trick is to combine these two qualities in his movies, and that's not it. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, stay as the main character in your movies because that does not work for you ... Gary
