I see people writing about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The performance was unsatisfactory at best. It made a lot of money because the teenagers went to see the movie seven times in theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, what was going through the minds of many people; maybe even a little conspiracy. Does anyone notice that certain people did not board the ship because there was a fire on board before they even took off? No, you do not know, because all you see is a rich girl falling in love with a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that dorky garbage, at least, make you think the movie was stupid?). <br /> <br /> I cried during a scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling the ship. It looked like water from the pool! I'm thinking that this movie made all that money and they could not make ocean water look real? unbelievable ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh the band played while the ship sank .. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor topped him in the "Nothing to Do with Reality" department.
