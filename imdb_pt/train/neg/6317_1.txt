I have no idea that San Francisco idiot invented this stupid plot, but apparently they need to get out of whatever drug they're taking and put their analyst in the money of danger - NOW. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a plausible story, if you consider the sequestration of aliens in "Life of Brian" as plausible. <br /> <br /> This movie is little more than a leftist popcorn. If the United States and the USSR gave up nuclear weapons, the result would have been to eliminate the only real obstacle that prevented the two from engaging in war. Bad as Korea, Vietnam and other wars of the era were, they were "proxy wars" fought to keep the superpowers of a direct commitment. <br /> <br /> This film makes me wonder how realistic it was when some high school kids would go on hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if someone were saying "Mr. President, some kids at Drastic High are not eating!" and Ronald Reagan would reply, "My God, it's best to review my defense policy!" Right. <br /> <br /> Like this movie? It would not be better if the Soviet Union had collapsed because they could not support the construction of their huge weapons ... wait, that's what happened!
