Kids love dinosaurs. It's a little part of their culture. But they have the earth ahead of time. The original. At least this movie had a heart. This one. This movie is simply pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs does not mean that you can just join any old story and show it to the kids. This movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and it's more for the material of the numbers. Not as soul-sucking as Theodore Rex, but far from being an Earth Before Time.
