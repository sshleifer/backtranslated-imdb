Okay, fuck MooCow will grudgingly admit the truth: I kind of like this cheap, extravagant parody of the '70s. The idea that vast hordes of murderous tomatoes are destroying the US is a great idea, and though all, moovie delivers some decent laughter, and the sight of terrified extras running away from big, obviously fake tomatoes. This film, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the first attempts at spoofs, which became so popular in the 1980s and 1990s, thanks in large part to Airplane !. This, like the forgeries, is very poor. Many attempts at humor are discouraging failures and will induce much moaning. But thanks to the hordes of greedy tomatoes, the nasty "Puberty Love" song and the incredible scene of the helicopter crash, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes supplies some products, though mostly for the wrong reasons. There are many things wrong with this movie ... and so it's hard to explain. Quite a few people should have also liked this as the Tomatoes have made a comeback in 2 moore movies and a cartoon series !! Big chunks of time spent away from the tomatoes are pretty boring. And dig the clothes of the 70's, man! ; = 8) This tomato is decadent and tacky, but worth a laugh or two; MooCow says: get a pizza and put the Tomatoes !! : ??
