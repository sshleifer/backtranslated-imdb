Be warned: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor plays the lead role as the poster you believe. Their roles are indeed minor. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, without being really engaging. Especially I find it impossible to gather much sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his crazy friends and sex-obsessed boyfriend. The plot trails terribly, and I turned this off after about 2/3 - unusual for me, as I'd like to finish what I start. Good performance and beautiful setup takes 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
