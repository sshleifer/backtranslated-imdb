This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect crime is executed and the investigating officer, ignoring all clues, immediately knows who is to blame. The public has to wait for the whole movie to get the culprits caught. The result is like every episode of "Columbus" or "murder she wrote." The director himself refers to the hackney story showing the cop watching an episode of Matlock! This story only fills 90 minutes, but the director insists on using all 120 minutes, filling all the clich√©s of the book. Skip this, you are not missing out on anything.
