1999 will go down in history as the year the film critic deflects the general public. First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. So they announced the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst movie of the year. What is this about? Who the hell knows. It is full of self-indulgence and loaded with poor acting. I always like to stay and watch the credits, but when that was over I could not get out of the movie fast enough. Most of the audience attending the screening I was in, felt pretty much the same way. The dates discussed among themselves and also with strangers. It's an ugly and hateful movie that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
