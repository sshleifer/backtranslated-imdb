I do not buy kung fu movies for a plot. I buy them for fight scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fighting scenes, but not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, but it changed very slowly for my liking. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes, lasting only a few minutes each. The last fight was a little longer, but by then I was so bored I did not even pay attention to her.
