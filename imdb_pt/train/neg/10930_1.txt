This movie is a total puppy. I found myself struggling to find anything to laugh just so as not to feel that I had totally wasted my money - and my time. The writing in this movie is absolutely terrible. Too bad it does not meet the standards of other Hale Storm films. <br /> <br /> They should have saved up the money to get D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working on the script until it was right. Even Gary Coleman was not properly used for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie leaves you wondering what would be the purpose of most of the plot - including subplots. After watching this movie, I get the impression that the producers hoped to capture some kind of Napolean humor, like Dynamite, where not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. Unfortunately, this film can not deliver lines, characters, delivery or humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
