I'll be honest. The only reason I watched this episode on TV is that it's at the bottom of IMDb 100. And now, I'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life would really be worth another 'check' on the same list. <Br> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who finds himself in a huge fight with the Universal Soldiers after the main computer took a 'HAL' to defend himself. And yes, after all the mandatory explosions, shootings and persecutions, he is the last one standing. Combined with a terrible performance and a little boring, he ensures that the place on the infamous list is fair. <br /> <br /> Only for the idiots like me who want to watch this complete list. 2/10
