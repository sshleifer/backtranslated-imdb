There is no story! The plot is hopeless! A movie based on a car with a stuck accelerator, no brakes and an automatic transmission gear lever attached can not be good! I would have stopped that car within a minute if I was in it or the police car constantly following it. I'm sorry for the actors who had to put up with such a bad script. The few scenes that some resemblance to the action were heavily dramatized, and as far from reality as you can get. In addition, there were a lot of mistakes, for example, the hood of the car on the run, which was blown up doing 100 mph. At first, he just folded the windshield, as it would in fact, but then it exploded. The car was later in the movie watched with the hood on .... This movie was nothing but annoying, stay away from it!
