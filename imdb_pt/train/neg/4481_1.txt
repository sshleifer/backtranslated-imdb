I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline's commercials, but I thought I'd give it a try. So I watched and all I can say is bleh. This movie was so bad. It's rare that I hate so much a movie. Watching this movie reminded me of those funny scenes from Altman's The Player when the writers cast their bizarre ideas at the producers. I would like to know which MTV producer has decided that an adaptation of an hour and a half for the video of Bronte (but this time the name of Heathcliff is Heath and he is a rock star, and the name Hindley is Hendrix) would be a good idea. <br /> Even this may not have been so bad if they had not gotten all the other aspects of the movie so horribly wrong as well. The direction must have been "you are alone, pouting for me". I laughed out loud during all the "serious" scenes and got bored for the rest. The camera job was spotty and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie trying to be nervous. My theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for some beers with his boom - all I could hear in the middle of the scenes were the waves. And in the other scenes, I wanted it to be all I could hear. And speaking of sound, what they did with the "More" song of the Sisters of Mercy is absolutely inexcusable, so again, it's inexcusable what they did to Bronte. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, there was a fun scene. - specifically the time when Johnny Whitworth licked the face of Katherine Heigl - and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with the rest of the story, more power to you.
