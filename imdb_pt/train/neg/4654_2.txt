A vampire kills young women and paints with her blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he has to do what she commands or be turned into a bloodsucker. After a few deaths, the assistant is remorseful and falls in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? That its pace is too slow, it has some weird sound effects (never a bite sounded so strange) and an ambient (new jazz here I come) and that the lights do not seem to be included in the set. It looks like a horror movie "auteur" with all the self-sufficiency inside. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and, as you can imagine, it is the vampire who explains how to kill her, even if she does not know it. have to do this; Of course, crosses, light, garlic and toothpicks do not work. <br /> <br /> It's not even a funny and bad movie. Maybe with some friends and lots of beers, it can not have its funny sides (to be honest, it's funny for 10 - 15 minutes near the end of the movie). Do not be fooled by Troma's sticker, it's one of the bad movies they feature.
