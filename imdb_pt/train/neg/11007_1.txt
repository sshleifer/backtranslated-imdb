Lately they have been trying to steal this movie late at night on cable TV commercials. Do not believe in hype. I was one of the unfortunate people to see this stench in the theaters. This is, in my opinion, the third worst movie of all time, right behind Mac and Me (# 1 worse), and Jack Frost (# 2 Worst), but I must admit, they are all close and all TERRIBLE! Really, nothing in this movie is funny, or disturbing, or anything else that is said to be like this, do not waste your money. The only good thing is to give your worst enemy. I'm not lying about it. Someone you would like to kill or torture would be a great candidate for this movie. This is horrible. If you do not believe me, then you deserve to suffer from the misery of watching this, which I doubt you might end up with. Two thumbs up enthusiastically.
