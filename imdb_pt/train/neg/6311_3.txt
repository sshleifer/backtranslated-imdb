It's a bad movie, a bad one. <br /> <br /> Well, for people, a realistic movie is a good thing. For me it is not. Life is also predictable, bad, nasty, trivial, pointless at times. Maybe that's the reason people say this movie is real. <br /> <br /> Many places in common: you are black, you are a criminal, you are condemned and cursed, what you do end up shooting or being shot by someone; do not let children play with guns, it can be dangerous; and then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before this, I had not seen such a bad movie. That is perhaps the reason why I have never noticed how important photography itself is important in a film. In this, every scene filmed during the day, outdoors, is clear and irritatingly blue. They did not bother correcting the color balance. Oh! I've "rated" over 300 movies in this database so far, and this (3/10) is my smallest ever.
