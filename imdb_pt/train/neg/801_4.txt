Despite their stereotypes, virtually nameless cast and an obviously low budget, I thought this movie was good; much better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical at first - the idea of ​​a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a bit ridiculous to me. But in the end, I thought the film coped well with the concept (even if some scenes were a little cliché). The cast was very good, and the two leaders seemed to take their roles very seriously. I could not help thinking, however, that Janine Turner is a bit like Geena Davis. Maybe it was just her face or the makeup, the hair and the clothes she had in this movie, but it only bothered my mind all the time. <br /> <br /> Although not a 'must see' or a great movie of any standard, 'Fatal Error' is a fun movie that will keep you watching until the end.
