This movie starts slowly and then slows down. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I left. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip lock. Anything. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people that any of us know. The producers of this film can be sued in court if they try to sell it as a "motion" movie. There is no movement. I could have told the same "story" with some still-captioned photos. The script is a joke. It's awful. I doubt any medical script in the world can save you. My biggest regret is not that I've lost 60 minutes of my life watching "Love In The Time Of Money," but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to leave, but I waited a little too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people leave before me.
