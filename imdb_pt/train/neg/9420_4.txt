The sequel to "Cleopatra Jones," 1973, has black actress Tamara Dobson returning to her role as a super-tough, chic anti-drug agent, here busting a heroin ring in Hong Kong. The cross-pollination of the blaxploitation action movie and the kung fu movie B is fun at first, but ends up being flags. The end of the shooting is to the right of the assembly line, and Dobson herself seems less energetic than before (she's still sexy, and she puts a single twist on her comically flamboyant dialogue, but those environments may have been too much of a thing to her - she's tired). Stella Stevens plays the villain this time; she's good, but she can not match Shelley Winters in her predecessor. ** in ****
