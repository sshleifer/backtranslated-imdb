One of those documentaries, "Thank God, I do not live." This speaks of two warring factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries, and the neighboring peoples of Medellin. <br /> <br /> Weapons, drugs and death run wild. The guys, no older than 22, who are not in the middle of a war are in jail. The girls ?? not women, girls? always react the same way when one of them is dead, with tears and screams. You scratch your head; What did they expect, really? I do not know what is most disturbing: the night shootings and civil unrest, or that everyone seems to passively accept things as they are. Or seeing that boy drinking what obviously is not his first beer, being all this, 10? If you took these young people out of their situation and put them somewhere where they had the opportunity to do more, more, how many would choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, everything, I'm afraid.
