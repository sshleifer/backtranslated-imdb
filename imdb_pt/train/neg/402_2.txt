To describe this movie as trash is unfair. At least rooting through trash can be an absorbing hobby. This movie was neither absorbing nor amusing. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can act superbly given the chance, so no doubt he had an IRS bill to settle when he agreed to this terrible script. The story of the mad scientist of 'Hollow Man' has been told before, was told better and was told without resorting to so many ridiculously expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of these special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs that you could buy in the early seventies. In the UK they were marketed as 'The Transparent Man' (/ Woman / Dog), which is perhaps where they got the title for this movie. <br /> <br /> Smart special effects, horrendous script, non-existent plot. <br /> <br />
