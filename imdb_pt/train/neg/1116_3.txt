This film seems to have been a training exercise for the Coppola family. It does not seem to know if it's a Western "A" or "B". I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for the love of God. William Boyd must be spinning in his grave. <br /> <br /> All Western "B" cliches are here. The pearly hero with two pistols in his white hat with the trusty steed ("C'mon Thunder"), the all-black bearded villain, the endangered heroine, the stray farmer, the cowardly sheriff, etc. <br /> <br /> The performance, with few exceptions, is strictly the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) Like the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) Like the villain seem to have been more at home in a quickie of the 30 years of Poverty Row. The addition to the cast of veterans Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a bit but they do not have enough to save him. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the movie? Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing sequences? Should we believe that Sheen's character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Being a great lover of westerns of all genres, I struggled to find some redeeming qualities in this film. The cinematography was very good and the settings looked very authentic. Besides the hero and main villain, the other characters seemed authentic. <br /> <br /> If the producers were to resurrect the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they might have thought of portraying it as it was originally written - a grumpy and dirty grumpy hand with a splinter in the shoulder, the kind of paper in which Lee Marvin would have stood out. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, but ... about Thunder, about a big guy.
