This is a kind of weird movie, since Santa lives in a cloud in space and fights Satan and his lackeys ... but it's still kind of fun. <br /> <br /> There's some genuine laughter. If all of them were intentional, it certainly is debatable. This movie is not good, but I can say that I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie about "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
