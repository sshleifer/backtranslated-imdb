If you have seen far fewer movies, this can be a big problem for you. If you've seen many movies, that's a joke. The performance of real heroes is portrayed very poorly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are many flashbacks and, most importantly, the fight scenes are stupidly done. New characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the heroes / heroines of Bollywood, you can predict what will happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they represent are terrible, especially since we have already seen this actor in a thousand other Hindi films. It's supposed to be a realistic film, but it does not show. There are moments when you ask yourself, you have thousands of army soldiers full of moving soldiers and the Pakistanis are bombarding them and none of their bombs hits them. Are the pakis really bad at pointing or did the director make them look stupid? There were only a few acting characters who were very good, but as far as the plot is concerned, the action is misdirected. This movie could have been short, if they took songs, flashbacks, stick to the point.
