I had to close it after about 15 execrable moments ... <br /> <br /> I hoped I could get better, <br /> <br /> What I saw was misinterpreted, directed and written . <BR> <BR> This film should never have been released directly on DVD, </ p> <p> The protagonist who is the top of a bride is from HELL, has a huge sculpture of ice on it, over there. She was such a revolting person that I did not even feel sorry for her. It ends up in a kind of paradise, and it was still repulsive, I left soon after. <br /> <br /> Eve Longoria portrays her and I hope to never see her again, she can not even act. It is simply simple. Paul Rudd an actor who normally can not do anything wrong was also in this situation. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (who is no longer a teenager) is also present, <br /> <br /> I like comedies, BUT not stupid people about stupid people.
