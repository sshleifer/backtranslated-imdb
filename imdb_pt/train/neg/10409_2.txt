As if the plot was not depressing enough, this movie shows cows being massacred graphically in a slaughterhouse for five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her childhood as a butcher. Weird thing. Then there is the central premise of the hero / heroine who goes and cuts his penis because he is too much at work and says he would have gone with him if he were a girl. Is this person a psychopath, a masochist, just a condemned queen who takes things too far? And what kind of traumatic childhood did he have? Only he was not adopted and had to live with nuns who at first loved him and then hated him because he was undisciplined. He tries to explain to us the reasons why he did what he did, but it is really very difficult to empathize. This sad and unusual self-destruction. Was it supposed to be funny? What was all this really?
