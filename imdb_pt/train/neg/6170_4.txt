This movie starts very slow, but when the action finally begins, it's a bit to follow. I could not understand why some of the events were happening, and many events happened before they were explained, making them a little confused. The only thing you really have for it is the huge amount of blood / blood you have, though most of the time the special effects are missing. Blood looks like red Kool-Aid. The skin rips like someone is stepping on a pile of sticks. Again, the story has a kind of amateurish feel, as the writer did not take long to perfect it. I feel it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was spent on the screenplay. I sincerely wish I had not seen it, not because of the blood, but because I feel I lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like extremely bloody movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
