if you did not live in the 90s or heard rapper EVER !! This movie may be good for you but any fan or anyone who has ever heard rap in this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where I said this is interesting or I did not know it. Another thing that bothered me was that it seemed that anything in his life that he did was very easy, there was no fight he made the prison seem easy, selling drugs, and even making rap was not realistic. I think if the movie was released in about 15 years from now, it could have a bigger impact maybe !!! good rap movies shake and flow, get rich or die trying not well known
