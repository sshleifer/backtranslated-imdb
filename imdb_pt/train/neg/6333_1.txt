I actually saw this movie in a theater. As soon as I gave the cash box my money, she said two words I had never heard in a theater, before or after: "No refund!" As soon as I heard those words, I should have waved goodbye to my money and gone home. But no, foolishly, I went in and watched the movie. This movie did NO ONE in the theater laugh. Not even once. Not even inadvertently! Mainly, we sat in dazed silence. Every ten minutes someone would shout, "This movie sucks!" The audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit in silence stunned and bored for another ten minutes.
