The director's version, which I saw, was too long for this kind of movie. Almost two hours are too long. If you have the choice, definitely go for the cut of non-directors. <br /> <br /> The main plot is almost not accepted, the film consists of the main part of several murder scenes, which are connected, but The feeling is that they are only shown to fill the film with violence. The connection is not revealed until the last part and the lack of context bored me long before I was there. Like a horror movie, it does not work. You never get the necessary feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and general disposition (the character is introduced, 15 minutes later the character is dead). This strong side photos is in the splatter part.
