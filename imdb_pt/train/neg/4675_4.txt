"Washington Square" is a flat, shabby adaptation of Henry James's little novel. In fact, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James' masterpieces. In addition, his simple, eventless story seems inadequate to turn it into a film (though William Wyler, with his "The Heiress," made a beautiful version of the novel in 1949). <br /> <br /> Either way, the movie completely betrays the spirit of this great American writer's work. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and clumsy, but she is still a smart and intelligent young woman, and she is not as naive as she seems. His attachment to his father is dignified and respectful, without morbid sides. Over three quarters of the film, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) seems to be just mentally retarded, poor thing. In the last quarter, she suddenly (and incredibly) becomes intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman, and everything. <br /> <br /> Director Agnieszka Holland added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when the nervous child Catherine has, well, problems with her vesica. The second scene, when we see in the background a kind of outdoor brothel, with prostitutes taking their clients behind tents, and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and reserved even by the standards of the Victorian era. I challenge anyone to find any rudeness anywhere from the thousands of pages of James' huge literary output. I really was particularly annoyed by these two scenes. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that a director needs reasonable freedom in adapting to the screen of a novel. But if a director completely ignores or does not understand the art of an author (here Henry James), I do not see the point of using his work to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The performance is appropriate to the film: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a movie not recommended.
