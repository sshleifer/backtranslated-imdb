SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie and I do not like it. <br /> <br /> First reason: annoying. Almost nothing happens, the women sit down and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, smoke marijuana, read magazines, take care of their sick friend, and cut the occasional dead body. CHORING !!!! <br /> <br /> Second reason: There are many things that have not yet been explained. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, holds them in a chair, and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do they know anything about illegal activities with regard to sick meat eaters? Why does he kill one and let others go? <br /> <br /> There is also this guy who at first I also thought he had a flesh and blood disease but he put his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting that he is not well What we we originally thought, never explained! How frustrating is that? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I find women irritating, uninteresting story, tedious duologue and non-existent action. Also, the cover art is misleading, since it makes you believe that this movie will be cool when it clearly is not. I rented this movie based on some of the comments made by others on this site, and although I respect the fact that some people may have liked this movie, I'll from now on make sure I've read more than two ratings on one film so as to avoid renting another movie, I am sorry to see.
