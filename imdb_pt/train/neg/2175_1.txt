Carlos Mencia continuously, violently, shouting with hatred "B ** ch!" in women it's like shouting "N ** ger!" in blacks, except that it is worse. Remember, the word B, unlike the word N, is the only pejorative term that is still associated daily with violence. "B ** ch!" is the last thing women hear before being raped, beaten or murdered. This guy is perpetuating violence using hatefully the language of violence. It looks like he might be a gay guy trying to cover up women so he sounds like a straight guy. How about all the white Nazi men in their audience giving the Fascist greetings while their stupid little white spoiled women whine at their side, clearly terrified to protest against this tide of hatred of women. Tee hee hee Bet Mencia does not believe or supports freedom of expression for them! Come on, Carlos? Do you want women to have the freedom of expression to slap you as hard and hard and big-mouth as you, or do you think "freedom of speech" is just for men to do crap on women?
