The first half hour or so of that movie I liked. The obvious romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute to watch and I wanted to see the inevitable happen between them. However, once the action shifted to the house of Ingrid's fiancé, everything collapsed completely. Instead of romanticism and charm, we see some parallel characters, extremely excruciating, arising that spoil the movie. The bridal son of the fiancé and the military attaché competing for the maid's attention seemed stupid-sort of like a subplot of an old episode of the Boat of Love. How the charm and elegance of the first part of the movie can lead to dopiness is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to recapture the success he had with the rules of the game, as the film is very similar, since the action changes to the ownership of the country (as in the other film). I was not a big fan of the RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HER MEN made me appreciate the art and nuances of the original movie.
