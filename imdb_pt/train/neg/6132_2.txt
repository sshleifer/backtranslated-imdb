As a kid, my friends and I believed that Gymkata was the most violent and bloody movie of all time. I'm not sure who started this rumor. It was probably born out of the frustration of 10-year-olds who could not see for one reason or another. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a perennial cable film late at night, and as a result I was able to make up for lost time. I must have seen scenes of this horrible excuse for a movie more than a dozen times, and I can always locate it for 1-2 seconds of time on screen. However, in addition to the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, rigid dialogue and outrageously difficult story line, the film has a few things going for it. With all that is bad about the movie visually, the sound is actually a lot of fun. Never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume! Canned kung-fu sounds are audacious, but slow and slanted music, and the almost 5-minute slow-motion scene are really weird. The city's pursuit of bloodthirsty villagers is not really as tense as it is annoying, and there are many bad wigs and extras that look at the camera and wave to make that train a little more fun. . Could it be directed to cult-classic status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
