I understand wanting to make a movie that is edgy and different. I understand the reviewer's previous comments that this is a misunderstood movie. My point is how this movie ended my first comment was: "this is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent" ..... she uses Daddy's money to make a movie that she wrote, directs, and pays for ..... obviously to close the film to realize that there was no character development and no direction as a beginning, middle and end ..... the voyeur part was good and bold , but what was the point? I saw a woman go to a house, find some photos, spoil the janitor, go off to the side on a very cold night (not believable) to check the noise and run over her homemade lover .... the movie ends ... .. Does anyone educate my ignorant ars ?? I really want to know what the point is ... what was the vision of the directors ... why is there no development of the dead lover? Why is there no background on the janitor? What is the purpose of night vision? What is the meaning of lipstick in the car? Why a dead janitor? Why tell us about a mental patient who escaped? What about the urn? Oh, and the lamp is the one that supposes to mean whose house it is? Territorial? Because? Why would the caretaker feel like it was his home? That aspect was never pursued ...... as for William Defoe ... I rented this movie because it was in it and known for nervous characters ..... write back and tell me what I need to learn ... .I'm just a mom in the middle of America who loves movies .... Chris ....
