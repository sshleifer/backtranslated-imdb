Lillian Hellman's piece, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with the help of Hellman, becomes a curious project of Paul Warks Bros. Paul Lukas, reprizing his Broadway role and winning the Oscar for Best Actor, plays a German anti-Nazi leader fighting the fascists, dragging his American wife and three children across Europe before finding refuge in the United States (across the border from Mexico). They settle in Washington with their wife's wealthy mother and brother, although a pensioner residing in the mansion is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends a lot of time at the German embassy playing poker. It seems time consuming for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize the heart of the material (the wise, honest, and direct refugees teaching the American mindless as the world changed suddenly), it seems a bit paternalistic - the viewer is literally placed in the place of relatives, being taught to. Lukas has several speeches in the third act that undoubtedly earned him the Oscar, although for most of the film he seems to do little more than go in and out, in and out. Like his wife, Bette Davis enunciates like no one and works with wide eyes to a good advantage, but the paper does not allow much color. Their children (all with divergent accents!) Are alternately humorous and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald plays no role as a wife (and the displeased texture she brings to the role seems totally wrong). The intention here was to willingly show us tactfully just because a man (from World War II) may be German, this does not make him a Nazi sympathizer. We realized that in the first few minutes; the rest of this tactful and tactful film is composed of exposure, defensive confrontation, and finally compassion. It should be a heady mixture, but instead is rather dry and inert. ** in ****
