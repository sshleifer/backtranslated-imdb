The extravagance of the potential film, defined during the 19th century, failed to produce. With big names like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there was no reason for the movie to fail. However, the film did not have an ending, had an excuse for a plot, and fell apart with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, reunited by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching side of the premature death of a mother and an absent father. The father, played by Finney, is a disturbed man, tormenting his daughter in both life and death. He believes that his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying below his social status. The actors tried in vain to recover what was left of the plot. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting precious time for those who watch with sadness. I give this movie a 1 rather than a 0, purely for the actors' attempts. Save yourself, stay away from Washington Square.
