Bobo, simplistic and low, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN FROM ANYWHERE) leads to nothing. <br /> <br /> This tale (just over sixty minutes) is not as inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a copy of Sam Raimi's RAPID AND DEAD, (his tribute to the spaghetti westerns) brought to a contemporary setting. In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone's character seeks revenge against the cowardly sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when she was just a boy, put into her hands the fate of her father (a brief participation of Gary Sinise); she accidentally shot him in the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by agile Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge against the villain Mr. Tojo (played with minimalist appeal by Shingo Tsurumi), who, when she was just a boy, put the fate of his father in his hands; she released the foot of the clutch, and the dear father was pulled and quartered by a semi truck. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is the fact that Tojo sadly bleeds Saki with ?? well, I will not spoil it for you in case you decide to watch it. <br /> <br /> In short, Saki? a pale imitation of the "unnamed man" of Clint Eastwood? city ​​tours? basically there's an auto shop and a tavern next to an American military base, so I suppose that's enough for a town? corrupted by Tojo, the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing his true self as a bounty hunter, Saki confronts the local gunmen in shootings whose choreography reveals more than a passing resemblance to the works of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, by the end of the movie, Saki endured her amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys, but does she stand up for the occasion? on your knees, in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending? and defeat all your enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Do not ask where she picks up the rocket launcher. Just watch by yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> Image quality is average for the DVD release. There is a quality granulated in several sequences, but overall this is not a bad transfer. The quality of the sound leaves a bit of imagination at times, but again, it is not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, it's a bad movie.
