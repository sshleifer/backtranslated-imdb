This was a disappointment - none of the nuances of the original. The British seem to be able to make a truly disturbing film without any of the exaggerated histrionics of the American version. The original series combined scary stories and performance subtlety with great attention to lighting and settings. I've watched the show many times and I'm still fascinated. <br /> <br /> Just another poor adaptation along the lines of the awful adaptation of "Cracker." Stay connected with BBC America or BBC Canada and watch delights like Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Watch the original Touching Evil, then look for "Wire in the Blood" to get more of Robson Green's truly understated and stylish performance. Hollywood needs to take a look at this actor!
