While watching this movie, I created a screenplay for a movie called "The creation of 10 items or less": Producer: I have good news and bad news. The good news is we can get Morgan Freeman! Writer: That's great! But what's the bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: We can only afford to hire you for a day. I think we'll have to find someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we hired him for one day. A movie is an hour and a half long. A working day is eight hours long. I can not see a problem. Producer: But ... he will have to spend time to get involved with the character. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we make him play a character who is essentially himself. Producer: But he still needs to understand his motivation and everything. You're not saying he has a famous actor who's making a low-budget movie, is he? <br /> <br /> Writer: Why not? <br /> <br /> Producer: This is ridiculous! But that's okay, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I think we have to put the movie in Los Angeles too. <br /> <br /> Writer: Of course. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script sucks a lot. We'd better make a living out of it. Just for the sake of it, ask the character of Morgan Freeman, Wal-Mart or Target, or one of these stores, so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs. Writer: Sure! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait a second ... what's this about a small cellar with an express "ten items or less" range? <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I think this is pretty weird. But we can not change the title now! <br /> <br /> I doubt my script really bears much resemblance to reality, but also not "10 items or less". This is a case of good acting but poor writing, and I hate to see it happen. When watching an independent movie, you expect it to try to convey some kind of message. I think they may have tried the old, tired message "let nothing deter you," which was made to death in much better movies. In any case, with "10 Items or Less", the only message I received was "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
