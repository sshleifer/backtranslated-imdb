This is probably the worst movie ever made, it's just for the name of Roger Corman is associated with it. I could have understood this in his early years when he had lower budgets, but nowadays there are no excuses to give birth to it! I'm a pervert from the movie "B" and from the point of view of certain people all the movies I love are set aside by "regular viewers", but take my word for it, the Vampire Club makes the top of my list of It's hard to imagine, vampires without fangs, the score is totally out of place, the sound effects are not effective, and finally Mr.Savage does not seem to know that he's in a vampire movie, the witch is too bad because he had a "not bad" career over everyone. Let me know that I'm hard at it because when I do not like a movie I usually forget that it's good side.
