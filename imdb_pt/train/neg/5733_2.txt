just watching it, me and my better half could not believe how horrible and badly acted it was. If someone thinks it's good then you should be easily satisfied. I really gave up one night out to watch this, everything has already been done before. IE. Hostel comes to mind, but at least that did not make you cringe with the bad acting and lack of plot, even old stuff, re-shocked, I read a lot about this movie, I even recommended it to my mates, my fault someone said It was good! no more bloody, horror or repressed in disgust that your average "horror movie" has to be said, please do not bother with this movie. get mary poppins. now this is scary! I'm out now, I go to the movies and watch something more frightening than that, Miss Sun maybe
