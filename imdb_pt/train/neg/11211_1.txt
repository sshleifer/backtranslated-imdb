There is so much wrong with this movie, but to summarize: Terrible acting - so bad it must have been on purpose. poor script - they may have had good ideas, but that was not the best way to present the story. ridiculously bad ending - in some cases, the end manages to save the movie, not in this case. If you can watch the whole movie, you will want to kick yourself in the end, because the end is not worth the wait. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It was full torture sitting in this movie, I would have appreciated someone warning me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing better to do. Even so, you will regret having passed through indescribable torture.
