This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any movie starring Kevin Costner). Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this movie, and his supporting actors did not even look like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he just can not transfer his talent to this movie, which probably only has two strained laughs across the image. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched movie yet, avoid it like the plague. Go do something constructive and more interesting, like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts, I give 2/10! <br /> <br />
