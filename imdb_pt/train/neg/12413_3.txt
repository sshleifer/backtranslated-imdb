I'm not going to say that this movie is horrible, because I've seen worse, but it's not even decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I really could not figure out what was going on and where things were going. When the movie ended, I was scratching my head. I watched until the end of the credits to see if they had anything after them that might clear things up, but once the credits ran out, that was it. I felt as if I had been shaken from one weak spot to another throughout the film, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> The development of characters is very superficial. I could not figure out when someone was angry or had a grudge against someone. I could not tell if half of the characters were supposed to be drunk, stoned, mentally disturbed, or if they had a bad actor to portray. This movie seems to be based on stereotypes (to their credit, they're hard to avoid when you're making a movie about a rock band singer), which should facilitate character development, since many other films have already illustrated the movie. Suffering from an abused child, or the trials of a heroin addict trying to clean himself. Stereotypes are easy to describe, which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotyped characters. This movie, on the other hand, uses stereotyped characters left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be discarded without any explanation. I think that's fine because so little time was spent developing the characters that I really did not get a chance to meet any of them, so I really never missed any of them. <br /> <br /> And last but not least Sadie was singing. It's awful. The music that sustains her is not awarded, but is usually drowned out by the screams being released from Sadie's vocal chords. I swear there's a point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought I would have to turn it off during this howl. <br /> <br /> As a whole, this movie is confusing. The characters are poorly developed, Georgia's acting is hard and woody, Sadie's character is ripped from one bad situation to another with no history or explanation. The music was unbearable, and I can not think of any good reason to see this movie unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain.
