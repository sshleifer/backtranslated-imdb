This movie is not as good as everyone thinks. the actors are low-level and the story is very comical. I respect fantasy, but the Lord of the Rings is fantasy ... Conan ... it's fantasy ... THIS IS NORMAL HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why do they include this Splatter language, this makes it all worse. The only good thing is the cinematography and the work of the cutter.
