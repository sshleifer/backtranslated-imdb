My wife and I really had high hopes for this movie, but it was a big disappointment. It was a Native American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails everything he tries, eg. fishing, hunting, obviously, he submits his family to his wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but in the process he lies several times to his son about several obvious things. Words can not express how bad this movie is. The children and the wife are very real, which makes the movie even sadder. I do not understand the humor ... unless you enjoy laughing at other people playing the fool. I do not understand how this could have been for awards. Save your dollars, it's not worth the rent.
