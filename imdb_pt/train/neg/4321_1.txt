This was the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took my two young children to see this. It was the darkest and saddest plot - the family has no money, mother loses her job, father is killed in the bank, bank robber steals family car with two children in the back and after high speed chase, leaves the bridge and drown them in Rio. Mother is left alone. No wonder your Christmas spirit is over. Christmas angels do not rescue children who drowned, and Santa Claus does not bring back dead parents! I thought this was the worst message to send children. Better tell them that there is no Santa than show them a movie like this!
