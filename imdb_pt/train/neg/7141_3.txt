Okay, so I got into this movie without really expecting too much, I imagined an action movie similar to The Fast and the Furious. Some good cars, some pretty girls, a bit of a decent storyline. Unfortunately I would have to say that this was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Do not get me wrong, the cars were cool and the girls were fine, but the way they rode the movie was just plain bad. The story never made you care about the cast and the movie just seemed to be assembled. So overall, this movie was not the worst thing ever, but if you're looking for a movie to go to this weekend I'd go through this now.
