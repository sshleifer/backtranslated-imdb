Wow. The only people who value this positively are Carpenter apologists. I know many of these. The guys who will watch John Carpenter crouch down on celluloid and pinch a movie and proclaim a masterpiece of terror. This "movie" sucks. It sounds and sounds like a porn (good God, the soundtrack is horrible ...), and has unsatisfying pornographic performance, which is shocking, because normally Ron Perlman is really a great actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter was thinking while doing this. Probably "Beans, beans, beans ..." until someone fed him and wrapped them in a blanket for the day ... They do not say anything about the abortion debate, when they could have had a very interesting central theme (such as religious anti-abortion fanatics feel when they are the devil's baby?), but they preferred that Ron Perlman and his sons acted and killed a lot of people and made doctors horribly try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl. Not a single person in this episode or what you should leave unharmed. It's awful. Like Plan 9 of the horrible Outerspace. Like, good God, please, somebody would turn it off before I got horribly dirty. Try to watch this and The Thing on the same day and your mind will implode.
