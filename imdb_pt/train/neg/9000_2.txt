When I rented this, I expected what "Reign of Fire" did not provide: a confrontation between modern technology and mythical beasts. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got a movie "the monster hunts stupid people in remote buildings." , with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. Bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave a 2 was that in theory there could be worse movies. In theory.....
