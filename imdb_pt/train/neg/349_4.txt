A pot - boiler if I ever saw one. An alleged thriller that borrows "Time to Kill", "Silence of the Lambs", even an inverted "In the Heat of the Night" with a small reverse homicide, to the "Strangers on a Train" played, he fails abysmally where all the above have, to a great extent, succeeded. That is, the delivery of emotions. The plot seems condensed from a larger book, making plot evolution obvious and uninvolved, while direction has no rhythm and enthusiasm. To curb any compliment, a major upheaval had to be delivered along the way and here it also fails palpably. Connery is clearly slowing down in her old age, barely bothering with her American accent attempt, and besides, she seems too old to be Hope Lange's husband and the father of those damn sons of him. He still has a father-in-law who looks younger than him. Laurence Fishburne barely has a chance to inhabit his role and you're confused from the start about whether he's a bad guy or a cool guy. Someone once said that flashbacks should not lie - they do, confusedly, here. The rest of the game is merely median by a reasonable cast in their subscribed stereotyped roles. The supposed climax also managed to roll, leaving me firmly entrenched in the back, not as it should have been the goal, the front edge of my seat. Disheveled Hollywood movies mediocre doing for sure.
