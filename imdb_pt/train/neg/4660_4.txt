At first glance, this gives the impression that it will be a laughable blaxploitation film, and contains moments in which it moves in that direction. However, the basic idea of ​​the story is much stronger than one might expect, and it is a respectable effort to portray racial issues in the Army of the World War II era. The recognizable cast is unpredictable, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams doing better. Stephen Boyd, however, stops shortly after turning his thick mustache into an overturn. <br /> <br /> Obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in production values. The locations are great, the effects and the action are weak. Imagine if "Rescue of Private Ryan" had half the peloton being killed in exactly the same way as Vin Diesel's Caparzo (except that we could see the shot because the effects can not cope with it), then Hanks, Damon and the Burns in a jeep and fired five Germans for the climax. However, the outcome, with the heroic soldiers not receiving respect for their achievement because they are black, and the racist captain of Boyd being affected by it, is compelling, as are the sequences of the character of Turman writing in a diary of his imagined exploits if soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines. <br /> <br /> In short, "Black Brigade / Carter's Army" was unsuccessful. But it's a respectable failure, not a bad joke. It could be remade as a very good film and, as it stands, it's an interesting endeavor.
