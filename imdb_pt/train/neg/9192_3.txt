I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. This seems to make sense, since most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's "Dead" trilogy to "28 Days Later". However, upon seeing it, you can quickly see what this movie really is. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's a video clip that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more bloody. There is no horror here folks. Only a few decently staged action scenes that soon become tiresome because they last ... and last ... and last ... and you get the feeling that maybe you played the DVD for 3 minutes but not , that's how they actually made the movie. It is a pity. I think anyone could find a better use for $ 7 million in the film industry than to make that lump. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, but again, they were heavily used and they became boring, since it was the same maneuver over and over again, with only a different character. <br /> <br /> Also what is annoying ROYALLY is the filming splicing of the arcade game. I played the game. Sucks. So why did they put it here? Oh, that's true, this is not a movie but a music video, and it's a poor thing in that. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence / gore and profanity
