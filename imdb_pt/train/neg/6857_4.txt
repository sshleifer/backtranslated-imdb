This "crazy comedy" seems very forced. In fact, the actors try very hard to make a script essentially bland. And as a result, it's not going anywhere. The idea of ​​a woman finding out she was pregnant after a quick divorce is not so funny. And then, when Cooper runs away with the baby because he does not want him to be adopted, he seems terribly dull and it's really hard to make it a comedy. It's really a pity, too, as the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself bored with all the fuss. Since Cooper has made so many good comedies, I recommend you look at them.
