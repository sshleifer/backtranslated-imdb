For the Beatles' well-informed fans, the main value of this film is just to sit and identify flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, missed events, exaggerated events, missed people, mistakes in the timeline, poorly assigned quotes, of place songs, and (shame shame) incorrect instruments and other boners I just can not think now. The failures come fast and furious, so you have to stand on tiptoe. <br /> <br /> I did not give a "1" mainly due to the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors (Rain band) give it all (Lennon's character is credible and does a good job ). In addition, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at one point and that counts for something. <br /> <br /> So, see for fun, but please do not take it as it historically does.
