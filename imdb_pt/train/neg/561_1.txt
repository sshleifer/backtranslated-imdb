Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it is - unfortunately - worse than you might think. First of all, the plot is stupid, it has no meaning. The script is full of intentionally funny dialogue. The audience was laughing many times. And the suspense is very low. Actors play more or less, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good times but also some terribly bad acting moments. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "I want to **** you" and it seems like, let's say, gently, a very mature woman acts grossly and is not sexy at all. This erotic tension of BI1 has completely disappeared. From the technical point of Wild Instinct 2 is a mediocre film - better than the typical straightforward DVD, but with a much smaller lever than the original film. For example, the crazy joyride scene is poorly made. The director of Wild Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his shows. The script is made by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas. The film seems cheap and poorly edited at times. I'm sorry, but my first thought after I left the theater was, "Why did not they make this movie earlier with original talents behind the success of the first movie?" All for the whole original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in popular cinema. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. He had the best performance of Sharon Stone in his career. It had this specific style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an unintentionally funny, misdirected film and a sure winner of the Razzie Award in many categories. It's a shame they made this movie.
