The movie starts off with an intriguing scene, three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar. They are all making up some outrageous stories. As the film unfolds, it turns out that the most scandalous story is true. However, in addition, the film is not very interesting, except for the scene in the bar and the scene in which the main secret is revealed. This revelation happens only half the time in the film and, frankly, there is not much left to be seen. The rest of the time director is lingering in an abandoned Russian village god filled with old pitiful and scary ladies. Of course, these are fascinating and somewhat shocking images, but to admire them continues for a long time, sacrificing any possible plot or character development. I have found this film as another example of bad or lazy film, where, instead of trying to make an interesting story, filmmakers focus on strangely fascinating images and on some almost unrelated stories (case in point - meat merchant story) leave the viewer to find out all the odds and ends. On a surface has artistic appearance, but in this particular case is nothing but lack of talent.
