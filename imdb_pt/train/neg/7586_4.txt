Summer Holiday is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness, and deservedly the Broadway musical adaptation of Take Me Along. With the exception of Stanley Steamer's music, none of Harry Warren-Ralph Blane's other songs are worth remembering and even that is questionable. <br /> <br /> It was soon after the release of this movie that MGM let the Mickey Rooney go and I did not think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old playing Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was just too old for the role of the seventeen year old who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, the one here, Killer McCoy. a remake of Robert Taylor's A Crowd Roars, Andy Hardy's Love Laughs and Words and Music. In all of them, Rooney was part of an adult. Even in the movie Andy Hardy, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy returned from WWII. Why he was in this Louis B. Mayer just knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney's bad cast makes Summer Vacation even worse, as in the original Ah Wilderness the emphasis is on the character of the father played by Walter Huston. And on the Broadway show, Take Me Along, which won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Great Touched Uncle Bernard Uncle Sid, played by Frank Morgan, and this is the central character. <br /> Gloria DeHaven joins Judy Garland as Rooney's sweet and sweet girlfriend and Marilyn Maxwell plays the girl who gives Rooney an adult education. In the original piece, O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but that was the Hollywood of the Code, so all Marilyn does is get the young Rooney out. <br /> <br /> A lot of really talented people had a hand in this story. one and they do their best, but summer vacations disappear quickly in a cold autumn.
