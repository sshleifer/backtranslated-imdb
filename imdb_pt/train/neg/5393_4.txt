I am a fan of Shakespeare and I can appreciate what Ken Branagh did to bring Shakespeare back to a new generation of spectators. However, this film falls short of conveying the overall intentions of the play with ridiculous musical sequences. Add that to Alicia Silverstone stumbling on the dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About Nothing) and other poorly-scaled roles, all of which amounts to unbearable resistance to see.
