For those unfamiliar with c.S. Forrester's book, this movie should be interesting. It is colorful, well represented and portrays the high adventure, but for those of us who know the original stories it is terrible. I could hardly sit with it. <br /> <br /> For some reason, screenwriters seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film. But why do writers rewrite history instead of just adapting it? In this case, the writers have outdone themselves. Just a few examples: There was no riot in the Renown. Officers took the ship after the half-insane captain went completely insane when he fell through a hatch - for implicit but never given reasons. There was no court-martial. The court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor does Colonel Ortega's wife. Hornblower himself was never on the ship either on the ship or on the coast. There are many of these manipulations in the Forrester story. <br /> <br /> Basically, I think the repeated use of the flash back device film harms the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why do screenwriters have to ruin a good story?
