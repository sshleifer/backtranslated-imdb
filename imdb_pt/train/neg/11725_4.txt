STAR CLASS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is in hiding on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist. Then he is approached by the agency again to travel to London to take another chance. His target was arrested there and under strong police protection - but they do not want him to just capture his man - they want him to be withdrawn. All goes well, but then the mission is ruined and when a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, blame falls at the feet of Dial. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young woman named Emily (Eliza Bennett), who is dealing with her own problems and becomes her unwitting partner while trying to clear her name and find out who betrayed him. This last Snipes direct to the DVD escapade came out of nowhere with a minimum of publicity, even for something so small (I do not remember seeing advertisements or trailers for him anywhere). and after Snipes' story about Duff's DVD efforts, this may have seemed like the Snoop Dawg would tell you to fall like it was hot. But I felt compelled to give it a chance anyway. He is not among the worst, but not as high as the standards of some of his best (the Detonator, 7 Seconds, says it all, really) too. <br /> <br /> That is, at best, slightly suspenseful, with a minimum of action, naff it all in the way of legal dialogue and Snipes not exactly at its best in the lead role. Similarly, in a leading supporting role, it is quite clear that the Dance only appeared for pay as well and this is usually one that none of the cast will scream through the hills on any of their resumes. <br /> <br /> He says very much that, in the end, the only 'contract' that keeps him interested is when the Snipes contract will end with Sony and with that, the end of any other secondary action movie. **
