I bought this movie from the Rogers Video store for $ 2. I like a good B movie from time to time and I realized this looked like a good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is very cliche "of the 1970s" and it's pretty cool for that. Unfortunately, the plot is difficult to follow and not much happens in the movie. In fact, I hung up after watching it for 45 minutes and realized a week later that I should watch the whole thing, no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The movie has good points, but you have to wait and wait and wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you're in B movies, this may just be for you, just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens, and I did not mention too much history either ... <br /> <br />
