First, let me know that I saw this movie on TV and dubbed English - which may have spoiled the atmosphere. However, I will evaluate what I saw and hopefully will keep people away from this version. I found this movie terribly boring. The entire atmosphere of the film is lost with the dubbing, leaving the slow frustration of a chase film. I'm sorry, but the worst sin of the movie in my book is being slow except when the film about philosophy. I did not see any deep philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I missed something, but I have to tell you how I see it. I evaluated a "1". What can I say, taste oriented in the USA, maybe.
