The heart of this movie was in the right place, no matter where your brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a spoof to the "Airplane!" (two years before the fact - good progress.) of what happens when vegetables, or in this case fruits, attack. Through all sorts of magical films (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching the tomatoes off the screen, people throwing basketball-size tomatoes at the actors on the screen) , the tomatoes actually attack everyone in their loose hands. <br /> <br /> So it's up to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies that I do not want the government side to save the day. Of course, there's a nosy reporter (Taylor) who shows up at the most difficult times, dancing and singing army soldiers, Japanese scientists vociferous voices, a guy dragging a parachute and a samurai sword ... and, yes, the San Diego Chicken before it made it big. <br /> <br /> The jokes here are not so great. In fact, you could probably improve upon seeing this. Some of the dialogues are unacceptably bad ("Please pass the ketchup" - there's something to say in front of the tomatoes) and, as far as "Puberty Love" goes ... well, I can not blame the tomatoes for wilting. listen to it. <br /> <br /> What is good about this? Well, I liked the theme song and the initial credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone since it was very well executed. ... that's about it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. It's not a "murderous" comedy, but try. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
