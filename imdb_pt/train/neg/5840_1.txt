Well then. I just watched a bunch of movies - all with varying degrees of quality. I was not sure which one I wanted to review first. Then hit me like a rats-bag: Rodentz. Let people know about Rodentz. This monstrosity does not sing to anyone and is painfully dull to sit on. And it's about mutant mice killing people. Yes ... really original. "Food of the Gods" or "Willard" anyone? Those were better than that, and that does not say much ... <br /> <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Ok, here's the story: In the lab, the scientist and his brave assistant are experimenting with rats and their labs . is in a shitty neighborhood and lousy building and the idiot friends of the lucky wizard come drunk and everyone becomes food for the ravenous rats and almost everyone dies and oh yes there is a giant rat that looks bad but is dead , the end . There, all at once sentence! Spoiler, you say? Pffff !! I beg to differ! The second we all realize that there is a giant mouse, we all know that he will eventually die !! ** Ending with SPOILER ** Here is the collapse: The Good: Well, I watched for free, but for everything world ... hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> I did not hurt, it did not help: <br /> <br /> - Hmmm ... well. the blood was decent. - Very average cinematography. <br /> <br /> - The CG rats are not as bad as they could have been in some shots ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - E in other scenes, CG rats were pathetically cheap. Look, if your movie has a low budget, you might not want to trust CG. Lesson to take seriously. <br /> <br /> - The acting is extremely poor. <br /> <br /> - The characters are beyond the uninteresting - we have a mixture of clich√©s and none of them is so well done. <br /> <br /> - Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Done before - many times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - Giant rat looks like a fat man in a poorly designed bear costume - that was funny - but it's not funny enough to give this movie any value. <br /> <br /> - Dialogue withdrawn, unrealistic and boring. <br /> <br /> - All college students are drinking Tequila from huge plastic milk jugs - and yet they do not seem to be drunk for more than a few seconds. Way to stick with continuity, guys. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. Simply terrible. Worse than you know. It's not even ridiculously bad like, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now these movies are crap you can enjoy. Even if they make you dumber. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: The end of the lame action movie, complete with unharmed heroes and blast. Because it did not look anything like the rest of this monstrosity-but it was still a drug. 2/10 Character / Makeup: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (I was taking care of my child occasionally. during the movie, so I may have lost but supposedly was there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (mean of time) Copywriting: 1/10 Direction: > <br /> Cheese: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Watch only if you like horror movies based on rats and worms . Wait ... Check this out. Do not watch. It sucks. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
