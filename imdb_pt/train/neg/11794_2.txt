An original image of the mediocre Sci-Fi channel. A bit squirmish, but not too much. The U.S.S nuclear powered submarine. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep beneath the icy ice near the North Pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks she invented a way to communicate with the monsters, but does not stand a chance for vague reasons. Also among the crew are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could have been a little better if the eels / monsters were not so funny.
