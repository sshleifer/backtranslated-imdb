Redundant, but again the case. If you like the former SNL comedian and his antics (in this case, Schneider), then you should go. Basic comedy Man's life is saved by having several animal organs transplanted to him. Unfortunately, it takes on the characteristics of each animal. Former survivor Colleen looks very well here now that she has no open wounds on her legs and a little makeup on her face! D
