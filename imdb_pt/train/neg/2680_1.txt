Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I would like to see. I also did not like the movie when some Australian smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling and Claire Danes. I would not go to this country, no matter what after that movie. In fact this movie smells bad. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I tolerate. I would also prefer to stick to the United States. After I saw a little of the movie in the theater, including the false accusation of drug smuggling, I left the theater and received my money back because I can not tolerate this movie. If you are going to Thailand to find someone who might be a drug smuggler, forget it!
