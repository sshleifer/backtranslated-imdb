This is a very bland and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most vibrant pieces. I can only imagine that the intention was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to Shakespeare before. In doing so, however - by making each line clear and obvious - they drained the game of life and turned it into a flat caricature. Somehow, it's really annoying - a very difficult feat given such wonderful material. <br /> <br /> The performance is forgettable at best - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, do not do so well. April Shawnham's Hero is a moody airhead that often causes shudders. Jerry Mayer's Don John is a meaningless cartoon character on the Whidash Snidely level (though Snidley was a lot more fun). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) is not in this version unless he was disguised and had his name removed from the credits. Given that the producer, Joseph Papp, is basically a theater god, this production is not only disappointing but also a scratch. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it. Watch Branagh's Much Ado instead - his version is overflowing with vitality and humor, not to mention wonderful performances.
