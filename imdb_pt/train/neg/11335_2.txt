I recently watched Belle Epoque, thinking it could be wonderful, as it won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film. I was a bit disappointed with the predictability and simplicity of the film. Perhaps the conflict I had was that from the time the film was filmed so far, the plot of a man falling in love with beautiful women and eventually falling in love with the good girl was done so many times. In addition to the predictability of the plot, some scenes from the film seemed really out of place with the plot (eg, a certain wedding event). Sometimes the film was a little boring in its ideas and, in relation to the Franco era, the film was set and the Church. The only thing that the film had for this were the cute moments, the scenery and the character of Violet being a strong, independent woman during periods when women were not really associated with those characteristics.
