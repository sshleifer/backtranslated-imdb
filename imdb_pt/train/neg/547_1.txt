The full title of this film is "Waqt: Race Against Time". This is a race that no one can beat, but you can certainly cut your margin of defeat by missing out on your precious "waqt" in these bakvaas. This movie was awkward and manipulative in a way that made the K3G look honest. That made my credulity difficult. It was ridiculously stupid in its history, and deserves to be ridiculed for it. <br /> <br /> It's not as awful as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend it. Stupid, senseless, with a ridiculously OTT performance by Amitji. The central "plot" is another nasty example of the cruelly manipulative propaganda that infests so many "familiar" BW films. If my father, who raised me and whom I love very much, treated me like Big B did Akshay, I would shoot himself. Not to mention the trivialization of terminal illness.
