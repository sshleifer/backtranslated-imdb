Writer / director Peter Greenaway cements his title as suitor to the Supreme Lord of the House of Art with his latest nasty self-indulgence exercise, 8 ½ women. The film follows a rich Englishman and his son in their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction, as they attract and blackmail women (guess how many) to join their personal collection of concubines. Think in any possible way this premise may be offensive, and it is likely that Greenaway has done so. The female characters are little more than a catalog of fetishes for the two protagonists to participate. There is the obsessed by Kabuki Mio, the always pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who has a fall for farm animals. Giulietta does not have legs and uses a wheelchair, she is the "half woman", understood? Greenaway vehemently denies all charges of misogyny, but if it is not so, then what is it? <br /> <br /> The film continues to eroticize anything and everything related to Japan, a continuation of themes from their snores. (less sexist) 1996 film, The Pillow Book. But where The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ women get excited and exploring. Greenaway's work is insipid and arrogant in its fetishism, and the only person who probably likes to watch is the author himself.
