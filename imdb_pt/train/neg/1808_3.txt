In his 1966 film, "Blow Up," Antonioni made his hero question the truth against a backdrop of young British demonstrators. In putting such questions against a fabric of youthful hippy movements, Antonioni questioned, intentionally or not, the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for a cause when what you think is true can be a lie? On the other hand, the film said that we should actively fight and challenge what we see precisely because others may be deceiving us with false images and false truths. Although the hippie aspects were the more cheeky parts of "Blow Up," they created a good texture and gave the film more meaning than it could have had. It was a very cautious and mature little film. <br /> <br /> With "Zabriskie Point", Antonioni throws out all the ambiguities and subtleties of "Blow Up" and enters in full hippie. The result is a movie full of bad metaphors, stupid ideas and heavy storytelling. How could anyone, who throughout his career have shown such restraint and intelligence, do something so silly? <br /> <br /> The film begins with a good series of close-ups as we watch a group of radicals discuss the meaning of the revolution. Suddenly, a man (Mark) gets up and leaves. He hates the rigid and orderly nature of the revolution. He acknowledges that, while revolutionaries fight for freedom, binding to this militant cause is effectively giving up their freedom. And just like Jack Nicholson in "The Passenger," Mark just wants to be free. As such, Mark buys a gun and goes alone. He accepts no one's orders. When police invade his university campus, Mark shoots a guy and runs away. He then flees to a nearby landing field, steals a small private plane, and flies into the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia and contrasts it with the ruthlessly capitalist cities with their modern billboards and appliances. He sees the desert as a sort of Garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark meets Daria and quickly falls in love. Antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. Free from the constraints of modern life, these tree-loving and radical students can now celebrate their individualism by beating the sun. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Mark dying and Daria fantasizing about blowing up the mansions and imposing. houses of the wealthy capitalists who killed him. It's Antonioni's challenge to his audience. Take the guns, pickets and explosives, he says. Tear the walls before they trap you! <br /> <br /> Of course the film had no effect on its audience. They recognized "Zabriskie Point" as just another self-centered commercial attempt to be radical. A kind of commodified radicalism. She looked like a liar and a liar. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the movie is pretty stupid. Antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world, and the fat cats that exploit you, you must flee to the desert (Mark) or actively fight against the system (Daria). Alright and good. But while artists constantly warn us about these dystopian nightmares, they are unable to show us how to effectively manage change. Like the end of the "Fight Club," nihilism and violence do nothing. In the real world, social change tends to be instigated by humble inventors, stimulated by small technological advances. I mean, what freed women more than contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A really bad movie. The problem is that Antonioni does not really believe in rebellion. He is a quiet, contemplative man. An introvert who seems to have made an extrovert film simply to get more worship from the counterculture that embraced his earlier film, "Blow Up." As such, "Zabrinskie Point" appears as a very pretentious and stupid movie. It's essentially a 50-year-old man who says, "Look at me, I'm a bold rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many films in which the public is encouraged to fight against the "system," but they all fall into one of four categories. In the first category you have movies like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". All this shows that the lives of freedom fighters end in failure, although in each case the "spirit of revolution" survives. The message is that you can not effect change, but dying or failing, the optimistic notion of change survives through martyrdom. Essentially, we must continue to fail rather than give up hope. <br /> <br /> So you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down", which simply encourage you to explode. Drop everything. Explode everything. Everything is a lie, so you can come out with guns in hand. These films are generated by angry and reactionary feelings, not by any kind of common sense. <br /> <br /> So you have the category "escape instead of fighting". Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre. Films like "The Passenger," "Red Desert," and "Badlands" show humans fleeing worlds they do not like and forging islands or peaceful havens for themselves. Both directors are pessimistic, in that Malick destroys their islands and Antonioni has its islands offering no feeling of happiness or solution. <br /> <br /> So you have the fourth category. Films such as Donnersmarck's "The Lives of Others," Ashby's "Bound For Glory," and Kubrick's "Mechanical Orange," treat artists as a force for change and rebellion. In these dystopian worlds, in which all are content to be slaves of the state, it is the unbridled creativity and freedom of will of the artist / criminal who keeps the system under control. By simply existing out of the herd, you create waves. Your comments, actions and critical look challenge the status quo. As such, the Donnersmarck film has novelists and artists undermining Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has Alex the artist / criminal fighting the Nazis, painting the city in blood and sperm.
