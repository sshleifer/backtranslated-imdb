This is for Zatoichi's films as the "Star Trek" movies were for "Star Trek" - except that in this case each of the originals was more fun and interesting than this great and brilliant remake, and also better done, if the substance is more important than the surface. If I had never seen them, I would have thought it beautiful but empty; since I had, I found the style inappropriate and the content insufficient. The idea of ​​reviving the character in a larger, softer production must have sounded good, but there was no sense in it except the hope of making money; it's just a show, which most often fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and can not take the character to any place he's not already. (Also, the actor was not at his best). I was hoping to see Ichi at an advanced stage of life, in a story that would make him come out with grace and draw some conclusions from his overall experience; this only repeats excerpts from other films, seasoned with more sexual and physical violence. Not the same experience at all.
