I'm a fan of Columbus, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to watch Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very lacking. The original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed far in advance, even years earlier than the modern detective shows today. But it was fun to see the crazy patterns of the sofas and "modern" electronics, and, of course, the compelling suburban mood that triggered the sale of modern art. The high tech home is a version of Tomorrowland for Jetson or for Disney, and it's fun to think of writers inventing those "outlet devices." <br /> <br /> If it's sunny outside, go play as there are much better Episodes of Columbus. Still, we should be grateful for the cable TV that these episodes are being broadcast.
