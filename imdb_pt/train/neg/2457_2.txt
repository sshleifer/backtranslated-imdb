Some people do not like the animation. Personally, I think the animation was remarkable when this movie was made. There are many older cartoons that I love. My problems with this movie are not the animation, but basically the way it was built. The characters are all ... well, fools. And for this movie, they should not be. Apparently, everyone in LOTR has a limping problem (to begin with.) The way they acted on me generally annoyed me. My two sisters and I were laughing for most of this movie. I think if a lot of people had seen this before they saw the younger ones, they would not have gone. I'm glad I rented this and did not buy it. There are some movies that give me a headache. This was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, although it's at the top. Or down below, depending on your vision.
