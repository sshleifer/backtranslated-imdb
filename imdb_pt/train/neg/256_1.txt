What? Should Jamie Foxx be funny? Does he really think it's funny? Well, it's funny to see his confidence in being funny. The man has no identity whatsoever ... I mean, you can immediately see who your idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he tries very hard to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that he does it bad, unequal, and what comes out are some parts where he looks a bit like Denzel with those mach√µes. t attitude, and then abruptly happens to be Martin Lawrence, the funny and clumsy-silly comedian. There is not a personal touch to it all, I mean he does not contribute anything to the personality he tries to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say personally. He really is Mr. Dull-boy in person. <br /> <br /> I was really looking forward to Hollywood, and the black community in America would find someone better to get into stardom, like Don Cheadle for example, but maybe pathetic Jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old.
