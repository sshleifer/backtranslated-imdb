Lynch. Man has some really great things! He knows how to upset us, then rewards us by making us think in different ways. This, however, is completely different. Dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, obtained with 99% stupidity. I may have laughed once, but somewhere near episode 4 I started to watch in rapid advance. There was nothing missing. I felt relieved when it was over, and that's part of the point with this series. It's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, with annoying animations, voices and sounds. But recognizing this and its other absurd qualities still does not make the Dumbland worth it.
