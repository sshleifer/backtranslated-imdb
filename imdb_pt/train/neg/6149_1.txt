I'm going to spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before swearing all his work. Having sadly dealt with Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now involved in many of Lucas's characteristics. How else do you explain your fury of disasters? His only useful film, of course, was "Willow." Everything else, including that, is very dependent on surface litter. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can not even have semi-intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard so caught up in his imitation qualities of Spielberg that he will be quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old saying: "Love conquers all, even sickness." Too bad for Howard that Lynch has gone through all the subtext with more skill. Even Disney did better than that. Ron even has fun with the possibilities presented by imagined realities. <br /> <br /> Howard's commentary range is simply horrible. Do not even rent the DVD. <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Dud Cinematographic
