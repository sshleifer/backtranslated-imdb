Worst DCOM I've ever seen. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. That was just plain bad. The acting and story were fine, but the effects were SUCCESSFUL! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! The only good fight scene was between brother and Shen. That was probably the only scene I was excited about. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie very annoying and the movie kind of ended abruptly. <br /> <br /> I'll give four to Brenda Song, who is a very funny actress and a fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
