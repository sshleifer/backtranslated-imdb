I watched this movie for two hours and I have no idea what it is. Someone was murdered or maybe he did not and maybe someone did it or maybe he did not. Did that bring back memories of the good old days (bad old days?) When all Canadian CBC movies were stinky. Lately the stinkers have been the exception, but this confused mix of fashion feminism, mind-bending flashbacks and babbling dialogs make up for lost time. I have never found Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This film continues this good Canadian tradition. Not easy to watch. Maybe the fashionistas at the Toronto chi chi cocktail parties pretend they like it. We, people in the boonies, are a little less pretentious.
