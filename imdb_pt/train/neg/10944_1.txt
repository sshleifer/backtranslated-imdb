Now I've seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I have seen (and enjoyed) all of Jean-Claude Van Damme's films, including one in which he is his own clone, both where he plays twins, and all three where he is a cyborg. I actually own the one in which he plays a stylist and has a fight in a truck full of duriums. (Hey, if nothing else, it has a big ass and you can almost always see it. With DVD, you can even pause and zoom in!) That's why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad , makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. The fights are bad. The stunts are bad. FX is bad. The acting is spectacular, terribly bad, most likely showing the worst performance of all the actors in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and this is actually saying something. And I would be willing to bet that everyone involved in this movie sucks in bed to begin with. ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> He can be unintentionally funny, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are a congenital idiot or very, very stoned. I was able to sit alone because I needed to watch something to distract myself from rinsing the cat urine out of my clothes. <br /> <br /> It did not help much, but it was better than nothing. A point for Ron Palillo's participation as a gay incendiary.
