A perfect little atrocity ... I doubt that a single shot lasted longer than the reglamentary-MTV 4.4 seconds. I regret it even worse than in the version of Kusminsky (a reminder: he managed to trick Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But, hey, the rich got what they deserved. Heathcliff, dark and taciturn, reduced to the state of a golden angel, fragile and angular that Catherine presented as a chubby, melon-breasted, meek and weak Linton is a pio tone, and innocent Isabel becomes a character of Sara Michelle-Gellar of Cruel Intentions. Eddie Bauer, 15, and the owners of Abercrombie and Fitch, take notice. This thing was made for you. It's a video clip of an hour and a half, where everything is given to you; you are saved from the uncomfortable need not to try to understand the complexity of the characters, but even the initial shock of your actions. The actors tried, but, as I said before, they were misunderstood. Decent photography, but the issue is at the level of high school TV production. I beg of you all: read the book, or even the cliff notes; note previous versions, including Kusminsky's; but stay away from countless future reruns, during which you will not receive the benefit of the premiere without commercials.
