Although I had seen "Gymkata" in a theater in '85, I could not remember anything about the plot except for vague images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the ending. After reading some of the other reviews I picked up a copy of the newly released DVD to once again enter the world of Gymkata. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this is one of those films produced during the 80's that would go directly to the video today. The film stars starring gymnast champion Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, recruited unexpectedly to infiltrate the country of "Parmistan" to enter and win "The Game," a bloody Khan-sponsored sport that encourages its people shouting what sounds like " Yak Power ". The objective of the mission involves the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in the martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never talks or leaves home. Once trained try to blend in with the locals, wearing a bright red sweater with dashes of blue and white. Needless to say, Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of Parmistan, en route to a meeting with Destiny, and the Game. <br /> <br /> Star, Kurt Thomas was poorly served by director Robert Clouse, with whom he seems never to have been on the set. The script called is just this side of the incompetent. See other reviews for the many howlers everywhere. The city of the crazy ones has some good moments, but ends up being ruined by the bad edition. The end ... meh. There is still the germ of a good action adventure here. A version of Hong Kong with more visceral action and faster pace may even be very good.
