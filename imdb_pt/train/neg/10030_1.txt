Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the film. <br /> <br /> This type of movie is made for the flop. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces movies like these that are useless than C-grade movies. Or even some C-level movies have a better and enjoyable story than Tashan. The much-promoted and very confident promoted Tashan barely bombed the box office he certainly deserved. <br /> <br /> In my view, this is the worst film ever made of the honorable track of Yash Raj Films. How have they dealt with such a heavy project for the new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no real sense of making an action movie? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi's ways of doing as Dhoom, but he suffered after all. The action scenes are more alike than comic books or cartoon films made to deplete the public. <br /> <br /> History also loses in its meaning and substance to tenderly win the hearts of the public. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of the southern star of Tamil, Rajnikant, in his bodily languages ​​and worldly expressions. I'm not a fan of either Saif or Akshay, but Kareena's prize should finally have gone to Saif's hand instead of Akshay. Only from the starting point did I expect, but in the end displeased me with the truth of the climax. Saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in the middle. In any film, the final must be judged with the entire characters of the whole story and the prize or say that the reward should be given to the one who deserves credit. And Tashan loses this way, and unexpectedly failed to become a success. <br /> <br /> Akshay has nothing new to show off his comedic talent here, but still remembers his previous films. He must seriously form a new image for his fans that would impress them again and again. Between Saif did a great job on Race, and now he's back in his hilarious nature again through this movie. But it has developed completely in the field of acting. And last, but not least, about Kareena. She looks really hot in a bikini dress, which some complain when she got too thin. But I do not think so, instead she got slim. Yes skinny !!! is a good factor for a woman to attract older (or, say, male) people. Beside them, it is good that Saif's son, Ibrahim, appears at the beginning and lasts as the young Saif. I hope he will now also lean on the target to make acting like his career. <br /> <br /> Those who like this Tashan are either mentally immature or still want to go back to childhood, or say they want to be admitted. in an asylum. Thumbs down to debutant director Vijay Krishna Acharya, who mismanaged the project offered by Yash Raj Films. In the future, he must experiment and study the script with a minimum of 5 years before entering practical directions. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I do not like to rate good stars for this kind of junk movie.
