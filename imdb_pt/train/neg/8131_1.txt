Unless the title is kind of a spoiler for the transformation of the wife (the demons! Spoiling everything for us). Anycase, if this movie was not made for TV, it should have been, it's so incredibly low budget, underscripted, underact, and hits every 70s clich√© except disk. No one is friendly, and you can neglect what happens to anyone in this. Eminently forgettable, except for poor performance.
