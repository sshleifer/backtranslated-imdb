No wonder the majority of the cast wished they'd never made that movie. It's just ridiculous and embarrassing to watch. Bad actors reading cheese lines while bright classic showroom cars continually circle a restaurant that looks more like an attraction than Disneyland. Students fight with the insane principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue. The Watts Riots with a cast of ... ugh ... 10 ?? Dermot Mulroney tries not to choke while he gets a look at Mary Hartman with the most annoying smile since 'Mr. Sardonicus'. Noah Wyle reads the lyrics of Bob Dylan to the evil teacher with a swinging pointer and a very bad facelift. The virginal drunken Rick Schroder sits on a child rocket on his last night before entering service. Silly and giggling girls dress in leopard stretch pants, walk on the set of 'Shindig', sing horribly without a key, and actually succeed in the music world. And who wrote this convincing dialogue? "I go to Burkley and I use flowers in my hair" .... "I think I found someone to buy Woody's dick!" ... "These people are 'animals'!" "These people are my 'family'!" As the Shirelles sing "Mama Said." Oh brother, what a mess. which is not funny either.
