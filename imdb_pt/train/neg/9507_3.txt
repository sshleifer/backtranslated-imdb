I always get frustrated with movies that were obviously written by a genre. Especially when they obviously do not do enough research to find out when something not only does not ring true, but rings are downright fake. <br /> <br /> The scene I'm remembering is the one in the bathroom where Jack tells his football teammates that he impregnated Diane. No way, way, or a guy would never cheer on another guy getting a girl in high school. They might cheer for the guy to have sex with the cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first football team that heard about it would not be in a urinal. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this movie did not. Do not take yourself so seriously, and it was not horribly bad, but come on!
