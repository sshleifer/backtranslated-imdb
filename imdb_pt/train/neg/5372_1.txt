We wonder why this picture was made: the plot is unbelievable, if not ridiculous, the characters (experienced lonely against the young, quite fascinated) quite predictable, the end completely obscure and impossible to understand (perhaps after several visions) but you would have to have a masochistic tendency towards this, the idea being that you have to read the book to fully understand what it's all about) and the acting is bad. Was the basic idea to show what French filmmakers are capable of doing, as well as Americans in the genre that include "Seven" and "Silence of Lambs"? If so, it is a total failure. However, it was a great success (and has a kind of cult status as the first serial killer French film) and, it seems, considered as a good product to export. Weird.
