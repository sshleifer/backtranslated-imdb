Having searched for this high and low movie, I actually found it when I least expected it, playing Sundance Channel early in the morning. Because I've been incessantly looking for a little vanity project that Chuck Barris was made during the last few years of the TV show, I have no idea. The movie is just awful. The part with script that deals with a week that is. Of course the highlight of the film is seeing the real artists who were "too hot for TV" or rejected for some reason or another. This part is still horrible, but grumpy, which was fun in its own way. Now that I've seen what I've been looking for so long, will I watch it again in my life? Resonantly NOT !! Do yourself a favor and just see the MUCH better "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or find old copies of the program. The acting girl where there is only licking lollipops provocatively was fun, but having to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon's flash the audience probably made me sterile. In retrospect, I am very happy that this was a big failure, because if it was a huge success, there could have been a "The Beauty Show for $ 1.98" and that my friends would certainly have brought the Apocalypse. > my note: D
