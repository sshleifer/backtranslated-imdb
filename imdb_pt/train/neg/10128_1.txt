He was my hero all the time until he went along with {if you can call him a movie} I went to the show to watch and leave and not just asking me for money back, but I asked for twice the money I is how bad my hero performance and hole thing was ............. I can not believe that Steven Segal's career hit so low that he was reduced to making 4th rate movies with 5th category of secondary actors. I watched this move expecting to see him drunk on some people the way he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo stroke between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks, something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is unbelievable as a movie, and even if you excuse the visual, and had read this story as a novel, you would wonder why you got the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal makes the moves and looks like he's just doing it because he's under obligation. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he does not appear. <br /> <br /> I hate to repeat comments from other people, but using images of scenes and scenes in-flight aircraft are pathetic. The condition of these cut scenes is unstable and the scenes themselves seem to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder movie showing President John F. Kennedy being murdered is firmer and cleaner. <br /> <br /> My heartfelt opinion is to say that you do not waste your time watching this movie, it is not up to the standards of your work on the man glimpse or eliminate the wounds. I read a review that said that the film had a budget of $ 12 million (Segal was getting 5 of that) and that the movie was still on budget. I must agree. <br /> <br /> No wonder this is a straightforward DVD movie, since no conscientious movie owner would do this movie.
