This movie is beautiful to watch, but it's like watching a really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) does not make any sense. But it's very "artistic." Many scenes of half-dressed actors struggling and looking deep into each other's eyes. Many artistic shots through the windows and with people outside the frame. Murmuring and people wandering gloomily. Small persistent close-ups of faces and bodies. When you get to the trio on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. <br /> <br /> It should be about the parent-child relationship, but you're just wanting the two to just stick with each other and get it over with. If you've always wanted to see bad Russian pornography without any money, your wish was granted.
