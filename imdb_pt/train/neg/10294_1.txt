Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> So characters without personality do not develop. <br /> <br /> So the end never comes because there is no beginning and no means. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful pictures that are not beautiful because they are not allowed because this movie is not even there. There is no "is" in this movie because there is no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialogue or point. There's nothing! <br /> <br /> There's a good point: there's a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is such and the film itself is such that watching it is not worth it, so if you're really interested, I suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something. You will have all you can of this movie without all the fatigue, headache and impatience. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
