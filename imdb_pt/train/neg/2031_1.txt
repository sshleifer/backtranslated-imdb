While William Shater can always make me smile at anything he shows up, (and I particularly love him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is about glamor and dancers and screaming and jumping up and down. > <br /> He has no millionaire intelligence, none of the talent of Deal or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show is about dancing and stupid things to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I watched, of course, just to take a look. I watched for over 45 minutes, so I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The best part was with William Shatner dancing on stage. It's a hoot !!! unfortunately, this show is not going to do that. <br /> <br /> That's a given
