Much re-edited and often confusing, the original version of Man On Fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the years that passed have not improved. This is the kind of movie that money-savvy producers do to get attention and everyone just does it to pay for their alimony or their drug dealer, with Scott Glenn's bodyguard coming out to save his 12 years. one-year job, the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - made everything better, the action is slow and sparse and only John Scott's exceptionally excellent score (part of which appeared on the last Die Hard roll) makes a positive impression . A case in which the remake (made by Tony Scott, the director's original choice for this version) is an improvement.
