What Hopkins does with this effort as a writer and director is giving us the feeling that we do not know anyone in the movie at all. However, maybe there's the problem. His film has a lot of ambition and its intentions are obviously complex and very deep, but they are so impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who someone is, so there is no investment on our part. <br /> <br /> It could be about a screenwriter mingling with his own characters. It is? Perhaps. By this, I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean there's no telling. The Hopkins movie is an experience. On the face of it, it can be argued that it is a pretense screenwriter who, at the exact moment of his encounter with destiny, realizes that life is unpredictable and / or success is a blind chance, since he is thrown into a "current" of collisions between points in time, dreams, thoughts and reality. However, it is so incessantly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion, even for the tiny, rather rudimentary extension of allowing us a connection with its characters. <br /> <br /> I did not think the nippy and an extravagant school of work and camera editing with unstable machine gun speed shut me down, but, reflecting on the film, I'm beginning to realize that it had a lot to do with that. There are so many movies from the past decade where cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other technical devices that spoil the atmosphere. I suppose, in this case, it is justified that the goal is to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams. However, I knew almost nothing about Slipstream when I watched, and I left the same way. And I just do not care, because Hopkins made no effort to make us care. There are interactive films, and there are movies that sit in a rocking chair and knit, unaware of its presence. Slipstream is the ultimate.
