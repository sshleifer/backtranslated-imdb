The Tooth Fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch who lures the children to her house to get a prize for her loose tooth and then takes their lives. The first few minutes introduce you to the beginning of 1949 of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switch to the present day. The horror plot worn out is practically saved by solid acting. They could have done it without the Hammond brothers and some other scenes, but overall the bloody scenes were bloody, but quick, which had a minimizing effect. Eye drops are very good for both sexes. Camera work is good. Dialogue is fair, but extravagant. I expected the movie to be a skeleton, low budget, slasher with few redemptive factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
