Make no mistake, this is neither a horror nor really a movie. I strongly advise against watching this 82 minute failure; The only reason he deserved a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a turnaround, a hint of surprise, a plan to emerge - but no. <br /> <br /> Characters take an erratic course in their actions and still do not have time to develop - thanks to parsimonious editors and downright embarrassed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful state (bringing the rock montage adolescent). The only thing that could have aggravated would be to add the perishable ethnic 'companion'. Their encounters with obstacles (whether human or physical) are brief, confusing and totally meaningless. <Br> Chris Pine struggles to stay above the surface while being drowned by a misery of a light cast. Lou Taylor Pucci could not be drier if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves scouring the Navada desert. <br /> <br /> Watch 'The Road', watch '28 days Later ', watch TV during the day ... anything but that; I beg you. Suffering boredom, unlike you may be led to believe in the movie, this movie is not cure.
