Hey HULU.com is playing the Elvira night terror show on their website and this movie is theirs under the name of Monsteroid, good fun to watch Elvira comment on this crap movie .... Have fun with bad movies. Anyway, this movie really has very little value apart from seeing how the '70s were bad for horror movies Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just bad movies. Avoid this, unless you want to laugh at it. While you're at HULU, check out the other movies that are yours now, there are 10 episodes and some are decent movies with good graphics and production, and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection.
