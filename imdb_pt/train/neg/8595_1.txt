Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are excellent actors, who can certainly face any acting challenge. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' offers only one for the actors and for the public: do not fall asleep during a tedious, predictable and unimaginative story. <br /> <br /> "Watching the detectives" (2007) tries very hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely misdirected and embarrassing on the verge of complete ridicule. <br /> <br /> After a third of the film still nothing that can capture even the most willing audience, such as friends and relatives of the director, is even suggested, not to mention really happening <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone who liked it pretended or pretended like Neil's ex-girlfriend when he showed her an old black-and-white movie that she could not care less about. 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' is not even close to category B, is between Q & R, as -Questions? and - Repress the questions! The director knows what he's doing! Well, if your goal was to upset the viewer to death, he did a great job! <br /> <br /> "Watching Detectives (2007)" was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, bur Please do not let it be a waste of your time! <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
