I liked the first reviewer's comment much more than the film when I saw it in a second-generation theater in the early 1980s. I was impressed, then, with the thought of creating fantasies modeled so closely after Tenniel's drawings. But for me, the cast was largely wasted, their personalities muffled by the masks, while the direction I consider to be unusually static, and obscure photography. The score scored at the time was a nothing, which means "not worth sitting once." <br /> <br /> Even so, I would also have a chance to take a second look.
