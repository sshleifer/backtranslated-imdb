This crap may have been acclaimed for 60 years, but it's one of the most racist films ever made with Native American Indians played by white men. Right-wing Republican James Stewart was a real-life racist, as was his friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart had actor Hal Williams fired from "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-lived series that mercifully failed) just because Williams was black. As if that were not enough, this movie is very old and boring. Watch "Dances with Wolves" instead of a less racist view. Stewart was in his forties when this horrible movie was made, and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a pedophile chasing after 16 years -released Debra Paget. I'm surprised that this has been allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
