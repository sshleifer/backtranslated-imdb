I'm not sure if I'm referring to those who labeled it as a nasty video or to the director ... "Devil Hunter" is certainly a bizarre horror film. <br /> <br /> The plot is a loose goose combo of top films like "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run". Chick is kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages'. The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies walking around in tribal-style Halloween party costumes. And savages vary in race, from white to Asian, from black to Hispanic. I suppose Franco just grabbed anyone who seemed a bit ethnic to this joke. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this film has an extremely minimal content, without real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. It's not funny. I can find something to like in just about any Italian or Euro-trash film; This one just dropped. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, kids.
