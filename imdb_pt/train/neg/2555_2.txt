This movie is possibly one of the most horrible horror movies I have ever seen. The length was not long enough to include a good storyline. Besides, the way the adoptive parents died was just ridiculous. The mother dies suddenly falling into the shower after stumbling into an action figure, and the father is shot by a police officer? I can see where some originality might have been what they were going for, but it could have been better. Besides, the tackiness of everything made me want to stop before it was over. After hearing all of Lucy's name and finding out it was 'Lucifer', I wanted to gag. Yes, it is interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's the male's name. Must be given to a male character. All in all, the movie was boring, and could have used a better plot.
