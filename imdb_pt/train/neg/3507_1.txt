A low in human interaction was achieved by the Maysles Brothers with this film. Remember, you, who used words like "masterpiece" when reviewing this movie, do these Maysles shiver not only to drive to the Hamptons and happen to film some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor and pathetic people, they had to fund their project (and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project). So they made friends with the two extremely vulnerable women. No meeting of minds here or real consensual participation. These miserable Maysles smiled, kissed, did anything to get the Beales to cooperate, and then exploited them as badly as they had ever been done. One would like to think that these traffickers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the filming process, given the pre-planning, actual footage and editing took a long time, and his goal had no provisions to really relate to the Beales as humans. A film of exploitation perpetrated by the most vile of people. As time accumulated, the reputation of making movies became seriously flushed by what they did here. His reputation as human beings is execrable. That's what people will remember them. Grotesque dealers.
