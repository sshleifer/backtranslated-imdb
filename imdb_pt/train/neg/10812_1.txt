What a pathetic movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste much time commenting on this. I'm still trying to get back the two hours I lost with this. <br /> <br /> Let me just leave you with - Shaq has no being an actor or singer. He is totally untalented on both discplines. It's a shame that substantially more talented people squander in community theaters and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player for undeservedly participating in movies and cutting CDs. Much of this movie film was the pathetic non-talent who is Shaq.
