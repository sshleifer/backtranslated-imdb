What on earth has become of our dear Ramu? Is this the same man who made Sarkar, Satya, and Comapny? I refuse to believe. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, it clearly jumped from the high cliff that rose, giving the industry some of the greatest works of all time. This movie is made to fall like a brick. I was shrinking to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit down because I could not have gotten my car out of the parking lot before the others left. Otherwise, nothing would have made me sit beyond the break. <br /> <br /> This movie is nowhere near Sholay. It does not even come anywhere near a mile. I believe that Ramu certainly loves The Godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic work. I read the interview from Ramu a few days ago, in which the interviewer said that Ramu does not sleep more than 4 hours a day, which also does not happen. I completely agree with this now, since his lack of sleep probably hurt the film. <br /> <br /> There is no power in performance. Amitabh Bachchan does not even look scary. He looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers I've seen before. Nisha Kothari, Ramu's favorite, did a fantastic job on Sarkar because she did not have many dialogues (in fact, none if I remember clearly). She opened her mouth in this film and found a place in history. The new guy who plays the role of Jai seems to have that impetuous look, but could not handle the role of Jai. I can not go on ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too great for me to manage now. <br /> <br /> I promised myself throughout the movie that I'm going to watch the original Sholay one more time to see that it's still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Horrible movie. The media and critics will cook Ramu's goose. And just to remind all the readers one more time, I'm one of Ramu's biggest fans, and even I can not dismiss him for that act.
