Impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I did not like the novel, but this movie did the worst! Bad music, even worse actors (besides SRK, of course, even if he can not save the movie), and it does not make much sense. The director makes everything look very confusing, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he's trying to make it all look surreal, yet credible. Well, he can not even do it. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to lose, do not watch this movie, please! (Saying this to your well-being!) Keep looking, you'll find something else to watch!
