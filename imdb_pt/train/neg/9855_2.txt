Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of fantasy. However, this movie is not for me. Many absurd arguments attempt to support the claim of this film that the dragons possibly existed. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries, but fails to investigate them more deeply, which could give some credibility to the film. The movie uses CGI (cool!) To tell us a fantasy story told about the life of a young dragon. This is combined with the flash-forward style CSI-popular-show-TV to make it look like something scientific, which it definitely is not. In many cases, the arguments / clues are exaggerated. In some cases, the clues used to show that dragons possibly existed, flew or spit fire are simply invalid. To see this only makes me have cramp on the toes. Even a fantasy movie needs some degree of reality, but this movie simply does not. In short: it's a pretentious fantasy documentary-CSI, which is not worth watching.
