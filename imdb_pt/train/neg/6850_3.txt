As a girl, Hinako moved away from her small village to Tokyo, leaving behind her two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised to discover that Sayori died when she was a teenager. She meets up with Fumiya and they are horrified to learn that Sayori is being mysteriously resurrected on the island of Shikoku. Oh boy. I rented this because I like Asian terror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a cool actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruity". This film is silly, boring, poorly filmed, unimaginative and, above all, unsuspecting. Kuriyama has a minimal screen time as the resurgent Sayori, and his character is little given to work.
