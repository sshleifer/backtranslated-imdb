Dieter Bohlen, a notorious composer and producer of somewhat useless pop hits like "You Are My Heart, You Are My Soul" felt the need to tell his story - and graciously decided to hire a ghostwriter. The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less a diffuse image of it. He did not deny that he is a selfish idiot, but the whole story has been distorted to fit his self-image. No word he probably beat up his ex-wife and she ended up in the hospital. However, it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as a member of the jury of the German version of "American Idol" - especially his unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> This must be the end of the story - really. In the hype of the mentioned "Idol" TV show called "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (abbreviated DSDS) someone must have had the terrible idea of ​​making a movie out of the book. The result is "Dieter - der Film" <br /> <br /> I've rarely seen a movie that tries so desperately to be funny and to fail so completely. None of the jokes really hit the point. Naddel's voice and manner of speech were getting on my nerves, though the voice of Verona should have done more. Obvious, childish, predictable and time-consuming girls destroy any motivation to watch this movie through to the end in a few minutes. The content of the film is a sloppy adaptation written by a ghost writer based on Bohlen's idealized and sloppy memory. They could have used that freedom to do almost everything. It was meant to be a satire, but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself ensures that the whole film is nothing satirical. <br /> <br /> No wonder it was considered bad for a movie release. The probability that this stuff was rotten in some files was pretty high until recently, when the current DSDS season turned out to be a mediocre hit. With the "friendly" help of the biggest German newspaper "BILD" and the desperate situation of the RTL TV station to have something on the show while the show still unbeatable "Wetten dass ...?" is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived on television - unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with a lot more fun and a story really worth seeing. /> <br /> Therefore: 2/10
