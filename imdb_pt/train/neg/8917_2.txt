The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzsche's work and personality, psychoanalytic techniques, and the history of Vienna. Take a well-known genius that you have not read, describe it as insane, include crazy doctors to heal it, a couple of pretty women, play your part played by an actor with a huge mustache, let all the characters talk to the most strong accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another prestige figure that has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mention some words used in genius works, exaggerate everything you can, particularly music, and you're done. Audience, please stay away.
