This movie is funny and painful at the same time. The "Cinemagic" almost gave me a convulsion. Despite what they imply, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical procedure. It was "developed" as the result of an accident, and they used it because they disguised the fact that their "monsters" were so stupid. I also do not think it's a coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink." <br /> <br /> This movie is good for a laugh if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days at $ 200,000. It's fun; at least I can say that. The bat / mouse / spider is the highlight.
