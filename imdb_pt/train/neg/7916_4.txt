Where to start? What about the wrong synopsis: "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epoptologically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the sinister Weapon X program." <br /> <br /> His epic violent past ends up being exceptionally nonviolent. <br /> <br /> Your relationship with Creed is so undercover that it is difficult to understand how they have any connection. We are thrown from a point of the opening scene that shows them as children running, to a montage of war scenes for which they fought throughout their long life and finally to the present, where they are part of a hardcore government team. of murderers. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that shows their relationship as brothers. Nothing complex is established for us to believe is authentic or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the film between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt. We're thrown into a novel so fast that it ends before you can blink an eye. Having just introduced the character, the Silverfox is killed about fifteen minutes later. We wonder why we should worry about it. Who was she anyway? <br /> <br /> For a crucial element of this story of weak revenge, the novel is surprisingly unexplored. Was rushed in simply because it was necessary. <br /> <br /> Curiously, when Wolverine discovers that his love is dead, he leaves her in the woods to rot when he leaves to find Sabertooth. Being romantic is that he was out of character for him, but needed to serve the plot in taking out a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> As for the X-weapons program, let's just say that after the painfully disabling. Wolverine procedure is in place. Eventually, he arrives at the home of a suitably old but extremely loving couple. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not frightened when they find a naked, sweaty man in their barn. Is not it wondering what fate awaits them? In the earlier films and in the comics, the main reason why Wolverines' amnesia tormented him depends in part on the fact that he was said to be cruelly evil and knowing that this was the case. .. did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle to fight against the villains of the world alongside his teammates? As suggested in X2: X-men United, when Stryker gives up some of his secrets, it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he knew of the evil deeds they committed together. This movie sets the team reasonably well, but they do not do much. Without disturbing violence, without ruthless deeds, they only torment some natives in foreign lands during the ten or fifteen minutes they are on the screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not a bad man under Stryker. Instead, he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother Sabertooth, who consequently was the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was. Eventually he just leaves them all together. <br /> <br /> No conflict of duality here at all. <br /> <br /> Idiotically REMOVING that conflict of character between good and evil DAMAGING history immensely. They may have given him rubber claws as well. <br /> <br /> There were a ton of other errors in this movie that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the cruellest Deus Ex Machinas that ever hit a script. <br /> <br /> Magical memory erasure bullets. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Apparently, they are the only thing that knocked Wolverine down. However, this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to knock him down with bullets and bombs that certainly would not work on him. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that it has tried to focus on Wolverine. while playing on a ton of other mutants that did little to nothing. Interesting characters were mere windows and did nothing for the story. Most were in the movie for 5-10 minutes at most and yet you find yourself wanting to see more of them and less of Wolverine. Fred Dukes (the Blob, but not the comic version) can punch a missile launch tank with little or no physical damage to it at all, but a simple headbutt of Wolverines metal noggin is enough to overshadow him? Cyclops optical beams (which instead of being concussion force are now more like lasers) can burn through buildings, but when fired directly at Sabertooth, it simply crushes it to the ground without damaging its clothes . Adamantium trench coats anyone? <br /> <br /> Mutant (gravity-defying) Gambit, instead of using his signature cards, is turned into a kind of crazy acrobat. In a poorly edited scene, he is unconscious by Wolverine ... then, surprisingly, a few minutes later, he is on a roof toward Wolverine. As he regained consciousness, he fled a few blocks, climbed into a building, then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the midst of a fight that is a mystery yet to be explained. <br /> <br /> Some apologized for it. movies weakness, claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak in character and heavy in the flash. The idea that this movie is a comic movie is superficial and superficial because of this fact is incorrect. <br /> <br /> The source material for the comics, the true origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen. It does not cover your past or treat the reader as addicted to computer graphics. It's a well-crafted story and although recounted and readjusted over time, it began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie would be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have this magic weapon? <br /> <br /> 4/10
