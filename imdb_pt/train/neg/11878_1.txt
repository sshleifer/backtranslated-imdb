Really, when the time comes, this movie is not funny. Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of the funny, and yet he thinks it's hilarious. The plot about sending the 17 cards was good at first, until Josh's "look at me, I'm crazy" approach began to infest every scene. The Judas Priest joke may have been the least funny thing I've ever heard of, and that's saying a lot, as it has strong competition from all the other jokes in the movie. And as for the incredible overuse of "Debaser" from the Pixies, I have only one thing to say: what did the Pixies do to deserve such a fate? What did someone do with Josh Kornbluth to make him write / direct / produce / star in such a terrible movie?
