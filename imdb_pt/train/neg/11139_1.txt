There is not much to say about this movie, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> The acting and the dialogue are far from decent, the hybrid werewolf story is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you would not want to see. He's so amateurish that it makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the DVD was in the Extras. The gag roller. Everything else just wastes time and money. I hope no one buys this, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from it.
