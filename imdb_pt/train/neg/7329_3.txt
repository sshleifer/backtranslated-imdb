After watching this movie, I felt the need to vent a bit of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous actress, currently underestimated and Max Beesley was quite charming in "Kill Me Later". The story, though not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. None of that mattered, though ... in everything. <br /> <br /> I do not know what your deal is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent as a director. She slowed down the footage, accelerated filming, reversed the footage, used strange camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion of quick cuts, jumped back and forth on the timeline, and filled it all up with a " modern "nasty. I can not remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a movie. Your ego must be huge to throw away the acting and the story and put your direction in front and center for the audience members to take notice. He's crammed up in their throats. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in Kill Me Later that show what could and should have been. Unfortunately, when things started to look promising, Mrs. Lustig was rummaging through her movie school tricks and mixing things up again. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you can tell that the film really had a good heart. 3/10
