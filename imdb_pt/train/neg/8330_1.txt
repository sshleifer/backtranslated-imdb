I saw "Shiner" on DVD. As I watched, I thought, "This is a really bad porn movie without porn." I also thought, "Who wrote this has some real problems." So I watched the director / writer Carlson explain his case as a special feature. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> The emphasis of the film is on two alcoholic losers who beat each other to leave. They are marginally attractive. There is frontal and total nudity. These factors probably explain that the film is being watched. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing element of the film is the gay attack and the subsequent gay attack of the same victim who tries in vain to take revenge on his aggressors. , the two drunken losers. Not only is the subject treated absurdly and technically poor, but the acting is horribly bad. <br /> <br /> Then there's the boxer-stalker theme. This is really insane, not just absurd. This handsome boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a boy of a fleshy mother who works in the parking lot of his academy. That's in LA, remember. The boxer is so traumatized that he appears in the stalker's house, undresses and gets excited in the process. <br /> <br /> Well, all I can say is, why is a boxer in the heart an exhibitionist so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It just does not make sense. And, unfortunately, some psycho-dynamics really make sense if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts rarely make any sense. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community. Well, he might be right, I suppose. We may never know, since such a minority would be so dysfunctional that it would hardly be able to organize itself enough to reach an obscure gay film festival or a DVD store, the only two places that could find this turkey. Thank God for that.
