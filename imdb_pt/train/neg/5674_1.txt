My God, what's going on? a Uwe Boll movie and positive comments? Wow!! <br /> <br /> It is good to note that most of the positive comments come from beginners to Boll's work. I myself, as I have stated in Uwe Boll's previous reviews, only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually do something good. I mean ... SHOULD HAPPEN A DAY! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Seed is not that day. I'm not sure where to start the failed attempt at a horror movie that Seed is. The thing to remind people is that all the sick people in the world are like that due to having witnessed several sickly acts in the video or on the net ..... or so, Mr. Boll believes. I still can not for the life of me find out why scenes of actual animal abuse and murders were needed in the first 10 minutes of this movie. I understand the concept that Seed (the killer) is a sick man and likes to see these things ... but he can not understand why Mr. Boll thought that putting real scenes in the movie would work. Maybe it's hitting us? Hmmm ... well, I, at least, am not scrupulous and can handle anything in the movie. I do not do this, I think the use of real images of fun animal cruelty in the smallest. If you were trying to shock me, it did not work. It just reminded me how the world was messed up because such things happen and also why Uwe Boll can continue making movies. This kind of context may have worked for films in the 70s / 80s (cannibal Holocaust), but not for the current market. With that out of the way we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap sensation like BloodRayne 2. You can simply say that there was not a huge amount of money floating around for production . As usual, Mr. Boll does not mind making a decent story as we're treated to annoying police shots watching several videos of Seed victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends in a quick unpacking of the victim. It's all very boring and tedious. I will not comment on the child's scene as it is laughable and just another cheap 'shock' factor. <br /> <br /> If you can sit through the first 25 minutes, then you will be treated to the cops crossing a very dark house to pick up Seed. The lighting here is horrible and Uwe has the old 'I'm not using a fixed camera' fiasco that he did with BloodRayne 2. Watch the cops die in stupidly growing ways to the point where Seed gets caught. This scene is soooo stupid, you have to see it to believe it. The cop really tells Seed that he could have shot him. For some unknown reason, the cop does not shoot him. Since Seed is a patient who kills both children and adults, you would have thought at this point in the script that meaning would prevail. <br /> <br /> From here we are treated to a stupid execution scene, followed by the cops burying Seed alive (and they know he's alive ... why not shoot him in the head ????), followed by Seed getting off the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the policeman's family. <br /> <br /> What I am trying to convey to you here is that it is simply STUPID! Not even Hollywood stupid horror .... just stupid. Uwe Boll can not direct ****. Anyone with an ounce of taste would agree with this statement. Anyone who watches this movie and finds it interesting in any form or format needs to take a serious look at yourself as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again we are treated with a piece of UB misdirected, directed, illuminated, produced and scripted.
