Whereas John Doe apparently inspired the creator of Kyle XY, I expected his pilot to be very interesting. However, I probably had very high expectations because I was pretty disappointed with that. First they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of ​​showing his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public area. So, after that scene, I started to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse, because none of the other characters was presented correctly. They focused too much on John Doe, which made the story much less intriguing. I was also a bit disappointed with Dominic Purcell's performance because I discovered that he did not make a believable John Doe. Another problem was the history of the police. It really felt like déjà vu and it was not a pleasant feeling. This leads us to the group's worst issue, the episodic format. I could already see the fillers coming one after the other. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I was very disappointed with this and did not recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was I understand better now because the show was canceled. In a way, I have the impression that he has lost his target, developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity. It's sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. The quality of production was also very good and the foundry correct. But I'll never know if it got better, probably not because I do not want to watch the next episode.
