Decent enough with some stylish pictures, but the tiny budget makes things difficult. <br /> <br /> I also got the impression that they were trying to shock you with some of the weird stuff on the site. <br /> <br /> If you like anime in specific things like cyber city and AD police, then this can increase your street. <br /> <br /> But basically your low budget box is still not totally devoid of your own style. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack of some grunge / punk / post grunge bands. Worth checking out if only by the soundtrack.
