Watching "Kroko" I would like to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this movie: main characters flat - absolutely no development, for example Kroko, the problematic German metaphorical child, remains a pure metaphor without any capacity for positive involvement, despite several hypotheses to do so. Uninspired actors, non-evolutionary plot. I think the film tried an environmental search, but it was not successful: the camera looked more unstable than motivated. The images were low contrast, gray and dark - I'm sure, but the components did not contribute to a convincing impression of the social milieu. The story had a certain potential, but it could have made a good story.
