This movie is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first is Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict or any other important detail required to portray a story. This 'movie' is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his manly side and the 'tough guy' he really is. I wasted my time completely watching this movie. The best part would have to be the final credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have cut my thumbs and thrown them to the producers. Whoever, in good conscience, gave Toby Keith the chance to perform in a feature film, is obviously on the same level of mind as him. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, possibly could be the only thing you regret.
