"Little Man", now on DVD, is a failure of the Wayans Brothers. It is the story of a criminal lesser than a dwarf played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a woman's purse after an assault. He and his partner Tracy Morgan prepare the brilliant plan to disguise Marlon as a baby and plant him at her house. He then goes through all kinds of "Home Alone" or "Child's Play" as chaos to retrieve jewelry and be treated like a baby. I was surprised at how low the mood was in this movie. The jokes have been made elsewhere so many times that they are not funny or funny. I almost think the movie could have been funnier if they did not use CGI and used the little actor that Marlon's face was glued to. While watching the deleted scenes (minus the CGI), this actor was funny in a Mini-me-like way, but they chose a different path. Some special appearances and Tracy Morgan do some funny scenes ... Spend your rental rate on Borat if you want some real laughs nowadays. Http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
