had some lovely poetic bits but it's really just an artsy-fartsy-together toss with no direction or resolution. How do these people go through film school? Who gives them money to do this crap? could have been a lot more, great lead actor, and I've always enjoyed Fairuza Balk, but come on, the alternative rock metaphor of just looking vaguely unable to find anything appealing is so tired, and it sure is not good movies. the director needs to go away and live life for a long time and not go back to the camera until they really have something to say. this is like the school of making spaghetti art on the wall, juxtaposition of a lot of sincere images and hope of hope as the poetry that emerges. this can work, if the director really has some kind of vision, or has a brain that knows when it is in the presence of potential, but here is just filling in space with no consequence. I felt the lazy ending come moments before it hit, and I was screaming "your lazy bastard" on the screen when the credits appeared.
