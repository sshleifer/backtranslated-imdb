"Captain Sky and the World of Tomorrow" (an incredibly incovenient title) is simply a bad movie; no heart, no deep ideas, nothing very special. Yes, CGI backgrounds seem interesting, but the result is that the whole thing is filmed in a soft, irritating focus. In addition, the movie uses music in the same way as, say, "Gilligan's Island" or Scooby-Doo's drawings - it never stops. Terribly, just terrible. There are no new ideas, just gobs and gobs and gobs and ... etc., from bits taken from old movies and serials. There is no gatekeeper here, the movie seems to exist because it can. Save your money and your time. Not fun at all.
