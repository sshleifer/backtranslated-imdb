I'm going to keep this short.This "adaptation" of the wonderful King book is a joke in bad taste and nothing more. Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans on this site and as a result, this movie has mysteriously find its way into the top-250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is laughable as Torrance and Shelley Duvall too. The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance. are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who has not read the book and wants to understand the characters in this story: follow the TV series .... <br /> <br /> Oh, and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King's story, because King is ... not a good writer, he should continue to review "masterpieces" as "eyes closed."
