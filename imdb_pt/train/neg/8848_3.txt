Somewhere buried deep in the bottom of this film is a decent half-way movie trying to get out. The only traces are some early scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and a graveyard) and later a couple of pieces of production design. As I say, buried deep. One of the biggest challenges facing movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react with credibility in unbelievable situations. Annie McEnroe's reaction to being informed that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the first film) is (was?) A werewolf is, as I recall, along the lines; "Seriously?". It is not one of the best answers to the challenge. Non sequitures continue as the story moves to Transylvania in search of Stirba's (seemingly self-appointed) "Queen of the Werewolves". Like Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie. Yes, even better than the werewolf group sex scene, Reb Brown's acting, and werewolf suits strangely simian-like. The final credits have assumed a minor caption status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the whole movie makes the same amount of sense. If you happen to catch it on US television, the credits have been re-edited to replace the endlessly repeated footage of Danning ripping your top off with another repeatedly endless shot of it opening a cloak only this time it has some kind of top underneath . It's kind of absurd, a cherry moment at the top that defies satire.
