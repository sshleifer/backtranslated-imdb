Because? Because, for a reason, there has never been a more adorable scene in any movie than Ann Margret singing "Bye Bye Birdie" at the opening. She replies again in the end too (in a different way!). Both wonderful. Rent and see. Even if it's all you watch. You'll agree, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about the original was so great that it did not need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa performed laudably, as did Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers of this new version were giving "everything", but it's like trying to improve "Casablanca" - this can not be done! It's even annoying to find yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to enjoy the remake, and fall short, without the actors' fault.
