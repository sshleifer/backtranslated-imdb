This is a movie that is bad in every way imaginable. Of course we like to know what happened 12 years from the last film, and it works on some level. But the new characters just are not interesting. Baby Melody is horribly awful! Unfortunately, while the logic that humans can not stay submerged forever is maintained, other basic physical logics are ignored. It is cold if you do not have cold weather clothing if you are in the Arctic. I do not know why most of the reviews here return from Jafar rates worse, I thought this one is more awful.
