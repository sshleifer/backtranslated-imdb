Was this movie banned in England? because? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had done much worse before and have continued like this ever since ... <br /> <br /> this film has all the basics of a decent horror of the 70's or early 80's movie. good-looking girls (who can not act to save their lives, by the way), a terrible lightning storm with a pouring rain, a sickle, a mad brother wandering around the family estate, and indeed a very good turnaround at the end . but banned? seriously. when the English parliament banned this film, the Italians probably laughed at their collective idiots about how backward and puritanous the Brits really were. <br /> <br /> There were perhaps two minutes of total time on the screen dedicated to violence and violence (which was very poorly done). there was nudity, but not sex, although allusions to sex were obviously made. but absolutely nothing worthy of being banished. <br /> <br /> I would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with. as it is, the movie is fun, but the lack of picture and sound quality takes the final result. <br /> <br /> banned ... what a joke ...
