Except for recognizing good cinematography, I can not say anything positive about this movie. The only real issue is the protagonist's dilemma of staying with his childhood friends in the world of misery or leaving them and taking their own life. Abundant "emotionally powerful" scenes do not combine with this plot, and because of poor acting, they also can not create the intended atmosphere. The director can only present Anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution. The characters do not seem to evolve, though it's hard to talk about any character ... maybe except Sonny. Beside him, the actors can not play much, and when some of them need it, they present themselves as self-indulgent amateurs. I wonder what ruined the film the most: the superficial script, throwing away all the potential of the plot, or the bad acting, disturbing any appeal that might be left.
