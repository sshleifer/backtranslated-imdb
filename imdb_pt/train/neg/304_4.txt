This movie portrays Ruth as a sportswoman who drinks, drinks, plays, and feeds on a small baseball. The early life of Babe Ruths was quite interesting and this was, for all intents and purposes, omitted in this film. Also, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and this was a well-known relationship, good bad or indifferent, should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than bad. He was an American hero, an icon that many of baseball's greats shaped their lives afterwards. I feel like I'm being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this movie completely ignored. What a shame for the producers of this film to capitalize on their failures and not their greatness.
