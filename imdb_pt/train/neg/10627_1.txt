I realize that most people who think the movie speaks the truth or not were born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or are not old enough to enjoy them. I think it's much easier to question a historical event if you did not live for it. <br /> <br /> I was a young man at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was happening. The whole world followed the moon. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines screamed about the latest events of every day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to moonlighting, to splashdown in a multitude of languages. At school, some classes were canceled so we could watch the major TV events. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and kept the collective breath while the men stuck to an uncertain destination. You could not go anywhere without someone asking what was the latest. The world was truly a community. <br /> <br /> Now, with a reserve of 30 years after the fact, it is easy to claim frauds because the enthusiasm and world interest have declined. We get our history books, and anyone can claim that the story is wrong and try to "prove" it with a bunch of lies and fabricated facts completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence that shows otherwise - not to mention proof that it inhabits souls and memories of those who have lived those wonderfully intoxicating and fantastic days.
