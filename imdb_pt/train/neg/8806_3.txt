How did this imitation of "Being There" become so loved? People say that it is proof that a decent and honest man can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. They are wrong. The film is proof that luck is everything: I hope your friend will invest all his money at Apple and not at Atari; I hope your shrimp boat is the only one on the sea when a storm breaks out; I hope you do not die of fright when, fortunately, you are shot in the buttocks and not in the back; I hope you do not have AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactionary - all those who rebel against social conventions lose their legs, use drugs, beat their girlfriends or die young. Also, product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulative film that is very, very empty.
