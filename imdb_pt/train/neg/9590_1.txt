The film is based on a genuine 1950s novel. Journalist Colin McInnes wrote a set of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners," "City of Spades," and "Lord Love and Justice." I read all three. The first two are excellent. The last, maybe an experiment that did not go away. But McInnes's work is highly acclaimed; and rightly so. This musical is the novelist's ultimate nightmare - seeing the fruits of the mind being turned into a one-dimensional soporific excuse for a movie that claims to capture the spirit of London in the 1950s and does nothing of the sort. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness Colin McInnes was not alive to witness this.
