How this piece of junk was filmed is beyond me. The only actor known to me is Judge Reinhold, a gifted actor whose presence is only a justification for putting him into production. <br /> <br /> I do not even think it's worth an indication for a rotten tomato prize, this movie really makes B movies a cinematographic delight. A car traveling along the road with the police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yeah, right. <br /> <br /> The script must have been written on the back of a cigarette box. Most made for TV movies is horrible, but that redefines the word. Check out the acting skills of the bridge operator, pure Oscar material.
