If you hear these three words spoken to you ... "Joe Don Baker", be afraid ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is the low-budget action movie based on a sheriff of a Texas town called Geronimo. (pronounced like Heronimo). He is an ugly, slimy and rude character who is hunting for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. Your partner really comes down twice in the movie. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. In addition, he shoots everyone as if he were in the wild west. I guess no one told him it was the 20th century. A female police officer is assigned to show him around Malta (who looks like Elaine de Seinfeld) and she is the only person who can support the hick. She must be crazy! <br /> <br /> The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in the movie. His dance is shown throughout the film and I started to relate to despicable women. Well, at least it was better than watching Geronimo trying to get rid of something. The ending is flawed and somewhat predictable, and I was glad it was finally over. You will never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker's movie. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to imagine how he was in THREE James Bond movies ... very strange! Anyway, if you're willing to laugh, then check this out at MST3K at some point. Also, I heard his other bad movie (among many), "Mitchell" MST3K version being released on DVD by Rhino. I can not wait to see this!
