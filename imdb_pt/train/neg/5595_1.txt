Wow OK. So, after reading the little fief here, I decided that I had to see this movie for myself. This movie is HORRIBLE. I stopped watching. I highly recommend cleaning a cabinet instead of watching this movie, you will be more scared / entertained. <br /> <br /> It's low budget with bad acting. <br /> <br /> Whoever is giving this 10s movie is completely incorrect and should be disregarded. <br /> <br /> I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Very, very bad movie.
