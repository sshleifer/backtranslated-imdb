But I got over it. It seemed to me that even the author of the book liked Caroline. I felt so sad for the character Louise, and she was constantly compared to Esau who was bad, I just felt that the comparison was a bit harsh and unrealistic. Really, the movie was bad. I really would not see it unless you're ready for a big disappointment.
