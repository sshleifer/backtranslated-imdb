I completely agree with the other comment that someone should do a Tiger Lily with that movie. <br /> <br /> It has to be one of the worst French films I've seen in a long time (actually together with Brotherwood's wolves, 2 horrendous movies in a very short period of time). <br /> <br /> It's very sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea is kind of fun. Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort among my darlings, I was very disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is very bad as usual, which proves that a pretty face and famous parents can take you to the movies, but they do not necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you want to laugh, watch Alain Chabat or some nice piece of fun-filled time like D'ARTAGNAN'S LA FILLE.
