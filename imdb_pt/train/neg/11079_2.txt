Over the course of several years in search of decent half-hired movies for my kids, I have developed a sixth sense to identify the really extravagant, direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit in (for anyone over the age of eight). I dropped the ball in this and the kids spent half of the movie asking me "what did she say that?" and "why did he do it?" and my eyes were aching to roll by the minute, as the characters did a lousy job of introducing seemingly random shifts into the plot. And the next time someone decides they have absolutely no skill with a sword is simply "bring realism" to a movie, please pass them on with a dull butter knife. "Prehysteria!" was head and shoulders above that. Arrgh.
