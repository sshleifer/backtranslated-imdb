Action, violence, sex, and gross language are the things the characters do throughout the film. And all they do is done without reason. Mark L. Lester is (dis) known for his violent films (no reason) (Commando, The Base). The story is strange, but stupid. The actors interpret their stupid characters very well ... I'm not saying they are stupid, but I mean they are very bad actors. It is another action film of the series B, of low budget and unknown. If you saw something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, Patriot, Sanctuary or something like these bad movies of the same type as the Misbegotten ... do not rent it ... and by the way, do not rent any of the movies I mentioned ... I give 1 and a half out of 5.
