This movie has the appearance of a student film project. Yes, there are some interesting (though puzzling) issues and shots, but the end result was youthful. <br /> <br /> The director did not seem to be saying "Look at this movie". It looked like he was saying, "Look at me! I am a DIRECTOR!" <br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
