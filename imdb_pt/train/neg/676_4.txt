I wanted to see this for two reasons. One of them was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, Bogart's part was played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with some subtlety, as in The Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; only here, the actors do not care, the director is lost in their thoughts and who knows what the producer was thinking. Jack Palance is getting bored looking at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters is wondering what she is doing in this movie. I do not even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role. And, of course, they had to use the dog's story again! They certainly could have different ideas. Maybe the color makes it cool to see the same place where they filmed the Serra Alta, but that definitely does not add any quality to the film. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time if you've seen the Serra Alta before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir? As for me, I'd rather die than see one more time ...
