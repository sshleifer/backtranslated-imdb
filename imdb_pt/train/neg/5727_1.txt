I just want to start by saying that this is the first review of a movie I made on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After reading the interviews with the director, he says that he respects constructive criticism and therefore I will try to avoid the act of circumventing the film just because of it and offer my opinions as to why I found it so catastrophically terrible. <br /> <br /> 1. The actors. I know the budget may not have allowed for great theses, but with Nicholson working in the industry for over ten years, he certainly knew some actors who were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. The incredibly limp and special effects. Again, the budget obviously interfered with what was originally planned, but after working on makeup for so many years, there really is no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. The obvious similarities to Hostel. Although not exactly a steal, it certainly tries to profit from the success of previous films. The only problem was that Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. The music. Not a bit scary or haunting even sickly simply annoying. <br /> <br /> 5. The script in general. The whole dialogue was forced and terrible! Also the subplots about the theater and the subject that comes to save them were weak and almost like a belated reflection. <br /> <br /> 6. The issue. WTF How shocking, and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'd like to hear the thoughts of the director in my post (he no doubt frequents his pages on IMDb.) cause friend ... what were you thinking. Certainly at some point during the shooting or editing, you realized what a turkey yolu had in your hands ... Sorry I do not want to be tough but you must have more talent than that I hope your next feature that film gutterballs or Whatever is better, I hope that practice will progress. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime avoid this like the plague. I want my 81 minutes back with interest. (At least I did not pay to watch.)
