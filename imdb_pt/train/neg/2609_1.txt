This movie did not provide anything new or worth it. After seeing it, my wife and I agreed that the studio simply shook it and could have cared less if it was fun. This is a good example of a "concept only" movie - they have a concept about a movie and the other details are not important because executives KNOW who will make $$ just based on the initial concept. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Cruella coming out of prison and going on parole. She no longer hates puppies, but was programmed to adore them - she just could not hurt a flea. This does not last long after her release and she is back to her old habits. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters. Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth, the bird, made me hate it - and this is difficult considering that I am a stubborn fan of Python. It was obvious that he did it because they gave him lots of money (there can be no other reason). Cruella's low-ranking servant, Tim McInnerny, was funny at Black Adder's shows, but here he's totally wasted and bland. And it must have cost a few dollars to Gerard Depardieu, but he was also totally wasted. There were a few other supporting actors as well, but considering how poorly written the characters were, I'm trying to block them. <br /> <br /> In general, you'd better let your kids watch television. than bothering to let them see this nonsense.
