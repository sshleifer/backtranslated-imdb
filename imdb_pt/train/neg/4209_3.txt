"I'm a cartoon!" "You're an illustration!" what does that mean? This plot could not be worse as a boy, who is afraid of everything, becomes very brave at the end of the film because he entered a library. The only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage American children to read, when a cheaper and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of ads! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (as the kid), Christopher Lloyd (as the so predictable "he's a Page Master librarian"), could save this senseless movie from the tedious plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (even) Leonard Nimoy, or the God of Hollywood voices, Frank Welker as the cartoon characters do not ever save that. I can only describe it as an equivalent of the 90's to the 1978, even horrible, adaptation of the Water Babies, because the bland animation makes the movie worse, not improving the annoying storyline!
