I'm a fan of previous Best of the Best movies. But this was awful. No wonder I had trouble finding him. I tried 4 video rentals until I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was terrible, the plot was a joke, and the action was bad as well. <br /> <br /> I really miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley, and the original characters and kickboxing themes that this movie had with the first. 2 movies.
