When I was a kid, I remember watching this while visiting a friend of our "Uncle" Phil. We're back! The story of a dinosaur is a silly drawing about a dinosaur named Rex (voiced by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a boy dinosaur the story of how the dinosaurs returned to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back, along with some friends. The villain Doctor / Professor of this movie, I think may have been responsible for them being back but I do not care about him. Kids may like this, but personally it's very tacky. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!
