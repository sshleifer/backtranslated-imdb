Arthur Askey's great ability as a comic was in the way he communicated with his audience. His juvenile jokes, silly songs and crazy dances fell well because he was able to envelop people and draw them into the world of walls. The lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage for him, and he never felt completely comfortable in movies. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, was adapted to make the most of his talents, but Askey, the artist, had to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Askey's support in the film is not strong, including regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a dopey honeymoon couple; Linden Travers going over like a 'crazy woman'. Also on board are Peter Murray-Hill, who married Phyllis Calvert as the nominal protagonist, giving a totally lenient reading of the part, and the protagonist Carol Lynne, who makes an equally insipid performance. It is left to characterize actress Kathleen Harrison to effortlessly steal the movie as a parrot loving a single woman who is crushed in Dr. Morland Graham's cognac.
