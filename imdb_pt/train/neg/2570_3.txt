I read that "There's a Girl in My Soup" came out during the low period of Peter Sellers. Watching the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the movie. Apparently, the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film; this doesn `t happen. The whole movie looks like they just randomly filmed what happened without writing anything. Maybe I have not seen all the movies about middle-aged and old people trying to be hippies, but this movie gives a very bad name to these movies. <br /> <br /> In all, both Sellers and Hawn have starred in much better films than this, so do not waste time on it. Very useless.
