I knew that 'Evening' was a girls' movie, so I was hoping to get bored. A perverse provocation on IMDb said it was a "girl movie", but that her companion would survive. <br /> <br /> Survive? Yes. I'm still here, but when we both left, we were surprised to find that it only lasted for two hours - it seemed a much longer night than that! I suppose, for the Yankees, it's supposed to be haughty or fascinating, because it's rich people living on the beach - well, near the beach, in a house with a wide porch and a lawn, but no apparent lawn mower. If that kind of thing impresses you, it may seem like a short film. <br /> <br /> There's a Monty Python movie about a knight who just does not die. He ends up squirming (why Yanks adds a third syllable to that word I ask myself) torso on the road still shouting threats to his enemy. This movie is also about a kind of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (improper name for the grave dodger shown here) continues and continues to die although taking the wrong guilt. She's not worried about being a big-eyed, wind-eyed fool, but she thinks she's a killer. Obviously, being a girl movie, there is one guy who should be the character of Mr. Darcy / Heathcliff. I am not a woofter, so I can not claim to be a good judge of such things, but the boring coward who is transferred to this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favor. He is a cipher without blood. <br /> <br /> As you may realize, the main characters are not very cops, but the smaller ones can, surprisingly, be much worse. There is a colleague whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is pregnant. It's fair, but it's not the role of Hamlet - why spoil it so much? Forgetting that it was a girl's movie, I thought he was going to be kicked out because any decent girlfriend would have told him the facial fungus did not compliment him, but then I realized that she must have encouraged him to cultivate 'beard' because he looked worse without he. I stayed awake, realizing that actors and actresses had their ears tied or free and watching interesting parts of the scenery - if you're dragged to it, see if you can see the stuffed buffalo's head, just the kind of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage. <br /> <br /> In addition to mandatory marriage, there is only one piece of action. You'd think they'd hit it. Unfortunately though, the accident is run by a car that could not be there. When the accident is discovered, the cast wanders screaming for a character he may not know about (but we do as the audience). If they have no clue that the person is a few miles from the place, then why do they wander aimlessly shouting for him? I suppose the director's excuse is that it's supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence ... <br /> <br /> Another scenario item that caught my eye was a pan with a copper bottom. I do not think the technology to do this was developed until the fifties.
