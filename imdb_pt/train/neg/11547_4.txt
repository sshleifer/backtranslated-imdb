What kind of shit is this? Power rangers vs. Freddy? It was watchable and as good as the first movie at the beginning, but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in their dreams, it started to become childish. This sh * t should have been rated PG or PG-13 instead of R. I expected to see some very mature things, but it was only for 1/3 of the movie. The rest is for small children. In addition, he is very focused on Christianity. I know Freddy is a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways of fighting demons. Why does it always have to be Christianity? That is total Orientalism and full of white men / Western superiority. Do not watch that, show it to kids who love power rangers.
