The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a first-rate comedian, in other situations away from the Stooges. He had a definite history of being very funny and clever. Moe, Larry and Shemp actually knew him or her at least for many years and liked his work. So what on earth was going on when he joined the troop as the "third goofy"? Obviously, nothing. In most short of the "late Stooge" era, most of the time, the boys are pitted against each other or Joe against the other two and this is not Stooge's label needs. "One for all, all for one, each for himself," to quote Curly from "Restless Knights." One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or hit each other, when the chips are really down, they get together and come to the aid of the other. In this particular, none of this happens. It's almost like watching a dogfight when someone tries to cheat others or be mean and nasty, not to the comic effect either. One might suppose that there was something behind the scenes happening here, art imitates life. Maybe there really was why Besser did not stay long with Moe and Larry. Just look at the history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
