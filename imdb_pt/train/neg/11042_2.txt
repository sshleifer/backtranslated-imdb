I wish I could say that this show was unusual in its banality, but it is common in every way. He has the idiot husband, his smarter but boring, conventional wife, along with the dumb partner for "comic" relief - who desperately needs predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions to laughter, punctuating the nauseatingly unimaginable plots of the mental sickness to make me physically sick or in a deep sleep more like that of an induced coma. But it may be for a while yet, because it gives the average American a character to whom they can actually identify. A regular guy like you and me. I live in the southern US, so for me this show is just the opposite of escapism. Here, this detestable character is everywhere, somehow or another. Watching him on television is a brutal exaggeration.
