As a young black / Latino woman, I'm always looking for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie in the store, I thought I would enjoy it; Unfortunately I did not. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story simply has not been developed properly. The film continued to drag on and many of the characters that appear on the screen just come and go without much to contribute to the film in general. If the director did a better job of interconnecting the scenes, I might have liked it a bit more. Honestly, I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" on this day. I just was not too impressed.
