Average (and surprisingly meek) Fulci giallo, which means that it is still very bad for normal standards, but redeemed for its solid training and for some nice touches, as a good time for the issues of visions and clairvoyance. <br /> <br /> The known weaknesses of the genre are in full swing: banal dialogue, wooden performance, illogical plot points. And the ending goes on for a long time, while the outcome turns out to be a bit stupid, or should I say: a lame case. <br /> <br /> Fulci's ironic treatment of giallo standards is fun, however. Yellow clues wherever you look. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 murderers limping
