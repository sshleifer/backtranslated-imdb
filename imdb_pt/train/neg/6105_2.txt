If you are the kind of person who gets to have fun with a really bad movie, then I highly recommend this. If you do not go, stay away. This is a surprisingly cheap movie, and sometimes you may wonder if it's not just a joke that someone is pulling at you. The most positive comment I can make is that the responsible people seemed to realize that it was a low-budget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of fun here. <br /> <br /> But that's as amateur as it gets. Their idea of ​​giant assassin mushrooms are simply faces covered with beige leaves with what appears to be a garbage can over their heads. Obviously not to be taken seriously (to say the least), but even with this warning you will see yourself shaking your head with the incredible bullshit of it all. Or laughing loudly as I did.
