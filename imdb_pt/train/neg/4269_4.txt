Sometimes a premise starts well, but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention deficit disorder, it turns into an incongruous mess. And for three respected actors who have done a better job before and after, that is a deadly shame. <br /> <br /> So let's see. Premise: A loving couple living in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop. Interesting to say the least. Make the intruder cop a bit disruptive, why not. It was well done in the hand that rocks the cradle and single white female, and is a proven ticket to a successful thriller. <br /> <br /> Now here lies the dilemma. Create a disturbing story that really bothers to bring some real threat to your main characters while it never goes so far as to look ridiculous, or play any resemblance to reality, increase the shock factor and make this cop so radical - an ultra bad variation of all the other super-villains that hit theaters since the silent era. <br /> <br /> Producers and directors chose the latter. So it is the resulting film - poorly done, with actors trying to give the best to make face or crown in roles that they have already tested before, and nothing much less yet.
