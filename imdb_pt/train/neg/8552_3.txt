... just look at the poor character Robert Webber (great performance, again!) who tries to fight a submachine gun from one of the terrorists. Everything in this movie seems to be a bit wrong. The biggest mistake, in my opinion, is the effort to give the action a firm foundation in the reality of the early 80's (the fundamental difference between this film and the much more fantastic, ironic and therefore timeless Die Hard). The story comes as a failed attempt to glorify SAS commands. Ideas like when a command screams upside down "all the good guys do that and all the villains do not do it so they can explode on a makeshift basis (with a good conscience), that the main character is not killed by the gas masked commands, even though they use the the same clothes and carry a weapon from their arsenal, they seem to be unlikely and make it difficult to take the film seriously, and it turns out that it tries to be more than just fun. but the political commentary is rather lame and uninspired.This is unfortunate, since the film features an early performance by Judy Davies.It plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject. " Anyway, her performance is a little above the others and somehow I feel the movie disappoint her.
