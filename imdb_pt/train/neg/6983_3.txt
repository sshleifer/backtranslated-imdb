Revolution is a terrible movie, I do not care if you're a history teacher, journalist, Al Pacino fan, there's no way this movie can win a legitimate '10'. <br /> <br /> The key To pointing to the plot is Tom Dobb (Al) trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots by taking his boat. Everything revolves around this note. Tom's son joins the army to make up the note, making Tom join the army as well, they go on an adventure trying to leave the army, years later the war is over and they can finally deliver the note to their boat. The End. <br /> <br /> He had some battle scenes, and they were very mediocre at best. Transitions between scenes used "five months later" and magically put the characters into some famous historical battle. The love story is a joke, and the film as a whole is hard to follow. Then save your "Notes" and watch the Patriot.
