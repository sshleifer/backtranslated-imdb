OK. Look, I've seen a lot and I mean a lot of these types of movies. You know, those where the DVD cover looks so good and scaarrryyy that you just can not wait to see it? Well, I got GOT again. And I'm getting very tired of it. But I digress. It's very simple. It sucked (I know, quite juvenile) but it happened. And I agree with the other poster that if we had to sit down with the boring thing, why, oh, why does the lead actress have to be so uninteresting? Distractingly so if I can add. And the scowl she wore conveyed pain / suffering unresolved by the death of her daughter did not help much. I mean, Jesus .. Oh, but the creeping-back-demon thing was pretty cool ...
