OK, I and a friend rented this a few days ago, because we like to watch B movies, since we do them alone. Anyway, the cape contained blood and strange naked girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini! There's no way this movie fails! Right? wrong!! It just seems like a waste! There was really no story, the dialogue was terrible (someone there? X 1000 !!!), the characters were ... well, they really did not have any personality ... The effects were terrible .. and what happens with these long, artistic shots of frightened people running around doing nothing ... with extreme close-ups of eyes and other things? We were sitting the whole movie waiting for something ... anything to happen ... but no ... "Oh, here comes the nymphs! Great! Oh ... they're kissing ... again ... and now to violence! OK ... nothing really happens ... again ... oh, now they run ... and the close of the eyes ... again ... oh, here's Tom Savini! ... he died ... right ... OK, maybe now something cool or even interesting happens .. no .. oh! cool! a severed head! the end ... oh crap .. "And finally, since that I'm so full of myself .. I'll tell you this! Give me a van, six actors, a strange-looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and I could make the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I made zero-budget films at two days that has better effects, better acting and a better script than that ... what is this Johannes guy? Making cool movies is easy! It could have been so good ... I'm very upset!
