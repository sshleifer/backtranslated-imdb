It is possible that A Man Called Sledge may have caused irreparable damage to the cutting room floor. Maybe someone will demand a cut from the director one day, but I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to profit from the western market of spaghetti and in doing so brought a lot of Americans to fill the cast. Out. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins and John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow, who wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> Garner is always cast as sympathetic thieves because he is so good at interpreting them. But he played seriously and did well in movies like Children's Hour and Hour of the Gun. He can and has separated from his usual stereotyped part successfully. But a man named sled can not be counted as one of his successes. <br /> <br /> He has the lead role as Luthor Sledge, a famous outlaw with a big price on his head. After partner Tony Young is killed in a hall and Garner takes appropriate action for Eastwood, he is followed by the hall by John Marley. <br /> <br /> Marley spent time in the next territorial prison and it looks like gold shipments are put under lock and key there at a rest stop for people carrying the stuff in a regular run. Garner arranges his gang for a robbery. <br /> <br /> Here is where the movie comes out of the wall altogether. Usually assault movies show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning. Certainly that was the case in The War Wagon, which some other reviewers have quoted. But in this, Garner decides to invade the prison as prisoner of the false American Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak when the gold will be stolen. <br /> <br /> That was too much to swallow. If catching the gold was so easy, it should have been done a long time before. But I will tell those who like the blood and courage of the western Italians, during the jail break there are enough for three films. <br /> <br /> That's not the whole thing, of course the outlaws fall and we have another bloody party before the movie is over. But at that time the whole movie lost a lot of coherence. <br /> <br /> The great 1930s movie singer Allan Jones is listed in the credits. But for the life of me I can not find it in the movie. Maybe a Donkey Serenade chorus might have made it better. <br /> <br /> I could not have hurt anyone.
