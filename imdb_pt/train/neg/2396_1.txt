I just watched this movie on TV and I have to admit, I was a bit surprised that it was on. There were so many jokes, confusions and bad editions that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to watch. The acting was good, but please, you can really feel the "Straight to the Video" feel. The cast / crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but wait until ten minutes before the end to hear it. Trust me, you would not even tell the difference.
