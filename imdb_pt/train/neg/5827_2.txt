Do not get the impression of other critics that this movie stinks because it is ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is no worse than the US meat trade or the Scottish haggis), which stinks because it is pretentious guff up-its-behind-behind that receives modern art a bad name. That being said, there are some stunning images, but there are stunning images on the average bus ride, if you use your imagination, then this is no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the movie happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted, and then, when you think it's over, start over. I saw him in a porn movie in Rome that had been hired for the weekend to showcase Barney's works, which is an admirable and clever way to recover what was once a local flop of the old men-on-macs dirty brigade, but if the trendy young things and the slightly noisy Bjork fans were honest, everyone could have had a lot more fun if they had just shown one of the porn guys!
