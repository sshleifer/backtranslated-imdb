I grabbed the chance to see this uncut and uninterrupted movie, reminding rahs and raves for that. But wherever he seemed about to be truly scary, he stepped back and went somewhere else. Dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in the raw sewer were discarded before they could even work to a scream. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Chamberlain's almost blank face mask offered little but confused disbelief, something that I found myself reflecting as the film progressed. What could have been a mysterious Aboriginal singing and instruments in the background, instead, was a cacophony apparently designed to strike the terror in someone's head. Ideas that modern people may incorporate ancient gods, that Aboriginal people believe that red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed more as a shopping list than a hint in another dimension (The Time of Dreams ). <br /> [SPOILER] In the final scene, it was not clear to me what the director was trying to say. Is there a big wave? And? How big? A tsunami? Yes, OK. This is devastating, but not apocalyptic. It's the end of the World? A wave? The last wave? That would have to be a great wave. Because? Was the world so bad? It does not look so horrible in this movie. In fact, I did not think the wave had left, as the shadow left Burton's face that had been launched by the wave. Was it just the apocalypse of Burton? This happens every day for people who lose. It was of no interest at all if it were just him. The most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was at Charlie's apartment, where Burton went to confront the old man. man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking him "Who are you?" and it becomes truly disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the film never followed suit.
