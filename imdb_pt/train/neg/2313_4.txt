Shintar√¥ Katsu gained much fame interpreting the wonderful personage, Zatoichi. Zatoichi's films had a strange and unbelievable concept - a blind man is the greatest swordsman in Japan and passes each film correcting the mistakes and demanding retribution to the evildoers. He's a cool guy and the movies are exciting and addictive (actually I've seen all the movies). That's why I saw this final part of the series Hanzo the Razor, since I thought it would be good looking ... and man I was wrong! It turns out that Hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and also promote the rape of "women who deserve it". You see, Hanzo is a Meiji cop and he regularly takes the evil women into custody and interrogates them violently raping them with his "steel penis." How he made his limb so strong is something you have to see to believe, but it certainly is not for scruples. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend that anyone see these violent and misogynist films. However, from looking at the other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular ... and this is rather scary. Despite some decent acting and incredible fighting scenes, movies are just like brain pollution - and I'd hate to imagine how the movies could have contributed to violence against women.
