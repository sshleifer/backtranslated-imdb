I watched the movie and was amazed to say that the movie could not communicate with me as a public. The language would embarrass street moccasins. <br /> <br /> The plot; a father forcing none of his son to marry, seems forced. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a grandmother asking her grandma to disrupt an enemy would only attract the attention of the weak mind. <br /> <br /> ... and I was expecting the whole movie for a laughing and laughing, I did with my stupidity of wasting 3 hours to convince me that the movie is not even worth it. <br /> <br /> I hope it saves your time!
