Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and is missing something in her life. She enters a Miss France contest against the wishes of her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia) and she wins. She leaves for the title of Miss Europe leaving her boyfriend behind. She wins again, but returns home with Andre because he asked her. Once together, her life becomes worldly again, so one night she writes a note to him and lets herself experience the fame that is waiting for her as Miss Europe. Andre follows her ..... <br /> <br /> This film is a silent film with a piano music track throughout the course. It is also accelerated, so everything seems fast. Limited dialogue was added afterwards and is very untrue. The cast is fine, keeping in mind that it is a silent film. The best part of the film comes at the end, but the story continues a little too long. After watching this, I'm not sure what the big deal was about the appearance of Louise Brooks - she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat. I do not need to watch it again.
