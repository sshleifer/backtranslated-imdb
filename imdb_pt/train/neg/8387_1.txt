This was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People who are hit in the head are not funny. People being kicked are not funny. After the third time a guy was kicked in the balls, not even the youngest member of the audience was laughing. He just got tired fast. <br /> <br /> I went with my little sister. She actually laughed out loud at King of the Hill, but this cinematic masterpiece bored her. I'm not surprised. The story is very bad. A dwarven thief steals a large diamond in what was definitely the easiest blow in Hollywood history. So he hides with a family pretending to be a baby. I know it sounds exciting, but that's the whole story. Say these two lines over and over for 1.5 hours and you'll get the picture There were predictable jokes in abundance. I really felt cheated after seeing this. I was not expecting much and I was still disappointed. I wanted Keenan to just hire some decent writers to write jokes and / or his next screenplay. That was even worse than the White Chicks, if that's possible. I saw the high school pieces that were better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I do not like my entertainment to be dumbfounded.
