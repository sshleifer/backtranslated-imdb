the guy who wrote, directed and faced this shocking piece of junk should really consider a caretaker change. Yes Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this crap? there are so many talented writers out there to whom money could be better spent. I think the idea is great, but the acting, script and direction is just awful! The jokes are not funny, I understand they should be picking up the mickey. But do it in style, this movie is screaming live 1995 satire on Saturday night. Why, I say again why studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER GIVE A COMEDIAN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE DIRECTLY AND BE IN YOUR OWN MOVIE. DUH!
