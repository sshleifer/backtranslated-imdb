Before watching "Dahmer", I thought that no movie could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. To summarize "Dahmer," it is a story about a homosexual serial killer that almost kills and consists almost entirely of Dahmer's encounters with gay men before they are killed. There is no plot to be found, and it is of no use to tell us about "Dahmer". All you'll learn about Dahmer while watching this movie is that he enjoyed having sex with men. Horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible writing, horrible everything ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and projectile vomit for three hours, go with the vomit .... it will be less painful .....
