The only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by Thom-Adcox Hernandez, who is underutilized in the film within the film. As usual, Tom Villard is good too. Otherwise, it is c ** p. Does not the possesor even exist as he magically changes the letters in the marquise of the theater to spell "The Possessor"? Lame.
