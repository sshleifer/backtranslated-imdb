This movie is just plain bad. Not worth watching to make fun of him. The whimsical teacher is simply annoying. Even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility (which I glady because of good bad movies) and allowing extremely stupid victims in a horror movie, this movie calls for even more than that. If you are looking for shower scenes in women's locker rooms, and random sexual encounters, get a porn, if you are looking for a good and bad movie, get something else. If you just want to waste your time on a bad movie, rent it.
