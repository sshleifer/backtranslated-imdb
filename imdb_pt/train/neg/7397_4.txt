I've seen this movie several times in a variety of short film festivals and it always gives me the impression that I saw a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> For a school movie is very well produced and directed, but the story ... well, needed something more to be a bigger and interesting film. The character named Tim Watcher needed some approach in the department. This is something lacking in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I liked this movie ... <br /> <br /> Congratulations! (Congratulations!)
