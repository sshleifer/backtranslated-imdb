I do not know what some of you guys are smoking, but I suspect it's potent. Horrible Swept Away calling would be an insult to the very concept of terribility. The acting is horrible and I'm not picking up Madonna here, we all know she's useless, but someone should have warned everyone that her illness is contagious. My backs literally ache from shrinking so much into poorly distributed lines. The edition is so careless, it begs the description. Photography and composition (which, at this time, competence must be attributed to any film with a budget) are surprisingly ineffective, even the illumination is horrible and unnatural in appearance. These are basic elements of the cinema, if you can not get it right, you should get another line of work. It is as artificial as a grade 3 production of Snow White, except that it is not nearly as well made or interesting. <br /> <br /> Lina Wertmueller's original film is a wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly represented and written, with breathtaking visuals. - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the sand swept by the wind in your hair. The sexual tension seems real and immediate ... those of you who found the version of Guy Ritchie deplorable, should see it, is really one of the milestones of world cinema. <br /> <br /> Those of you who thought of the remake. is some kind of masterpiece that should have their heads examined.
