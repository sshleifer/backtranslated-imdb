Everything you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene where a guy falls into a pond and is eaten. Then they start rolling the title credits: You see "Slugs!" in big letters, followed shortly after by "The Movie". WHEW! I was worried about having accidentally tuned in to "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". Anyway, from there the film deteriorates in a killer festival. You see a guy cutting off his hand because he had slugs in his gardening glove, two people are attacked by slugs while having sex, and a girl falling on her back in an underpass is stung to death by killer slugs. It's a very silly movie, falling into the category "so bad it's good". It's also filmed so poorly with this grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I'm very surprised to get a score as high as here, because most people here do not give love to this kind of movie. But if you want a movie that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable, this is one of your top candidates.
