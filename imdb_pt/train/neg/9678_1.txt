I'm sorry to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although visually fascinating (for example, the use of color was absolutely stunning), it was very annoying and disturbing (see incest between father and son). <br /> <br /> What's more, the music is totally absent, and if you think about those wonderful soundtracks of Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most Greenaway movies) then you can imagine the difference that makes. <br /> <br />
