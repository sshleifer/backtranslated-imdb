This film is nothing more than a religious treatise that promotes classical Hinduism and New Age occultism clothed with Western images to be swallowed up by those who ignore fundamental religious comparisons. The basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the 1600s) obviously reincarnated. God is an impersonal force. Animal life and plant life are all the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield attempted to blend Eastern mysticism with Western Christianity. His attempt at syncretism may mislead or confuse those who are not seekers of truth, but this film is a weak excuse for any supreme reality. As the advertisement in the former Berkeley Barb used to say for $ 10.00 will show you how to start your own religion. As a famous prophet said, "Use Luke of the Force."
