Kol, a space prisoner on the death row in space, manages to hijack a space shuttle and flee into the woods of America where he, along with a new friend found, tries to escape the alienator a killer cyborg machine. The best movie of Fred Olen Ray's career, "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers", this can not but seem a bit disappointing, as cheap as the previous movie, but not as fun as me. None of the actors really stood out in me. The movie is fine for the indiscriminate viewer during a rainy Saturday afternoon, but that's pretty much everything so that's fine. <br /> <br /> My Notes: D + <br /> Where I Saw: Showtime Thriller
