Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Moto movies. However, near the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio had "jumped the shark", so to speak. This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its peak and responsible executives have decided to reinvigorate the program by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with "The Brady Bunch" they introduced the annoying "Cousin Oliver" and with "Family Ties" they introduced a weird baby who grew up six years in just one season! With the Moto movies, they jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought these clever films needed to be reused. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played a boring fighter. And in this movie, the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief of all time, since you expected someone (preferably Moto) to kill you just to shut you up !! Although he supposedly works for the famous Scotland Yard, it shows all the intelligence and acumen of a turnip damaged by the brain. Again and again, his scenes were rude and unnecessary, and Peter Lorre only looked distressed as he stood there and watched this buffoon "act." It's so bad that it actually destroys what could have been one of the best Moto movies because of its clever plot. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the Queen of Sheba's crown is discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more of an international cop than the amoral character he originally was, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen. In a major uproar, several thieves try to steal the crown independently of each other. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is watchable, but it's also evidence that the Moto series should have ended here. With World War II approaching, the films could not have survived much longer, since having a nice Japanese character would simply not have been accepted in the US or the Allied countries.
