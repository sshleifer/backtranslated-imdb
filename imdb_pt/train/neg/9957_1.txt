One of the most peculiar plot of romance novels is this: a seriously confused man falls in love with a woman with a terminal illness that transforms her life before she dies. Occasionally this story is well done and realistically (as in "The Theory of Flight", an excellent weepie), but more often it is done as it is here, where as usual the heroine dies of "Old Movie Disease". You know, terminal illness that has no symptoms, but a spell of fainting and a need to lie down while you say goodbye to your love forever; and his appearance is not affected at all (and as this is the 70's, his sex life is not either). This is one of the worst versions of this particular story, where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together, and they are played by actors who are completely at sea. <br /> <br /> To be the worst performance of Al Pacino's career, and I say that after seeing "The Devil's Advocate" just two days ago! He plays an emotionally constipated, freak-controlled race car driver, and plays an ineffable lifeless character. He seems to be constantly wondering why he is getting around the Marthe Keller grill (the same goes for the public), and spends most of the film just ... standing there, usually with his mouth open. The only time he shows any sign of life is at the end where his character proves that he has moved from tense to released by doing a hilarious imitation of Mae West. Hey, it was the seventies! <br /> <br /> Marthe Keller is equally terrible as moribund love interest; her character was conceived as daring, free, touching, uninhibited and full of life, even if she were dying, and probably should have been played with an actress with the sensibility of, say, Vanessa Redgrave or Julie Christie. Instead, they have the expressionless face and Keller's strong German accent, which looks more like a terrifying Teutonic stereotype ("YOU EAT OMELLE!") Than anything as lovely. She should be reforming Pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and everything, but it does not work that way, it's more like she's insisting on her faults in the most unpleasant way possible. This makes one of the less convincing novels in movie history where you can not believe she would be with someone she thinks is so useless, and you can not believe she's with someone who gives you so much nerve. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Some bad movie fans call it a cult classic, mainly because of Pacino's ridiculous imitation of Mae West. The scene is a scream, especially in context, but it's not worth sitting during the rest of the movie for. No, just watch the movie if you are a serious fan of bad movies that is especially interested in studying Extreme Lack of Chemistry among the main actors, or Very Bad Casting (not just the leads are terrible but Pacino's other girlfriend is played by actress who looks and sounds just like Keller with shorter hair, I was totally confused). This is not one of those bad films like "The Conqueror", it's just a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br />
