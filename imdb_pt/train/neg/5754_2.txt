I watched mask in the 80's and is currently showing on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking it was cool back in the day and had some toys too but watch now bored me. I never realized before how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. It's just awful! It's not close to where the same Transformers championship, He-man or Thundercats has been and was quickly forgotten by almost everyone since it's gone from being done. I just watch Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes right after that (if the mask does not let me sleep first). One of the less animated cartoons of the '80s that I hope to completely forget again as soon as it's finally shown on Fox Kids!
