<br /> <br /> Worse. Movie. Ever. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of filming this remake (as well as turning it into a 90-minute informercial for the movie soundtrack)? Zombies that * race * ??? I think the director never watched the original "Dead" movies, which show rigid creatures (of rigor mortis) dragging / dragging towards their living prey. <br /> <br /> And how exactly did the survivors know which boat at the marina belonged to Steve left recently? <br /> <br /> 1/10
