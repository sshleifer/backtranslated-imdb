I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes a few times. Was it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - they all have some kind of talent, but here they all were in what basically adds to a Cinemax style skin style. Onboard a spaceship! <br /> <br /> Sad as it is, "Alien Intruder" tries to be unique with a computer virus / devil / harpy / anything else you want to call Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrating this kind of virtual reality station high-tech aboard a spaceship where four men can live out their fantasies while the system is seen by their captain (Williams). <br /> <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but everything here unfolds like a well padded episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams ranks right and left, and it looks like he would rather be doing anything else, ANYWHERE ELSE. Ah, the things people do for money ... The FX is pretty static, maybe even less than you would expect from a cheap cheap like this. Unfortunately, even female nudity is lower than you'd expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here and of course you get ALL the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like a movie that is all provocative and brainless, check out "Alien Intruder". Of course, you'll probably have to go past Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> No star, not even for the star power that this movie can present. <br /> <br /> Let this lost in space.
