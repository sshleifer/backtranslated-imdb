This movie has the core of a very good story. The work of Coast Guard men and women, especially in the North Pacific, is a thing of heroes and legends. This movie makes a good story with three endings (unsatisfactory), a couple of unnecessary and unnecessary bar fights and two supposed "romantic" relationships that have as much sparkle as bonfires. The rescue scenes are great - even if the generation of computers is fake and the scenarios are quite unreal - but the background story is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially the acting of his hands (pay attention). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best female is one of the Coast Guard's sailors at the rescue center and she's on camera for about two minutes throughout the movie. It could have been a great movie - and Costner needs one!
