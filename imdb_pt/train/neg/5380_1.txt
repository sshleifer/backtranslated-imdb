As I write this review, it seems that more than 50% of IMDb voters attributed this movie to a 10 or a 1 rating. I can only assume that those who scored 10 were cast or staff. <br /> <br /> They say that with enough monkeys, enough time and enough typewriters, these monkeys, just by random keyboard appearances, would end up typing Shakespeare's complete works. However, I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time, you could find a single to give this movie a rating of 10. I patiently watched the first half foolishly assuming that the movie would, at some level, develop the plot or the characters, or perhaps make some kind of social comment or provoke only an intellectual thought. Failing that, I was well prepared to accept action, suspense, comedy, horror or even free sex as a way of holding my attention. Finally, I was disappointed, and consequently much of the second time was seen in double speed, as I searched in vain for a short stretch of cinematic redemption. Unfortunately, there were none. <br /> <br /> If "The Choke" was pitted against an episode of Scooby Doo, then I'm afraid the cartoon would win hands in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And speaking of cartoon characters, the acting skills of the various cast members ranged between acceptable (at best) and embarrassingly poor with Brooke Bailey's portrayal of death-pseudo-gothic pseudo-gothic London being so bad that I almost felt sorry for her. I would have liked to have ended on a positive note, but even the soundtrack, a second-rate feast of contemporary punk rock, could not even entertain, much less serve to improve a very poor movie.
