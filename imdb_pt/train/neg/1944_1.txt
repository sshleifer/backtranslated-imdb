I grew up with Scooby Doo my whole life, My dad grew up with Scooby Doo. We just watched the first episode of the farce called Shaggy and Scooby has a clue. What planet is Warner Bros to let this mess fall in the air? The characters could have been better attracted to my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my 3-year-old twin cousins ​​(who are also Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy simply are not !!!!! If anyone but Casey Kasem does the voice of Shaggy, it just will not work !!!! trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was a disgrace. What's New Scooby Doo is so much better. Why change a winning format? Put this piece of junk and go back to the real Scooby
