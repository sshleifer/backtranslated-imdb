Bridges of Madison County is an improved version of this story. I felt that the end of this film was not treated sensitively, as in the original English film. This movie is very indianizado, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when the hero dies in the end you will love this movie, On the other hand, if you are a fighter in life and think that crying is for the weak you may not like the end. But overall a very good subject is well treated for Indian conditions. Tabu was good as wife and loving mother. Everyone acted well.
