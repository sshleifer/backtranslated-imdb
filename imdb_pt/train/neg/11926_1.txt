I'm rarely moved to make these kind of comments, but after watching most of the horrible rankin movies I feel like I've really earned the right to say what I feel about it! I did not make it to the end, and I became one of a half dozen or more outlets (about 1/3 of the audience) after the ragged plot, the lamentable dialogue, and the insulting characterization became too much to bear. this movie is all pose and no art. all style and no substance. is overwhelmed by a terrible performance, a genuinely hideous script, indifferent cinematography, and production values ​​at the student level. how this was funded, started and completed is a mystery to me. I'll bet a million pounds is never released in general. the right critics would shatter it. a very bad movie. shockingly bad. a really really bad effort And that's not to mention the free time of the newborn-kitten-fallen into a deep fryer. totally meaningless, absolutely light, poorly placed together; this film is a terrible embarrassment to the UK cinema.
