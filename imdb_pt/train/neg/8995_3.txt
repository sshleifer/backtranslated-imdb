I missed the start, but I saw most of it. A friend got on DVD in the cheap room at FYE. <br /> <br /> The sketches are all very short, and yet most of them are still very long. Most of them, they seem to have forgotten to have something funny! A lot of racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor, stereotype-based sketches, or sketches that use racist terms for people. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to remember something that I found funny about it. and I'm having trouble ... The Tunnel Vision network logo is a mouth with lipstick and an eyeball. The mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids. Half scary. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most actors have done better things, and it's fortunate that this bomb did not stop them.
