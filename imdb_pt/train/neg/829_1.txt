I heard about this movie and knew it was not very good. But I started watching the movie (on my movie channel) and I was interested. This could be a really big, dark and black satire about the current media morale. The small featurettes in all competitors were good. It's something I do not want to lose. But when the show starts, everything becomes implausible, cheap and half silly. This is where the writer should have added something that would make people think. But instead it is wrapped up and supposing people are dumb. <br /> <br /> The ending is so bad that I give 1. 1. Even if the movie gets promising.
