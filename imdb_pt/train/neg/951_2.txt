*** May contain spoilers. *** If LIVING ON TOKYO TIME was a daring experiment where actors who want to be in real life received parts of the film under the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful anti-anxiety prescriptions. , anti-depression and anti-psychotic medications (this is the classic combination of psychiatric ward that transforms patients into drooling zombies) during filming, so this film would have a lot more interest. Or, if the production of the film was another kind of experiment where all actors were deprived of sleep before and during filming, then TOKYO TIME could be more easily explained. <br /> <br /> As it is, this movie is full of lifeless, low-energy actors. At the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking to his sister, it seemed like he was having trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene, he speaks his lines seated with all parts of the body motionless. From beginning to end, his facial expression is best described as "almost asleep". <br /> <br /> Do not worry about the actors who are talking about each other because these actors can barely finish any dialogue. Everyone speaks in a depressing, monotonous voice. Not laughing. Without shouting. No force. No one has enough energy to break a smile. The result: total and complete boredom. <br /> <br /> And it does not help at all that the direction is simple and amateurish. <br /> <br /> Avoid this lifeless movie at all costs. Better to watch GREENCARD, which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for a story of unconventional Japanese romance, check out the long vacation that has a sufficient amount of everything that lives in TOKYO TIME.
