I'm never much for classic movies. Films like Patton, following my path, how green was my valley, the godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, gone with the wind, Lawrence of Arabia and citizen Kane bored me. However, I prefer to watch any of these movies 3,469 times while I'm tied up in a chair than watching An American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I did the last, I'd probably be sleeping all the time. <br /> <br /> Colorful art direction and music did not interest me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. Dancing and singing can help a person sleep. The dialogue does not mix with Singin 'in the Rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other film I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I only slept 5 minutes the night before. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (Too bad we can not give zeros).
