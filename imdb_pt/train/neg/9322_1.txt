Please do not let the cover of this movie fool you. And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at: that's not it. Usually I'm going to be stupid if it's funny, but this stupidity was so stupid that it almost (or possibly made me) made me stupid. <br /> <br /> The quality of the movie is better than a handheld, but not by much, and It is quite possible that the song was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard. These problems should never be an impediment to seeing a horror movie, but add this incredible cast (cry), and you have a real humiliation. <br /> <br /> The story is about a guy who invites his friends to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He also extends the invitation to his girlfriend in his office. On the way, they find a woman in danger, who is then invited to come along with the other girls. <br /> <br /> The stay in the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a heap when <br /> <br /> From there you (the audience) and the idiots, one, actors , try to find out what is happening and soon begin to distrust each other. Overall, I think I made it sound better than it is. The main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot plotted, the acting poor and the motives baseless. Again this could be forgivable, it was the least funny, but unfortunately it is not. <br /> <br /> The end of the twist is just a twist in which no one would imagine it simply because if you really thought the movie would not make sense anyway. Please do not let this comment prevent you from seeing the wonder of the movie. (Woah, my nose grew just eight inches).
