Parasonia has an interesting premise, but the story is poorly made without any tension or even a logical approach. The cast has not convinced, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played a major role in such films as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good), with the exception of Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West of the great trilogy Re-Animator). But he can play roles like that in his sleep (which is a bit what he does here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all. The story is rather monotonous and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some bloody scenes, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> This could have been so much better, I do not get the good reviews on this. It's below average really.
