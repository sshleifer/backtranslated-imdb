Um ... Okay, I think I have the whole shaky-cam technique, gorilla-style, but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie ... This thing was just a complete mess from the start. Bad acting, bad direction, bad story and horrible filmmaking. As this piece of junk was released I will never know, but it has and unfortunately I watched. Filmed on location in Tennessee by the directing team of Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across The Eyes", I assume it resembles a "Blair Witch" movie, but falls short ... nose plunges on a cliff. I was really embarrassed by these young women, whom I'm sure promised Hollywood stardom, but I ended up in this dung heap. The dialogue is ridiculous and, in fact, aggravates it by listening to it. As this is supposed to be a horror movie is another mystery, as there is nothing even remotely scary about it except for the fact that I watched it ... Try this in size: There are 5 of you and one of her, do the beads and hit her ass ... "The End". Saddly continued (and continues) for over 95 minutes of numbing stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free, and wanted my money back.
