I got a DVD of "Bogeyman" and this stunker was an extra feature. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "assume": it makes a "donkey" of "I" and "I". I had read before seeing that BII contains a lot of footage from the original and that starred the actress Love. While watching "Return of the Boogeyman," I decided to stay inside the original footage to see the notorious toothbrush death scene. Before I knew it, the movie was over. Trick. I think I thought it was BII because it has a title similar to one of the BII's alternative titles. Oh, well, at least that was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the movie's mistakes. Many, many mistakes. Who does this guy Ulli What do you think he is? Does he really think the same movie will sell in different ways? There is nothing original that supports Part III. It's basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a medium who is giving us a tediously annoying game-by-play as it all happens. This is the movie. Oh, and a stereo death scene, but you can read this from another person's criticism. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is lost forever. <br /> <br /> Final Note: This is not a series of movies to watch back to back.
