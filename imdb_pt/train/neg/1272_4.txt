Someone else noticed when they are in the car every time the camera takes a new angle, they switch from road. As in a scene is a residential lane with sidewalks, then they are on a multi-lane road with a partition, next to a two-lane country road with two yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget, but that was just a sloppy movie job. <br /> <br /> I also read the other reviews and disagreed that it was a bad movie. I think if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you can enjoy this movie. If, however, you find your work / not funny then I would recommend staying away from this.
