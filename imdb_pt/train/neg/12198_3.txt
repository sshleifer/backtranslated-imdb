Growing up with Transformers Beast Wars, I was not very familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I've seen the incredible movie, and now that I've seen the oldest cartoon on which it's based, I have to say that I like the original design and the live action movie more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> Not that I do not like the BW characters, I think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> I mean, "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!" sounds much better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me firmly believe that he is a true commander, more than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimus Optimus. Just look on the web! Megatron in the BW character looked more like a humorous version of his more evil version in the original series. <br /> <br /> In addition to what is cooler, changing robots for animals or robots changing in vehicles and spaceships? Give me the original Transformers any day about Beast Wars!
