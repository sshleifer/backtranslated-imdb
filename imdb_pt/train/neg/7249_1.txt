This film rivals "Plan 9" as one of the dumbest movies ever made. Always worry when the same person is: 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western "stuntmen." So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just one example of the film: in the movie, the sheriff has to take a witness to another city for protection. Of course, the bad guys find out and are waiting for them. But what happens? The good guys are walking and a shot sounds and hits a tree near them. When the camera shows us the thugs, everyone is sitting on a log, talking. What's wrong with this photo? <br /> <br /> I could go on. Maybe this movie was conceived as a comedy. If so, it was not so.
