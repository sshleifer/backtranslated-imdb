Primal Species comes from movie legend Roger Corman and as such, everyone who watches this needs to realize that this is a Low Budget B movie and you know it. <br /> <br /> A bunch of terrorists attack a truck and kill an entire army doing this, they believe to hold uranium but not ..... It contains two Dino with a taste for Human Flesh .. Then a crack team that could well be called Delta Force be called OK, this is not Jurassic Park, but the Dino's are never seen clearly because it's obviously a guy in a costume that is not much different from Barney the Dinosaur - just a little less terrifying, but it comes in guys this had about 1% of the Jurassic Park Budget and as such does what it can. <br /> <br /> Does it deserve to be in the bottom 100? .... NOT! I think the almost half of the voters who give a 1 - are being too hard, it's a lot closer to a 4 ... it's actually a lot better than a lot of other movies that are not in the Bottom 100, and have a value of production similar to a production of science fiction channel. (again Films that spend an excessively hard time with the critics here in the IMDb) <br /> <br /> The acting is as expected in a B movie, although none of the actors take it seriously, nor the script <br /> <br /> All in all it's a nice B movie - not for movie Snobs <br /> <br /> ** out of *****
