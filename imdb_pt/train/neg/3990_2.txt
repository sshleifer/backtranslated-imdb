Jungle Fever is highly stylized, stereotyped and seems essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong in the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Even though there is a lot of talent in this film, it is mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative appearances. Moreover, instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is, Spike Lee decides to shake it like a flag in a complaining and annoying way. I spent most of the film, but I could not finish it, and that, for me, rarely happens.
