You have to find out that when the star's name is listed wrong in the opening credits, you're not in for a good time (credit says "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). A good chase of cars, shoot them, blow them up, if all you want is action, because the relationship with the plot exists is, at best, tenuous and completely unbelievable. The character's motivations, especially those of Gooding in the end, are worse than unbelievable, irrational when not hopelessly confused. All I can think of is that Andy Cheng must be a really cool guy to get these good actors to participate in a dirty project (he can not have something in all of them, can you?).
