Martin Weisz, who directed the solid "Rohtenburg", will take the heat, with Wes Craven, to another "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the original legendary, who boasts an unbelievable plot and a dog having a flashback, will forever be erased by this more technically polished remake (just in name). A bunch of national guards (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills full of mutants. One by one, the weekend soldiers get caught. That's it. There's some hardcore violence and a fairly brutal rape scene, but there's not much you can do to get excited. The "heroes" of the film are the usual clich√© and mutants, very different from the original "family" of Craven, remember Brian Thompson of "Cobra", along with some creatures that Stan Winston had left of the film "Wrong Turn". Much of the action takes place in caves, ward "The Descent", and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. One laughable aspect is the addition of Wes and Jonathan Craven from a sympathetic mutant who lurks around his cave as Leatherface in Hooper's original Chainsaw. Weisz will be blamed for this annoying failure, but he's not really guilty because he does his best to keep the suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the planned situations. Not a fan, unfortunately.
