Robert Forster, usually a very strong actor, is lost at sea as a New York family man seeking revenge against the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion. Scary stuff explored for cheap thrills in the "Death Wish". It is not difficult to mock these procedures: the dialogue is full of howler monkeys, the criminal statistics are irrevocably dated, and the supporting characters are ridiculously articulate (particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to leave the office). The court). Low-income production is negligible in its self-justification, especially since violence in our cities has only increased. * in ****
