About the baby: Why was the older brother not assuming that he would be hungry for a bottle or some food or diaper change? He should have screamed without stopping after those many hours without care. Definitely stupid to take the baby from a safe place when he did not need it. <br /> <br /> And why was the road miraculously clear whenever someone wanted to drive somewhere? Did not any trees ripped off the roads and blocked them? <br /> <br /> I can not imagine the cops at the barrier not following immediately after any young woman who knocked her down, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> That said, it was nice to have a movie that the kids could watch safely for a change.
