As a lesbian, I am always looking for movies related to gays and lesbians. However, with this kind of crap out there - it would be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for something to happen - anything! - a story to develop, or just to make some kind of sense. Neither of them occurred. It was just nonsensical scenes, disconnected anyway with anything. The film failed to convey any kind of story or depth to the character. <br /> <br /> After an hour or so of that absurdity, I simply turned it off. <br /> <br /> Do not waste. your time in this absurd. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and does not even deserve it.
