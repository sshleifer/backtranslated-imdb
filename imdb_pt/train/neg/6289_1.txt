This is the most clich√©d mounted and worst romantic comedy I have ever seen. Each scene is worthy of joke and the two main actors - Corey and Danny are so annoying. Corey is very dumb and naive and should never have heard the false promises of Danny. Neve Campbell and the Urban Legend killer are the only redeeming qualities of this poor movie attempt. Danny (Dean Paras) looks like he's in his late thirties and the girl he's trying to sleep with - Corey seems to be still in college. <br /> <br /> Here in Australia, this movie is called Too Smooth; there is nothing good about this movie. 1/10 Avoid
