A family in search of some old roadside attractions to include in their father's desk book faces an old and decrepit old spectacle of aberrations led by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family van breaks off leaving the show, they are forced to stay in an almost abandoned fishing field that was the site of a prison decades earlier. <br /> <br /> There have been many films on the field. "sub genre of horror," which ranges from Tod Browning's beloved "Freaks" (1932) to Alex Winter's hilarious "Freaked" (1993). These are classics (or about to be with 'Freaked'). 'Side Sho', however, will never be. What if you ever achieve classic status. . . well, it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our genre. From the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17 year old daughter who is obviously older than her natural mother, this movie did not have much to do with it. The writing was inferior, but not completely horrible. . . just boring. The direction was bad, and the odd weird effects were horrendous and unbelievable. The acting was terrible and the cast was even worse. Anyone who believed in the age of these two teenagers of camp age should not have known a teenager for a very, very long time. There was too much blood and violence enough to compensate for the lack of any other quality. . . and when there was a bit of violence, it was not well done. And, I can not forget to mention the final fight scenes that were, in all honesty, some of the worst I have ever seen in a movie. Overall, this is an easily forgettable and badly made horror movie that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar box. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
