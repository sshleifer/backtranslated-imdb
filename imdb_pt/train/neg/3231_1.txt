This movie seems to have many people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time. After I have just seen him, I can say that he does not fulfill these affirmations. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is really insane. But overall, the execution was not at all credible. Even the final scene (the eyeball thing) is not really unpleasant. I was hoping for something insane, instead it was of inferior quality to gore extended in films like the ultra low budget Violent Sh! T. Anyone who wants to see a real movie will be disappointed, since it is not a story (though most people certainly know this). Gore's fans will be disappointed, because, contrary to popular belief, the blood and guts here are few and far between. Not to mention that the actress who plays the victim may be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what people say, this movie is not so shocking, it's just a drug. Avoid this.
