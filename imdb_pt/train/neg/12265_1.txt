The special effects of this film are, especially for its time, laughable and used in such an emphasized way that you can not deny its terrible existence. <br /> <br /> The action redefines the term "terrible exaggeration." at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff just redefine "bad." <br /> <br /> *** spoilers *** The charm in this movie can be found in two things: First is the excellent casting of Carel "Lurch" Struycken as the mysterious psychic Gaunt , who can sense where and when people will die and is always there. The second ones are original finds, the SF-Western combination is obviously original, if terrible, but other discoveries are more original, like the shooter Zack Stone being able to feel the pain of the people he throws ( although his performance is short here). Overal ... do not watch this movie, unless you love that old, brutal Carel Struycken, like any Dutchman who deserves it.
