I being of Puerto Rican origin, had mixed fillings on this "documentary". First, I was offended because Mrs. Perez compared Mr. Campos to Che Guevarra. It is also just a point of fact, Mr. John Leguzaimo is not a descendant of Puerto Ricans. Her parents came from Columbia. Whoever did research on this was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our race depends on education. This message should have been resounding throughout this film. Education is our way to freedom and power. I think any future venture from this production team should make it the focus. In my opinion, this movie influenced an anti-American sentiment.
