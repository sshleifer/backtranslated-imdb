The film was made in 1942 and, with World War 11, the film industry decided to capitalize on the fact that the spies were around. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun to watch because of the fabulous dance of Eleanor Powell. The late Miss Powell was certainly a great joke in every sense of the word. She is again paired with a very young Red Skelton here. The two also starred in "I Dood It". <br /> <br /> Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later was superb when the police officer in "Mildred Pierce" again appears as an officer asking Powell to deliver an item. The problem is that Olsen and his rascals are really the Japanese spies. <br /> <br /> Bert Lahr is his usual bright I here and he gets ample support from Virginia O'Brien.
