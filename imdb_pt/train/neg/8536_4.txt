This is a typical production of Steele, in which two people who suffered some kind of tragedy manage to unite despite the difficulties. I would not call it a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they end up. If you do not want to know much about the plot, do not continue reading. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French descent who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop making movies, where she is forced to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, can not realistically draw any accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather unpleasant divorce. He is kind, convincing, and convincing in this role. <br /> <br /> The two meet on the beach through their daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked about art with the boy. . They all become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two leaderships is not great, even if the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a matter. They did their best with a predictable plot and script that bordered on stereotypes. Two people meet, tragedies, major tragedies, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they come together. I wish there was more to it, but here it is in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> I wanted stupid entertainment, and I got it with that. In relation to the genre of romantic films, this can not be memorable. "A Secret Affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), just as some of Steele's earlier books have turned into film.
