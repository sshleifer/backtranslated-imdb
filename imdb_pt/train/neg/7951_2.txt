I gave 'Kôhî jikô' a low score not because it was a bad movie but because it does nothing worth praising. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any work of Hsiao-hsien Hou before, but for the uninitiated (myself included) 'Kôhî jikô' is announced as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was in 1962) The film is an extremely scarce work ... containing very little dialogue, history, music or emotion. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays 'Yoko' a jobless, wandering character who spends his time at his local cafe or vaguely investigating a Taiwanese composer she likes. Tadanobu Asano plays her friend, who works in a record store and occasionally delivers her interest in trains. And that is all. <br /> <br /> We watch Yoko having coffee all by himself ... walk around ... wait for a train ... get a train ... sleep on the train. The kind of mundane reality that anyone in Japan can see daily. Hou captures these common moments in the lives of these characters, but without any meaning for these vignettes is a totally meaningless film to make or watch.
