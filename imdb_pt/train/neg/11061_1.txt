Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it's not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the creators of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man has given a new meaning to the term "finger lickin 'good"! And with all the flashbacks and flash-forwards I had a hard time following the story. All in all, Jeremy Renner's performance was not too bad. You can get him in "S.W.A.T.," in which he plays a former disgruntled police officer. Anyway, I would rate this as 1/10. You only earned 1 because of Renner's performance. There are many books and documentaries on television that do a much better job of covering Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this.
