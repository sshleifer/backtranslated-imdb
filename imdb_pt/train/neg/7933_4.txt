I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this movie is a failure. The whole thing has a canned, fake, sonic feel, with a truly horrible projection on the back screen. It has a good plot idea that the screenwriter buried successfully in a script without clarity, which makes it impossible for the audience to be immersed in the action and really care about any of the characters. The direction is pedestrian and only accentuates how bad the script is, instead of helping to improve it. I've seen lots of "nice soundstage productions" before, but that's not one of them. All it does is make you enjoy Scott / Boetticher movies even more. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is tanned, trimmed, and shines for millions of dollars. He is always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his films. In addition to Scott, the other main reason I wanted to see this movie was how much I liked Wymore in Errol Flynn's movie, "Rocky Mountian." In "Man Behind the Gun," she's so handsome, and you might say she's a good actress, but she was forced to say some pretty stupid phrases, and the blockage she got from the director was really awful. I just saw Phil Carey in "Operation Pacific", and he plays exactly the same character here ... an arrogant pain in the ass that you want to beat in unconsciousness. I think this proves he's a good actor ... he made me hate him. There are some useless attempts at comic relief that only hurt the film, in my opinion. Although there are many elements to beat, I must say I've really enjoyed the two Spanish songs sung in the musical numbers ... but that's not why we're going to see the Randolph Scott movies, right? <br /> <br /> There are definitely worse movies of Scott out there, and this certainly is not unbearable, but it certainly can not be considered anything but mediocre.
