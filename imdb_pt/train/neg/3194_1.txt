I can not believe this movie was made in 1984. It has a ridiculous performance, not to mention one of the most stupid scenarios of all time. Who could ask the greasy Texas sheriff, Joe Don Baker, to escort an Italian that he illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the film tells you virtually nothing - in fact, it's a generic title for an aspiring action / cop movie I can imagine. <br /> <br /> Happy I only saw this on MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield. They observe the female leader's resemblance to Elaine de Seinfeld ("None of them is spongiform") and riff non-stop at Baker's weight. This movie is probably no worse than "Mitchell," but Baker's reputation definitely precedes it: when his title appears at the beginning of the film, Tom says, "I would like to be illiterate so I would not have to read it."
