This is the kind of movie that is watched in a horrified silence and jaw dropped, and still continues to watch, hypnotized, as if watching a slow-motion train crash. And yet, in the back of his mind, thoughts are shaking: "Who on Earth gave the green light to this garbage?" <br /> <br /> Some of the comments from previous reviewers say things like: "A good way to introduce kids to Laurel and Hardy" - an insult to kids everywhere. That children need some kind of training plan to learn to love the comedy pieon shows a deep misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others commented on the fidelity of the characterizations of the two stars of Laurel and Hardy to which I would respond: so WHAT? One would think that the eruption of the BOMBS movie based on beloved series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam) would have taught Hollywood that there are some things that simply can not be recreated. The Laurel and Hardy films are readily available on video: why bother with it? <br /> <br /> As for F. Murray Abraham, a great actor in theater and cinema ... well, all I can say is: he must have had problems with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, away from the television, if this crap pops up!
