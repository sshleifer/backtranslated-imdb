One of the many surveillance epics that flooded the market in the mid-1980s. The routine plot has echoes of "The Magnificent Seven" (believe it or not), action scenes are lamentably manipulated, and special effects are nonexistent. You could do worse .... but the movie is still just a waste of time. (* 1/2)
