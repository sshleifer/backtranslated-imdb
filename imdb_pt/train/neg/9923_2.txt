As I write this review in 2008, we are bogged down in a remake culture. Film studios seem determined to ruin as many classic movies as possible with totally useless upgrades, including King Kong, The Wicker Man, and virtually every movie that has starred Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as "Mass to Do" proves. A totally meaningless color version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Dough for the Do-Do' sucks the life of the original, spreading the color all over Clampett's original material and adding some new controlled images by Friz Freleng. Freleng was a totally inadequate director to play in Clampett's fountain, although in fact no director could expect to approach Clampett's inspired insanity. Inevitably, then, "Dough for the Do-Do" is nothing more than the rape of a classic with a terrifying new title. For cartoon fans like me, the equivalent of a 'Casablanca' coloring.
