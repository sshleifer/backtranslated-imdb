A yawning disappointment, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation for his possible involvement in a case of loss of money. When a bank is stolen and hostages are held against their will by a thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender? its a shot at proving that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intentions of her own, sent to retrieve an item from the bank safe that is stored inside the bank, and you have a trilateral dilemma. Unfortunately, all you can set up in the movie, and nothing worth at the end. Denzel Washington is more uninteresting in an ineffective and unpleasantly egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the film is its competent co-star Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster offers the most amazing and high-caliber performance against the kind as a kind of ruthless and ruthless villain. Clive Owen does not have much to do but hatch and pose, but the depth of his presence and his acting ability achieved more than outweigh his underdeveloped role. It is strange that so much talent is wasted in this film of little impact or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while creating this movie. The most disconcerting aspect of Inside Man, however, is how much unwarranted praise he received. For a movie that seemed to have all the ingredients of a pre-summer blockbuster, this movie falls terribly flat.
