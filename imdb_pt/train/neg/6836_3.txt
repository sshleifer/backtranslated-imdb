Please, even if you are in the worst moods, avoid watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think if anything was right with this movie. On the recommendation of a friend I watched this and I literally released 1h and 48 min of my life in the closet. Poor acting, stupid direction, weak plot and pathetic action sequences - and when you mix that, you get "Double Impact". Even less of the expectations were not met. <br /> <br /> I think I learned something - I never watch Van Damme action movies. They are pure waste of time!
