Another American Pie movie was pushed down our throats and this is the worst of them all. It does not deserve the name American Pie. They should have stopped at "The Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie looks like a stupid porn movie in which they put the title American Pie. When I was watching this I felt like I was watching a different series. Do not fall like American Pie. It has a different mood and is much more rude and has many sex scenes, then the other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this ever. In fact I would not recommend any of the "American Pie Presents" movies. Just stick with the beautiful original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
