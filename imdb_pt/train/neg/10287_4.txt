This is available on Dark Sky Films' "Drive In Double Feature," and as I just finished "Barracuda," I also watched. This is a film that is incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time. <br /> <br /> We start with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign city, but where exactly are they? They stop to look at necklaces of some Chinese seller and try Chinese style clothes in a store, but then we see some Aztec dancers? And all this time, these girls are being followed by two guys, who end up losing the secrecy they did not have to chase after the girls in a wild ride through town, and finally catch them. <br /> <br /> It seems like one of the girls has a coin around her neck, and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it? So in flashback, we came back to find out. And how did they know she had that coin? Hard to say, really. <br /> <br /> Now back in the day when these two women were 10 years old, they went out with their sisters and sister's boyfriends on a boat, and then stopped to get air in their tanks, they tow this boy back to his original dock, just so that his grandfather leaves and invites the "young" ones to the herbal tea with his grandmother. But not everyone drinks tea, Todd went back to the boat to check on the girls, and when they are away, the boat explodes, and when they return home, their friends mysteriously disappeared. Well, it seems that these "gentle people" raise their own vegetables, but expect the meat to go through a spell and serve herbal tea. <br /> <br /> But the girls and Todd left the place. island, but now they are returning, escorted by their captors, and they are there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one has ever shown the girls where they were before. There also seems to be another person on the island, and the thugs mysteriously begin to die, one by one, and since there are only three, it does not take long. And there's even a kind of happy ending that will leave the viewer as baffled as during the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The two bad guys seem to be speed fanatics with anger problems, and combined with no acting ability, are hilarious. The hickory-like family is also devoid of acting ability, despite the fact that the grandfather is Hank Worden, who has appeared in many movies and TV shows. The action is confusing, the locations are even more confusing, and the island looks like Southern California. <br /> <br /> So, what the hell is this? Not sure, but certainly worth seeing once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre.
