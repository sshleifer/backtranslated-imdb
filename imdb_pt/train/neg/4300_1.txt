Buford's Beach Bunnies gives B & T grade films a bad name. As a fan of the genre, I was shocked to find little attempt to exploit the talents of the young actresses. I am referring specifically to the distinct lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. What is the next generation of sad teens watching this on TV late at night supposedly?
