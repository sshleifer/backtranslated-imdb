In standard view, this is a purely horrible movie. However, it ranks an almost perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale. I can think of some real comedies that make me laugh as hard as I watched this movie. The ghost of Andy Griffith dressed in Native American dress puts me all the time in hysteria. I would not waste gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it, but if you're lying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on TV, check it out.
