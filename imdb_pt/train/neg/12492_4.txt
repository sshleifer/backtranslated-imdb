This is one of them movies that has an incredible video box but has camra work with strangers and unknown actors who speak with bad dialogue. It is so dark when the deaths happen that you can hardly see it anymore the film is difficult to understand . The only star on this one is Vanessa Sanchez from WCW (Tygres on WCW before she quits) and is a good actress. I like low budget movie especially those who have mistakes because they are fun to watch but cut unfourtunatly is not one of them.This movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is not blockbuster but if you need something new to watch, then rent Severed.
