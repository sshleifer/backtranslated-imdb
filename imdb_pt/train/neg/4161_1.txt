A stuttering plot, uninteresting characters, and insignificant dialogues (to say the least) plague this TV production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion-dollar production budget. <br /> <br /> The characters are not credible, in their professed motives, actions or occupations. The plot looks like a lousy Dungeons and Dragons (TM), but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are serious problems of continuity and the degree of meaningless interaction between the characters has this author, at least, shuddering. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. Watch any Dark Angel episode and you'll have better acting, dialogue and plot. Disgusting.
