In the unlikely event some aspiring directors read these comments, I'd like to offer some advice (free!) From the viewer's point of view. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to make a parody of exotic adventure movies, go ahead. DO NOT try to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, having a silly comic relief character killed and beheaded and following him with a monkey swinging a tree and dropping a coconut on the head of a cannibal only makes it seem like you did not have IDEA what kind of movie you wanted to do. This is annoying, meandering, cheap, racist ... you get the picture. A couple of smart moments and some glimpses of nudity from Kathy Shower (very pissimo here) will hardly be worth it. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
