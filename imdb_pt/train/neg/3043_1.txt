This movie is supposed to be a lighthearted tale about Santa and his "magical and mystical wonders". But instead, it seems to be quite scary. Two things in this movie that stand out in my mind are horrifying: 1) the way Santa looks. Have you seen a more awful Santa Claus? and 2) the "wicked representative of Satan." The simple and strange Pitch dances are sick to watch. Just watch this movie if it's the MSTed version or if you like a good laugh. I can not believe this is a children's movie.
