I hated this show when I was a kid. This was on the day the children show that the characters actually had an accent, not just the Generic General General Dialect that we are accustomed to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf was from the south. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch who wanted the flute. This always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute only bothered me and I would not have had any trouble taking it off! <br /> <br /> Just a comment on the similarity between Pufnstuf and the McDonalds's 1970s commercials. which others have mentioned: Pufnstuf stole McDonalds. At the height of McDonalds's popularity, the TV show (or rather, its creators) sought to license the McDonalds characters to the show, but when McDonalds turned down the TV show, the characters changed a bit and passed the same. They even hired ex-employees from the McDonalds advertising agency and the dubbers to do the TV shows. McDonalds sued and won. Look for the Pufnstuf McDonaldland process and you will find many articles on the subject.
