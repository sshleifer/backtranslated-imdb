Why, oh, why do not they learn? When you have a nice and juicy exploration trick, use it! Do not joke around, trying to be deep and thoughtful; you'll just end up looking silly. <br/> <br/> Christmas Badly is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw a little too much of Mom kissing (Dad dressed as Santa) when he was a child. So, of course, Harry grows obsessed with Christmas, and finally, when his disillusionment becomes too great, he turns around, dresses in Santa Claus and wanders around town distributing toys to good kids and cruelly killing anyone he considers disobedient. <br /> <br /> Simple enough, and not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other holiday-themed horror movies use the same schtick?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to be more "Santa Claus, Portrait of a Serial Killer" than "Silent Night, Mortal Night." Two-thirds of the film is spent documenting Harry's slow but inevitable collapse when I would be willing to buy the premise until the opening titles were rolling. You know that a horror movie is in trouble when you find yourself asking the killer to continue with it. Maybe Harry's fall into madness may have been irresistible at the hands of a competent director, but unfortunately, we have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only movie, and it shows. The action jumps vertiginously from scene to scene, without establishing shots or clear visions of the actors, to let us know where we are and who we are seeing. <br /> <br /> Even when the film is running, we're still trying to pile up aids to Harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. More depressing than scary, the evil of Christmas is to be avoided.
