If the team behind "Zombie Chronicles" has read this, here are some advices: 1. In a "Twist Ending" movie, it is not a good idea to insert close-ups of CADA DEATH IN THE MOVIE in opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know that you have produced it with little money and - to be fair - you have worked miracles with your budget, but, please hire people who can really act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesticulate at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you've been setting part of your movie in the past, do it only if you have the accessories and costumes of the day. <br /> <br /> 4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Of course, we do not want twists that do not make sense, but signal "revelation" as soon as you introduce a character? This is not a good idea. Congratulations to the guys for trying, but in all honesty, I'd rather they did not have ... <br /> <br /> Just for the complete zombies.
