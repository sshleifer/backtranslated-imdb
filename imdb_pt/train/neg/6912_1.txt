The only reason I gave it 1 out of 10 is because the option to give zero of 10 was not allowed. This was the biggest waste of time I've ever spent. For about 75 minutes, you are subject to the WORST performance (and I do not mean it in a good way, as in KILLER NERD who had a terrific good acting) and a plot that is not just ridiculous but which also has absolutely no NOTHING to do with a massacre. The reason I even rented this piece of shit was because it has a massacre in the title. That being said, there was only one murder in the whole movie and it was really bad at it. You spend more time watching children quarreling and doing yard work than anything. Speaking of children, the little actor is probably the most annoying child actor ever since he passed home through the graveyard. Did I mention it was filmed on video as well? If you want to throw away your money and over an hour of your life, then, by all means, watch it. But if you savor your money and sweaty time, then move away as far as possible.
