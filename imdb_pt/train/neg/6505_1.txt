A confusing mess from start to finish. As they used to say about the Beatles hits, there was a secret message if you played the LP back. If someone had the patience to watch scenes from the end-to-end movie, you would have the same degree of disappointment. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this psychedelic mix of flashbacks and fake beginnings, the clearest characters were the film's proponents, seeking revenge if the film was not rated. There was nothing to like about these two either. Overacting, screaming and threats were delivered in comics. I think one dimension is an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Okay, so maybe the artists are rolling their eyes, revealing the fact that, unlike them, we commoners just do not understand it. Well, I'm afraid there was nothing to get. And the two main sins of any bad movie were taken from start to finish. A non-existent and pathetic plot, if you want to call it that, and by far the worst, not a single character you care about.
