Well, what can I say, there are B-Grade movies and there are B-Grade movies and this definitely falls into the latter. However, since it is obvious that even film producers know that it is not a credible film (take a look at the final credits) can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a condemned psychopathic killer is killed. He accidentally has his genetic material mixed with some experimental acid that is combined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes the form of a snowman - if you can believe it. The snowman, Jack Frost, is behind the city sheriff who put him behind the bars. In doing so, Jack Frost ends up killing half of the city. <br /> <br /> This movie has no fright and the effects alone remind me of the B-level movies of the 50's. This is all worth watching for a laugh. A movie to pass the time.
