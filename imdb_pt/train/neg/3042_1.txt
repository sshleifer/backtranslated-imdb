I'm allowed to write 1000 words about this movie, but one word could be enough: bizarre. Husband and I did not laugh as much as gawk in this truly awful movie. We continue looking at each other with our best "What ...?" expressions. There is no way to properly describe this movie. Murderous tomatoes were funny, but that's just sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and puts them on film for others to see? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird and strange movie and then packs it up as if it were appropriate for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa Claus, do not let him see this movie. Preteens can watch - probably with "What the ...?" expressions on their faces. If you decide to inflict this movie on others, you may want to increase your eggnog. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.
