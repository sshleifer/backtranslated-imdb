Judy Holliday hit gold in 1950 with George Cukor's film version of Born Yesterday, and from that point on, her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to hit the gold again. <br /> <br /> never happened. In "It Should Happen to You" (I can not think of a nicer title, by the way), Holliday still has another variation on the blonde dumb one that may not be that stupid, after all, but everything about this movie seems heated and a half heart. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe to be his first movie role, can not muster enough energy to liven up this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning, so most of the time it just sits there waiting for the movie to catch up. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're in love with Holliday, you'll enjoy it; otherwise I would not bother. <br /> <br /> Grade: C
