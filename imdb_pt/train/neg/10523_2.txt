In the first forty minutes, the Empire really shapes itself: it seems to be a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster movie. At the time I did not know why, I thought it was good, but now I know. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this film is that it is purely and completely unpleasant. I do not mind movies with psychopaths and things, to prove a point - take Jackie Brown, for example - but they're all so terribly shallow in it, but this is obviously thrown in for entertainment. You literally feel a knot in the stomach. Another major problem is the protagonist. He is presumptuous, arrogant, but ironically - not so bad. He does not seem tight enough to be a drug killer. The fact is that at the end of the day, this movie is completely pretentious. Not slippery, not smart, just boring and pointless - this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * out of ***** (1 of 5)
