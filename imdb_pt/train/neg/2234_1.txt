I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I realize why. The acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. Lighting and sound are poor at best. The plot makes little sense, even when sober (ATTENTION: I do not advise watching this movie when sober). This movie looks like you're watching the home movie of someone who does not get out much. It's really a pity that all the very little money spent on this project has been so great, I'm anxious to see if any of them wrapped still have a career other than eva longoria who is the only "star" in this movie. who apparently was not hit with the baton of bad action. I'm sorry none of these criticisms sound constructive, but I'll tell James Cahill a thing, do not try again. In the words of squirlyem "Your severely lacking in good department".
