This is one of those movies that is more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I make my assessments based on how much I enjoyed or was entertained with the film, so I am giving the grade 4. If I were to classify as an academic film, however, it would gain a 10. <br /> <br /> It is filmed in a very interesting way, as a pseudo-silent movie with elements of sound effect and reality. It is meant to convey disconnected memory and fragmentation of the mind, and it is interesting in these respects. <br /> <br /> However, the film has many disgusting elements that I did not find so much fun. They are mostly disruptive. It has some very interesting images as well, and some interesting concepts, but some of the relationships between the characters (especially between mother and son) are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will attract you or it will not. For me, it was interesting from the academic point of view, but it was not a good observation, and I probably will not come back to it a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you are looking for entertainment. 10/10 from the academic point of view.
