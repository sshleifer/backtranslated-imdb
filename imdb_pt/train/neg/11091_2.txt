Denzel is the only right thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe once in an early stage, this movie would be better. Someone decided to cut some action points and plot at the beginning of the film, distributing most of the story in the first 5 minutes. This and ruin everything that will accumulate in the rhythm and pace that the film could have had before. <br /> <br /> So, first, it confuses you, and then that puts you off. The dramatization goes beyond the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> Of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this can instill in viewers. Granted, do it this way if you're looking for it ... knock yourself out.
