After Highlander 2 (which I'm still in denial about), I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames had at least a few hacks that worked. Who wrote this movie knew nothing about computers, except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she has watched the original movie. The acting is neither convincing. Please, save yourself, under no circumstances watch this movie. I do not care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can not turn the TV off. THIS MOVIE WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE.
