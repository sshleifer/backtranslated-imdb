I usually only write reviews for movies that I really hated or really liked. And, as you can probably tell by the number of stars up there, I did not like that. So far, I suppose you've read about the plot or maybe even watched the movie, so I'll skip the summary. Let's break this down, pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: The concept: The premise was created to be interesting. Using chaos theory as a theme was interesting. However, it was not performed as well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the Chaos theory was kind of misrepresented. The event that occurred in the film seemed more like a planned coincidence than anything else. I think the effect of the butterfly was represented by the whole "God (s) causes the Tsunami to bring back the statue." The presentation comes off as really sloppy though. Some people call it smart, but it seems to be just another action movie. <br /> <br /> Plot: Is it just me, or does it seem like Kamal just threw this together to give you an excuse to play? ten roles The plot is extremely planned; Govind continued to lose the bottle so many times in obscure accidents (his friend mixes the flask with a package he was sending to India, a crazy old lady just tossed the flask into an idol, half of the cast only happens unexpectedly to find himself in the same hospital, and the affair with the idol just mingled with one that belonged to a famous singer.) CGI: Oh god, the CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3, and those sucked. Immediately, I could tell which parts were animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that submerged cars do not look like that. Stunts: Yes, I now that action scenes in Tamil movies are not realistic, but the action scenes in this movie were horrible and really distracted me from the story. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal would be playing people with similar skin tones, so the two fake white guys and the fake Japanese Aikido caught me off guard. However, it was still very bad, I could easily tell which ones were wearing masks. <br /> <br /> The songs: The music was distracting and out of place in many cases. <br /> <br /> Asin: Your character was possibly the most annoying in the movie. She was noisy, servile, and irrationally obsessed with this idol. In fact, I found myself wanting her to die. <br /> <br /> Lot and refrigerator Logic: Let me get this straight: a lab monkey was smart enough to go through a password locked door, but not smart enough to tell the difference between a bar chocolate and a flask with a deadly virus. And then, a former CIA agent who after the vial calculates that he is going to India. Instead of following him immediately, he marries a pole dancer first. A famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks in a small-town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available. In addition, he is shot in the throat with a bullet. You'd think he'd be dead, but the magic bullet cleared his tumor. You read right, a BULLET ripped off the tumor. <br /> <br /> Pros ... The Naidu Character: Possibly the only nice part of the movie was his comedy.
