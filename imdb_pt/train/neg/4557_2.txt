OK, it's very rare that I complain about something I received for FREE. So I guess this movie pushed me over this limit. I saw in the Hollywood Cemetery for FREE and left very disappointed. One of the audience members' question to the director about using Native American references as "bookends" instead of being better embedded in the film basically tells everything about what this movie HAS FAILED. <br /> <br /> US NATIONAL REFERENCES --- The references of Native Americans have actually felt displaced and planned. It is obvious that this director and writer tried to approach an arena in which he has never played before. They should have adhered to the old saying "write about something you know". If they are indeed versed in this certainly did not show in the film or the beauty of this unique culture was not given their own justice. <br /> <br /> Clichés and NO NOSE --- I agreed to see this movie based on the fact of being an indie. So I held this to higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie and saw it before it became so popular. Before I even left for wide publicity I was already delirious how successful it will be. UNFORTUNATELY I could not say the same about "expiration date". "Sunshine" led us to clichés incidents, but the filmmakers were so clever in their approach that the result would take us in a different direction, avoiding the trap of being a "cliché." This film, on the other hand, had no way of falling into the trap because it was TRAPPED from the beginning. The psychopath's antics, the Hendrix couple, etc. <br /> <br /> I hate to say it, but the best and worst movie I've seen this year were both indies. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this movie is the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the filmmakers for doing so well with their relatives in the cemetery.
