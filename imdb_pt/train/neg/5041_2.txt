The film Purple Butterfly, by Ye Lou, puts a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against Japanese forces in the war in Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and his former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance encounter. <br /> <br /> I agree with the Paris critic. The film replaces a complex and semi-historical plot with a plot without giving the audience a single reason to worry about the characters or their causes. The sudden displacement of time does not help, for it seems completely unjustified and meaningless. Usually I do not care about dark films, but the absence of light, camera shaky images and the generally bad techniques of making movies really make it a hard movie to watch and get interested. I also agree with the viewer. from Georgia that this movie "has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography," but I do not think this helps the movie. The backdrop to the film is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century, and I do not believe you can do justice to editing it as if it were a Michael Bay movie. Excessively melodramatic moments do not increase your acceptance. <br /> <br /> The actors are all suitably melancholic. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range, as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, meditating and seeming generally irritated. However, at least she adds some variety to this role by having sex and engaging in the worst lovemaking scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disappointing movie, especially seeing as it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10
