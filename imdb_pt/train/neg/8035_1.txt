This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a fan of horror movies and I'm renting any horror movie unless it's not made for tv. When looking at the box, it says it's classified as R for blood and some tongue ... Where was the blood? Was it the scene of a good death where you actually saw blood? I could have forgotten that there was some brief nudity or some good dialogue. There was not even a remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie. Sometimes horror movies are great because they're so stupid, but that's sad.
