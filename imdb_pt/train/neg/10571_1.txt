My wife is fanatic about this show. So I bought the seasons one to three and the fourth season is in order. I personally think the show is a great farce that the cast is equally bad. Alyssa Milano should have stayed with the other junk films she made, such as Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampire, to name a few, the other female support cast members are equally inept in their portraits. I saw better special effects in the old Republic Pictures brochures I saw as a child. I can understand why the male protagonists stayed on the show for short periods of time, even though I do not know if they chose it or not. Please. please do not renew for another season, since it is enough, Bob
