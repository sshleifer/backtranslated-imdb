In seventeenth-century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. Her name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey around the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. While in the sea a violent storm swallows its precious gold destined to buy the arms and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must fight against all odds to survive and secure the fate of her beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is an epic multi-dollar action adventure set in three continents. <br /> <br /> Starring cinematic legends Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davis (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurais, Throne of Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a masterpiece of the film. <br /> <br /> The winning Osaka stunt team bought for Bob Ivy's screen brings exciting battle sequences / action, such as the opening battle against the Eastern Army, the attack on Mayeda's ship carrying invaluable jewelry And the final clash between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. A good musical score by famed composer John Scott is also present. Director Sho Kusugi has not even been nominated for an Oscar for this film that deals with emotional conflict, such as the death of the Mayedas family, the pursuit of love and acceptance after mourning, and all of this is extremely well treated. Highly recommended cinematographic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please note: All of the above are opposite for the movie in question.
