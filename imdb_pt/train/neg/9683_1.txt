I'm giving a pretentious piece of junk to 1 simply because I do not believe there's a worse movie in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie, I hate acting, dialogue, setting, writing and direction. I hope everyone who's been involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest circle in hell. <br /> <br /> Damn this disgusting waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day for this movie to be Just an invention of my imagination. I pray that I dream about the movie, and that I will never have to see it again in my local video store again. <br /> <br /> BURNS IN HELL
