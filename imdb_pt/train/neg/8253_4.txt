The film had a cute opening, I really believed it was in one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a while ... there was something in particular "strange" about the way the film was created, realistic but a bit abstract and mystical But then the plot began to become increasingly unrealistic. To say that the ending was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost a euphemism ... The most typical romantic ending, where everything is great for all the 'nice' characters. A scene in which the main character realizes that he has made a mistake and pursues the "woman of his dreams" only to confess his love for her before a crowd of supporters. Let's go. In the end, the 'good guys' win, 'bandits' loose ... You get it. A waste of a potentially interesting movie.
