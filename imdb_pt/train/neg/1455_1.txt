I have rarely been subjected to this kind of nonsense in a movie that is supposed to be based on a historical figure. A horrible joke from a movie, I cringed everywhere. Terrible, banal, distorted and full of lies and half-truths. <br /> <br /> Hitler's famous biographer, Ian Kershaw, was originally a consultant for this film. However, he found the script so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he declined, and also demanded that they stop using his name as a source (it was embarrassing to think people would think he was involved). <br /> <br /> One scene shows Hitler hitting his dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loved animals above people. He brought the most stringent animal welfare laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal experimentation. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film transforms its Iron Cross gain into a farce involving bribery. Absolute lies. He was rewarded for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time. <br /> <br /> There are no historical documents showing that Hitler has ever had a sexual relationship with his niece. Not one. <br /> <br /> In addition to these, Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage film. <br /> <br /> If he was halfway as ignorant, demented and as thick as he is in this senseless movie, as in real life, you would not even know he ever existed. It does not matter if he becomes the leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Go watch Downfall and give it a lot of space.
