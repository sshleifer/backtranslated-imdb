I think Jason Lee has a huge potential, but this was the WRONG vehicle in which to attempt to leave as a star. The plot is horrible, the comedy is horrible. I laughed twice, I guess from relief, because in retrospect they were really bad jokes. I got scared of Fletch's future, and had to console myself that it was the movie that had flaws, not Lee. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend looking at the silence. photos on this site to find out this instead of this movie. Save your time. 1 star.
