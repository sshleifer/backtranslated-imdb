First, the CGI in this movie was horrible. I watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. In the end, when the owner of the park is dead, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've ever seen. Even the Night of the Living Dead had better animation. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie had almost no plot. Why were they on that particular island? Well, that was not said in the movie. And why would people keep going into the cat area? Does not make sense. <br /> <br /> One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. In what could be called the movie "B made for TV movie", the acting was very good. Parry Shen stood out in particular. <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. May be good for some memorable quotes.
