Writer / director Bart Sibrel bases his work here around a can of film he says has been erroneously sent to him by NASA. He says it shows the astronauts faking the television images of their trip to the moon, employing camera tricks. The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time, and the editors on the ground made up these raw images in just seconds from the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Sibrel's research is so sloppy that he does not realize the "backstage" footage is actually taken largely from the 30-minute live broadcast (also on the reel) that was seen by millions, not hidden in NASA coffers, as he suggests. And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his own conspiracy narration on the audio of the astronauts in the footage, because listening to the astronauts in his own words clearly explains that the astronauts were just testing the camera, not pretending to shoot. <br /> Finally, anyone can see the original footage without having to buy the hacked version of Sibrel. (He shows more of Zapruder's film about JFK's murder than about his "smoking gun.") Sibrel thinks he's the only one who saw it. What is more revealing are the clips from that rough footage that Sibrel chose NOT to use, such as those clearly showing that the appropriately distant Earth was eclipsed by the window sashes and so on, destroying their claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the windows of the spacecraft. create the illusion of a distant Earth. As in most such films, Sibrel relies on insinuations, inexperienced assumptions, misleading remarks, and selective quotations to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is no fragment of real evidence.
