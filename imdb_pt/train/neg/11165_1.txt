I mean, really ... or all of a sudden I've lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and just not funny. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview, I knew it would not be a great movie, I just did not think it would be that bad. .. What happened to the good old days where you could find funny lines in some movie? When did the actors not have to play ridiculous roles in an attempt to be funny? Now we come across movies like this, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4, where I could not find the funny parts !! <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece of crap <br /> <br /> PS (Sorry for my English)
