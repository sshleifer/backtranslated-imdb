As much as we love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. A publicity stunt at the dirty end of what appears to have been a distinct and idealistic career, Pacino plays his role looking like a bed undone and assaulting everyone with a totally false and inconsistent southern accent. The plot Sai from one side to the other with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind coils (and then retreats). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is there, not doing much. His scenes with Pacino are simple and unconvincing. Hard to believe that meant so much to each other. There is no energy there. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone, on the other hand, lit the screen. She was electric and her scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting in the film, but not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
