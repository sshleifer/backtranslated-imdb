I rented this movie purely on the fact that the cape attracted me. However, as soon as the movie started, I regretted it. It looks like they used a homemade video camera to shoot this movie and let a toddler do it. They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try to scare people, but I found myself laughing, I could have put it together and done a better job. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, I felt that I had some good ideas, but because of dishonest lines and, in some cases, acting, they were obfuscated. There was no direction. <br /> <br /> I did not want to go through all this because it caused me physical pain to watch, but I always finish what I start, so I took a deep breath and let it continue. Definitely, 98 minutes of my life were wasted. <br /> <br /> I would spare myself the embarrassment of knowing that you watched 'Haunted Boat' and found something that is more fun. I'm a fan of low budget horror movies, but this was a big disappointment I thought nothing could get worse after 'Terror Toons', but that made me reconsider. A disappointment to his genre. <br /> <br /> * out of ***** (The star is for the ideas of having your worst fears coming to them)
