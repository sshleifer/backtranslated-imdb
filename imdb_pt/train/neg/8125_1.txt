"The Bat People" is a very bad movie that deserved the MST3K treatment as well as the other movie "The Creeping Terror". <br /> <br /> In it, we are in some kind of mountainous terrain full of bats. . We see many things happen, like flying bats and attacking and other things, station wagon chases, emergency room mishaps, and more! All that, plus the tacky mediocrity of the 1970s (Hey, think of "Mitchell" here!), Making "The Bat People" really one of the best of the last episodes of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" made in the series! Moviewise, it's awful. It should be avoided like the plague unless Tom Servo and Crow are watching with you. <br /> <br /> "The Bat People" - more like "The Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 course !!!!!
