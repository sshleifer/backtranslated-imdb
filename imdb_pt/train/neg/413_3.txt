This is the kind of movie that leaves you with an impression. Writing a story is about making a movie. <br /> <br /> Incredible visual effects. Very good acting, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect .. Except .. The story is just poor and so, everything fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine this, if you had the power to be invisible .. What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) could think of nothing but petting and raping women. That's all your supposed "genius" mind would think. Does he try to gain extra power? No. He does not even bother to search for a way to be visible again. The guy is basically a crazed sex maniac. <br /> <br /> Add to that the laboratory atmosphere, you have all these young guys .. Playing jokes like they were in a bar .. If it were not for all the white coats and outfits, you would think this is a bad imitation of "Cheers". Very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are nothing more than lambs to the Hollow Man wolf. Even as a thriller, the film falls too short because most of the "thrilling" scenes are written so poorly and are filled with illogical behavior by the actors who are just yelling "this is just a stupid thing that I have to do so the hollow man can find me alone and kill me. " <br /> <br /> If you read the real book while the scientist (Cane) goes after the women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thoughts that come into your character. In the movie, Cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded market to rub his body on women and hang out on top of him. Just sad.
