Wow. That's all I can say now. Who writes these things? Who produces these things? What respectful actor would agree to "act" on these things? Oh my gosh! I do not know how I did it through this movie, but I assume the fact that I had like 8 cups of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake. Good God! It was one of the most drained and predictable cinematography scenes I've ever seen ... and for record, I never plan to 'witness' again. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie when I bought the DVD (ERROR # 1). I mean ... I realized, hey! Julia Stiles. I like her. She is cool. I'll watch it as soon as I get home (ERROR # 2). I tried to watch it without groaning every five minutes wondering when that pile of crap would come to an end, really I did. But I did not succeed. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... what's with that thing where he imagines what would happen and then go back to real life? That was annoying enough when Dad used to do it on 'Parenthood' like ten years ago. The 'jokes' - and I BELIEVE, it's VERY hard to call them that - they are stupid, the characters are banal and forgettable, the plot is totally predictable ... all this creates a movie that should be DUMPED FROM HISTORY RECORDS! I should have realized something was wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this movie. It was probably a straightforward DVD. <br /> <br /> For anyone thinking of watching, I have advice. NOT! For God's sake ... NO !!! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can not get rid of it ... No one, and I want to say no one wants to buy from me! And I'm talking about second- and third-hand thrift stores that would buy the mud from their shoes and put them in the shop window. This should let you know exactly what CRAP is like.
