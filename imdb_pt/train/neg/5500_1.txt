This movie tries hard, but completely misses the fun of the TV series of the 60's, which I'm sure people remember with fondness. Although I'm 17, I watched some of the shows on YouTube a long time ago and it was fun and fun. Unfortunately, this movie does little justice to the series. <br /> <br /> Special effects are quite below standard, and this was not helped by the flat camera. The script was also monotonous and without any sense of admiration and humor. Other low-script movies are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, and Addams Family Reunion. <br /> <br /> Now I will say that I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was poorly executed and sold out too early, and I honestly am not sure why it is something for the family to enjoy. And I was pissed at the talking suit, despite Wayne Knight's voice work. <br /> <br /> But what irritated me the most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah. , all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels did some good performances before, but he did not seem to have any idea what he was supposed to be doing, and the character of Elizabeth Hurley seemed sadly useless. Daryl Hannah is an adorable and generally overlooked actress, and I liked the idea of ​​her being the love interest, but unfortunately you see very little of it, (not to mention that the Monster attack will probably scare the kids away rather than haunt them) form with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government agent. Christopher Lloyd acquits himself best, and as an actor I really like Lloyd (he was in two of my favorite movies, Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I really like Back To The Future) but he was given little to work on, and had a tendency to exaggerate rather wildly. <br /> <br /> Overall, as much as I wanted to like this movie, I was impressed. Instead of being fun, it seemed useless, and that's a shame because it had so much potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted on a bad run. 1/10 Bethany Cox
