After seeing the credits with only one name I recognize and who was the preacher in this film (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this film and I was not disappointed. A man is planning to kill his new wife by convincing others that she is crazy and will take her own life. Unbeknownst to her husband is that the plastic skull he wears, in contrast, a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife takes revenge on his mind and wears a real skull. A simple plot with a touch of irony in the end. If you are tired late at night and need sleep, this will help you sleep that sleep.
