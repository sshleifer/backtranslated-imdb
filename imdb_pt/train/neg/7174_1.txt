I wanted to read the other reviews before leaving my review and most definately rules: This movie is aweful! From acting to unrealistic animation to countless mistakes. I was really hoping the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (I can not extend the flaps without the motors). The landing gear can not be lowered unless you have electricity. That little fan that was going was not enough at any point to lower the landing gear. The only thing I found very peculiar was when they landed, the rear wheels landed and then the nose broke, thus suspending the plane with the two rear tires in the air. How did the captain apply the left and right brakes to tires that did not touch the ground? Did they forget the spoilers? Word to the director: Find out * everyone * you can about airplanes before trying a movie "airplane". Sorry for the technical speech, but I give this movie 1/10.
