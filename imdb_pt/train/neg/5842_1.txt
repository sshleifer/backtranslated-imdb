What a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts well, with the title sequence, but it's as good as it looks. <br /> <br /> The movie is about rats turning into monsters and moving on. on a kill. The acting is not too bad, but the script is useless and the movie is not scary either despite the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It's really amazing that some group has put together this trash bag and thought it would make a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's rubbish and I ask you not to waste a minute of your life! One in ten.
