Having watched it after receiving the DVD for Christmas 2005, I came here to rummage through it - but after reading the other reviews, I do not have the guts. Clearly this is a movie that worked very well for children of a certain age. Well, do not let me be a complete Grinch; it may still work for some children - if they are not too saturated with media and have not become overly sophisticated visually, for example watching all LOTR and Harry Potter. But if you're an adult, stay miles away; You will not like this. <br /> <br /> The good bits: Barbara Kellerman as the Witch, especially in her early scenes with Edmund, creates the right mix of charismatic evil and restrained madness. (At Stone Table, she's a little overdone.) Michael Aldridge, in the minor role of Professor Jeffrey S. Perry, as Tumnus, also has the kind of polished and skillful acting that we expect from the best of the BBC. dramas And Aslan's costume works very well, surprisingly well considering. They have the right eyes. <br /> <br /> The bad parts: almost everything else, but two areas in particular. One, the cast. England is full of good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive children from the British school. How could they have ended those four stiffs? They move like wooden soldiers and they talk too. Peter has no gravity or charisma (and is noticeably lower than his supposedly younger brothers); Edmund is just a whiner; and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is so dramatically, visibly, drastically wrong for this part that I can not imagine how she got the job. <br /> <br /> Two, the animal costumes. Again, it looks like they worked for some kids. If the kids are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are incredible and compelling characters, they may be thrilled with this movie. But for a spectator with the sophistication of, say, a 12-year-old boy who saw Prisoner of Azkaban? When Lord Beaver comes out from behind the tree, there will be cruel laughter and mockery. The clothes just do not work - I could not, and I think any adult or modern teenager could not suspend disbelief by looking at Mr. Beaver. The animation drawn later (griffins, etc.) works better, is easier to take. <br /> <br /> So: ten stars for the very young and tender of the soul; all the others have read, or reread the book and watch the much better movie unfolding in their imagination.
