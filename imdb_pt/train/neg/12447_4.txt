Sondra Locke stinks at this movie, but then she was a horrible 'actress'. Unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including her real-life boyfriend, Clint Eastwood, down the drain with her.) But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one? A reading from the script should have told him that To be a real snorer.It's an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or plot.Add yourself bored, little acting, even the normally good Eastwood.There is absolutely no action except a few arguments and, as far as I'm concerned, this movie is at the top of the I think watching the paint dry or the grass growing can be more fun.
