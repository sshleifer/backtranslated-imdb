With its complement, MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES and DREAMSCAPES can only be seen as the absolute point of the genre that began so auspiciously with TWILIGHT ZONE and EXTERIOR LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that it does nothing to interest a comparatively adult audience, instead targeting the ten-year-old who are only able to count the sacks of the body, and hardly that. And thus rudeness is king, and the King is rudeness. <br /> <br /> Is Stephen King simply illiterate? in general he has the ability to tell stories of Bart Simpson. Since he can not read his only inspiration is the cinema. <br /> <br /> It is true that cinema is not such a bad place to start, since it generally escaped the onslaught of "Realism." But these movies are just the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to WRITE, you have to go deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close acquaintances. But even so, it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least the FOUR CAR ROOM is a clear indication of what is wrong. You can almost imagine this pathetic jerk sitting at his desk trying to think of something scary. <br /> <br /> No, remember, trying to accurately describe the horror of the system of which he is an integral part, making the stupid stupid but trying to invent a scary story for his nephew. Suppose you were paralyzed and people thought you were dead and started to open up like they do in those autopsies! Would not that be disgusting? And that, boys and girls, is history. <br /> <br /> And the characterization? Oh yeah, he's one of those costumes, he's never really enjoyed life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he's screaming? Well, they can not really hear you, you know? he's saying he's going to sue the hospital, but he's not that important anymore, you see, lying there (or lying down, I can never remember) and everything. And he's thinking: Oh no please, please do not cut me and this is terrible, lying (or lying) like this? now, would not that be a great story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, I think it was the great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of that snake again, oh yeah, a BOOMSLANG ?? There's a ring, right? <br /> <br /> Let's make it a BOOMSLANG PERUVIAN! Sure, Steve, is this great? except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, you idiot! But how can you really say that the target audience is children, not simply mental defects? It's easy: there is no sex. <br /> <br /> Well, there is, but it's the kind seen by a crack in the doorway of our parents' bedroom. Modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the chase. <br /> <br /> But, unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON, they have no idea what's going on. All that's left is the laughter outside the SM club and the fascist creed that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil. <br /> <br /> Despite a certain discrepancy in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay. Wray Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And since there's no real excitement about it, does he have to torture her first? not in any way that can excite you, you understand, since it would disturb our puritanical feelings. And so, horror and romanticism become simply unpleasant and the preparation of psychopaths. <br /> <br /> Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist, and can only be hurt if someone touches it, do you know down there with you know ?? rubber gloves (giggling). And this is what they use at autopsies, and this is how they find out that it is, in fact, you know. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is the author at the height of his powers of inspiration. Too bad they cut it off as it could have upset the FIVE YEARS by watching the show!
