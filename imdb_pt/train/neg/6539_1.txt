If this could be classified as 0, it would be. From the dreadful act of wood to the monotonous and arduous rhythm of the childish angle of exploitation and the second-order pseudo-lyrical styling added purely because of the sad viewers, this is a disaster of a film. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable from the outset, it is absolutely certain what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will begin. From a boring and unpretentious start to a pathetic and somber end, the whole presence in this movie is wasted, and every bit of talent unearthed for this turkey is wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something as relentlessly desolate with plenty of the same infantile excitement, watch one of Ilsa's movies. At least they have not apologized and are convinced of what they are trying to do. How something horrendously bad that has already managed to be rated above 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or demanding standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious purposes. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not interesting, and most of all, it's not exciting in any sense of the word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime that such horribly offensive and incompetent trash was conceived and given the resources for existence, and yet another tragedy still defended by misguided viewers. <br /> <br /> Not even Elvira's cheerful personality and playfulness could soften the blow that this horrifying farce of the movie is. Avoid at all costs.
