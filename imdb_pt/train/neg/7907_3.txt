Alix Elias' excellent performance highlights an otherwise misdirected and confusing pile of dreck. I've seen this movie, maybe 12 times, and every time, I feel less pleasure. Why are Munchies so lustful? Has this been explained? Are they a reflection of our disinterested and coarse selfishness? If they are, why not make it more obvious? Why not just give a touch of the subtlety that plagues this movie and make that connection explicit? Another part of this movie that bothers me endlessly - bikes. The jacket that the little monster wears on the cover seems to suggest a street traveler. Sunglasses say "pretty cool guy". With all this, I'm ready for Easy Rider to meet the Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives? Stick to the Gremlins series if you are a fan of diminutive and wise reptile dolls - it will give you the treatment you deserve.
