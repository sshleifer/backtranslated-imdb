I heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently put it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and enthusiasm when we heard it was a terrifying, really scary movie. How disappointed was I? VERY!!!! Besides this scene (we all know that bit) NOTHING happened !!! I was hoping to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do some more hectic scenes, like popping out the window or crossing the hallway or something. <br /> <br /> Almost all the comments here say that scary, thrilling and atmospheric movie is this. I just did not see it, I'm scared. Maybe there's a difference in what people find scary in the US so far in Britain. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment after all the hyped reviews :(
