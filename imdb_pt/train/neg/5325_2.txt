Poland's criticism must be feminist, since it thinks "Young Catarina" is a great and historically accurate film. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many, many years I have made exception with YC in almost every turn, and in particular her politically correct representation as the boss who alone has moved Russia to a dominating direction. The truth? She was only brought to St. Petersburg to be wife and mother, and discovered that she had to "unite" with the Dvorans, the boyars, and the military only to survive. As long as she did not challenge them, she was able / able to satisfy her cultural desires (filling the Hermitage with art treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that it was not "big," but in this area of ​​postmodern revisionism the evidence is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a little cut-out by Ted Turner who, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is yet another example of how badly Russia is portrayed in the West.
