This movie reminds me of how college students used to protest the Vietnam War. As if, upon hearing some children run out of cheeseburgers at Cow Dung Collehe, the president immediately changed all US foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The worst is that, although dangerous, the concept of politics based on whether the USSR and the US went to war, this could mean the end of the world, WORKED. The US and the USSR NEVER MAKE WAR. If we had only conventional weapons, the notion of another war, a "victorious" war in Europe and Asia would not be unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Not that I think they should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as a splendid example of "How NOT to make a movie". <br /> <br /> Must be 0 stars or maybe black holes ...
