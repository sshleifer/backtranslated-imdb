This movie had some andrenaline kickers, but it's an old story that just could never happen. The Navy's protocols could never break so much that a crew, let alone an XO, could go so far against the Captain. I'll take Dr. Strangelove any day if you want to see this plot. Sidenote - The US Navy did not support this film.
