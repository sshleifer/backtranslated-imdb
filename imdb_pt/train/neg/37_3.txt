Devil Hunter gained notoriety for being on DPP's 'Video Nasty' list, but it really did not have to be. Many movies on the list, where there are by God (and DPP) only known reasons, and meanwhile it is not the tamest of the group; there is not much here that guarantees the ban ... which is a shame, because I would never have gone through that, not because I was on the shopping list. The plot, in fact, gives the film a decent basis - or at least a more decent base than most cannibal films - and follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon rainforest. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to face the natives, led by a man called "The Devil" (hence the title). The movie basically goes on for about eighty-five minutes and there really are not many scenes of interest. It's a shame that Jess Franco made such films because the man clearly has talent; as seen by such films as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately her good movies are just gems among heaps of trash and Devil Hunter is a very important part of the crap. I saw this movie purely because I want to be able to say that I saw everything on the DPP list (just two more to go!), And I'm guessing that's why most of the other people who saw it saw it. But if you are not looking for Nasties; there really is no reason to worry about it.
