Without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've seen in years. The story focuses on four women impelled to steal banks with which, supposedly, we sympathize. It's hard to sympathize with characters who continue to make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the cops are with us, they know who we are, what do we do? ... Let's steal another bank than get out of here! What!?! Each character is a stereotype and it is easy to tell who will end up dead.
