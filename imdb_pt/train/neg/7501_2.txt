I went to this movie expecting a concise movie reporting the effect that Sam's Son had on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to feed me more with racial tension, with the justice of the mafia, or with the inability of the ordinary citizen to make a choice under peer pressure. Lee presented an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The whole movie could have been more effective if in a 90-minute format with more focus, less tangential subplots. <br /> Do not bother renting the video, unless you like Spike Lee; In that case, the theater is worth it. This is not an escapist movie.
