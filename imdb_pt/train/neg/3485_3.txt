This movie was quite absurd. There were some funny parts. He goes straight to the movie box in my memory, where I think, "Hmm ..... this movie had some funny parts, but overall, a pretty ridiculous plot (or lack of)." <br /> <br /> I thought it looked like Ben was trying a bit too much to be a funny guy. And I did not understand how he was a multi-millionaire and still an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. He does some crap, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I liked Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli was all his fault, I like him in general. I think he's like the kid you're sorry because he just can not get it right. <br /> <br /> My advice would be to avoid this movie. It did not develop into a workable plot, and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. were not used as well as they could have been. They deserved better. Overall, this movie is not at home alone, it's not a Christmas story, it's not a Christmas holiday or any of the other classics. Forever unforgettable.
