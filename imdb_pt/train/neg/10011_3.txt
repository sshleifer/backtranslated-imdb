This movie is about a male escort engaging in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful wives of men. <br /> <br /> I thought "The Walker" would be exciting and engaging, but I was so wrong. The pace is painful and painfully slow, that even after 40 minutes of the movie, nothing happens much. Seriously, the first hour could be condensed in ten minutes. That's how slow it is. <br /> <br /> Having no emotions or action scenes exacerbates boredom. It is almost shocking that even the plot scenes are so simple and devoid of emotion. Maybe it's because of the hard upper lip of the higher social class? <br /> <br /> It's sad that "The Walker" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. The fault is the poor plot and an even worse rhythm.
