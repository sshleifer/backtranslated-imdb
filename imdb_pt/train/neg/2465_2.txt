This would be a mediocre mediocre Hollywood if it had a good edit. It's based on the typical American suspense plot - "who's going to be smarter than anyone". Acting is below average but with the brilliant appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is the biggest responsible if the tension in the film increases. The film was completely choked by video shots and blank sound and most of it looks like raw movie material. All in all, if you do not mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a movie to watch. I think it would be enough to say about this movie, everything else could really ruin the voltage that is probably low enough.
