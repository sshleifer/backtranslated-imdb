I just saw this movie and what a waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. It's basically the bad Mormon newscasts that play basketball sanctioned by the church. Instead of watching this movie, I should have a root canal. The cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship / funding. This movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by Mormons when they play basketball sanctioned by the church, however, because it is classified as PG, the true nature of the show could not be transferred to the movies. The acting is horrible, with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thurl Bailey in the film was completely unnecessary.
