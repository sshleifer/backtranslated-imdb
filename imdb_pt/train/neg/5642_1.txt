This title looks more like a shooting exercise than a movie that should have been released to be seen by the public. For Dafoe and his wife, it must have been fun working together on a movie for the first time, regardless of whether people could actually watch it. I felt like it was 90mins wasted while anxiously waiting for a plan to develop, or even begin. <br /> <br /> Try to fit this movie into a genre and you will not because it does not have a beginning, middle or ending. I've seen 'artistic' movies before, and this does not even come close to being artistic, abstract or original, it seems completely pointless to me. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks for itself when the only people who rated this movie as 10 were the age group under the age of 18. No doubt for the nonsensical constant erotic scenes that the movie insisted on playing on us. That is, if you can call it erotic. It certainly had no taste.
