KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963; which I remember having classified as BOMB) was my introduction to the work of the director of Honda worship; Is not this necessarily better? it's just that I learned to be more tolerant of this intrinsically low rate! <br /> <br /> Here, in fact, we get two Kongs for the price of one: an ugly giant monkey with a dopey look and a robot variation that looks even worse! The simian creature lives on the island of Mondo (!) ?? where he is shown battling a pair of other monsters and befriends a trio of humans. Of course, he falls in love with the blond (and bland) heroine; in fact, more intriguing is a femme fatale in collusion with the mad genius of the villain movie ?? called Dr. Who and sporting the anemic appearance and cover usually associated with a vampire !! <br /> <br /> He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes him to retrieve Element X, which is embedded in the icy waste of the North Pole; apparently, the giant monkey is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and, to ensure its full cooperation, whoever captures its three "comrades")! The female agent then has a change of heart, helps the heroes (one of them is typically an indescribable American) and is killed by Who. Kong finally escapes and arrives in Tokyo, where he has a final confrontation with the robot. The doctor flee from the chaos that ensued in his sub? who, at the request of Kong's dream girl, is summarily destroyed by the giant monkey.
