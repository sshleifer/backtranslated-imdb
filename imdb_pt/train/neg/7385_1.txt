The movie is boring, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, unbelievable, the action is hilarious. This movie is a big mess. It looks almost like when action music kicks in, the most impressive trick is running. Either the voice is dubbed with Mr. McGregor or Steven sang too much and changed his voice. There is a lot of dialogue in this movie, and it is extremely bad acting on behalf of everyone. The movie is great for sleep therapy. The fight is laughable. The eye-shifting effect on the malicious women of the drug addict was decent. The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through questioning, he would just throw random plots like (spoiler) "CTX (his designer drug) will be in the water supply," which is never addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie. This movie is highly recommended to spend.
