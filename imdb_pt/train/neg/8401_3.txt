Having just seen this on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. It's obvious that although stooges are stars, they do not run the show. First, they are split into 2 groups - Moe, like "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a pair of homeless, so there is not much teamwork. The love story that feeds the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability, there are another group of musical clowns that are not funny, unless you consider your attempts to be funny to be sadly snorting. The music is tiring, they drive cars to the ranch and then rely on horses, western wear is silly, and there is a lot of film without clowns in the camera. By the way, this is obviously after Curley's first blow, and his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early in an uncredited paper. I loved everything these guys have ever done, including all things that are not from Curley, but this puppy is really bad.
