there is no suspense in this series! When an episode ends, the acting is so bad, the effects are so bad and the script is so horrible that the last thing on your mind is how Batman and Robin are going to save the day. No, actually, the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode! This show is so annoying that I can not see how it was done, much less released on DVD! Obviously, the effects are not up to the contemporary films of Batman, but even the script is horrible. An incoherent mess about some evil teacher and a lightning gun or something, I'm not sure, because it's horrible to follow. Watch the 60's version, or the 90's versions, or even Batman Begins, anything about this version!
