I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most rewarding factor for owning the DVD is the short film bonus. My vote for this movie is a big fat ZERO. Do not misunderstand, I'm a girl of terror. but I want some meat behind the story, not to mention that I prefer evil to happen to humans, not to be fooled into watching, what seemed like an eternity, animal snuff clips. Acts of brutality interrupt a long and painful silence and little acting. If I was forced to make a comparison with another film, the only one that comes to mind is the Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, pointless and a totally uncomfortable clock.
