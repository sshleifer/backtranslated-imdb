Well, I just asked for it on my pay-per-view at home because I was bored and needed a laugh. I have to admit, I laughed a few times, but I do not even remember what parts they were in. I do not understand why this movie was made. He claims to be a comedy, but seriously, I do not find a penis singing, or a very funny 70 year old nude woman. This movie was trying to fit in the gross-out comedies of the last years, like American Pie and Road Trip, but it simply failed miserably. It was very rude, so it was comedy. Also, why the hell did Cameron Diaz attach his name to this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and nice and well done. Also, avoid this movie. 3/10
