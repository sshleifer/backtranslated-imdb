I agree with most, if not with Tom's previous commentator (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement. <br /> <br /> I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe that 14 was not released in Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing. The plot was complicated and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many of Zatoichi's earlier stories. At one point, I was wondering if I was not seeing a remake of an earlier Zatoichi movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was disappointing because it began to depend on effects (a rolling head, severed limbs, blood) and less on the nobility of the character Zatoichi. All previous films have been successful based on plot and action, and have won many followers without having to resort to effects. <br /> <br /> I'm just hoping that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend. This is Zatoichi's first film from his studio. I recommend all previous Zatoichi movies - and recommend them.
