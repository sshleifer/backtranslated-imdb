My God, what an incredible movie that is! It reminded me a lot of the similar scene in Mel Gibson's movie "We were Soldiers" when "The Company is not lost, they're just cut" And the other scene in Pearl Harbor when the British official tells Ben Affleck "If all Americans are like you, then God help the nation that goes to war with America! <br /> <br /> Put all 3 movies together and you'll have enough BULLSHIT to fertilize the entire Sahara desert. / The story of the Cut Battalion may be real enough, but the film could have been made without all of this American propaganda preached to him. There were audible groans in the movie theater during the above-mentioned scene in Pearl Harbor (not joking) The Battalion Lost, though, is it really in a class of its own ??. <br /> <br /> "Americans think they are unbeatable ?? bravery inspired. "" I actually shrank and nearly threw up in all the commotion that was expelled throughout this diarrheic disaster (the movie that is). The fight scenes were well done (3 stars for this), but if the script is manure then wrapped even in colored ribbons, it's still manure. The writer, James Carabatsos, also wrote those other screamers Hamburger Hill, No Mercy , Heartbreak Ridge. Someone, please shoot him before he writes more such garbage. <br /> <br /> The director, Russell Mulcahy is Australian too, God, the shame !!!
