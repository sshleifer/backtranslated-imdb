Jared Diamond made it a point in the first episode that the other peoples of the world had no animals to tame, but the Europeans did, and that explains why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> But then, in the third episode, he says that when the Europeans in South Africa came very far north, they found the Zulu people and other tribes that pastured cattle and planted crops. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievement if they had the main things that the author claims are necessary for success? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claims smallpox germs (brought to North America by black slaves) were our greatest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus * without a single low * in both cases, then I think you have to conclude that the germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we would succeed. <br /> <br /> He says that malaria prevented Europeans from colonizing further north, killing "thousands" of Europeans without affecting Africans. (I would like to know real numbers, but he does not say.) So in the end he says that today malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they can not accompany us. So, what is it, Jared? Has malaria helped the Africans by stopping Europeans or hurting them? And how has Europe done well despite the great plagues throughout our history? <br /> <br /> He also seems very eager to say that the reasons why the Europeans were successful were because of luck. At times, when the evidence threatens to overload his fragile theories, he is reluctant to admit that perhaps the Europeans succeeded because they worked for it. It is sad to observe this obvious contorted neo-Marxist reality to try to prove its point.
