They say this is a personal movie by Peter Bogdonavitch. He relied on his life, but changed things to suit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, does not it? This whole movie was written by Peter, and shows how out of touch with real people he was. You should write what you know, and he did, actually. And it leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curiosity for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered shortly after filming. But Patti Hanson, who in real life would marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is much better and has a wider role. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. It does not have much to do with the story, which is rather complicated to begin with. All in all, every character in this movie is someone with whom very few people can relate unless you are a millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your disposal. For the rest of us, it's an annoying feast. That's what happens when you're out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inner jokes and endure all the rest.
