German filmmaker Ulli Lommel achieved a task that many horror fans found impossible: he defeated colleague Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made. <br /> <br /> Lommel is really the movie's Ed Wood. new millennium. This movie is as sloppy and laughable as the best of the worst EW. I am proud and ashamed to say that I saw her at the beginning, morbid and fascinated to see that the bar could be defined. The answer is: underground; Lommel dug a hole and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins with the cast of no international. Just someone who lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many aspiring actors willing to vomit his ridiculous dialogue with a serious face. <br /> <br /> The main character, a villainous cop, is played by a German actor with a strong German accent. In addition to being a serial killer, he is also the oldest police officer in Los Angeles. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women and takes them into custody, he then drags them into the house (which is inexplicably the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and he does it all in the sight of his novice partners, Los Angeles police Angeles refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja-style invasion of his apartment. <br /> <br /> The sets are painfully bad. The production designer's budget apparently included enough money for an ink can; enough to paint the "District 707" on a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> Since the actors were obviously not unpaid professionals - a sad assortment of European exiles (possibly deported if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos and desperate middle-aged women - and how little or no money was spent on sets, special effects, locations or other production value, it is fair to mention that some genuine-looking police uniforms have emerged. Unfortunately, they could not afford a police car; the uniformed police cross the streets in a shiny new mercury rental. <br /> <br /> More than half the story focuses on the dirty acts of our mad German police officer in LA and the futile efforts of two newcomers to stop him. One of these young actors is especially unfortunate because he is the only actor in all this mess, even with a vague chance of a real career in the movies. The other fits well, with a rockabilly and tortured Brando styling hairstyle that needs to be seen to be enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our The assassin is resurrected after he kills a girl who has just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protection spell placed on it. Do not ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodoo before being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride. <br /> <br /> After very long withdrawal of tombs on the straw-covered banks the zombie girls can appear. They look exactly like before death, perhaps even prettier, with black glamorous makeup generously retouched around the eyes. Nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the catwalk. <br /> <br /> At this point in the film, Lommel lends a creative note to his respected compatriot Boll, and injects large doses of European cheese. trash techno on the soundtrack. We are talking about prehistoric electronic bee noise. Things they could have played in an Ibiza ballad when Lommel was still young enough to shake off his serve. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, the Lommel girls speak and function normally ... er, I mean, like them before they became zombified. This gives our author ample opportunities to give us more of his golden dialogue. Yes, it's a shower of gold. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin anything, revealing the end of the crash. All I can say is that it is perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives in ... or should I say your geist.
