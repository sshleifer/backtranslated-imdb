OK, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I've been able to sit and watch it twice !!! the plot was pretty horrible and during the first part of the first tale I wondered what the hell I was watching but at the same time it was so horrible that I loved cheap laughs all the way. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for her role in this movie, the only thing that disappointed him was half way he stopped his silly name by calling. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was very perfuming but if you go after cheap laughs and you see it on land pound go through it.
