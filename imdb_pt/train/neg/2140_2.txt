The mission of Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is to kill a Middle Eastern oil minister, whose name is Omar Sharif (Neikov), in the country of Turaqistan, which is run by American interests. Hauser presents himself as a fair producer to allow him to come to Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a satire can be so exaggerated that it becomes more irritating. Here he does too much: government, politics, music, war, people generally not accepted by society, and I mentioned "war." And that's what we have here - a very boring film that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life. I'm still wondering why I kept the DVD. Also, there are so many members of the Cusak family in this that John Cusak seems embarrassed by the family being there, or is this just me? It used to be a John Cusak movie, while a little unusual in the end was pretty good. Not here. Believe that John Cusak had a hand in writing and producing this mess. Make it what you want. <br /> <br /> Is there a lot going on in the movie with constant shootings, shelling and screaming that you really can not concentrate or was that the point? Probably. It takes a lot of time to hit the hit, which is forgotten until the last 15 minutes. Meanwhile, we have meaningless jokes among everyone in the cast. And chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I do not think so, but you know: the boy? and they needed something to occupy more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, for what they should be, (unusual and annoying) Duff and Kingsley's performances were good. But when I saw the character of Dan Aykroyd at the beginning of the show, sitting in a toilet taking garbage, I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well. I was not wrong. I'm sure some will sing praises to this effort, but if a rose is still a rose by any other name, so is also a mess ?????????? <br /> <br /> I now remember why I continued with the DVD. I hoped the story would level up and save itself. I never did. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
