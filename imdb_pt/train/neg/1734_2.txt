I'm a big fan of the old westerns and I do not believe Hollywood is capable of capturing its former glory. But even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can not help this 1957 film, which carries almost all the banal characteristics of the pharaohs of the retired man turned into a good boy. fallen woman but virtuous, fanatical city people who must turn to the shooting for salvation, etc. I can not help but notice the surnames of the writer and the young "actor" who plays Granger's son. Some nepotism there? I've seen better acting in high school plays. Chill Wills does a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills. Have I reached 1000 words yet?
