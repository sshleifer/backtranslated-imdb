There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast, but unfortunately this does not help with the main disadvantages of the film. I never understand why directors ask actors to use accents that are not theirs when it's obvious to everyone who can not convince. Fiennes does not know how to do Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. When the voice is wrong, no matter how good the performance, the character will never be convincing. As for the big problem .... the plot .... was there one? I think there was some kind of plot involved, but it was so full of holes that I could hardly wait for the end of the movie ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
