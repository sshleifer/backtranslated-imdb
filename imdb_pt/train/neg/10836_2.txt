"Magnolia" is an absurd and bewildering performance demonstration that adds up very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a series of aimless episodes, without any concern for consistency. The camera goes through corridors and corridors, glimpsing sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who scream a lot, who can not care for others (except the characters of John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman), and they are self-defeating idiots who are falling apart or dying. I remembered how much I did not like "Shine" because of the irremediable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive and unpleasant characters here, why do we want to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> That said, there is nothing that holds the "Magnolia". The ideas of Paul Thomas Anderson are speckled on his canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular, this bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute movie. One of them has the camera shifting from one character to another as each one sings one of Aimee Mann's folk songs. Sweet, but ineffective, since we can not see what unites them all together. The other idea I am referring to can be revealed only by saying that it is completely unexpected and utterly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise, who triggered a performance that I did not know he had in it. And John C. Reilly plays the most decent and really good cop in recent history. But all this contributes to nothing. When the unexpected secret event happened, a girl behind me in the theater could not hold it anymore and said, "This is stupid!" My feeling is that most viewers will agree.
