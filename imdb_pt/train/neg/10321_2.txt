This show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and they are getting worse and worse. I'm one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas, but at least I liked it at first until I got into a routine around Season Two, all the jokes were thrown out and the characters had nothing for them. Well, at least Corner Gas was good in the beginning, Little Mosque on the Prairie is typically awful CBC soft comedy that had nothing to go on from episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I'm being honest is old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I do not know a single person who likes this show and can not stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. I hope it does not last much longer, because all the success that this show had seems to me based entirely on the premise that this show is Muslim, which is different and could / should have led to a great show.
