I had never seen a Tarzan movie before, so when I saw it on TV, I thought I'd try. Unfortunately I have to say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 and slightly overweight. Not as I imagined Tarzan would. And unless I missed it while making a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave up his traditional tip-off. There was also missing Tarzan swaying among the trees - jumping from vine to vine. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, so much for the expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - The Cheeta monkey was there. There was a guy with a guitar there. There were villains and good guys and a novel ... all very harmless and predictable. Not bad, you understand, but also nothing good. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to feature Tarzan: 4/10
