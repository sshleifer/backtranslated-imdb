This film is poorly conceived, misrepresented and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is terribly annoying and can not escape the same routine as Napoleana Dynamite. In addition, Diane Keaton plays the same overconfident and overly obsessed mother who cares too much about her children's lives but does not get close enough (see Because I Said So). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I usually like her, plays an insipid idiot in this movie as well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is acceptable, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
