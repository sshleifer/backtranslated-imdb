2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that's being overly generous. I thought with a cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas - how could I miss it. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine what drug Sam Shepard was at the weekend, he gave that dribble. I suspected Sam S. was a little crazy, this movie, based on his play, confirms this. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of artist b.s. that actors LOVE to sink their teeth, since this gives them an infinite chance of excitement. However, for the viewer who sits through this mindless junk, there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie. <br /> <br /> You have not seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch. Pa is crazy, Ma is crazy, the son is crazy and the daughter is, oh yes, crazy. They also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush, especially the teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if that were not enough, the plot - and it is so You can read meticulously - there is a hole the size of Alaskan. <br /> <br /> Ma is conspiring to sell his decadent farm. It turns out, just like Pa. Now I do not intend to be an expert on real estate, but the last time I checked, the property together should have both signatures of the owners to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, the other could not legally sell it, so it would be useless for that person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, and therefore his plot does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that anything else was really working anyway. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason that someone might have to watch this movie is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in complete frontal nudity, and I can not imagine why anyone would want to.
