This movie has a huge amount of big adult stars, but it can not interest you in a way that an adult movie should do. Between all the stars, you did not get your kicks in any of the scenes. The film is filmed in a middle-aged dream that is embarrassingly extravagant. The acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are as exciting as hearing your neighbor talk about your son in college, and the dialogue is the worst I've ever seen in a movie. The plot was also worse ten times. I'd take the amateur route. The audio commentary was useless since it's a skin movie, but it was bad anyway. Unless you're an unconditional fan of Jenna Jameson, just here. 4/10
