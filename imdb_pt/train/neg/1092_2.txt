Well, I suppose the good news concerning William Winckler's 2001 work, "The Double-D Avenger," is that it unites three of the mammoth wonders of Russ Meyer - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix - in a photo . (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they filmed this thing ... or were able to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news, however (and there is a lot of it), is that this movie - if it can even be called that, having been filmed directly on video - is a complete misfire, a total miscarriage, an absolute atrocity, an absolute abomination, and truly one of the worst pictures I've ever seen . Look no further for the superhero movie that has already been made! The plot here, as it is, deals with Kitty gaining superpowers after dropping the rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer, and later battling with a trio of bikini dancers in Los Angeles. joke trots completely falls (you must forgive the expression) flat, that there is ZERO real nudity in the film at all (plus some old photos of Kitten at its peak), and that some shaving cream and a papier-mache boulder are the sum total of the special FX. The Meyer girls here are a little long in the tooth / sagging chest, to be gentle, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, like the bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Get to stand out very well. So why did I give this juvenile, bland, a flawed embarrassment of a 2-star movie instead of 1? To be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs. His comment on the special features of the DVD I just saw is absolutely hilarious, especially when he draws about 100 synonyms for the word "mama" from the 1,000+ on his Canonical Hooters List site. The man is a national treasure, and he manages to upgrade this skeet from a disc to roller coaster status!
