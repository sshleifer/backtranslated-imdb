I'm hearing rumors of an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates Blu-ray Disc". With the advances in the last 25 years, from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated. I just hope it helps remove the bad taste left in my mouth for all this Magnavision demonstration fiasco. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the Betamax VCR" was a brilliant milestone in the history of entertainment. After the attempt of "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the compact" and the cheeky "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the tape of 8 tracks", who would expect such a glorious film? I'm crying now just thinking about it.
