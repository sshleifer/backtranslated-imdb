First, IFC manages Town and Country and now that. The difference between that stink and this scratch of the Pink Panther is that Town and Country was watchable. This is not. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the cast signed up for it so they could enjoy in Europe with someone else's money. Belushi is especially irritating. His scene with Candy (doing Don DeLuise's Z-grade) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of Shepherd without talent, and I bet the prisoners at Gitmo would crack like nuts! <br /> <br /> The real "Crime" (besides being lit by green light) is Shepherd's character: a mousy wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino to half a million dollars! If you buy this, I have some beachfront property in Arizona you may be interested in!
