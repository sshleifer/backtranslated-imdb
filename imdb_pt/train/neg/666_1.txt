I saw this trailer and I thought to myself, my god is this real movie, who would want to see this movie and at the same time I thought that, my girlfriend turned to me and said "we have to go see this movie". ..enough said so I saw this about 5 minutes and I tried putting on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there was not even any of those. It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen the director has no influence no prospect the same shots were used again and again he did not build suspense the cast was probably simply said cry cry fall run. I would love to see the script, since the first 40 minutes were mostly giggling and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ... well, there was no plot basically I know we'll terrorize a high school group on your prom night with a serial killer stalker, that's brilliant! hmmm The acting was what you expect in an Australian novel without hope, that main character the dam of God Blondie that she bothered me. her longest line must have been half sentence, and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression. <br /> <br /> Please listen to me if you have some taste in movies do not go see this, and if you like me and do not have a choice well, then I wish you good luck, maybe smuggle in one iPod or magazine. I can not believe this movie was made!
