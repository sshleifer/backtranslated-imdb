Kitten Natividad, from Russ Meyer's film, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who discovered she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruits (Crockazilla?) That should have healing powers. After descending on some of these fruits (which appear to be plastic bananas in stems) Chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a superhero, specifically, The Double D Avenger. Note that she is also wearing a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, all of this sounds very good. Running, well, leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local diner is upset because she is taking away her business, so some of the strippers (including Haji, aka Russ Meyer) go after her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity fights the Double D Avenger guise. Watch her spin a "Wonder Woman" spin to change her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. False bad and double jokes arise as if there is no tomorrow. With inane theme music playing over and over again, this becomes an adult live-action show from the '70s with adult content, though although this is not rated, it could probably end PG-13 at worst. And it is probably a blessing that the faded stars remain well covered. That makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan movies look marvelous by comparison. Special appearance by Forest J. Ackerman but so on. Very stupid, and I'm never buying another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.
