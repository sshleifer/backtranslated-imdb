But, let's face it ... he took some nostalgic sighs from me. <br /> <br /> The show is so consistently great that it is allowed to have some hiccups. I have a new season, and just power through them as I have 2 days to live. I like the idea of ​​closing, but it was much more an end-of-season episode that would explain the following: Dr.Cox should not go bald for a few more episodes, The only explanation I can think of is that they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to re-shoot the beginning. <br /> <br /> And my friends, that's why the cox hell is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is incredible ... bring in season 7.
