It took 9 years to complete this movie. I would think that within those 9 years someone would have said, hey, this movie is terrible. I've seen better acting in pornographic films. The story is tired and played. Abused child becomes serial killer. How about something new for a change. How about abused child turns into a florist? At least that would have been a new twist. Why do everyone with a camera and a movie idea (especially movie ideas without originality) think they can be a director? I admire the fact that they got this movie for 9 years to finish it. It shows tenacity and spirit. With that kind of unit, I hope next time they can focus on a better script. If you want to see a failed experiment in indie film production from a Michigan writer / director, see Hate One Minute. If you want a good movie from a writer / director from Michigan with Evil Dead.
