The fatal flaw of orders - apart from an asynchronous plot - is that the character simply does not resonate or even react. <br /> <br /> Two examples: a priest, walking through the cemetery late at night, is suddenly attacked by a ghost. spirits. After fighting them, he calmly resumes his walk when his friend appears. "Something wrong?" Your friend asks, having seen the attack. "Just some demonic spirits - nothing I could not stand." No reaction, no surprise, just like he changed a tire. Your friend is equally carefree ... he must be a standard priest of training ... ["And then you put the biscuit in their mouths ... Any questions? Okay, move on, Demon Spirit attacks ..."] Example Two: At one point, priests need an answer to a question, and only a demon (or something that cares now) could provide it. As? Why do you have to ask a dying man! So the devil has a random person hanging in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the man who is floundering and panting. "Hey, do not kill him!" or maybe "That's not cool!" would have been more realistic than his answer. They never ask that they let the man go or stop in fact, the closest to reacting is the slight annoyance. They ask your question and they go. <br /> <br /> I had to turn it off at that moment - my brain was beginning to atrophy. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one star of four) <br /> <br />
