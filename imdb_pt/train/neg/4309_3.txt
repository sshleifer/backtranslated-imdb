A high school principal (Keenan Wynn) with a losing basketball team involuntarily hires a coach who turns out not only a beautiful blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) but a catalyst for her new winning ways. Are you really surprised? Along the way, a romance grows between coach and team player, Jack (Michael Biehn). The police are never notified. <br /> <br /> Packed along with other Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse movie really does make this movie no service. This can easily be edited in a television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby is great as trainer Randy Rawlings, especially in her miniscule outfits, but I expected more than just the excitement of a porn movie. A plot involving an idiotic center that is hypnotized by his teammates in thinking he is a former NBA player Sydney Wicks is the real reason for the team's new success instead of coaching by Cathy Lee. Too much provocation and no sleaze enough makes this a big disappointment.
