This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of all, I'm from Kansas this movie does not have a bit of truth in all this. It's like they took BTK name and did the rest. Also, it looks like someone was like I only had $ 20 here, got it and made a movie and, yes, do not bother researching btk, just make up something. dookie seriously pure no one should ever see this movie. The slaughter of cows scenes and making their victims eat stuff and describing slaughter of animals BTK did not do any of those things, but the film does so for the love of God never see this horrible god movie. Made for TV are much better and more accurate
