Now I get it. The title refers to the immediate reaction of each member of the public after 68 minutes of mental torture. Trying hard to be terrifying, without good dialogue, even any fear, really makes the Yelling Skull more like a Restless Snarl. Despite this, the mansion and the black and white property set a dark tone for the movie, but that's about it. The only scary thing about this flop is that people really made money from it! Remember the coffin's assurance in the beginning? This may be the funniest thing I've ever seen on the screen. The saddest thing is that viewers probably expected director Alex Nichol to be forcibly placed in a coffin, nailed and buried alive for his effort. Jenny, placed in this horrible unfortunate situation, never attracts any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is ascribed to a haunted skull receptacle. In addition, her husband, John, appears as a condescending talker, but that does not work and he ends up proving how tough he is by slapping a crippled cripple! Ah, Mickey, the days before you could get a restraining order against property janitors like him. The approach of this guy is not very good or maybe a lot of airline glue. Still, despite his strange persona, Mickey is probably the only good thing for this movie, providing a slight sense of entertainment and I can not get enough of a guy saying "It was Mary!" and scouring vases in a greenhouse.
