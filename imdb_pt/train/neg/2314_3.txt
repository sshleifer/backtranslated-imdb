Synopsis: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped and replaced by an android, Secret Service agent Eric Phillips finds her and discovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders. /> <br /> I was not expecting much when I first saw the sequel to Richard Pepin's low-cost action sci-fi hybrid "Cyber ​​Tracker." This movie was nothing special, not to mention a blatant steal of "The Terminator" and "RoboCop." This sequence is the same as before, with a full action sequence opening the movie. There are plenty of explosions, heavy shots and a huge bodycount, as well as some martial arts moves courtesy of the movie star, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The entire film looks like a series of action scenes, chained together with a minimal storyline. On the acting front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.
