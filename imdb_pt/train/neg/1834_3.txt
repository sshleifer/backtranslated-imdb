I can not say much about this movie. I think it speaks for itself (as well as the current rankings here). I rented this two years ago and totally regretted it. I even tried to enjoy it by watching it twice, but I could not. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this loss of time, ever again. And I'm not the type to trash a movie, but I really believe this was awful. It was not at all funny. The only parts I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken on them. I think this movie ruined Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think about when I see one of your movies nowadays is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is very boring too. <br /> <br /> All in all, well, I think you got it. The stars are for Walken, by the way.
