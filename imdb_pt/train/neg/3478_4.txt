Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be alone this Christmas. Not only is Drew a millionaire; but also unpleasant and guilty of being too grandiose. Drew returns to the house where he grew up and offers the family that lives there, the Valco's, $ 250,000 to be his "family" during the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant but is greedy enough to accept Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say about it, but she learns to like having Drew around ... not exactly the same feeling with daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but that also has room for change. Drew's girlfriend Missy (Jennifer Morrison) traces Drew and wants her friends to meet her family. Genuine fun is in the store as a happy Noel becomes a dysfunctional hilarious nightmare. Other cast members: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comical, though strange.
