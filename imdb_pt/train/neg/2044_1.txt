This movie is bad. I do not want to just say "bad" as in; "Oh the script was bad," or; "The acting in this scene was bad" ..... I mean, bad, as in someone should be held criminally responsible for foisting this absolute pile of raw steam on an unsuspecting public. I will not even dignify with an explanation of (Plot ??) if I can refer to this as this. I can think of just another occasion in about 40 years of watching film that I found need to vent my spleen in one movie. I mean, after all, no one leaves to intentionally make a bad movie, is not it? Well, yes. Apparently they do ... and the culprit is writer / director Ulli Lommel. But worst of all is that Blockbusters is renting this to their customers! Be warned. Leave that crap where it belongs. Stuck on the shelf, gathering dust.
