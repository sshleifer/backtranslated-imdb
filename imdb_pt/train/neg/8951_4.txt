I am a big fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favorite writer since he studied Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of pure curiosity, Burton is an actor that I have in high regard, so when I learned that he played the role of O'Brien I was rocked. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer on DVD. first and a few fears began to emerge, especially in relation to the downright terrible "theme song", listening to the mechanically screaming euritmistas "1984!" Repeatedly, an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds. <br /> <br /> The acting in general is very good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth about the end can be felt, especially in the distressing scene of Room 101. However , this is also where the movie is disabled. The film spends a lot of time focusing on the love affair between Winston and Julia, which frankly is not what Orwell was writing. He was writing about a harrowing future, about how Ingsoc builds a man's beliefs and then destroys them all in his name being made to love Big Brother. The film skips about what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons coming to terms with their position in life and in the world, and their re-education via O'Brien. <br /> <br /> The comment on IMDb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit to the Brotherhood of Goldstien and confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial cases in which Winston finds the article with the Unpersons, but he is mentioned near the end, if you have not read the book, it is completely confusing. <br /> <br /> A terrible script, which some excellent acting can not save. Michael Radford seems to have completely missed the point that Orwell was trying to make, and the soundtrack of the electronics is downright terrible.
