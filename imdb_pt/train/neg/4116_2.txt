My one-line summary should explain everything, but I'll try. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie seemed like an exaggerated novel, and that's about everything I can comment on. There were some interesting scenes, like the "Big One" that hit the middle of the movie, but, wait, what is it? The earthquake * sigh *, wait a minute! This is Dante's peak! Well, parts of her were massacred and slapped. I can not believe how bad this movie was made, "lending" scenes from other films much better. It's no wonder that the director has thought that viewers are idiots enough to believe that there are great mountain woodland scenes in downtown Los Angeles, Dante's Peak. <br /> <br /> My advice, forget Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this movie and go for the real thing (again, someone from Dante Peak coincidentally). <br /> <br />
