I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler, and one day I was looking at Cast & Crew's selection on one of their DVDs and I saw 'Going Overboard' and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with some friends of mine and rented. We dressed him up and were shocked to see an Adam Sandler who has not yet reached puberty, it seems he was 12 when the movie left. I could not even watch it for 30 minutes, I did not laugh, I laughed, I did not even smile at that movie, actually the only time I smiled was when I saw how horrible that movie was. I could not believe how much he tried to make viewers laugh in this movie ... and it did not work once. Despite seeing the horrible camera angles and hearing the disgusting script, I realized why I had never heard of this movie because it sucks more than anything I've ever sucked before. This movie, in my opinion, was the worst movie I ever did, .... always!
