Some might say something like "Baby Geniuses," with their giant robot babies, or "Dumbo," with its psychedelic nightmare and drug addiction sequel, would win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children. You can say that too, but you would be wrong. And here I bring it to you: Santa Claus, the most helpless family movie since ... well, always. <br /> <br /> From the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their tasteless, insipid songs (seriously, this segment is almost 20 minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the gripping conclusion in which Merlin appears out of nowhere and saves the day (do not care about him, he's from Barcelona), this is the childhood trauma at its best. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just ... can not ... get ... those ... reindeers ... laughs ... out ... of. .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this piece of junk that avoids a hungry whale during the mating season. Still, if gay fiends on fire with a severe case of swine flu are something to you, I think you should try. But really, this movie is not worth your time and mental health.
