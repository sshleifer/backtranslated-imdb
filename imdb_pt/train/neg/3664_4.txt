Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after he attacks his traitorous wife and his lover, and then is revived by a scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses it in mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor's failed experiments. <br /> <br /> On hearing of Naschy's death from colleague Jon Kitley, I scoured my collection to see a movie fit to watch. In my fight, I discovered that I did not have one, but three (!) Copies of "Fury of the Wolfman". The film is of questionable video quality, the sound is dubbed mediocre, the cinematography is a kind of slapstick style sometimes. And the American versions have two love scenes removed. Frankly, without a remastered and uncut copy, I was not really getting the proper movie in all its glory. <br /> <br /> This film claims to be the fourth in a long series on the werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky. I suspect this is true, but you do not know that about the movie itself. The plot is confusing at times, and there is really no indication that this is a sequel. If you read the plot summaries on Wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box, you will see that I am not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the flaws of the film can be forgiven if you understand the hell of production that has passed. While floating for years, it was only released in 1973 due to problems involved in finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic and that he hated working with him. These are not really slight charges, and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say in his own name. <br /> <br /> Chances are, sooner or later you will find a low grade version of "Werewolf Fury". It appears in a variety of three packages and sets of boxes, so you can accidentally acquire it and not even know it. What really needs to happen is an uncut American version, with a mix of decent sound and video, and love scenes back to back. As far as I know, it does not exist. We will honor the legacy of Paul Naschy and bring his films to a wider audience at a level of quality he deserves.
