I hired the Hybrid over the weekend. What a disappointment! An idiotic attempt at a telefilm. The guy they picked up for the lead was totally weak and when he was running {he did a lot} it seemed like he was eating those candies with menthol ... with his ass! The wolf contacts he wore were great, though I thought the actor trusted them too much, since there was nothing threatening about his acting. The wise native American Indian chick has to be one of the stony hardest hags ever seen. Talk about a sour cow! She smiled once for the whole movie, and I think it's because she had sex. The sex scene was thigh too. They may also have shown blowing curtains if you can dig this. <br /> <br /> Finally, and this is a great pet hate mine, on the cover and the DVD menu, the losers digitally attracted cool sharp teeth in the face. They were far from being seen in the movie. :(
