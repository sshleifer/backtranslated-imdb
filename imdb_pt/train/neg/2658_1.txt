Watching "Surrender, Dorothy," CBS, I wondered why Diane Keaton would like to be in it (not because it's a TV movie), with the dearth of appealing roles for older actresses, it's no wonder why Oscar won? artists like Keaton turn to TV - but because they do not offer opportunities for Keaton to shine). A single mother, mourning the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter, imposes - and gradually becomes friendly - the group of young women her daughter was close to at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters that someone would cross the street to avoid. In addition to being rude and obscure, these fake people are incredibly unconvincing, as is the neat setting and the bungalow near the beach where the children live (a young man wearing muscled shirts to tell us he's gay, hears Diane Keaton say "Surrender , Dorothy "and actually asks," This is from "The Wizard of Oz", right? "... no, genius, it's" Citizen Kane "!). Keaton may have wanted to make this material based on the subject of confronting death. She tries to make this distinctively nasty woman into a shadow of her own character (many strange outfits), but does not look good with the viewer, since Keaton has always been warmly friendly and flexible in a weird way. Here she is a mad harpy who does not learn many lessons in her journey of self-discovery (the film quickly forgets that it is about a dead girl and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mother who seems to be a hippie who has never lost anyone near her). This is the kind of movie the actors promote on talk shows with the admonition, "That should help a lot of bereaved moms out there." I can not imagine this helping anyone, since it is intrinsically bad, confusing and disconcerting. You're insane.
