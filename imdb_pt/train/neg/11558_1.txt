Exceptionally horrible tale I can hardly express in words. The best part of the film was when one of the murder victims appears at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is a chance that I have missed some crucial plot elements, since I may have been in a light coma during the time the baby was. The box in which the movie arrives shows scenes that are never in the movie. I was drawn to the gross images of torture and the promises of a sexy horror movie. I have the feeling that this was the budget version and about a quarter of the film was left out. All good things more than likely. I have the addition of PG-13 that made as much sense as the end of the new movie 'Planet of the Apes'. Watch this with a friend and a bottle of hard material. You will need this.
