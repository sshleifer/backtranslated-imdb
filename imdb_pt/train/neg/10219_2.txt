The Blue Soldier is a movie with pretensions: claims to be some kind of deep statement about man's inhumanity to man, about the exploitation and brutality of the white man towards the indigenous peoples; A biting, inflexible and sarcastic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, sorry, but it fails miserably to be any of those things. What the Soldier Blue really is is a pernicious, banal, ill-done and dishonest waste. <br /> <br /> Another critic was right in saying that it seems to be a hybrid of two completely different films. What is basically a queer, lame, cliched, misunderstood novel - Strauss and Bergen overcoming their prejudices about each other's lifestyle and falling in love (ah, bless) - with two sickly massacres that would not have gone out No there are excuses for the repulsive, lascivious, blood-drenched climax in which Native American little children are filmed, sliced, dismembered and impaled on loving and close-up graphic, and Native American women with large breasts are molested, raped and tied - no excuse , that is, except box office. (The massacre itself, though repulsive in its misplaced intention, is poorly staged and filmed, a group of actors scattered with stained red paint, interspersed with some special decapitation / dismemberment sequences - dismemberments, incidentally, that they used <br /> <br /> Forget all the paps you've heard (including the ridiculous comments that start and end the movie) about it being a "protest" , an accusation of American brutality toward native peoples.This film does not show anything about the Cheyenne situation, if it did, it would have characterized some Native American characters, would have made us know and care about the anonymous, faceless innocents which are slaughtered at the climax. Instead, what we have is the silly white loaf of Bergen and Strauss (lousy actors, at least in that), with enough blood, courage and cut heads to attract the curious. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible shame because there's a movie to be made about the Sand Creek massacre, about all the real-life massacres that the US (and Britain, and all so-called " civilized ") have participated over the centuries (Iraq?) this is not this movie.
