I am required to write a review of this IMAX resource as a means of alerting others to SAVE YOUR MONEY. Almost any episode of Desmond Morris's "The Human Animal," or "The Nature of Things," by David Suzuki, could have surpassed the material presented. The director not only does not make use of the unbelievable 65- to 70-mm film from IMAX and the gigantic presentation screen, everything on the screen is extremely unimpressive, given the accessibility of such a programming previously mentioned. Viewers are introduced to a pregnant Heather, her husband Buster and his niece and nephew. We follow them for an endless forty minutes while they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. While we have access to scenes within the human digestive tract and learn about the natural reflexes of baby diving, have we really learned anything more than most elementary school graduates? Are we even remotely entertained by the transatlantic heather? Do we care? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see an IMAX feature, I suggest the "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" or the technically exciting "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
