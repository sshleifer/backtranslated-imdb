Thank God for not going to the movies for this movie. I would be very sad for the money I gave. I saw it on tv and I could not believe my eyes. I wonder if any movie could be worse than this. they spent millions of dollars on this movie for nothing. horrible and horrible setting. I think the other people who wrote comments are the man who works in the company of the movie;) It's a big fiasco! in the year 2000 they can still laugh at this kind of movie? embarrassing
