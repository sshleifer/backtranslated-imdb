I can not figure out how anyone can get a budget for such a bad movie. It's as if the TV station was desperate for anything, anything. They are buried under a lot of snow, the electricity constantly blinks, but magically there is a backlight that remains constant. Where does all this (false) light come from? That's all those silly fights between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than in inventing ways to survive. He tries to create that sense of emergency and help people. But because it's so bad to drive and act, you're not going to get your Florence Nightingale fix with this movie, sorry. I'm joining the negative feedback, and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever.
