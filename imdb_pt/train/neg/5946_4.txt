There is absolutely no plot in this movie ... no character development ... no climax ... nothing. But there are some good fight scenes that are really good. So there you go ... as a movie overall is pretty bad, but if you like a brainless movie that offers nothing more than just a good action scene, then watch this movie. Do not expect anything more than just that. Decent acting and a not so bad direction .. A couple of appearances of Kimbo and Carano ... I was looking to see Carano a little more in this movie .. she is a good fighter and a very hot girl ... White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope he can get a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art ... Imagine a movie with White and Jaa together ... that would be amazing
