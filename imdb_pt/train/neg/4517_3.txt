There is much to enjoy here: spectacular sites and flight sequences; costumes, props and period settings; and competent writing and acting. However, to enjoy a drama, we need at least one director who exhibits some qualities that we may like or admire. In this bunch of damn snobs, we find only one character who is at all friendly? an unfortunate enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as his helpless victim. From the comments here, it is clear that we are completely out of tune, but we do not find malicious high school behavior fun or fun. Even the dog is obnoxious. We threw the towel after two of the six episodes, so you should discount those remarks accordingly, but what I could find written about this miniseries gave us no reason to expect the character's transformation or redemption.
