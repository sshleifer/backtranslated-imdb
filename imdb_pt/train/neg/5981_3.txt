I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say I was not satisfied. <br /> <br /> Of course the computer graphics was incredible, but the plot needed a little touch up. Also, I think this movie would have done a lot better with more curses and blood, as well if it was rated PG-13. <br /> <br /> That would certainly attract more people to see this -> teenagers. What would also attract more teens (particularly teenage girls) would be a great close-up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Even if the movie had its negatives, I still saw it and thought it was okay!
