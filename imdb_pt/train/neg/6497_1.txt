In fact, I had high hopes of getting into that movie, so I took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best. About a third of the film I simply had to give up, simply the movie is a mishmash of things going on for no apparent reason and everything is offline. I love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected. <br /> <br /> Do not think it's David Lynch-esquire as some would like you to believe, it's nothing close to that realm apart from some weird visuals. Saying it is artistic to disguise the fact that there is no plot or apparent story is just a way or justify why you missed the 1.5 hours in the movie. The acting was good, but this can not save the lack of history. I agree with the comment posted earlier ... "It's like being in someone else's head ... while they're stoned," in other words, nothing makes sense.
