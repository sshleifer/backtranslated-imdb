Do not waste your time, let alone pay rent for this piece of drink! How it was made beyond me. (I do not know why there are a minimum of 10 lines ... I've already summarized this useless movie, but, oh well ...) The acting was horrible, as if everyone needed lessons. The plot was weak, the end ... Feh! I think cinematography was the only thing that was not totally bad ... well, maybe the sound was minimalist. The only good thing is, if they could make this movie until they made some money from it, there could be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea. So, all of you, take courage! I think the same goes for the actors ... if these people really get paid, then so can you!
