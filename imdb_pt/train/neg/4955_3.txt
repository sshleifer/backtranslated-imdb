In the light of recent and very good Batman, the Brave and the Bold, now is the time to take a fatal blow to this mistake in Batman's life. Being a big fan since the first revival of Tim Burton 20 years ago, I was able to accept different shades in character, dark or campy. This is not only credible: many effects, bad intrigues and so few questions. What's great about Batman is the diversity of his abilities and aspects of his personality: detective, crime fighter, playboy, philanthropist etc. Batman shows it only in his days of karate. And, by the way, how is the Penguin capable of such virtuosity in jumping in the air, regardless of his corpulent corpulence? And look at the Joker, a mix of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae man, what fan of Batman could accept such betrayal? Not me anyway. Batman is much better without the "The" article in front of his name.
