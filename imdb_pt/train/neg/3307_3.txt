My comments can be a little spoiler, so worth it. Stop now if you care enough .... The Saving Grace should have been titled "A Paper-Thin Excuse for Older British Women High on the Screen." This movie sucks. Incidental music is an annoyance, as are the obvious and banal melodies that pop up sporadically to comment on the narrative ("Spirit in the Sky", for example - Oh, I get it!) This is basically a Cheech and Chong movie for its boring English scene and the overwhelming power of Brenda Blethyn inflicting emotion on the audience using only her voice. I could literally hear the people of High Times receiving their praise for the huge "buds" that fill this image. Worst dinner? Easy. Brenda tries to sell her illicit goods on the streets of London wearing a white spiked suit. It's not funny. It's not original. It's not interesting. Not a good movie. The rating of 7.2 is the result of over-voting zealots. Do not waste your time ...
