This game has the (dis) honor of being the first game that I stopped playing right in the middle and felt like it broke into pieces and then burned. Congratulations. FIRST and LAST Tomb Raider I'll never play, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Just typing that word made me laugh. There is not one. There is also no character development. Finally we have a heroine who can take care of herself, which is not a * beep * mary-sue, but unfortunately she dresses like a slut and her breast is huge. They had to attract the sexist boys you see. Anyway, all she does is go to the grave after the grave, throwing things at her as she goes along. Why she does this I have no idea. I had subtitles and t.v. as loud as I could and I still did not understand anything. The development (or lack thereof) for her, her two friends and the villains were laughable. There will also be levels you have to go through it - they will not give you any clue as to what you have to do next and you will literally be in most of the tombs of HELL as HOURS trying to figure out what the hell you're supposed to be doing. There's a course (out of two) in particular with her on a motorcycle (Believe me it's not at all fun) that you'll be in ATLEASE for an hour without saving point in sight. That means you get hit by the other driver and guys in vans throwing you or you hit a tree. You start the hour of hiking. Stupid Boss F * ck: You know, let's make the levels very long, basically no salvage points, no history, no character development, no variety in the game, has the highest part of the song at the longest levels of ear, and gives no indication to the player to stay even longer in one place instead of reaching the nonexistent plot. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck a: These sound like banging ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs character development, plot or shameless gameplay. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, sir, but these ideas look like they'll do away with the player. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Shut up Todd. You are fired. <br /> <br /> Game: All she does is shoot. Of course she can flip while SHOOTING, jumping while SHOOTING, or kicking while SHOOTING again. But pitching, jumping and kicking does not erase the fact that all she's finally doing is SHOOTING. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: The intro music is extremely beautiful. I love hearing that. The music of the game goes from tolerable to wanting to cut your ears. Visuals: Since this game was made in 2006, I was hoping the look would surprise me. Bottom-line: This game is a mess with no character development, with a poorly dressed unmarysuish (THANKFULLY) young women in the lead who passes by boring tombs to some annoying reason (what could this be me could not say) with unimaginative shooting gameplay. STAY AWAY FROM THESE B.S. !!!!!!!! It gets two stars for having a woman who is not a damsel in danger (no matter how sparsely dressed she may be) and beautiful in music.
