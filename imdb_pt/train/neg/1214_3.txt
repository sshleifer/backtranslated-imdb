A friend once asked me to read a screenplay of him that had been chosen by a movie studio. To say that it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I've ever read would be a bold euphemism. However, I never told you this. Because? Because in a world where films like "While She Was Out" can be enlightened and attract an Oscar-winning star like Kim Basinger, a script without character, content, and common sense is no guarantee that it will not be sold. As so many other critics pointed out, "While She Was Out" is a terribly poorly written Woman-in-Peril film that abused Basinger housewife, hunted down by four unlikely covers on Christmas Eve. Every complaint is legitimate, from weak dialogue and poor acting to the lapses of jaw-dropping logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. Here are some things that have impressed me: 1) I do not care how much we think your husband is an idiot, the house is a mess with toys. Since when has it turned into child abuse to make children learn themselves? <br /> <br /> 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Of course the movie is stupid. But there are also the myriad "thrillers" I have sat where women are portrayed as wailing, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman making the best of her executioners. <br /> <br /> 4) LOVED the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although a previous reviewer coined this phrase, I really think this movie should be renamed as "The Red Toolbox of Doom".
