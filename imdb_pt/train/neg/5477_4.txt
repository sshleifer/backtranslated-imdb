Grab a SciFi Original Movie and mix up a little alternative / revisionist story, and you'll get "Aztec Rex". Apparently Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, had to first conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and his companion. That's the essence of this movie. Given the plot it might have actually sucked; the fact that only a kind of sucked is a tip of the cover for the writers. There are some problems. For starters, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is as compelling as Axl Rose as Gandhi. And while Cortes conquer the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs here seem to be interpreted by a whole Hawaiian whole. Leaving aside, the T-Rex (es) looks reasonably good, although every time one of them is hit, the CGI ends up leaking. And they die very easily; I suppose if a T-Rex were out there in real life, they could probably be shot down or at least injured by some ruthless sixteenth-century weaponry. But that takes something from the movie. There are also some human graphic scenes that swallow the T-Rex, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked well. There is a lot of action, and the whole angle of colonization is prevalent throughout, but it does not overload the dinosaur's angle, unlike the other recent SciFi dinosaur movie Original "Warbirds." Overall, a mediocre (but decent by Original SciFi) movie that ranks a modest 4.
