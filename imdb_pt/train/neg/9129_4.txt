There's no getting away ... this movie is terrible. I've seen the old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu movies, I'm familiar with the characters and their origins in series, but it's still just a marvel. However, the genius of Peter Sellers still shines with his interpretation of Nayland Smith, with echoes of sadness, tragedy and force boiling in a Stoic fa√ßade; is a performance that I put together with Van Helsing's portrait of Peter Cushing, but made in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all of Cushing's "Dracula" films. If the film was made into a more serious-comic vein like BUBBA HO-TEP via the AVENGERS TV show of the 1960s, this could have been something special. If you are a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers more complete, this is something you need to see, but it is a pass for anyone else.
