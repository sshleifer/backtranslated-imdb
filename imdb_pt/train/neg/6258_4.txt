Writer-director Tony Piccirillo has adapted his own play about a recently widowed heterosexual man, learning in the last three weeks that he is HIV-positive; He traces the only homosexual partner he has ever had, takes him to an apartment and ties him up, forcing a blood test on his face and promising bloody revenge if the results are positive. Intriguing idea sounds better in the role than it unfolds. James Marsden's captive is cynical and arrogant, but the actor's artificial mannerisms are disconcerting - it's like watching a roadshow version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder at the more challenging role, but his personality, from shy to kidnapping, is not convincing, and neither are the conversations they have. Marsden's gay party-goer is not apathetic, of course - he's momentarily sympathetic to Speedman's situation - but he does not react or behave as any homosexual man would do in that circumstance. The film is not exactly an excuse, but it is a fraud, further hampered by bad editing, poorly designed flashbacks, low budget production and the grand finale that claims to be pretentious melodrama. * 1/2 of ****
