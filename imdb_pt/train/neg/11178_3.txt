Firstly, I must admit that it is not a good movie. And I would never watch that movie if Pacino was not in it. <br /> <br /> The film is about the strange 24 hours of an advertiser. And he is overwhelmed, dizzy, sick and sometimes repentant. as the character at all.It is very annoying, after 20 minutes you can fall asleep.And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this horrible movie.Because of money or what? <br /> <br /> As I am an avid fan of Pacino, I bought this movie from 2002, People I Know. If you have not bought it, do not even think about it, it's just a waste of time.
