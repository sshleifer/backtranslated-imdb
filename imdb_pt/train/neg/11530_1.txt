For the past 10 years I have worked in 3 different professional wrestling organizations, got many professional fighters (including 2 stars from Backyard Wrestling), worked on 2 different wrestling shows, and made narration and commentary on many wrestling DVDs. I've never witnessed the level of absolute amateurish stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and poor quality production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. Even listing this as a wrestling video of any kind is a misuse of the term. Filmed with low-cost video cameras, they are essentially home videos of children struggling in backyards. The sound quality is poor, the video quality is poor and the acting is horrible. Fighters wear improvised costumes with hand-drawn t-shirts and ski masks, and hit each other with a variety of items and, halfway, mimic wrestling moves. Sometimes "matches" are in the grass. Sometimes in a backyard trampoline. EVERYONE is misinterpreted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill. In short, do not bother with this stinky one. If your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
