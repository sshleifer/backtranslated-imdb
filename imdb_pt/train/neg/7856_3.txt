This movie is very sucked. I'm in the military and the soldiers portrayed in this movie are horrible. If you are in the military and you see this movie you will laugh and get upset the whole movie because of the way they acted like a squad. That was ridiculous. They acted like a bunch of normal people in Army uniforms for not knowing what to do. It was a pretty bloody movie that I would have to say the least. There have been some scenes in which they try to make you jump. I recommend watching it if you are bored and want to see a violent and bloody movie. It will be a better movie too if you are not in the military. I would also have to say that I liked the first better than this.
