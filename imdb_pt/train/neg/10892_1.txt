This movie is horrible! I do not even know where to start, I'm speechless. I can not even describe how horrible it is. The blood is flourishing first, and the acting is AMAZING! The only good part was the biker girl who saves the day. This movie was ridiculous, I do not see how it could even get a vote of 1 as bad. It looks like it was made by high school students.
