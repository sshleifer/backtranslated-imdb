Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> No line of plot. Very little character development. <br /> <br /> Full of silly and tasteless humor. The whole movie was chaotic and without direction. There was no suitable end to the story. The airport was filmed in a mall. <br /> <br /> The same story has been chewed over and over again until you want to say "please just move on !!" Even the music and dance were meaningless and poorly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bodies out there ... but most Bollywood movies have this anyway anyway. <br /> <br /> Btw I'm not from an Indian background <br /> <br /> 2/10
