Start with the script. I've seen drawings in more depth than "envy." Whenever the characters repeat what you've seen, and it was not funny the first time, a movie is in trouble, what "Envy" certainly is. A movie that is based on a joke is better to have somewhere to go with it. Here we have a movie that is not going anywhere. Christopher Walken especially would like to forget about this bomb, because his character is very weak. Ben Stiller has been in great black comedies, "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex", immediately comes to mind. Be sure that "envy" is not a black comedy. There is no double meaning, only total absurdity. "Envy" deserves to be low, because as if it were matter, it stinks. - MERK
