Another Friday, the thirteenth ripoff, even featuring some of their songs! A group of young adults meets for a small high school reunion and begins to be shot down to the Jason Voorhees. Could it be that nerd they used to torment at school? <br /> <br /> The slash-fest routine is fun for fans of the genre, and contains the usual T & A quota for movies, if it is not so. The ending is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher. <br /> <br /> MPAA: Indicated for violence / blood, language, sexuality, nudity and some drug content.
