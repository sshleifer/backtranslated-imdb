This was one of the most ridiculous movies we've seen in recent months with a predictable storyline and a very bad acting (mostly from the supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the movie itself ... Hugh Laurie obviously worked hard to learn how to dance Samba, but the scope of his character was only needed . let him soak in the children's end of the pool. The movie is based on the looks of a lovely girl and good music, but these are not enough to make good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio, or the interior of a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10.
