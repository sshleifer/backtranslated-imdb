I do not believe in all the praise for this movie. The piece and the movie were an imitation of Sleuth. Michael Caine wants him to be Olivier, and Reeves would like him to be Caine. Caine even had the guts to do a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law doing its original part. Jude Law? You mean what did the remake of "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> This movie was made during a period of Caine's career, when it was obvious that he needed to pay gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would star in such award-winning films as "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure." What seems to be driving the praise for this movie is Reeves' death. He deserves more than being remembered for this bad movie. And so does Caine. This movie can be found at the $ 5.97 deposit at Walmart. Along with precious stones like "The Island" and "Guilt in the River".
