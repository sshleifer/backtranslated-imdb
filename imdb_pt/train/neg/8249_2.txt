Hi everyone, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie sucks. Think "Love Actually" in reverse. Nothing fits very well, nothing is consistent and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a total failure. As indicated, however, there are three redeeming points about this mutilated potential of a film. <br /> <br /> A) With a star billing Jennifer Love Hewitt, there will be hordes of guys who will submit with grace to see this. just to get a glimpse of petite Hewitt in tight clothes. To tell you now ... there are some promising scenes ... but it's a really weak eye drop. The "possibilities" here are diluted. However, I watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene of you know what ... exciting! <br /> <br /> B) The ending is romantic and positive. That is the opposite and "over the top" is relevant ..... yet for me it was still a plus point. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays a friendly amourous face ........ REFRESHING! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, it's not worth your 10 or more dollars. <br /> <br /> 2/3 of the way, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend. Although I accept it back for now ... it depends a lot on her next movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and her sister is kind of an idiot. Her husband is very stupid ... and what the hell, she's kind of dumb. <br /> <br /> Next time. I can not wait for the next love with JLH!
