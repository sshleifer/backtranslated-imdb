I think this movie is an homage to the first Superman movie, as it's as crispy and painfully long as the original. <br /> <br /> After an opening scene consisting only of obscure intergalactic visuals, the credits are a tribute. for the futuristic credits of the original Superman movie, even crummy-looking-for-his-time. <br /> <br /> So, there are some more obscure things. Ma Kent sees some kind of riot on the farm, and he spends a good part of my life walking slowly to some debris in the cornfield. Then the Superman comes sneakily and faints. <br /> <br /> Then we talk to Lex Luthor in a scene about many obscure close-ups of an old lady while she dies. We do not see Luthor's face until the end of the scene, an early example of the film to leave no stone unturned. Lex Luthor is a guy who does not like Superman because he is not human. In addition, he probably also does not like humans, since the film occasionally features some sort of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of Earth's population. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent appears back at his house. Old work (I forgot to mention, he had been away on a five year journey where nothing happened). He then discovers that Lois Lane has an illegitimate child and is dating Cyclops. This disturbs him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a frame. <br /> <br /> At this point, we see that Miss. Lane is in some kind of jet connected to something. type of space shuttle. It's some kind of important event because of this it's on television. So we learned that there are people in a control room monitoring this event. There are also people watching on the television and there are pilots in the cockpit. The movie then reminds us that these people are involved cutting through them for most of the summer. <br /> <br /> As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster began to form, I asked for permission to get a soda. I accidentally went back to the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in full. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but somehow I joined the Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row. Then it's time to stop playing. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater, found my seat, and looked up to see that the imminent disaster of space shuttle Lois Lane was almost there. Still, it seemed to take forever, so I wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son, and sent him to college. While attending my son's medical school graduation, I remembered that I should probably take a look at Superman Returns, so I apologized and went back to the theater only to find that there was no need to hurry. It still took about half an hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane. When they did, Superman saved everyone, which was cool. <br /> <br />. And then there's a subplot in which Superman becomes really scary and starts chasing Lois Lane and her family with her x-ray vision and super audition. So he tries to get her to bring in Cyclops, who seems to be a good guy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in some sort of contest to display all possible generic villain behaviors before the end of the movie. . I forgot to bring my score card home with me (they give you one at the door), but I think he scored almost one hundred percent. I hope he earns the million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, things start to prepare for the grand dark end. I think maybe the projector was broken because the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here. I remember seeing obscure things coming out of the water, Superman getting sick, Superman getting better, going back to somber things, he's sick again, no waits, he's fine again. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luthor released his last movement of the villain: yelling a little with his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Then the Superman died and came to life. I thought the movie was over so I left. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, the home where I lived seemed a little cold. I noticed that I left my sweater in the theater and went to fetch it. When I did, I was a bit surprised to find out that Superman Returns had not yet finished. I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed, but most of them were just skeletons with long gray beards now. <br /> <br /> I sat down in my old seat and saw Lois Lane wheel by her house for a while. So Superman appeared and started citing the beginning of the movie, and since I've seen the part I thought it was okay to leave. <br /> <br /> So this is my review of Superman Returns. <br /> Ah, also, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about a dog eating another dog, you will love this movie. Because of two jokes like that.
