Although not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name on the opening credits of 'Joshua'. Heck, I did not even know he was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it's clear that I was watching the movie based on the movie, not the leads. A kind of 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Omen' or any other demonic child movie 'Joshua' was announced. Unfortunately, it fell. Slowly, incredibly slow and flat. However, I kept seeing how all this would resolve, hoping, beyond belief, that the final climax would give some light on the subject. Okay, I'll admit, yes (a little bit), but what an obsolete closure. And that low budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. Does a person fall? you do not see the fall, you see someone laying in what looks like blood. Is a person hit by a taxi? you do not see, you see someone complaining, holding a bicycle. I'm not sure if this is called "style" or laziness or simply, lack of funds for special effects. Do we have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a workaholic father trying to balance everything, a child? Joshua, who may or may not be the antichrist and a newborn girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she's alive? And what was that? Are there rats above or is it Joshua? Is your mother crazy? Is Joshua crazy? Is he just jealous of the newcomer to the family? Will he grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does he take his family to the edge of the abyss? I think not. They were crazy before, and no "dictated" performance could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, almost no question has been answered, hardly any open door is closed. I'm sure this might have been the idea, but, for God's sake, give me something. Anything. There are very good movies for those who will explore. Joshua is more like the Antichrist's Mini-Me.
