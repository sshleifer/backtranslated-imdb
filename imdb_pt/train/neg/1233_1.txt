Oh my God. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. beyond the point that seems to be written by a child of 5 years. the plot, the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace. <br /> <br /> Normally I'm not that critical of any movie, because every person has his style. But this movie, however, was probably the worst movie I've seen in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and I think it should stay that way, because movies like these are making the genre thriller a joke. /> <br /> I advise anyone who is a fan of thriller movies, or simply movies to stay away from this.
