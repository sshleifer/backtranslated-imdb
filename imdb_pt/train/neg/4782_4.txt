1ยบ visto 12/24/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff that really is not specific enough to explain how the actual story happened in this fact-based incident of a man who is unfairly placed in prison trying to get a job for his family make Christmas happen for them. The three children of the family then fled from home on a walk to Washington D.C. to enlist then-President of the United States, Herbert Hoover. This journey provides some parallel stories, such as their positive encounters with a homeless man and a puppeteer, which makes the story a Disney movie "Animals on the run" and does not fit right here. In the end, there are no details on how the president helped the family and this is another downside to the movie, in my opinion. The movie ends up bringing tears, but it takes a long time to get to that. The movie should not have been an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but does it have the obvious fade-outs that make it look like this? so I'm not sure if their information is accurate. All in all, this is a simple movie (which could have been more complex) with a happy Christmas story, but gently played and without much substance.
