This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it, thinking that I really would like to have good fighting. Dude this sucks! Fast flashy cuts, an extremely annoying speaker, and their struggles were heavily edited and shortened (I'm thinking especially of Jet Li's fight in Fists of legend and Jackie Chan's fight of the drunken master 2). <Br /> <br /> And what's the problem with those street fighters fighting?! What's so "cool" about it? I've seen more interesting fights over Martial Law! <br /> <br /> This is a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie again! Do not encourage people who did this crap to do more of this crap! <br /> <br /> Instead, buy the movies where the fights and fights of their uncut glory came from!
