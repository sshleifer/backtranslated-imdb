The plot of this movie is not anything strong, many holes. If you approach as a car movie is not bad, many big cars in this. The reason I like it is because I am from the area where this was filmed. I have the great pleasure of looking at the recognizable sites in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the city has changed since 89. It is an interesting historical piece for us locals. It seems like whenever a movie is made here everyone wants some relationship with it. It is impossible to find a copy at any of the local video stores because they were all stolen when she left on VHS. I had to get a copy of Japan on Ebay, I find it interesting how the drag race way is all over the city. I did not know the director was from St.Cloud.
