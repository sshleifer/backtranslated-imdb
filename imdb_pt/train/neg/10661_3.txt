It is "The F.B.I." starring Reed Hadley, with a cast of guests from all the stars! The movie begins with an accidental (convenient?) Sequestration, which leads to one thing, and another - which does not really indicate the main story, which is a "Big House, USA". history of the prison. The story is very unlikely, to say the least. It's like a TV show, only more "violent" (for the times). <br /> <br /> BUT - the cast is a journey! Imagine this: Ralph Meeker is sent to prison; his cellmates are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading a magazine "Muscle"!) and William Talman (reading a magazine "Detective"!). Honest! You should know that an initial scene reveals what happens to the "missing" kid, responding to the final "narration". If you do not want to have this suspension, do not miss the opening scenes between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian doing well as an asthmatic fugitive). <br /> <br /> Big House, USA (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
