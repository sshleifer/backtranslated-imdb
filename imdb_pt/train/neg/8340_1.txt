One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was so bored that I hung up halfway to watch the news. When I called again, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are some more dreams in between. Come on, what should keep me interested in this? A movie must have a reason to be interesting. The minute you felt the movie was just a dream, it's when some moviegoers hang up. Has anyone insisted on telling their dreams and what does this mean for them? It is !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely awful.
