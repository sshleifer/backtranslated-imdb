Photos of the Republic arrive at the end of the game to the genre "werewolf" er Werecat. The plot has a writer who returns to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed the fear of the jungle during which he had blackouts. He is coming to great acclaim as his novel that accompanies an infamous trial is a bestseller. The French government wants to know if he has access to secret documents, something that seems more likely when an employee is killed by a "catman." Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc√© ends up dead. To complicate things is the return of blackouts so the writer does not know if he is the killer or not. <br /> <br /> The suspense is very pleasant to be enjoyed. There are many musical numbers at the beginning and a lot of time dead when things are all talking in the middle and later sections. The acting is good and the sets are good, but there's a reason most people I know just remember the killer in a top hat, he's the most interesting thing in this movie. Despite its short running time (just over an hour), I think the reason this movie was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you start to lose patience with it. No matter how good the conversation, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, in the final minutes, it was a bit too late. <br /> <br /> Accept.
