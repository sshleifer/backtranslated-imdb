I'm curious is actually two movies in one medium is the experimental sexual side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with the political / socialism. Whatever the director's intent, the two do not really match. The director should have taken the romantic side of Lena and made a separate film for politics. There is a bizarre mix of political / war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flaccid breasts and pubic hair. The film looks more like a fictional documentary than a movie. In addition to the interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored watching this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think nude / sexual scenes are exaggerated for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. Generalized nudity is a great distraction from any entanglement that exists. I think the cast did a good job though. They played their parts credibly. There is little of the over-the-topness that I am so used to seeing in American movies during this time.
