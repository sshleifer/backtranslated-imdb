"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy", whatever you want to call it ... just does not hit the target. Maybe it's just me, maybe I just do not like Gangster comedies (as I thought Oscar, Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked) It's probably more "spirited wordplay" than everything outside Comedy, only it's not so witty and sharp like him or the other commentators) Make out to be. <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old to start making it a joke that was sometimes painful to watch. <br /> <br /> There were no Local Changes or Feel Enough for the period in which they should be. Most of the film was set in "Dreyfus's Club" or in a variety of Offices / rooms in dim lighting. .. (what was with the Sit down Gun that Goldblum kept winning?) The support cast was ... in the excellent Paper (great to see Silva & Drago), but characters were killed before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a joke! The Romance and Love element of the movie also ties in. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I do not think I'll do it anytime soon.
