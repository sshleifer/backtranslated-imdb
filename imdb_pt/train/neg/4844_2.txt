I am definitely in the minority opinion on this. "The Hurt Locker" has won more critics' "Best Picture" awards than any other movie this year. However, not only did I not like it, but I also found it difficult to sit down. <br /> <br /> There is a minimal plot and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight and disarm more bombs. This is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking. This has been a recent fad in the cinema and is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap documentary look. The camera was shaking so hard that it made me sick to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not care about war movies and "The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you do not have to believe my word, because critics love it.
