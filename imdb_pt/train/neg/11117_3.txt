Spooks is a nice trash, featuring some well-directed sequences, ridiculous plot lines and dialogues, and some third-rate action. <br /> <br /> Many have described that this is a British version of "24", and one can see the similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares the foolish foolish plots, but the execution is much more discreet, sexier and I suspect, man. <br /> <br /> Some people describe weak comedy as "soft comedy." . <br /> <br /> This is a gentle hour of espionage history, just the opposite of anything created by John Le Carr√©. <br /> <br /> Give me a smile any day.
