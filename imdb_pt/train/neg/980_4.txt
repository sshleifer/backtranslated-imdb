My first full Heston movie. The movie that everyone already knows the end. A "science fiction thriller". The exaggerated factor. Everything that came with this movie was injected into my head when I rented it, and the morning I watched, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood I was in. (Do not want to move.) Put on the player, hide in blankets ). And although I tried to understand what was going on to lead to the end that will be eternally ruined by pop culture, this really did not happen. Everything was everywhere, the relationships had no backbone, the end had no advantage. Everything was kind of weird and the observer has no choice but to leave partially baffled in the end that arrives, because even though we all know that they are people, they are quick answers as to why people make any serious attempt to enjoy the movie for something other than the foolishness thrown out the window.
