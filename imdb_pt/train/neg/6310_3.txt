I watched this movie last night and was a bit disappointed. Many of the "facts of time" were off. At the beginning of the film, the grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when 9/11 was hit. This movie was supposed to have happened in 1994. In addition, one of the friends of the grandchildren was wearing an Eagles Donovan McNabb jersey. He had not even been summoned yet. The plot was good, but the facts and timeliness of the timeline were so off base that it made the film look extravagant. My boyfriend is an avid reader of books and memorabilia from World War II. I rented this movie hoping it would be good. The performance was like this. The dog was cute. But the way this movie was made made me happy that I only paid 4 dollars to rent it as opposed to 50 that would have taken me to watch it in a theater. I hope that anyone who has read this will understand that I do not mean discontent for those who fought in the war, but the facts and timeline should have been monitored a little more closely.
