Anyone who has seen Scott Hicks' 'Shine' from the moving but ultimately merry life of pianist David Helfgotts; Am I sure that "SOLOIST" is too bad by comparison. It's as slow as a lullaby (I took five pauses answering emails just to wake up). The description of the homeless area far above the top and extremely self-indulgent in a couple I dread with the horrible beach battle depiction on Joe Wrights another disaster Attonment. J. Fox's performance was an extremely poor example of performance and, on the other hand, he lacked credibility in offset. although he's struggling with a poorly paced movie, he still manages to charm, is that right, or is he turning into George Clooney in more than one?). Comparing both known "STAR'actors", it is unnecessary, since the light that shines the most with regard to acting should be that of Geoeffry Rush's "brightness" which has a brilliant performance definitely much brighter in my sky. With both "Attonment" and "The Soloist", the written word gains much more prizes for subject empathy. Read the book and the articles or expect the DVD to be in the bargain basement soon.
