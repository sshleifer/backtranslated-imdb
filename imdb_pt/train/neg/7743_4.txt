This movie was one of the worst I've seen in a long time. It's a combination of crime drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, investigating a shootout at a hip hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is planned and there are many parallel issues going on. Ford is rushing the real estate market (Martin Landau is one of its customers), Hartnett runs a yoga school where he is stealing girls in their spare time, the two are under investigation by Internal Affairs, Ford is rubbing the ex girlfriend ( Lena Olin) of the IA investigator and she is a psychic who has a radio show, the man who organized the murder at the club is a dirty cop who shot Hartnett's father years ago. <br /> <br /> Mandatory car chases and some useless attempts at humor, and that's about the essence of that turkey.
