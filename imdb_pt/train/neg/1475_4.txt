Most Season 1 episodes are horrible. There is no comparison with Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, since the programs had decent story lines. Most surprising stories are pretty boring .. not surprising at the least .. rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I heard the 2nd season of this series is much better .. also for some reason on the DVD they cut the parts by Ray Walston that further diminish this compilation. The cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most stories are very predictable and the series could be better with twists and turns that left you thinking ...
