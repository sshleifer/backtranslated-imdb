I love murderous insect movies, they are very fun to watch, I had to watch this movie as it was one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. <br /> <br /> I met him and I would listen to him as this movie was terrible as he said it was after he said that I was still dying to see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> The plot: people are dying mysteriously and horribly, and no one has a clue What is the cause? <br /> <br /> Only health care agent Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory about murderous slugs is ridiculed by the authorities. <br /> <br /> Only when the body count starts to rise and a slug specialist in England starts snooping, it seems Mike had the right idea after all. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most exaggerated you have ever seen in a movie! Slugs in this movie are fast (so normal) and it looks like they are fast moving through the scenes! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing like the book, the book was ten times more scary, ten times more bloody and had many more stories about it! <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all! As I am big fan of Slugs the book and second book called Breeding ground! Both books are great <br /> <br /> Read the book and see the movie, you may like it more than I
