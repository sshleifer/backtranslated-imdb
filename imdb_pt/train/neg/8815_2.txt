Yes, I'll talk about it, so do not read if you want surprises. I have the one with the title Christmas Evil. There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. Considering Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) had a lot of potential and was very close to being good, this was not so good. It started off interesting enough watching the villain (if you can call it that) by watching the neighborhood kids and writing books about who is evil and cool, but after a while you're looking for some action and that movie does not deliver. You need character development, but this goes overboard and you still do not know why the hell the guy grabs. About an hour he kills three or four people while an entire crowd watches in terror, and the guys he kills are not even their targets, they're just making fun of him. This is one of the many unsuccessful attempts of the killer to hit the bastard. He then begins to try to kill this other guy, and he tries to break into his house, squeezing himself into the fireplace. He promptly gets stuck and barely gets out. He then enters the basement and then tries to kill the guy, suffocating him in his room. He can not kill the guy that way, so he picks up a star from the tree and cuts off the guy's throat. What the hell was a tree doing in the bedroom in the first place? Oh yeah, the killer before that killing stopped at a party and had fun too. Well, it's about it, except for the people in town chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that song he wants to play. What was that? He kept talking about something that was never really explained. As you finish you ask, well, since I have spoilers I'll tell you. He runs off the road in his van and proceeds to, well, let's just say he was lame !!!!!!!!!!!!
