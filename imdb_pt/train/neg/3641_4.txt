Recap: According to legend, Valkyrie Brunhilda challenged Odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire. Only a pure warrior of heart can cross the flames, free Brunhilde and free her from the claim of Odin, and have it for herself. Now the war is brewing in the Nordic lands, and the king needs an alliance with the Berserkers. The Berserkers are warriors claimed by the valkyries of Odin, desiring war, blood and flesh, and therefore outcasts, but superior in battle. The leader of the Berserkers is a despised son of the king, Boar, and his price for the alliance is his brother, the future king, Barek. But after the king is victorious in battle, he refuses to give up his only remaining son, breaking his oath to Boar and betraying him and killing him. The boar is saved only by Barek's call to Odin. But this is only the beginning of the battle between the brothers, and their final battle is about to begin now, a millennium later ... Comments: I was hoping that this would be a movie based on some Viking terrain, very little quality film on the Viking was made. It started very well too, with detailed longships and armor, nice and proper scenarios and an OK battle. <br /> <br /> The basis on Aesir's myths is thin and looks very corrupt to me. Odin is much more vindictive, rancorous and absent than I remember him from school, and the valves have been turned into some vampire demons. I'm no expert, but this seems totally wrong. <br /> <br /> But the fatal mistake made by this movie is to change the time from the original time period to that of today. If the two brothers had fought on time, with some decent battles, that movie would have been much better. Now the setting is suddenly changed to the current day in Stockholm. Still, Odin is present and is sending Boar and his berserkers to Brunhilda and Barek, who gives silly scenes when Barek enters Barek among the industries. Beautiful mountains and woods were replaced by cement. And when I allowed myself to focus on unique fights rather than massive battles as at first, I quickly saw that the actors' struggles and skills are slow and awkward. <br /> <br /> The end result is a fine story, sometimes hard to follow and sometimes just silly, and the only one that could save you, the action, is drawn from slow, dull, clumsy swordfights . It draws very little from the myth of Aesir or the Viking tradition. So both the story and the action fail, and the film is just plain bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, as a Swede, this movie is a bit confusing. Supposedly filmed entirely in South Africa, it still contains some familiar Swedish signs, signs and what looks like an authentic police car. However, the effort is weak and only goes so far, to really set it in Sweden. No name is Swedish (perhaps with Anya as an exception), no family scenario is Swedish, they (supposedly) speak a little (old?) Norwegian, not Swedish. And the uniforms, both police and medical, are clearly not Swedish. If they did not try to do it right - and really gave the illusion that he is in Sweden, why bother? <br /> <br /> 4/10
