I have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show. The acting was aggressive and amateurish, the story was old news and the development of the plot (or the lack of it) invariably made my eyelids fall less than halfway through each episode. That's all there is to say about it, because it genuinely lacked any kind of substance. <br /> <br /> How can you like crap like that? It's stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it better ... It's as if some of you look unthinkingly at the trash like this just because you like the way some of the actors look, or because, for some crazy reason, you do not have I've seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before. <br /> <br /> I just ... forget. This show sucks, and fortunately it's gone forever. I wish they could work demolishing The O.C. once and for all.
