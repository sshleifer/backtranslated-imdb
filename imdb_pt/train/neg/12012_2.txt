The dialogue was very terrible. The plot is not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents. Not visually stunning. In fact visually annoying at times. Definitely one of those movies that you find easier to finish if you keep a finger on the fast forward button. If you could watch it for free, there is absolutely no other option open at the moment and you really enjoy seeing the little lady poltergeist ... well, maybe I recommend it to you but no one else could think at the moment.
