This movie is fun enough because of Virginia Madsen's excellent performance and the fact that Lindsey Haun is lovely. However, the reason the film is so predictable is that we've seen it all before. I have not read The Mother's Gift, but hopefully for the sake of Britney and Lynne Spears it's completely different than this movie. Unless you consider closing a movie with what is essentially a video clip an original idea, the whole movie brings to mind the word plagiarized.
