I rented this movie to see what could be a bloody, non-stop action movie, and got this overly sentimental, over-budget low-budget action drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and when Lou saves Reb from the monsters, he gets shot in the head in one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam scenes are filmed in someone's yard, I swear! Lou now has problems with his brain and Reb and he live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a kill to retrieve it. There are no good fight scenes, the punches are two inches away from a person. The characters' personalities change in a matter of seconds. One guy is bad and in the next scene he is good. The acting is horrible and the song is an overly sentimental Frank Stallone song that would make you sick. I hated this movie.
