<br /> <br /> Cheap and ugly, this movie does not even seem to entertain children in the audience, except for a fun bathroom joke. Christopher Lloyd is far from his prime and, indeed, quite tiring in that role, although the sad excuse for the writers jokes does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateur in a supposedly comedic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There's really no reason to do this movie, especially since it's inevitable that it compares to the brilliant improvisations of Robin Williams in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
