Proof that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold. That's definitely more plastic, all the way. It's easy to see that without Quentin's involvement, this would probably have been on the shelf for years, assuming it would have been produced in the first place. It's about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes, Angela Jones is not convincing in this role, William Baldwin is better as the Serial Killer that keeps Jones on the job! All in all very poor.
