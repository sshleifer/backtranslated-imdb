This is incredibly bad and incredibly embarrassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is ranked among the top five companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE AMAZING BLOODY MOVIES! This is not especially bad. It's especially typical and typically bad, filmed in two-bit hotels and public parks with fine directing, high school acting and "gee whiz ... let's see what that button on the camera does ??" photography. If Michael Moriarity was so determined to do an imitation of Jack Nicholson, could not he at least have made a good representation of Jack Nicholson? And if the film was filmed in Vancouver, truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world and also a yacht building center (part of the "plot"), why, in God's name, did we let the endemic Canadian inferiority complex that was disguised? Seattle ??? Not only am I crazy about this movie, I'm embarrassed and more than a little embarrassed. Australians reveal some splendid things. We produce second-rate piffle pretentious. Gawd !!!!!
