I was not expecting much from a movie directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren, but I certainly was expecting more than one obtained. One-line user commentary - second-rate action movie - did not strike me as deprecating for a Lundgren movie. On the other hand, I would not have bothered to watch this movie if its rating was below 5.0, but, hey, the film had 5.9 out of 10, which I found quite acceptable for this type of production . <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of the people who rated this movie as 10 (excellent) were clearly a publicity stunt because DETENTION is the regular trash from Nu Image that you've seen before, again and again. <br /> <br /> Lundgren does not convince him as an ex-military man who turned out to be a history teacher assigned to a difficult school. His acting is simply terrible, unemotional and planned. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in scenes with juvenile delinquent boys. Either they are great actors or, compared to Lundgren, they look like great actors - just because they seem natural and believable. <br /> <br /> DETENTION has some elements that could have been potentially interesting to this low-budget movie - a closed film. - for the high-security weekend, four teenagers in detention with a veteran war teacher and a bunch of ruthless criminals trying to get in - but the story (something like THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD, or is PANIC ROOM?) is full of unbelievable situations, many cliches and stereotyped characters. And let's not forget that Dolph Lundgren is the lead actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dob√≥ play a couple of Bonnie and Clyde in love and they present the most acceptable performances of the film, even though he seems to be a low-level actor. budget version of Sam Rockwell and her, a Milla Jovovich wants to be. In a movie where everything fails, its madness and style provided enough fresh air to keep my interest from falling to zero.
