Whack !!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed to find out that she was in two short scenes at the end. Other than that I was basically pushing the fast forward button all the time. A teenager travels to Romania with his father and is bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there is a full moon. He kills his father and friends. About 30 years ago, but he does not get old and enroll in a high school. There he meets a shy teacher who bites and then has children with her. This movie sucks and I do not recommend it to anyone. Read War and Peace instead. Only Mrs. Hartman did a great job. Check out a very young Bob Saget on this one !!
