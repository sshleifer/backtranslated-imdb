As a former Kalamazoo resident with a penchant for the city, I was eager to see this movie. But, what a disappointment! Although the acting and production values ​​are not bad, the script is horrible, the plot is unrealistic and the subject is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of this movie is that women are nothing without husbands and children. I can hardly believe how regressive it is in his view of women. Has the writer lived under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I would not suggest this movie to anyone. It's terrible. It is an embarrassment to the city that bears the name.
