This movie had to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, horrible and tacky and talking about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again nor will I recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the film started, I realized what I got into. All they did for this movie were copying scenes from many other horror films out there and they grouped them all in this single movie. The prank calls, Halloween night, a psychopath and a knife! It's absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared during the movie, which I thought horror movies should do. As for the making of the film, it's rather hilarious as everyone talks about how this movie was so good and scary. I mean, how do you not realize that movies are a cheap theft of "horror movie", for example. At least get some good actors there and maybe it was a good horror movie.
