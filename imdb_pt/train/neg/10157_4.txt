Slashers ..... well if you like horrors is definitely one to watch, otherwise do not even bother. It is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget, for example, it seems that the whole movie was filmed in one warehouse somewhere, and on numerous occasions you will see the shadow of the microphone and the shadow of the camera man, believe me you will not have to look for them. Also try to ignore the cheesy actors, if that's how you call them !! Some people decide to go to a game show where they have to survive a night in a big labyrinth due to being 3 murderers on the loose and who lives in the end gets rich. Now there is something about this movie that keeps you watching and you rarely find it with a cheap budget horror these days, For example when I watched this I thought to myself I would'nt mind having a go at this game! especially for $ 12,000,000. Anyway, I recommend you watch it and make up your own mind.
