Obvious attack against Microsoft by people who do not seem to understand intellectual property or the market economies in general. Loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates, and is a corporate villain of cartoons ordering murders. While Microsoft may engage in some anti-competitive activity at times, they are unlikely to actually murder people. So the movie is at the top and ridiculous from the start. <br /> <br /> The "deeper" point is apparently that major technological innovations should be free to the public, and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that most innovations would never have been developed were it not for the market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property. <br /> <br /> One thing is to oppose anticompetitive conduct - - this is common sense. Another is to oppose the competition in the market, which is what the mantra of the film represents ("knowledge belongs to mankind"). Another example of Hollywood being completely out of touch with reality. .
