(First of all, sorry for my lousy English) Of course, only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include such serious hits. I'm Norwegian and I felt offended and shocked by the creators of this movie who did not have time to do research on making this American / "Norwegian" movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about that country. <br /> <br /> So I'm posting my corrections because of my frustration: -The country is called Norway, not Norway. "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. Norwegian priests never wear these black cloaks with white paper on their necks, as the Protestant church is the dominant from afar. - It is true that we have a traditional native folk costume (which we only use twice a year), but the clothing in this film is more like a German outfit. -I could not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie .. Jessica was making no sense .. neighter made the "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I recognize is the Norwegian flag (and the hats vikings but this is so stereotypical what people think about Norway - Vikings !: gosh) Well, I guess the people who made this movie will never read this comment. but at least I clarified a few things and got rid of some of that frustration ... <br /> <br /> I'm proud of my country and would love it if people in the US were less stereotyped and more accurate when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> That was all .. Lenge light Norge! P
