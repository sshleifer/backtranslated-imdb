"The Lady and the Duke" by Eric Rohmer, is based on the diaries of an English aristocrat who lived the French Revolution. But it's a blistering affair, with its strange painted scenarios and an educated conversational tone. Most notably, this picture of the age of terror occurs almost entirely at a distance from actual action; Very little is seen of the ordinary people in this film and little of the chaos, poverty and terror that has unfolded in the halls of the persecuted, but spoiled, aristocratic classes. The result is often tedious and ultimately ill-advised about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; It's a disappointing movie from an acclaimed director.
