Feeding The Masses was just another movie trying to earn a little money from the zombie craze that circulates, mainly due to the popularity of films like Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts at a television station, which is monitored by the military, and is reporting that the Lazarus virus (zombies) is close to containment and that the city will soon be free to do business again. The problem is that this is totally false. Zombies are running loose and only a small minority of people are aware. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), camera man, Sherry (Rachael Morris), the leading anchor woman (who for some reason is listed as Shelly on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), his military escort. Torch and Sherry are against lying to people, but the station is being run by secret services (or some other government agency) and they are heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This film slaps the back of the audience. cover box saying "We hold FEEDING THE MASSES at a higher level than any of the three 'of the Dead Movies' by George A. Rombero." The source of this quote has lost all credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this movie is bad. I do not mean badly as I was expecting more (I obviously was, though) but I mean bad in that I could not find any redeeming quality in the movie, whatever. Acting everywhere is finished or too much wood. Does anyone remember your lines or are you reading suggestion letters? I can not even think of what was the best part of the movie or the best actor / actress. There really was not one. If I had to give someone a nod, I would say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character, but that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> I would have to recommend to pass this film, although the cover of the box looks very good (is what originally attracted me to the film). 3/10
