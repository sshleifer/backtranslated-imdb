I'm not a big rom / coms fan at the best of times. Some have been very good (Dream for Insomniac check), but this is just more of the same, but less. <br /> <br /> With a run time of 100min, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins. The only real chuckle is when strangers and friends instinctively help Lee's character. All I can say is AVOID. I guarantee there are at least 10 other movies on the shelf that you deserve. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (And just because I'm a big fan of Lee)
