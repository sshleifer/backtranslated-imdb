ALL SPOILERS: Gettaway is mostly an action movie. And what action there is for !! Shooting, chasing, dumps and more. It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coy's. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I did not see the original, but I did not really care about this, although Bassenger and Baldwin have a good chemical screen. But the movie itself did not do that for me. <br /> <br /> The Gettaway has become really tiring very quickly. The plot is overshadowed by one fight / chase after another and as violence continues to pile up, Bassenger and Baldwin keep their great looks, no matter what perils they may be. In fact, at the end of the movie they almost look BETTER then at the beginning. I do not think the makeup of Bassenger's eyes moves once during the whole scene. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, certainly not, but it's not very good and unless one is a purist action movie I can not really see this movie because there's not much on here. The Gettaway is also not very original, and goes from everything, from brutally unnecessary to rather annoying. It really could have been better, I guess. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin give performances OK, but they do not have much to do except be chased and run for their lives. Sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again, becomes obsolete. I did not like that much.
