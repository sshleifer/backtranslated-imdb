Simply not the quality I expected from Morris (Love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is very much like a not-so-bad student film. What worries me, in all of this is why you won a BAFTA ??? Morris ridicules "conspicuous mediocrity" (Ayn Rand) for much of his work (Nathan Barley) and even with this play he is urinating on the backs of the talented and telling us it's raining! <br /> <br /> I just hope he has chosen a subject that I would love to address (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions) that he will not risk, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of the dominant ignorance and opinion about this emotionally strong phenomenon.
