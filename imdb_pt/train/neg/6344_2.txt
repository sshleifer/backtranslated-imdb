Well, I'm blown away, a Woody Allen movie that I quit after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral frailty of commenting on a movie I've seen less than half of, but I hope you understand why). Basically, it became apparent from a very early age that we would be sponsored from the screen with: a script that would define its presumption as having bullet points; a cast that was trying to be characters of Hannah and Her Sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny), and were misdirected to do so; and a camera that sat around wonderfully, just so there was nothing to film, other than talking and the actor handing it over. Drama? None; is partially pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe I came out too early in this case, but then I decided against another hour and a half of a clone-liner-Allen. Does the script have its funny moments ?? I was almost entirely in the back of Will Ferrell's excerpts in the trailer (hook-hooked again, doh!) ?? but there is little rhythm to let them fly nonchalantly, as it is best. Worse than that, there is no fluidity. To say that this film is made of wood makes a forest look like a jelly: the opening of the discussion linked to coffee is the most abject case. The only thing that must be done by numbers is to roll in vase ?? 2/10
