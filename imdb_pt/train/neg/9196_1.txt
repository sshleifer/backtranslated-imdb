This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad it looks comical. First, there is no plot. The actors seem to be reading the tips cards and making things more stupid. Like being chased by dead people, but still wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, not as fun as any of Romero's work, which enters the film. And the dumbest part of all was that they showed video game flashes in action sequences. As if we did not have the video game, it's about shooting zombies. In addition, every 20-something knows how to use automatic weapons and reach a target without even aiming the weapon. And the way people die is so stupid. It's as if they ran out of ammo and kept waiting to be attacked. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of opening the door, So stupid. FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they were blessed. with a second chance. Definitely the worst movie I've seen in years. A B movie on the cinemax is better.
