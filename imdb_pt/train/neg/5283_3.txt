I was anxiously awaiting the first showing of this film since it was delivered to me on DVD for Christmas. Having booked a special place for him last night, I sat down to watch him with my daughter (aged 17 and a student of Film Studies), with chocolates, of course, anxious. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After the first two minutes, we knew we were sunk. The camera's unstable shots and angles, the general cinematography, the bad direction and the wooden performances already left us unsatisfied. Discouraged, we visualized it. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked strangely and without any particular purpose, directly at the camera on several occasions, breaking our hard-won 'fantasy of the moment' and engulfing us directly in a fashion of almost chase 'I'll find you.' Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, bless him. I hope they paid him well since he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave that predictably broke the breakwater, soaking him and his co-actor. They were almost dragged into the sea. Health and Safety would have a picnic! Poor Rupert was left spitting seawater to deliver his line. Presumably there was not enough money in the kitten for a re-filming of that scene. Anyone with any sense would not have tried on such a day in the first place. <br /> <br /> In addition to Penry-Jones, Alice Krige made the only convincing performance as Lady Russell, but her efforts were soon counterbalanced. by those of the unconvincing portrait of Anthony Head Sir Walter Elliott annoying. Toward the long awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth appeared strangely graceful Anne with a visit every two seconds having made a great effort to avoid her for most of the film. It was as if he had developed an impediment of memory that led him to forget his reason for being. In contrast, Anne hurried from pillar to post in search of the good captain who, however, had been able to summon almost all of Bath, they told us, in only three or four minutes, without even having worked hard. <br /> <br /> We did not experience any of Anne's charms crossing the screen. In fact, we wondered what the charismatic Captain Wentworth had already seen in Anne, simple and without opinion, and why anyone, anybody, did not tell Sir Walter to shut up. <br /> <br /> The crucial kiss, usually our favorite girl moment, has been painfully prolonged. As they approached, Anne kept opening and closing her mouth, which had the effect on the screen of making her look like she was chewing gum before her lips finally found each other. Hey! The sweetest thing last night was the chocolates and half an hour of mother-daughter brainstorming about how bad the movie had been. <br /> <br /> What a shame to ruin such a charming and engaging story, filmed in some of England's finest settings. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Jane.
