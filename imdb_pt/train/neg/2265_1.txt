I love watching Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but that poor excuse for a soft-core pornographic film is unnecessarily offensive, does not look anything like intelligence, and serves only as a self-promotion vehicle for Springer. Even with 90 minutes running, the movie creeps horribly, and I should have the good sense to leave. Simply atrocious.
