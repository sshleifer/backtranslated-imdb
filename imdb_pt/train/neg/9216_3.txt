Hoo boy, this was a real test to pass. The DVD case has Tom Hanks' mug stamped and is the only reason someone would buy it. He looks about forty in the box, however, the movie was made in 1982, so he still has his chest mates and of course is about forty pounds lighter. The plot is about a game of Dungeons and Dragons that Hanks and his three friends play and Hanks ends up thinking that the whole thing is real. Chris Makepeace is a genius kid named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he uses a succession of funny hats. Ooh, look, he has a yellow helmet with a tuxedo! Now he's dressed up as a World War I pilot! This was a really horrible movie, but in a bad way. A group of veterinarians appears mainly as parents of children. There's Anne (I'm Honey West, dammit!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who actually looks a bit warm. Murray Hamilton, the mayor of Jaws, has an ungrateful role as a police officer. Wendy Crewson, it's Hanks's love interest and some blond guy I've never seen before or since. There is some sweet music here and there and absolutely no tension or feeling of danger or excitement. There's a monster that only Hanks can see because he's, you know, crazy. The monster is played by the late, great Kevin Peter Hall, he of Predator fame. A friend of mine took this from the old crate of MallWart and advised me to throw it in the trash without even looking at it, so naturally I had to see if it was that bad. That was it. The night before, I watched Apollo 13, so after that, this movie was a bit shocking. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the trash. Ah, yes, after Hanks almost jumps from one of the towers of the World Trade Center because of his illusions, he goes home to recover and is visited by his friends. Hanks's mother, a drunken Vera Miles, says he's doing very well now, but when they walk up to the lake to visit him in his tennis outfit, he's crazier than ever. The end
