OK this movie was really "unique", say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented of the film, despite saying she had a cocaine problem during the film. but she said she can not remember much of it. Well, that's an excuse, but what is everyone? I can not imagine they all had a coke problem. whatever it was not so bad, I think the plot was OK and had some very funny moments. though the part where the guy gets that thing in his head was a bit too violent for my taste. oh well, I think I was disappointed because Carrie Fisher is so incredible and this movie did nothing for her.
