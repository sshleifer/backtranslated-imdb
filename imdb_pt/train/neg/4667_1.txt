Visually cluttered, less plot, incredibly numbing junk. Not even close to Greenaway's best work. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> The overlapping 'split-screen' effects do nothing more than confuse, the film is too dark for too long and the 'artistic' composition of the images is pretentious to the extreme. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic, that seeing that fills a large part of the film soon gets very annoying. <br /> <br /> Also, how can anyone say that Ewen MacGregor's acting is brilliant is beyond me. He showed more skill in the Star Wars series, and that's saying something. <br /> <br /> I have not been so impressed with a movie since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and Little People'!
