I thought Hedy Burress (who managed to escape from the first part's watery grave) was going to be part 2. I do not think so. I just think they should kill her like on Friday the 13th (part 2) (you know what I mean). <br /> <br /> This movie as Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2 followed the movies inside a movie. /> <br /> This was the PURE CRAP! The whole movie inside a filthy movie. <br /> <br /> BAD STAY AWAY!
