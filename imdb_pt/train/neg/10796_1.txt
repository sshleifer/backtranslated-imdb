This film proves that the "commercial" cinema, or otherwise, Hollywood movies are in serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason for this film to have been produced regardless of the fact that someone expected success based on Shaquille's name. It is worth referring to the plot: it is a little more perplexed than a knot. What else? The screen is a bit dark, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. Rating: 0/10.
