Everyone who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! Show yourself about all the mistakes you should not make in editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (Actually, it's so bad I can not write a sentence without an exclamation point!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs was a good family comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequence is misreading the recipe. of the first. The funny parts could be counted in one hand and maybe in half of it. Clavier is exaggerating in his role even more than in the first part, Robin is trying to act like Lemercier (because she is replacing it), but this is "grotesque." Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny alone on stage, she is not in this movie because she is not acting like she used to. I know it must be difficult to replace someone who was good at a role (Lemercier got a Caesar award for her role in the first movie), but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, did she play? Lemercier playing it 'Function! As for the story, it's awesome! Of course we knew by the end of the first film that there would be a sequel, but Poire and Clavier should try to write a simpler story like the first episode. The jokes are repetitive, childlike and déjà-vu. No, really, there are only 3 funny parts to it. The only good things can be the costumes and some special effects. So you have only 2 reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn how to edit a movie in a terrible way, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment! 2/10
