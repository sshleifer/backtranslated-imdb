Once again, Canadian TV surpasses itself and creates another program that will air after its first episode. <br /> <br /> Last time, I remember that sitcoms should induce a reaction that we in business call laughter. How funny is it to overcome the stereotype of all whites thinking that all Muslims are terrorists? Okay, maybe a joke just to stick with the masses. But not 30 minutes. It's called hitting a dead horse. Even the SNL would be able to quit after a break. <br /> <br /> In addition, let's have a little conflict in these scripts. Will she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the Ramadan fast? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh this is the Emmy-winning stuff here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! Which characters?! They are all cardboard cutouts with nothing interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to another. This is the point of the comedy of the situation. We need to have dynamic, interesting and strong characters so we are constantly drawn to the TV set every week. We have to worry about these characters to worry about what problems they will come next week. If I ever see these characters, it will be too soon. Luckily I do not remember any of their names (note to CBC - that's not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And the acting is so bland. It's more of a casting problem than of the actors. None of these people really personifies the characters they play. They seem to act like they're working on a movie of the week. Sitcoms require actors to live and breathe this character - to make them fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character they portray. Watch any American sitcom and you'll see how the characters are easily identifiable. Part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as if it could be a platform for bigger and better things, instead of being their only great character in a life for which they will spend the next 8 years portraying. This level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows. But to be honest, considering the lame concept and the horrible writing, there is not much for the actors to do, but to say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture. As another commenter mentions, this looks like a TV movie and not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And the direction or lack of it! What can I say, Canada has a lot of talent, see what the Comedy Channel is doing with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up. Look at the Trailer Park Boys (not the movie because it bit the big helium dog). Look at any American show to see the potential of our talent, for that is where many of our stars go to find a decent job. <br /> <br /> Give credit to the CBC, they really know how to build publicity for a non-event. Remember "The One"? No - well, do not even try to learn the names of the characters in this program, because it's sure to follow the dodo path. <br /> <br /> Let's all wait for a full ACTRA blow so nothing like this emerges from Ceeb for a long time.
