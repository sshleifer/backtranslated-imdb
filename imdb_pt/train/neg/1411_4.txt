This movie was great the first time I saw it when it was called "Lost in Translation". But Bill Murray somehow turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into an angry Latina woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan, turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence that we enjoy in translation, we are meaningless blabbering on 10 items that become annoying. Instead of characters who were thoughtful and introspective as in Translation, we have characters who convey useless advice on matters about which they have no clue. How does a character wearing 100-dollar shirts and never been to a Target department store expect to advise a working-class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think that this prevents you. If he is not giving advice on clothes, he is telling her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was how they supposedly were in a hurry to make an appointment, and yet the characters still find time to do another errand, whether it's washing the car, stopping at Arby's, or just being on the list. off their 10 items or less lists of things they love and hate. I kept wanting to yell at them saying, "Did not you say you had somewhere to stay? What the hell are you doing?" A minute ago you were practically late, now you're eating roast beef and reflecting on your lives! " Until I saw this movie, I never really understood how something could "insist on itself," but I think this movie does just that, and it's undeservedly so. The dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unfriendly - with the exception that I felt sorry for both actors for signing this project.
