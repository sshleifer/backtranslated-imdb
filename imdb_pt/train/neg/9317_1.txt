I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said the reason being so cheap was because the disc was scratched but did not mention that the reason was so cheap because the film was a lousy effort that sucked more than Paris Hilton. in a homemade video of a hotel room. Speaking of home videos, since when was it an honest game to release them as movies - I mean, movies used to employ actors and technicians and writers and so on - no more - just gather their friends and lame ideas. for the weekend, squandering production on a budget of £ 8.00 and making someone fall off the ladder with a Casio keyboard (the soundtrack) - then put it on the shelves for some poor guy (me) to take home alone despair. But here is the decisive argument - I made the most of it quickly, and threw it aside, ready for the hammers ... until the following night, while watching a Hellbreed Valentine's Day horror (£ 1.99 to take home and avoid a different Blockbuster). Now that movie made Grim Weekend look like The Exorcist, so I slapped Grim Weekend to recapture some of the moments listed on the wonderful IMDb lists that viewers claimed to be hilarious. Sure enough, once I got over the misery, the pain and the horror, realizing that Grim Weekend was a great toast, I could enjoy it, savor it, and just dig into the fun stuff. And there is a lot of it. Check the boards. Then check the movement. Hell, it might even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
