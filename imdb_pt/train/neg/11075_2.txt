There was once a science fiction author named H. Beam Piper, who wrote a classic book called "Little Fuzzy," about a man discovering a race of small fuzzy humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's authors began to plunder his grave before his corpse became cold. This is the book from where they got the idea for the Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Nightingale is a cheeky imitation of "Little Fuzzy" I can imagine why I'm the only one that has ever been noticed? <br /> But do not take my word for it. Here is a link to Project Guntenberg, where you can download a free copy of "Little Fuzzy": http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
