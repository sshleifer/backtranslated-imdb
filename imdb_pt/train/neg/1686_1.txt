Imagine being asked what the movie you want to see and remember to see a rather intriguing trailer about "The Grudge". So, in good faith, you recommend watching this movie. It's the time of Halloween, after all. And it did boffo box office last weekend, so it must be pretty good ... then you will. <br /> <br /> And you're really in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it happens, and you hear yourself audibly saying, "this may not be the end of the movie ..." But unfortunately, is. <br /> <br /> And imagine leaving the movies with shame and embarrassment to recommend a dog like that. You think your date thinks you're an idiot for suggesting such atrocity, and your suggestion will surely end a promising relationship. In fact, it was so bad that we both laughed at how bad it was. I see no future for Miss. Gellar in the movies and I suggest that she devotes herself to television in the future. In fact, it will not be long before she gets the flea market conventions that sell Buffy's souvenirs, and that can not happen soon enough if you ask me. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The plot made no sense; the continuity was terrible. Clearly the whole ending was planned to have a "Rancor II - The Return of the 'Cat-Boy'."
