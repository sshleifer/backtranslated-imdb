I watched 'Envy' two nights ago, on DVD, at a friends house. The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with great potential but he can not deliver completely. I watched with about five friends and no one laughed at the whole movie. Jokes (which are few and far between) are NOT funny at all ... the story sucks, and they never answer the question ... WHERE IS THE SH * T GO? Of course the answer to this is no one cares. This movie does not have any kind of comedy value and, as some other reviewers have said, the only thing that makes it almost worth noting is Christopher Walken as J-man. None of the characters are developed, the plots so thin they are almost transparent - and this music throughout the movie should be funny?
