This movie is bad news and I'm really surprised at the big name level that I would never agree to show up in a crap like that. I suppose there were some strangled agents on Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this fiasco. What really leaves you is that it could have been good. The directors star the appeal and the subject was enough reason to arouse interest and ticket sales, but that is a failure. The various lines of the story go from bad to silly to the end of the photos, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that seems rotted. What Spike is able to achieve is to take revenge on any Italian who might have beaten him when he was a child or insulted, since the film does a good deal of perpetuating stereotypes outdated and probably offensive. As with any Spike Lee movie, there are some really provocative and magical works. He has the gift of grabbing his psyche and transporting him to his sight only for some memorable scenes. But the question remains ... you can endure the other two hours of scratching your head and watching clock as you ask yourself and wait for the end that has to be there somewhere.
