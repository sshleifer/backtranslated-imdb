Hmmm ... where to start? How did a serious actress like Demi Moore get involved in such crap? "First blood" can be classified as bull *** but this kind of nonsense is just Rambo with tits, period. Of course if you're interested in crap (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be a part of MARINE SEALS), which is the stupid clich√© I can think of, you'll say "GI Jane" is a great movie. Only the performance of Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable, but hell, I can not think of Demi Moore being Rambo (especially not during the latter, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve the credits to make this movie one that appeals to women with equal rights, it's just a brainless advertisement for the American army and to make it more appealing, they've tossed Moore into it. Horrible movie.
