STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Missing the Mark *** That Little Among ** Delayed from behind * The Wells <br /> <br /> Some plutonium has disappeared and some very unpleasant people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of mass destruction - then Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his young and promised Deke (Judson Mills, a different actor from the previous film) with the help of Josh's adopted daughter, Que (Jennifer Tung) He left to stop them. <br /> <br /> This was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 11 September. Filmed in 2001, Norris himself even later commented on how the plot of the movie resembled what happened in central New York that day, so there would have been those who would have been in the mood for a film in which Norris and his kicking side kick some terrorist butt if nothing else. Other than that, it's as interchangeable as anything Norris has ever been. Makes you wonder what the original did to ensure a sequel first, and if this could be done a President's 3 Man could leave soon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a Norris movie, you've really seen them all and there's nothing new or unexpected happening to this, but at least you know what you're getting and, as I said, I could have been just what some needed to release some steam. **
