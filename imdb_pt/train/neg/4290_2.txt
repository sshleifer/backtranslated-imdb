I'm going to give this movie two stars because it is filled with beautiful photographs. Otherwise, this clings mainly to clich√©s and stereotypes: the mountaineers are white idiot garbage of the fanatically religious or racist type, or wise white Indians. The Indians are magical people who move without sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals and read minds from great distances. And so on. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, I wondered what the purpose of the film was (besides showing me beautiful pictures of mountains, huts, woods, a variety of animals, spirited mountain dwellers and weird people in the church ). <br /> <br /> The plot touched a number of issues, but did not explore any of them in depth. This was not a story about growing up during the depression, nor about being an orphan, nor about a fight for identity. He tried to be all this and more, which made him superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the movie should be about Little Tree's education, we learned almost nothing about it. He received a brief summary of the history of his people (who was brave and stoic) and a demonstration of distillery; tried his hand cutting wood (at which he failed) and whiskey running (literally); I learned to read (and maybe to write) with the help of Grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. Apparently, he did not learn much during his internship period because he was locked in the attic. <br /> <br /> However, Grandma and Graham Greene's character ensured that in the end Little Tree became a very spiritual person whose main purpose as an adult - after, and I'm paraphrasing here, "walk with the Navajos "and" getting caught up in a couple of wars "- was" catching up "with Grandma and Grandpa and Graham Greene's character in the sky (instead of, say, going out with girls, getting married, having kids or other nonsense). <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I must say that I found Grandpa's commercial offensive. Why does everything have to be a whiskey yet? To counter the stereotype of the "drunk Indian"?
