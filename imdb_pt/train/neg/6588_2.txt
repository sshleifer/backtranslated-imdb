Following are some of the strident problems with this film: 1) Clich√©s abound. Seriously, terrible "twists" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative jumps in time, which would be good if well done, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Lame characters that do not develop as much as or remain completely static, or change drastically without good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) A great: ADDING HORRIBLE. Above all, of almost all people. <br /> <br /> The following are some of the best points in the movie: 1) The leadership is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> In my view, there are only two types of people who would participate in this movie: a) People who can sit for 90 minutes of guts simply because the leadership is attractive. b) People who often think to themselves, "I like Hollywood full of cliches and exaggerations, but if I could watch in Korean ..." There's a lot of Korean cinema out there, so why waste it? your time with junk?
