Man, this was hilarious. Must be in COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have made her realize that a pile of stinking was much easier. Seriously? I want anyone associated with this movie to take effect immediately. For all who are thinking of watching this "movie", let's go through some points of the plot. Oh wait. There is none. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored, and he decided to film something with some random people, and miraculously somehow got into videotape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Do not believe me? Go watch. Do it, man. Dare. But be prepared to tear out your eyes. If you can sit without blowing a cow, you are very strong and brave.
