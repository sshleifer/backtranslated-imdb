I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First of all, I want to say that the story behind this film and the creation of the Amber alert system is good. However, the film itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible. The big problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Nichole Timmons and his father Glenn Park. The events surrounding this part of the story were not entirely correct. My father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and took Nichole without any intention of harming her. He loved her as a daughter and was under the mentality that he was rescuing her from some sort of injury or neglect that he probably believed was coming from his mother who paid him little attention in the 3 years since my father cared for her. and summarily lifted her up so that her mother could play. The movie showed my father in a way that he would harm her in some way or form. The funny thing was that Nichole had spent many nights, sometimes consecutively, at my father's house while Sharon worked or did what he was doing. The reason why my dad was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be used as weapons in his truck. My father was a landscape artist. The items they considered guns were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time to work. My recommendation is to take this film with a grain of salt, it's a good story and based on true events however the details of the film (at least part of Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park) are largely inaccurate and portray the director's failure discover the truth in telling the story. The funny thing is that if the director had interviewed any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, they would have stated exactly what I posted here.
