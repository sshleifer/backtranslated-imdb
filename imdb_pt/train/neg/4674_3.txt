I do not know who's to blame, Miss Leigh or her director, but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to watch. Ben Chaplin, on the other hand, does a superior job - against all odds as far as I'm concerned. Your character is very charming and attractive. but he certainly was not greedy enough to tolerate the foolishness of Leigh's character. Chaplin seems confused by what can not be understood as Leigh's timidity and lack of grace, but rather his orthopedic instability. There has to be some element of credibility for your interest, but as played is incomprehensible. The performances do not spin. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, wonderful despite any effort to stop them. The support cast is also a pleasure to watch. Too bad, too, the leads do not work together because production is lovely to see.
