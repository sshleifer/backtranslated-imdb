Hi, everyone, if you saw "Singing in the Rain", you remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. You also remember Donald O'Connor's dance number, "Make It A Laugh." If you've seen "Royal Wedding", you'll remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you've seen "Jailhouse Rock", you'll even remember the title dance number choreographed by King himself. <br /> <br /> That's what's missing here. There could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. The closest was "I Can Do That" by Chuck McGowan. The simple fact that you have some talented people on the stage moving together does not make a great dance movie. Richard Attenborough was guilty of this failure. He pointed the camera at the stage and thought it would be a good thing. Crying with people who participate in an audition for a play in a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be so badly fused if he were in a Western or a comedy. He's fine when he's in a Michael Douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we'd like to scream. It does not work here. <br /> <br /> The cast was good except for Michael, of course. A good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the production stage, but someone should have thought about how to film it. <br /> <br /> Next time you do one of these, I hope you call me first. . <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
