I can say without a doubt that Going Overboard is the worst movie I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination like Schecky Moskowitz, an aspiring comedian working on a cruise ship. That's the plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else in the movie makes sense, it's everywhere like a crazy man's breakfast, and not in a weird, but more frustrating way, "play the two sneakers the way you do." even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason that I can understand (certainly not for humor). Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian accent I ever hear, and you have something I will not call the worst movie ever made, because Going to the sea does not even fit the basic definition of a movie. I highly recommend watching this movie as it will elevate the position of every bad movie you have ever seen. I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad movie will be "at least it was not as bad as going to sea".
