This is by far the worst movie I have ever watched. I've seen some really horrible movies in my time, but this one takes the cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn bakery. It is so bad that I believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has not yet been created. Please do yourself a favor, if you have the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur barney, then multiply that thirty times and you will still have only a small fraction of the horror you would be saving for . In short, I think you can actually call it horror movie, but only if you are willing to be afraid of meaninglessness for the worst acting in the business and a totally meaningless story. Real Rating, -10 Repugnant
