I wonder who, how and more importantly why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most unique sensation of reaching Broadway in many years? He is an Oscar-winning director. Yes, he won by Gandhi you idiot! Jeremy Irons is an Academy Award-winning actor, do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Same? "Oh what a kind war" did you forget? To answer your question, yes! The film is a deception, clear and simple. Not one ounce of living energy survived the heavy hand of the process. Each character danced beautifully, they were charming, but their projection was theatrical. I did not feel anything. But when I saw it on the stage I felt everything. The film should have been released with stars, strangers, newcomers, but stars with unforgettable faces, even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who could dance beautifully. Well, Michael Douglas was on it. It is true that I have forgotten that I am absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like a musical by Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas.
