Rumor has it that when NASA technical advisors for this film were invited to keep the image believable, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you are a politician or a crew member, you will not get on the shuttle. In addition, the Space Camp (Cadet) is in Alabama, not in Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on Earth will win billionaire lottery prizes before the events depicted in this movie become possible. This film was made for children, and had to have been written by one because they are not aware of the numerous restrictions and requirements regarding access to the KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless movie of all time, and it was a well deserved failure.
