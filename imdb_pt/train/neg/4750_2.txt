I would give it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was really, really disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were very short and brief, hence the moral was not clearly presented. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have a hard time dealing with her role. I could see the need to put Western elements in the show, however, there are certain parts where the Chinese elements were also needed! The villain, for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot rather than something outside Chinese culture. The last and the worst failure were the incorrect and distorted facts put into the program. <br /> <br /> Others may point out that this is a 'children's show' and therefore there is no need for so much standards. However, there are other Disney programs, such as Mu Lan, which were much better in terms of developing and presenting stories. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think Disney films should be better researched and better planned. A good show is not enough with just a number of martial arts moves to depend on.
