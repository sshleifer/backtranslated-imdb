Robin Williams performed well on The Night Listener, as did the other cast members. However, the film seems rushed and leaves many loose ends to be considered a "must see". I think the problem happens because there is not a strong enough relationship established between the speaker and Gabriel Noon (I had to spell that way because IMDb wants to automatically correct the correct spelling for "Nobody"). The movie spends just over 1:30 and in the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, Noon begins his quest for Pete Logande, the boy who called. <br /> <br /> This happens after he talks to the mysterious interlocutor about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not very deep, consisting mostly of how you are ... I'm in the hospital ... why your boyfriend moved ... etc. In the book, the boy almost becomes Noon's shrink and vice. versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy once he discovers that the boy disappears and thinks he may be a farce. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Noon becomes obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is left wondering why? Since there really is not a strong enough bond established between noon and the interlocutor, why bother? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know there's a difference between a book and a movie, but those links and that relationship were essential to establish on the screen because they provide the basis for the rest of the movie. As this does not happen, the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> This is surprising because of Maupin's other work, Tales of the City. When it was made into a mini-series, it worked beautifully.
