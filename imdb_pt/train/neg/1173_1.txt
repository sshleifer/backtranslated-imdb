If I had just one camera that was accidentally stuck on the floor, enough film for just one outlet from each outlet, and then I lost the entire film and had to get some change to buy some digital video tapes, and I was forced to make a movie of more than 2 hours on the French Revolution, and also had no scenery and had to make my autistic son of 4 years paint the funds, and also the only actors I met were people who did not. I auditioned for that year's soap opera, and I was also forced to not use any music throughout the movie, and also the camera's zoom function did not work except for once when she accidentally started zooming in and failed . Stop it, oh, and if I hated my audience, then I could do something like this horrible, though mistakenly hilarious, a waste of time worthy of Hell. The almost grandiose, but completely false scenario reminded me of some of George Lucas's latest creations, which made it much more disappointing because throughout the film there was a glimmer of hope deep in my mind that the movie would be climax in a saber duel / space laser battle. I do not want to ruin the movie for those who have not seen it yet, but that's not the way it ends. The only thing I can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review. Peace.
