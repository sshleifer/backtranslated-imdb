If Fassbinder made a worse film, I sure do not want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are very timid and claustrophobic should be forced to see this, to learn to appreciate the freer style he has opted for in such excellent films as "The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant." This film clings to so many artistic and almost symbolic images that it looks like a parody of an "art film". The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where Elvira's prostitute friend sails for ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a veritable test of the spectator's resistance. But what really pisses me off are the few scenes that feature only Elvira and her ex-wife and / or daughter. These are the only moments that show any real human emotion, and prove that at the heart of this horrible movie, there was an excellent movie struggling to break free. What a waste.
