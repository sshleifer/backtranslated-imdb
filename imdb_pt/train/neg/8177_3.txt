90 minutes of Mindy ... Mindy is a provocation for her boyfriend Bill ... Mindy dances at high school prom ... Mindy asks for ride to Big Sur, buys a piece of "shepherd's bread," Mindy is almost raped by gangs . Oh, the pleasures of the drive-in features at Crown International. You should remember that these movies were never designed to be watched from start to finish on DVD players. They were done like 90 minutes of ambiance so that the teens of the 70s had a soundtrack as they got into their chicks and quotes. The lack of pace and structure did not matter to the original audience - they probably only tuned in when the T & A on the screen matched what they were doing in the parking lot. The movie is really annoying when watched as a story. It is much more fun to talk about it than to watch. My favorite inanities: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. No luggage or underwear exchange, they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher, just like in real life. 2) After being kidnapped and nearly raped by depraved motorcyclists, and after her innocent friend "Pan" is brutally beaten, Mindy and his girlfriend find a motorcycle unattended on the road. Mindy immediately cheers up and sings, "I'm going to Big Sur!" But again, it's a lot more fun to talk / read about than to sit.
