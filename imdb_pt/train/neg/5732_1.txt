I'm all for a "bad" horror movie, but this was just a pile of dog sh! T! How anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me. If you like rush editing to cover the special effects, bad acting and a bad script, then go ahead! There was no suspense and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake. I'm taking Hostel or Wolf Creek by that pile at any time. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she met a stinky one when she saw one. I, on the other hand, was stupidly sitting all through the movie just to wait and see if it got any better. No such luck! I have not seen your other movie, Torched and I doubt it will bother me now.
