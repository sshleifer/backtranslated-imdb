Dear God! I waited for this movie to "start" ... so I expected him to redeem himself ... and when that did not happen, I just sat there, stunned that: 1) it could be so bad, and 2 that I had just finished waste a few hours in sheer stupidity. I had faith that Drew could not have made this movie bad ... and boy, I lost my faith! Do not bother with this one! Drew tried, but the movie was poorly written, misrepresented and ill-conceived! I can not believe that such a bad script has been funded! There was a million chances to really do something with the idea (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to even qualify!) And yet it has not gone anywhere! It's just unfortunate! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it was not the worst, confuses me! Because believe me, if it got worse I would have cut my wrists before I finished it!
