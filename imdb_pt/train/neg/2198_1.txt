A scientist and his girlfriend are out driving when their speeding causes a car accident. He escapes unharmed, but she is beheaded. He saves her head, brings him to his house and keeps her alive (!!!!). He then starts looking for models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. Your crippled assistant watches the head begin to speak and has a telepathic (or telepathic) link to a deformed monster guarded in the closet ... As you can see, this is a very stupid thing, but I had a certain amount of love for it. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local TV station showed this movie about 20 times a year (no exaggeration). They always showed this on Saturday afternoon on TV - no cuts. Seeing this on TV back then was great! Explicit blood and gore along with a horrible monster and sleazy sexploitation - who cares if it was good? Seeing this now I realize how bad this really is. <br /> <br /> The acting is totally unhappy, the production values ​​are nonexistent, the script is pretty dumb and (besides the blood still disgusting) this is silly. . There is also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly big monster at the end. Also add a finish that leaves tons of loose ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of a 60's exploration film. On the other hand, its total garbage. Anyway, it's not a good movie, but it's a must-see (for once only) for horror and gore fans. <br /> <br /> Also the laughter of the head is very frightening. Note the final credits that leave TITLE wrong (calling it "THE HEAD THAT WOULD NOT DIE!")!
