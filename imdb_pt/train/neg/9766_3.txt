Roger Corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was solely responsible for some of my favorite horror movies (such as Edgar Allen Poe's "Masque of the Red Death" and "Pit and the Pendulum" adaptations) as well as some cheap and sticky cockroaches (such as "Creature" "The Trip", for example, and also "Gas" ("The Shark Reef") and "The Shark Reef" -ss ", with the imaginative title, can be labeled as psychedelic exploration.In other words, they are incredibly strange films influenced by hippie culture.Middle of time you have no idea what is going on, who are these characters that walk of The plot is simple and highly effective: a strange but deadly nervous gas is accidentally released and promptly annihilates the entire world population with more than of 25. That * could * be the basic premise of an atmospheric, sandy, clenched-nosed suspense. Post-apocalyptic science fiction landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman have decided to turn it into an "amazing" road movie comedy. None of the characters are trying to prevent their inevitable future deaths; they just have fun on the streets and find small juvenile crime syndicates. "Gas-s-s" is a disappointingly annoying and tries too hard to be bizarre. The whole script seems improvised on the spot and not funny at all. It's definitely not my cup of tea, but the film has a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who am I to say it's not worth your time or money?
