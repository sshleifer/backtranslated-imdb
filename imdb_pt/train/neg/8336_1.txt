How the hell did they get that? Featuring as a caper comedy, the misplaced "$" is essentially two hours of people mumbling snippets of phrases. The generally trustworthy Warren Beatty looks drunk, and the generally hilarious Goldie Hawn acts as if he were in depressives. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Not even the guy with the LSD champagne bottle can save this litany of uselessness. <br /> <br /> I'm comparing this movie with "Plan 9 from Outer Space"? I would not do such a thing even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was done stupidly, but ended up hilarious; this was stupidly done and makes you feel as if your brain has just melted your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for it when they co-starred in "Shampoo," but then they co-starred in the appalling "Town & Country." Maybe they should not co-star in movies. All in all, I would rather have my skin ripped off than having to watch it again. Horrible. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should remake it with Jackie Chan. So I would pay to see this.
