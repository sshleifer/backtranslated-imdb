Checking the spoiler alert just in case. <br /> <br /> Maybe one of the most horrendous movies I've ever seen, Labyrinths and Monsters felt that I lost 101 minutes of my life. The only redeeming quality of the film were scenes that tried to be serious, but they turned out to be funny, since they were so bad. Badly dead, anyone? Unfortunately for M & M (fortunately for us) it did not develop a cult and resulted in a trilogy. This movie tried to solve a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) found throughout the film. It turned out to be a video of fear about stereotypes that helped feed D & D like the Devil movement in the 80s. <br /> <br /> If you want to avoid wasting time and money, avoid such junk. PS - Even if the cover seems a little interesting, which is why I think my brother bought it, it does not happen in a fantasy realm unless you consider New England or New York as a place like this.
