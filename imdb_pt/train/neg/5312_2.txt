Typically awful garbage from director Fred Olen Ray about a female cyborg hunter (Teagan) commissioned by Guardian Jan-Michael Vincent to find and execute fugitive alien Ross Hagen, who has traced the course of Earth. Soon, the Forest Ranger, John Phillip Law, will have to protect a group of college boys filled with obnoxiously headed by grater Richard Wiley who ran over Hagen with his trailer on a camping trip that went wrong. Soon the cyborg will explode with his arm burning an innocent alcoholic doctor (Robert Quarry of the fame of Count Yorga-Vampiro) proving that nobody will be in his way to recover the skin of the convict, whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body. Law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, a former Vietnam War veteran with too many guns hidden in his hut. <br /> <br /> Perhaps intentionally done horrible, this characterizes what fans of the "rancid cinema" desire. effects, performance and premise. At least the movie has PJ Soles for some eye drops ... even in 1989, she was smoking. That laser gun is certainly funny ... you can incinerate some houses even when the Cyborg shoots at Law barely leaves a mark on the fired spot.
