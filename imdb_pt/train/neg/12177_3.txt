Since the 1970s, writer / producer / director Charles Band is responsible for literally hundreds of B movies of science fiction, fantasy and horror. Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget for maximum effect; many of them are very bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems. A tale of Time Travel and Terminator-style action, Trancers saw Tim Thomerson playing Jack Deth, a future police officer in charge of tracking the evil Whistler, who travels into the past inhabiting the body of an ancestor. Whistler is able to control other humans with their psychic powers, turning them into obedient zombies (the title trancers), and attempts to alter the course of history by killing the ancestors of the leaders of the future. Jack followed him until 1985, determined to stop him. <br /> <br /> In this sequence of 1991, Jack still lives in 1985. Having destroyed Whistler, he settled down and married Leena (Helen Hunt), the young woman. which helped him succeed in the first film. But for Jack, things do not stay calm for long, and the problem comes in the form of Whistler's brother, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build a trance army. <br /> <br /> Trancers II does not have the charm and simplicity of the original and is a big disappointment, considering how good the original was. The story is difficult to understand if you have not seen the first movie (or at least not for long), and there is a lot of deadpan action and some bad special effects. It was the inventiveness and intelligence that made the Trancers so fun; instead, we took some phrases of effect and a script that seems to have been written immediately. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can give to recommend this movie to fans of the genre is the cast. , which has many names that will be familiar to followers of science fiction and horror films: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to be having a day off during the filming of Trancers II, and performances are mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series obviously has its fans; four more sequences have been produced since then. Unless quality has assumed a huge upward movement, I can not imagine them to be good.
