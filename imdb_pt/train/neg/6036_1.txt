Starring an unknown cast that seems to continue like this, this "movie" is yet another horror film that surprises me as it was released. I have no problem with horrors and slasher flicks in particular, actually they are my favorites. But when they finish THIS BAD, he really takes the monkey and it's no wonder the genre has such a hard time. The story is as clich√©d and unimaginative as possible with a lot of people in a hut in the woods being hacked and hacked by this zombie / ghost face. It's not the story that sucks the most, it's the atrocious and dialouge performance, quality of homely direction and a terrible soundtrack. Not to mention the laughable effects and some incredibly lazy movies - these idiots are outside in broad daylight, but are we supposed to believe it's nighttime? What the hell was the director thinking about this move? What, he had only one day to film all this? Was he afraid of the dark? (It's hilarious to see a policeman walking in broad daylight with a torch acting as if it were pitch black, though) <br /> <br /> I think the upside to the actors is that they look like people who they work at the local supermarket so at least they could get away from this movie without being noticed. I'm sure one of the "teens" plays bingo at the local pub - but she's between 40 and 45. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's good to laugh, but it's just another waste of film and time.
