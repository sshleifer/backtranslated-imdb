Despite being a 2001 film, direction is the type of 90s art style that was considered "old" and out of fashion a few years ago. The extravagant cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is decent enough, and some scenes kind of captivated me (like when the taxi driver takes her to the bridge at night). But the story with the detective that his sister killed himself and how obsessed he was with suicide was just terrible. The performance of the actor who plays Selma Blair's boyfriend bothered me seriously. I've sat through the whole thing, which is rare for the kind of random movie you just found on TV and decides to watch.
