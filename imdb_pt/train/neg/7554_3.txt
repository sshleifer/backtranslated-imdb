I have never seen the oldest and most highly rated version of 1973. I am a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, well acting as usual). This movie probably took five minutes to complete the plot (I can see this being done on a dinner napkin), if you can not figure out the end of this baba in the first thirty minutes, you probably find this movie fun. This is, lately, the terrible plot that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror / mystery / suspense genre, unable to give enough credit to the audience and write a new, clever and tempting script, they sing some scary music and play some things to make you jump a little and then send the final impression to your local theater. At least he did not have the hand-held camera shaking.
