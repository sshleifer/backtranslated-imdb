This is the worst sequel in the movie world. Again it has not since. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he's killing people who are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means it's the dumbest movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it. If you value the only precious hour during this movie, then do not watch it. You will want to ask the director and the person next to you what made you do it. Because it simply does not match the original marks of horror, action and crime. <br /> <br /> Do not let your children watch this. Teen, toddler or young adult, this movie has that kind of impact on people.
