Well, what can you say about an adaptation of Barbara Cartland? <br /> <br /> There are some incredible actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles and Christopher Plummer), but they are clearly betting money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks aptly embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see an "adaptation" of Cartland, Bonham Carter is the only one to go to ("A Hazard of Hearts" - that title !!). , but Bonham Carter is suitably handsome and of course can really act, and the rest of the cast plays the language fist firmly on the cheek (Edward Fox and Diana Rigg).
