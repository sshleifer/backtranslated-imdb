This movie is a rewrite of Warren Beatty's 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait," but was written for Mr. Rock's stand-up comedy style. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken away before his lifetime ends and makes a deal with God's representative, Mr. King, to return to Earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he likes Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who shows up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea of ​​turning an old white multimillionaire into a black comedian trying to conquer Sontee simply does not work. Also the intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the actual 'white' Wellington fail miserably. Improvements could have been made in Beatty's original plot - which in itself did not masterfully portray the idea of ​​life after death - but certainly not found in "Down To Earth."
