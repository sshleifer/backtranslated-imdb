... except for Jon Heder. This guy tanked the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed fun. A lazy 29-year-old son (Heder) still lives with his widowed mother (Keaton) who happens to find a new love (Daniels). Slacker's son is jealous and eager to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but whoever chose Hader would be better off selling hot dogs on the beach. Heders performance is annoying, which would be a good thing, since he plays a boring guy, the problem is that he is a bad actor to lose this act making this guy nice in the end. In the end, you still want to be able to personally punch the guy in the face and you are upset with the end. In the future, every movie with this guy will be a no go for me!
