I was eager to see this movie for a long time, after seeing "Return to Paradise", which I thought was bleak. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about this was the unpredictable ending that I think was partially stolen from "Return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> Maybe I was expecting a lot. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I did not like the character of Danes and first and found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything realistic about the movie. It could have been made much better, for example, there could be more emphasis on prison conditions and pure horror. It was a very exciting film to be realistic. There could also have been more action and tension. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the "tragic" ending. I could not predict that. But at that time I did not really care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
