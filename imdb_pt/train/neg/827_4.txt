Saddles in flames! It is a struggle between two distant brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), who can fire bonfires mentally; They dodge the differences of childhood, with the divine Debra Winger, in love with love, caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the television boy behind "Moonlighting") suffocates the dark-textured comedy in Vince Gilligan's screenplay with such a clever presentation that the film resembles an entry of a film student overjoyed with a donation of 15 million dollars. It has the thorny energy of a great commercial feature, but a misshapen style that takes nothing away from the characters except their eccentric eccentricities. These are neither characters, they are plot functions. Little publicized in theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over substance, looks good. Winger is the only highlight in a cast that seems truly baffled. * 1/2 of ****
