I had been submitted to this movie for a relationship class at my school. As I realized, it was nothing catchy and nothing new. Although he tries to be original, focusing on the teenage father rather than the mother, showing the problems that the father would pass. It had an interesting side, but it simply did not match its originality, due to the fact that nothing else in this movie was original. We have the main character who has the big sister who likes in all the other movies as this has one thing against him we have to stay at home mom who waits too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust, so we have the father who is always gone. So on the girls side we have parents who want everything and expect it to be perfect in everything it does. For the story as I said, it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the whole cast and the lack of any good writing or story telling. Everything about this fell on the clich√© the nerd boy at school starts to study with the girl, they get together, have sex and then boom, we have a child. Perhaps it could have been better if the writing had been much better and the acting had been improved. I really took more excitement out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than any actor in this movie and that's pretty bad, since the Leatherface movies are crap and acted horribly. So far, the only interesting teen pregnancy movie I've seen was Juno. So far, the comic side of this grave situation has been more fun while still giving the same message. As I said the idea was unique most of these films focus on the teenage mother but this chose not to focus on the father's drama but again the originality does not save this mediocrity movie. I really hope someone decides to redo this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar movie because this was a potential wasted.
