WOW is all I can say, whether your reading is assisted or thinking about it. Trust me, watch! <br /> <br /> I laughed so much in so many parts of this movie that the worst performance ever made is very funny! I can not believe they overcame the school sign! I must have played that scene again and again just to laugh more and more each time. If such a film can be made, it gives us hope to make our own films. even the costume was bad. It seemed that my 7-year-old cousin could have done a better job in doing so. I bet he could have written and acted better too. All I know is that I have to watch the second part just so I can see if it was as bad as the first one. is a cool idea about a terrifying killer, but a much better job could have been done. I hope another shocking killer movie comes out, just not like this one.
