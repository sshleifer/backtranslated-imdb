Ok, first the good: Cher's performance and cinematography. Although I'm not a fan of Cher, she gives excellent performance and her part was well written. The cinematography was well made and captures a sense of romance. <br /> <br /> The rest: a fine plot, Nicholas Cage's performance, and a totally non-humorous and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York. First of all, every time Cage opened his mouth I cringed. I do not know what kind of accent he was trying to use. I honestly did not, it sure was not any New York or Italian accent I've ever heard. It was pretty surreal. And it was not because I'm a precision advocate, his voice just sick in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other presentations. Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York, and frankly I have more laughter and felt happier in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family, far from what this movie offered. And that would be a boring night in the house. What a disappointment.
