I thought maybe a movie that featured a cast including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews might be worth watching. I was wrong. Absolute pretentious absurd from start to finish with O'Toole and York exaggerating wildly. I watched it twice and still have no idea what it was. I have the feeling that O'Toole plays the Laird from a Scottish castle who has trouble drinking and enjoys reviving childhood games with his sister (York). He's also barking crazy. But besides, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The movie has no redeeming features. I can only assume that the cast and director were blackmailed to make this pompous and bland. Clearly a waste of time from a talented cast and director. Laughable.
