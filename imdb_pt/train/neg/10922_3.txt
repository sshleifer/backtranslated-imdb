Worse than the rating that was given. This is a typical science fiction movie nowadays: barely a horrible performance, a poorly written script and a poor quality direction. From the opening scene where DeMille is burying his set to the end, this movie is terrible. In the early scenes, this film has Moses (who was Charlton Heston in the movie DeMille), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor), overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand. The characters that should represent the three icons mentioned above were terrible and had to look like the people they were supposed to be. The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is injured and everyone is screaming for an ambulance. The screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a low quality movie.
