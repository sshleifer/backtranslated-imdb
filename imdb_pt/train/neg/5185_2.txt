A complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The script and dialogues are poorly written, the direction is dull and the boundaries of acting in the hammy. This film was clearly pointing to the audience of Rang De Basanti, but is far behind the mark because it does not even have one of the elements that made The RDB connects with your great audience script, great acting, good direction and a powerful social message that was never preached but shown. <br /> <br /> Compared to this masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step back resorting to such scenes as the hero taking a leak in the villain's Persian rug and mentor the hero looking for bullets in a truck no less! All of this may have been acceptable in the 1980s when there was a drop in movie quality and bad films like Divya Shakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits, but filmmaking has become more subtle and caring lately. Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I thank him that he wants to give a social message in all the films that he does, but maybe he just does not know how to do it! He resorts to sermons without worrying about the intelligence of the public in understanding what he is trying to say. Maybe he should focus only on entertainment and leave the social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with everything I say, you will agree that during the show you will be thinking that Rang De Basanti was much better and Mr.Santoshi should have left the industry to Om Shanti Om. Attacking the industry? Santoshi described the industry as a spot of hitters, putaria and the cast sofa that the hero happily indulges in with a star curiously named Sania. There are some people who think these parts show the true face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> In all, raise your voice against movies like this and do not waste your hard-earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * out of ****.
