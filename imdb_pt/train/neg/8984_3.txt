If you've ever wanted to see a film that emphasizes style over substance, this is for you. For me, Son of the Sea is beautiful to SEE, but there is little precious substance, unless the sly, melodramatic and manipulative love strands leave you aroused. This may be one of those famous 'girl movies' that you've heard a lot about. <br /> <br /> We are in the middle of the movie before something happens: Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes out to sea looking for tuna and does not return, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling). ) and son to take care of themselves. Then, in furious six minutes of screen, they bury Ulysses, Martina marries again and its son grows until the middle of the childhood. This rapid transposition is shocking, to say the least, and very sloppy: after 40 minutes or so prowling, we are suddenly in a complete melodrama, all in six minutes. I think this is called disobedient narrative. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulysses (as in the wandering superhero Ulysses, do you understand?), returns to his 'Penelope' (Watling) only to discover that she is married to Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), a inexplicably rich guy (what does he do to gain all that mass?) that inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets. When Martina, with great anger, questions Ulises about her absence, he tells her that he will take her to the island of Sumatra someday and she will understand everything. <br /> <br /> And here's the thing: it CAN NOT Take it to the island of Sumatra. The reference simply dies somewhere in the script. He did not really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and son for five years. He does NOT absolve himself as an honorable guy, and the movie does NOT fill the holes that are staring at us for at least half of the movie. I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to fill the story lines with the mystical clues (fish, reptiles, sea) he offers through breathtaking cinematography and elusive dialogue. It just does not work. The narrative 'bow' in this film ends up looking more like a faltering clothesline. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I just could not buy Ulises from him as any kind of hero. (which is what the original Ulysses should be). With moist sensuality, he releases a short stanza of Virgil's identical poetry, about 2,000 times, and every time it excites Martina to an explosive orgasm. This guy should be rented to invigorate old weddings. I'm sure Virgil would be impressed. He does not fuck as often as I understand him. <br /> <br /> This poetic 'device' appears prominently in the film, and I had no choice but to assume that it was a genre inversion of Ulysses's famous 'mermaid song' (ie, beautiful maidens singing seductively away sailors, who were doomed if they answered the siren call). If that's what Bigas Luna is doing, you can see the problem - he's offering tricky symbolism in an attempt to grab and grab the High Art. Again, it just does not work, at least in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Watling is a handsome and magnetic young actor, but she gives us a character here who does not seem to have much intelligence or intellect. even romantic depth. It's beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who bears a sign of rent on her face (like in the void), oily 60s hair that looks more like seaweed, and one of those 21st century fashion beards. '(you know, four days of growth, not more, not less). He's supposed to be a face-type guy (I think), but those eyes of him suggest he may be suffering from overexposure to an absurd script. <br /> <br /> But, do not despair, this movie is great to see. Just do not try to connect the dots in the red herrings or think hard about what you are hearing in the way of the dialogue. You can lose the fast-forward in this movie (especially in the first 40 minutes) and you really will not lose much.
