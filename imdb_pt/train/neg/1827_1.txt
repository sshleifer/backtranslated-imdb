Envy stars some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, you can only hope for the best. However, with "Envy", no one could save this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and co-workers in a sandpaper mill. Both are having a decent life, but as Tim has a better performance at work, he is able to withstand more than his friend Nick. Nick is a dreamer who is always inventing new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with the idea of ​​a spray can that makes dog poop disappear (yes, I'm serious). Falling in love with the idea, Nick decides to actually invent this product. He makes an offer for Tim to invest in his idea and share 50/50 profits. Tim refuses to think that the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, titled "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious), ends up making millions. He likes to spend his money on things like a much bigger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and extravagant deserts. Tim begins to feel envious of Nick. Hence the name of the film. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it's still horrible. This movie contains some of the worst dialogues and very bad performances from the entire cast. Then again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. Not even the great Christoper Walken, playing a homeless character named "J-man", made this movie funny. The movie is bad from the beginning and it just keeps getting worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: • you like crap (no pun intended) • you want to see Jack Black in a white tuxedo <br /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie at all costs , but avoid ESPECIALLY if: * you are offended by the mood of the bathroom * you love animals
