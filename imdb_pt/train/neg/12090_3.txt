Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film through its intrigue, I certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the structure of the scene unfolded was asking too much for most viewers. Huge holes in the script, such as the one never explained "your father died today" mother's comment made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters. <br /> <br /> This won the first place in Cannes in 2001, which is a shock considering. Perhaps the French had gone hungry for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this movie. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when combined with the inability to relate to the main character went too far for me and kept me gun away from the story altogether. <br /> This is a movie only for the most dedicated fans of cinema noir and one that does not expect gratification for having watched a movie after it's over. I LOVED films like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which were much more disturbing, but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and rhythm. Watching this slow and painful scene of teachers, scene after scene, has become so redundant that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to like this movie every turn.
