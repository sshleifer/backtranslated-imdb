Expecting a combination of scifi and period film on Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc., I was disappointed by this absurd pseudoscience film and mix of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that his writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a real understanding of Mathematics, technology or history that is the subject of the film, but is working from a kind of diffuse artistic impression of them. This affects me a lot, since I have long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to gloss over and abuse scientific terms and ideas to the point of confusing, for example: Emmy Coer: "information waves have a half-life," Ada: "I'm not sure half a life is better than no life at all." <br /> <br /> This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it's uninformed. The only redeeming value I can imagine for this is that it can draw a viewer to learn about the subject that he distorts so badly. It is more likely, I think, to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement, indistinguishable from magic.
