This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen and possibly the worst overall movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed that they were trying very hard to interpret their roles as idiots, tough guys, idiots, they know everything, etc. And the big foot itself was terrible. It seemed to be some kind of computer-generated image from the days of Atari & Intellivision. At one point near the end of the movie, as an army of sasquatches was chasing the remaining survivors, one is shot and how he is running, it looked like a version of the ass's own poor ass! And one is hit by a bullet and the blood coming out of it is just awful animation. Another thing that was annoying was the music. Way way too much music (classic punctuation or whatever you call it) throughout the entire movie. It never ended. Oh yeah, the movie is boring too. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I recommend getting their $ 3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spend it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere. Really terrible!
