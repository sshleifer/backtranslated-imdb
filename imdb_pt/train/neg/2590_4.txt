American Pie was a long way from the first. At first I believe the actors have no idea what they are doing and instead it is just a remake of a crazed college party. The story goes like two college kids (featuring the young stifler) setting the dreams of attending college just to experience the night parties, sex and, of course, the drink. The plot is stupid and comes too far from the original pie. In fact, they no longer used an apple pie somewhere in the movie. Luckily, I work at a rental company and I can rent for free. But, please remember that it is a waste of time, unless you enjoy brainless sex movies with absolute nudity and insane drinking. I'm a teenager and I believe even Evan Almighty would have been a better choice.
