The original "les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 should be a candidate for "Worst first sequel to a really good movie". In LV2 everyone keeps screaming, when a joke does not work first, it's repeated 5 more times with some vague hope that it will turn out to be funny. LV2 is a horrible parody of LV1, except, of course, that a parody should be inventive. If you love LV1, do not watch this movie, just watch the LV1 again !!
