The 90s started having daytime talk shows sprouting left and right. All nets had one, and all of them did not have one thing Originality. Ricky Lake was just another sight to entertain the overweight mother of trailers with a Marlboro cigarette hanging in her mouth as she nursed one of her dozens of toothless, illiterate children. The English language and other cornerstones of humanity, where ruined by it, show existence. Titles ranging from Girl you to Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone want to watch this garbage pure and absolute? Did our society really become nothing more than a bunch of parents of hill bows and beats dead? The people who appear in this program were Garbage. The people who attended this show were Trash. Anyone who wants to see this program played or placed on DVD is the GARBAGE. People wonder why Americans are becoming too fat and too greasy to get jobs, and having shows like this tells them it's okay to be over 500 pounds and have 12-year-old girls behaving like prostitutes. Having this crap on TV ruined morale.
