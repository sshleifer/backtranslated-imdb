"Fred Claus" somehow avoids becoming "The Santa Clause" this year, at least for funnier times than Tim Allen, but that does not mean it was enough for that, it's worth a trip to the theater. <br /> <br /> As holiday films happen, they are artificial and sentimental. But in fact, this could be the least of Fred Claus's concerns, to boast of having David Dobkin ("The Wedding Crashers") on the steering wheel, contains practically a genuinely funny moment as he walks awkwardly. line between a rude Vince Vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy Christmas movie. In the end, this amounts to not much of either. And with a cast consisting of Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates, plus he leaves a disappointment. <br /> Vaughn plays Fred, Nick's older brother (Giamatti). Once upon a time, he left him and his parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after having had enough of supporting the favoritism of his parents of his younger brother. Nick grows up to be Santa (and, as the narration tells us, time freezes you and your family when you become a saint), while Fred becomes a sales rep in Chicago who is having a hard time reminding his girlfriend O Wanda's birthday (Weisz). <br /> <br /> He runs into trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother (who strangely seems at least a decade older than him) to get him out of jail. Nick agrees, but only if Fred agrees to help in the toy-wrapping business at the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees, but his cynicism runs counter to Santa and the perpetually merry nature of the elves, even as an efficiency expert (Spacey) checks the operations of the toy factory, but is happy to have all Arctic operations shut down if things fail. /> <br /> The film, as said, has its moments, but the padded racing length stretches them throughout its duration. Among them are stacks of Christmas movie cliches that have been treated better, say "Elf" and attempts at sentimentality are as catchy as last year's fruitcake. <br /> <br /> Vaugn, as always, brings his coarse charm. to the table, but Dan Fogelman's neutered calligraphy prevents him from REALLY doing his thing. Giamatti, underneath the fat jacket, brings an old charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately, it has to be Fred's second violin. Spacey brings his playing face, but his twists often end up unhappily insipid. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, "Fred Claus" becomes a forgettable movie that falls short of what those involved deserve. Of course, there are worse ways to start the season at the movies, but there are certainly much better ways.
