No matter what anyone says, there is a mere fact to the word "possession" in movie circles - like "what possessed you to give the film a green light?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense does. That is, if your mind is clear and you have the sound mind to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> On many levels, I tried to rationalize where this movie would entertain .... or even interest the average consumer. The star? The story? The unique idea? A movie of friends the kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman? In my goodness! I'm sure when that was an "idea", it looked good. But somewhere during the course of development ... someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment that someone would like to watch or pay for ... unless they were very deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and I saw something that the rest of us could not see. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is a complete mess. Mess, mess and mess. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (what plot?) Et al. Whoopie received a paycheck, but I'd be embarrassed to accept it. I hope she has fired her agent / manager / advertiser during this career change. Obviously not, she started making more bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
