I work as a concierge for a hotel in Washington DC and take my word for it, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox - # 1 we just do not walk around with our pockets full of theater tickets and $ 100! # 2 If I allow someone to use a room for some time of "afternoon pleasure", I would be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has well defined standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. # 3 Similarly false was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key badge and passing it to some other employee - we earned those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be able to use them. There is a whole process of applying and vetting to join our organization. <br /> <br /> This movie does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing more than a mercenary with no money. In short, it does a disservice to our organization. I welcome any comments.
