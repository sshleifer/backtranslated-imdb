Only glandular secretions - and please do not ask for more details - of young virgins can keep the body and mind in rapid decay of the mad wife of the old amateur horticulturist, fresh and young. Since, like most people, except those who participate in medical tests, virgins rarely give up their secretions willingly, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) causes them to be abducted and preserved. He will do the extraction himself. <br /> <br /> What a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror film. If The Corpse Disappears is not the Havarti of horror, as a simple limburg tree leaves an interesting flavor. <br /> <br /> Of course, the acting is almost terrible, except for the actors who were lucky enough to play the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his brutal crazed brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who moans a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the crazed mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the maddened wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin and of course the crazy doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> A young entrepreneurial reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters), looks for the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been used by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay the night, a violent storm erupts immediately. This clue tells us that some violent violence is about to enter. Since it is well known that in Hollywood at this time all single girls were virgins, Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crisp laboratory where an almost dead virgin is stored, a mausoleum in the basement, and later a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what story she will have to give to her publisher. <br /> <br /> If you taste this moist slice of moldy Velveeta (and why not? Do not be superior), do not judge Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here. He had a huge impact on Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie is The Black Cat (1934). Like Dr. Vitas Werdegast, he is a sad and ironic man who protects his two young friends. When he finally picks up a scalpel in Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and begins to skin the living man, ah, well, it's a great scene.
