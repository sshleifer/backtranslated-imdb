While the likelihood of someone focusing on this comment among the other 80+ for this movie is low, I feel I have to say something about this. I'm not the type of movie watcher who pays attention to the value of production, thought-provoking dialogue or acting and brilliant direction. However, I claim that this movie sucks. I do not know why I do not like it ... I mean it has almost everything I want from a horror movie: blood, outrageous, unintentional humor, etc. According to this evidence, it should be my favorite. Still, Zombie 3 is a baaad movie. <br /> <br /> There are many things that make you scream on the screen. Like when the girl leaves the army guy when the car breaks down to find water (this does not spoil anything, so do not worry). It goes into what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Did not she see that there was a damn pond in the middle of the building? Yes, she is looking for water and passes through a lake. Because? Because she wants to know why people (who are not there because the place is abandoned) will not respond when she shouts, "Is anyone there?" Oh, that's just a small insignificant part of the overall picture I'm painting. <br /> <br /> There is a reason, however, why I gave this film more than one star. It's one of those movies in which, if you forget how bad it really is, as I have sometimes, you'll want to watch it again because it's so exaggerated in every way. I called blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, there is an ocean of blood. In addition, there are also very strange creatures: a zombie baby (with an adult-sized hand) and a magically flying head to name but two. <br /> <br /> Do you know when you're trying to think of the darkest, hottest films of all time, and you come up with science fiction movies from the '50s? I believe Zombie 3 and movies like it should be at the top. It has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, armies battling monsters, and so on. This is Plan 9 of the '80s! While I will not say this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, just expect the worst. And when you find out that waiting for the worst is to underestimate Zombie 3, it will not be that bad. You may really like it, I'm not saying it's impossible. <br /> <br /> Do not think that I hate this movie, I do not ... really. Oh, P.S. Killing Birds (aka Zombie 5) rules! Did I just blow my credibility?
