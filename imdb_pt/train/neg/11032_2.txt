"I Love New York" is another entry from VH-1 (MTV Networks) showing the fun side of dating a raucous and obnoxious woman. It must have been an easy decision to take the craziest, craziest Ebonics candidate talking - and her mother - and give them a show on that network. Many will argue, "this is a show." It's true that it's not as bad as the previous show, "Flavor of Love" - ​​but it's so bad. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a part of the 1990s show, "In Living Color," where Keenan Ivory Wayans was imitating boxer Mike Tyson on "The Love Connection" dating show and he chose "Robin Givens" for a date. Mike talked about how good the date was, but how the detestable mother continued to intrude. This show reminds me of that. <br /> <br /> Men are chosen and given names to degrade and the woman they are dating. (I think a smart man wanting to date a smart woman would NOT allow her - and her mother - to give her a name that is so ghetto, you'll be ashamed every time you show up on TV.) But these are Reality Actors Professional, so why bother? <br /> <br /> Escaped for me to find out what's so fun about it all. The fact that this is as false as its newly implemented additions? 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network? (Well, you can not hate them for trying to make a buck). Perhaps the wonder is - who would want to stay with this woman after an hour? Or wants to know if she and her mother's next show would be on the WWF! Either way, it's a train crash that you've seen countless times before, so now the shock value is reduced to zero. <br /> <br /> No twist or bend will make this a more interesting train accident, or unlike any of the others. It appeals to the lowest common denominator and to those who call it the "end" for reality shows, this is just another nail in the coffin of why they should end, immediately.
