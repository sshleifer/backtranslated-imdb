this movie, I will not call it "movie", it was basically about nothing and it worked mainly for the popular acts of the time. Yes, the war was in full swing (pun intended), and this film gave the troops and our audience a pleasure. <br /> <br /> But let's have something with a little more substance. <br /> <br /> I loved seeing a young Buddy Rich on the drums. the music was good everywhere. <br /> <br /> But one cameo after another gets old fast. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Zero Mostel! So if you're one of the "biggest generation" as they say, you'll definitely love this ... movie.
