I have fun easily. I liked "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and its many sequences, even when most people found it unbearable. I even got to enjoy most of Pauly Shore's films. There is only one movie that I saw that I can honestly say was bad ... and that was it. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "This is a stupid movie. Why did I see this?" It's honestly the only movie I can not recommend.
