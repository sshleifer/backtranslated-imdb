Instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed them to the monkeys. Monkeys are funny. People with amnesia who do not talk much, just keep their eyes blank, are not so funny. <br /> <br /> Black comedy? There is not a black person in it, and there is not a funny thing about it either. <br /> <br /> Walmart buys these things somehow and puts them on their shelves. It is labeled Unnamed. I think they took the topless scene. They may have taken other things too, who knows? All we know is that, whatever they took, it does not exist anymore. <br /> <br /> The acting sounded good to me. There are many unfathomable there. Is it supposed to be a city? Is it supposed to be a large lake? If it's so hot in the church people are shaking, why are they all wearing coats?
