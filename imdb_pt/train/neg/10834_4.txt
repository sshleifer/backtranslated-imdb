Sorry I missed something? Did I leave early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and fake!) Stories made me think, "This is going to be a classic." But it was all down there! The acting was brilliant, as what William H Macy is worth is fantastic and gets better and better in every movie I watch. But it never seemed to connect. I was waiting for the big time when all the stories connect and then suddenly ... rain frog? was if the writer said "I went to the bottom as I can pull all these stories together intelligently ... Oh, it's just rain frogs." I like smart movies, I like weird movies, but this was weird and boring. 4/10
