Why is this movie well below standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor script and no humor. A slim, medium-sized Travolta (looking quite elegant in black, I mean, even with a HUGE mullet) and Gross, both act very well as two well-dressed youngsters are, but even so young New Yorkers eager to open their own nightclub. Other than that, the rest of the movie is boring to watch. It's so monotonous that it really is not worth knowing what happens at the climax of the movie at any level. Kelly Preston obviously conveys sex appeal and sexual dancing with her future husband Travolta is one of the few pleasures of the film. Charles Martin Smith is a lot of fun to watch as the challenging KGB fighter "Bob Smith". Personally, I think the film would have been better if the plot had been altered a bit so that the settings did not change from NY to 'Indian Springs, Nebraska' (you're in the former Soviet Union?) - you'll understand if you watch the movie. .. Apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a release in 1987. I think Paramount stopped releasing the film until January 1989 because of the unbelievable plot. It was reported that they considered it "unrestricted." However, this $ 6,000,000 movie grossed slightly more than an embarrassing $ 163,000 prescription, since it was only released in places like Texas and Colorado before heading straight for the video. This is proof of the overall ADB quality of this film.
