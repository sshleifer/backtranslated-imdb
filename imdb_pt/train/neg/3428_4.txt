Well, if it were not for Ethel Waters and a 7-year-old Sammy Davis Jr. (here without Jr.), Rufus Jones for President would be one of the worst depictions of the African-American stereotypes I've seen since the beginning of the talkie and would not have been worth seeing because of it. Waters is great here singing "Am I Blue?" and "Underneath Our Harlem Moon," while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz has prepared him for his superstar status as an adult. He's so good tapped here that for a while I thought he was a small person with decades of experience. So if you are willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for the president should provide some enjoyment. Q. This marks the fourth time today that I've seen and heard the song "I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You" featured in the film, this time by Davis. It must have been a very popular song about that time.
