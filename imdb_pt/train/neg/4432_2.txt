Tatie Danielle is all about a horrible old witch who torments her loving family and others out of sheer spite. There is a bit of subtext that may be about the colonial past of France, but it's mostly just Danielle doing the sort of thing (like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park) that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, this does not happen here. It looks good and the acting is good and there is nothing really wrong with the concept but it is so SMUG. God, does this movie love itself? Too bad he's not as smart or as funny as he thinks. The only momentum in the show - sorry, movie - comes from Danielle getting more and more unpleasant, and the only surprise comes from observing the increasingly unlikely ways she does it. That's right: just like in a sitcom, that's what it is, with the "bonus" of delusions of grandeur and a time of 110 minutes.
