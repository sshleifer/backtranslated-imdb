This kind of plot really has a lot of potential, but it was massacred here. Honestly, I felt the cheese element in the beginning, but I thought it would look better after the grotesque birth. Whoa, I was wrong! So a mad scientist makes a monster, wants to brag about his old friends before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's too bad. I should have told you sometimes that the shark rubber mask peeked from behind some foliage, but I probably would have lost count. <br /> <br /> Pan up the bloody-cut leg-to show how the shark-man meets the staff. I hate being fed up with every aspect of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and after being almost killed by a mutant shark and walking around an island in the jungle, there is nothing more joyful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare ... < This is one in which you will find yourself cheering for the monster ... if you can afford to watch this poor excuse for a movie.
