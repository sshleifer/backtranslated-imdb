The movie itself is so pathetic. She depicted deaf people as cynical about listening to people. It is true that some deaf people are cautious about dating by listening to people, but they are not necessarily angry, as if the character of Marlee Matlin was in the whole story. The deaf do not go to the bar and dance like Matlin. All in all, the film itself is more annoying than pathetic. It is so annoying that I would like to believe it is a movie healed by insomnia. If I have a problem sleeping, I can simply appear in Sons of an Under God and watch. That will put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Remember, this is a deaf guy talking.
