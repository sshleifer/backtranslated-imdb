This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I do not really remember when I saw a worse one. I thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation. What it really was was a soap opera, and a bad one at that. They exaggerated the 'conflict' letter to the extreme. The first hour or so sounds like a game of shouting, with some implausible scenes. The 40-minute memorial scene (with black umbrellas and rainfall needed) for fictitious accident victims was lame, and I thought it would never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, unless you like 'conflict'. <br /> <br />
