This movie was different because it did not show the typical gay stereotypes I used to see. But that does not change the fact that a plot is totally missing. I'm sure there are many gay men who are happy to see themselves on the screen, since black gay characters are rarely seen and, when they are the characters, they are generally not fully developed. But how difficult it would have been for the writer to script a story with beginning, middle, and end. Or how about a focused story? There really does not seem to be a point for this movie, and even if it's a low-budget film, it's still no excuse for a lack of story or plot.
