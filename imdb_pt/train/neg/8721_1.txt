I'm sorry, but this is just pathetic. The girl was a brat, they were not nice characters and the plot was a drug. Besides, it was not even a crocodile like the movie would have us believe. If you check any complete reptile guide, you will find that it is actually a crocodile, not an alligator. Obviously, they did not hire a real animal expert or they would know the creature is a crocodile. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the ending. I almost slept with this one.
