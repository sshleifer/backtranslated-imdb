I sat almost an episode of this series and could not take it anymore. I felt like I had already watched dozens of episodes and then hit me ..... There's nothing new here! I heard this joke on Seinfeld, I saw someone fall like that on friends, an episode of Happy Days had almost the same plot, ect. None of the actors are interesting here either! Some were good at other shows (not here), and others are new to a profession they should never have entered. Avoid this stinky one!
