I can fondly remember Bo Derek's apogee and UK media attention (especially the Sun & News of the World's grungy papers) - all following his small role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Understandably, a lot of noise was made of her photogenic face, crystal blue eyes and perfectly formed bouncing breasts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting is, and never has been, its strong! I think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the DVD trays - Orca, Tarzan, Male-Man and Bolero. All these films could be nominated for "So Bad They Are Great". <br /> <br /> It would be a guilty "must buy" mine! If you have ever read your press, or this comment, Mrs. Derek, please do not take offense - always had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to care about than your ability to act. Much love.x
