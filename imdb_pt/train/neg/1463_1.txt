Imagine that the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been as stupid as Carlyle portrayed him in this film. No one would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed person. face in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This is just a piece of Hollywood cardboard advertising, disguised as "true story." <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for all who really believed in anything in this program. Carlyle and the producers did not agree with that. <br /> <br /> Why was Hitler able to win so many people, a whole county for his ideas, if we were such sausages? Why did people follow him to death? By portraying him as a loser, they make their own movie totally unbelievable. This film is a mix of old World War II propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a movie about Churchill, where the director only shows him as a drunk for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disgrace and I wonder how they could talk to an actor like Carlyle in this story.
