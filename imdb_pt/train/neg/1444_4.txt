The film is very long and unfortunately very different from the novel. If you want to see the movie, then do not read the novel first, as this will surprise you. However, the cinematography was OK and if you are a person who loves adventure genres that explores Africa, then go ahead. Performance performances are adequate, however, many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father. Gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave, while here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
