Is there anything that happens in this movie that is not predictable? I think not. Basically, the movie is cliché after cliché and really nothing comes as a surprise. This makes the film extremely predictable and, because of this, the film is also seriously lacking in tension. So for a thriller, it is not tense and unpredictable enough, but also as a drama, it is a failure. This is because the film its story is highly improbable. I mean, no way this could happen in real life, just as events occur in this movie. So the film has a real suspense and credibility problem. <br /> <br /> But it's the clichés that killed the movie. It was shrinking sometimes. Everything is so stereotyped in this movie. The predator is portrayed as a fragile and heartless boy, almost psychopathic, and the victim as a naive young man, who acts as if he does not see any of it. Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and everything seemed to happen for a reason. Like the sequence in which the "predator" repairs the broken car of the "victims." This has to be one of the oldest clichés in the book. I knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point. I tried to look like the teacher and student were actually approaching each other through the eyes of the other people around them. It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point. The movie is full of moments like this. <br /> <br /> The title may suggest that this is a cheap porn movie, but it's actually a movie made for TV movies. Which means that everything is happening slowly and the film spends half of its time developing the character and unnecessary subplots to make the movie even more dramatic. <br /> <br /> I admit that Elizabeth Berkley is very good at acting in this film. It makes some of the clichés and events seem almost realistic at times. Her Hollywood career is as good as after appearing in Paul Verhoeven's "Showgirls," so unfortunately, she's probably still only appearing in movies - and TV shows like this. It is a waste of her talent and she certainly deserves better. All the other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier plays the "untouchable" rich kid cliché and the way the main character's husband is portrayed is even worse. He looks more like a frustrated sexual predator than the true predator of the movie. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before going to sleep, he wants sex. He comes home, he wants sex. It may be a realistic thing, but I do not know, it does not seem right for a movie like this and for the story in general. <br /> <br /> A movie full of clichés and I can not think of any reason why anyone should watch this movie. It is predictable and therefore also lacks suspense and credibility. It's not a 'horrible' movie and it certainly is a watchable film at times, but all the weak elements and clichés of the film also make it far from commendable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
