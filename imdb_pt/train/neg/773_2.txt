No, not the administration of GWB, the Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove". Life must have realized what a dog was because the series was recorded in two episodes at a time, most of them transmitted between 11pm. Friday night and 1am on Saturday morning. As for the reason why I watched the whole thing, I can only argue seizures weekly seizures of masochism. <br /> <br /> Most of the cast are unknown that will likely remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who deliver the only decent performances (Jones is just the whole series - lucky woman). Ward, by the way, has been aging very well since his days of "Thorns Birds". The only main thread in the conspiracy - who murdered the heroine's father who was wrongly convicted of Dad's murder, but released after six years in the slammer - has been stretched for so long and hastily concluded that you will not care especially who does it. There's a lot of "smoking" sex, lots of murders and all kinds of rude behavior - hardly any of them are interesting or believable. Most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented. The writing and direction are on the same level as the cast. <br /> <br /> If you stick around to the end, the postcard is a joke (much smaller). <br /> <br /> CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!
