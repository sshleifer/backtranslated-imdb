The movie is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what a "walker" is or really will care. I felt like I was watching a 1970s movie. The subject was not credible for the year 2007 even though it was set in DC. I think this sounds true to everyone who watched as well, since the cheers were low and fast in the end. Most also did not stay for the Q & A session. <br /> <br /> I do not think Schrader really thought of the movie ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed to be interrupted as if they were never finished or he just did not know how to end them. He jumped from one scene to another and you had to try to figure out or figure out what was going on. I did not really have the private life or boyfriend of Woody (Carter) either. What were all the "artistic" male images of slavery and torture (of Iraqi prisons)? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt to create this dark private subculture life for Woody's character (Car). Did not work. It did not even seem to make sense at all. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) perfectly. You really had a great sense of what a "walker" might have been (say, twenty years ago). He was great and probably will never be recognized for it. <br /> <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... boring. <br /> <br /> I do not see it! It's painful! Unless you're a true Harrelson fan.
