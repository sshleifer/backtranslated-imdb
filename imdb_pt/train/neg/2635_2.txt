I've been willing to deal a lot with fluff action films in late spring / summer, but overall this is due to the fact that most of them have a reasonable return (ie legal special effects, interesting twists, comic value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This film, however, had none of that. All we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of Eva Longoria's neckline (a Maxim edition is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, background story, character development, continuity, etc. I'd go into detail, but frankly I've - perhaps willingly - forgotten most of the movie. <br /> <br /> The whole time I was in the theater, I was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24-season DVD. Save your money on that, folks. Unless you really like Eva Longoria's cleavage.
