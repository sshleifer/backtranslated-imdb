I'm a big fan of Porsche, and the car was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim, the drug now exhausted abusing a child star of the 80's is bland as usual, and commenting on the back. from smaller characters / actors would be useless; Needless to say they were all very average. It's a cool movie like a road trip through memory until the '80s - with some weird clothes, some good pictures of the Colorado scenery and a very harmless, albeit daunting, plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, please do not. Do not waste your time watching this, unless you love the movies of the 80s, Corey Haim, or like me, loves the old Porsche (this one in particular looks great) because life is too short to watch bad movies.
