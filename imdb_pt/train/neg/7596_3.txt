A movie starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea. An independent movie sounds even better. The studios will control content less, allowing actors, writers and filmmakers more creativity. <br /> <br /> But why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. <br /> <br /> This film assumes right away that we are deeply involved in the characters. No one is given a proper background story, so we never know why the characters act the way they do. <br /> <br /> Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you still have a left at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I told a friend that I went to see this movie, and that I thought it was horrible. His question: "Could not even Colin Farrell save him?" My answer: "Not even Colin Farrell's butt could save him."
