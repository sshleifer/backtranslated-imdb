Un-bleeping-believable! Meg Ryan does not look at all kind, but that usually makes me forgive his superficial behavior. Hard to believe she was the producer of this dog. Also, Kevin Kline: What kind of suicidal journey have you been in? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! Was this finally directed by the guy who made Big Chill? Must be a replay of Jonestown - Hollywood style. Woooff!
