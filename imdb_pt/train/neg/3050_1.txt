Just when I thought I would end a whole year without giving a single movie a "Bomb" rating, a friend brought this notorious dick to my house last night. I feared the worst knowing his reputation, and it was as horrible as I had anticipated. This is a Mexican mess, nicknamed in English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible sets and effects and features a rather scary Santa who does not operate at the North Pole, but rather a cloud in outer space, and who does not have little elves helping him to make his toys, but to all different groups. of children in virtually all countries. The opening sequence, where St. Nick chuckles as he watches the monitors showing all these hard-working boys while singing terrible songs in a variety of languages, seems to last forever, and without history. Obviously, THIS Santa does not observe child labor laws! <br /> <br /> Eventually we have some nasty, red-haired apprentice devotee traveling from hell to Earth, just to make little kids naughty and turn Santa's Christmas Eve into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a tortuous and distorted experience, and this should scare little kids and turn them into Santa and holidays forever. Strangely, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas film, which somehow makes it all the more scary in the context of all the bizarre things that are happening. This easily makes my personal list the "worst movie I've ever seen," but I'm sure it's nothing special.
