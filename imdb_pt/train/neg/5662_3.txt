When I read most of the other reviews, I felt they were too bright for this movie. I thought I had completely lost the spark found in Zatoichi's previous films and only proves that after a long absence on the screen, it's often best to let things happen. I completely agreed with Star Trek's analogy from another reviewer who compared FIRST's Star Trek movie to the original series --- millions of animated fans were waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch a bland and sterile approach of the original. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, it's terribly bloody (although the recent NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much more bloody) and does not have the heart of the originals. I did not mind the blood, but some might be turned off (particularly cutscenes with severed heads). Also, time has not been good for Ichi - he looks like a broken and sad man in this movie (much, much more than usual) - and this is something that fans of the series may not really want to see. <br /> <br /> This was a very sad comeback for Zatoichi. Unless you're like me and want to see ANY Zatoichi movie, this is very skippable. See one of the previous versions or the ALL-NEW version of 2003.
