This movie was a mess. He had the worst issue I've ever seen. It was almost like at the end of a scene that the writer wanted to go to the commercial, and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to realize the dream of the writers. Under the confusing direction and editing, there was a glimpse of something good. A good idea, a convincing spark. But somewhere went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about an almost psychic priest who is trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that is hard to bite is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well, the part does not ask him to be a good priest and he succeeds very well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the crazy freak. He always plays the crazy freak. Very hum hum. Oh, one thought occurred to me that perhaps all the edgy and horrible editing and the disconnected plot were trying to add a sense of the confusion the character (Grieco) was experiencing. And just to prove that it was invented they rolled the backwords of the credits. Not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
