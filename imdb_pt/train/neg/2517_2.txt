This movie is the perfect illustration of how NOT to make a science fiction movie. The worst trend in science fiction is to make your subject a horrible, suffering, pseudo-Orwellian / Huxleyan / whateverian "vision of the" human future. Sci-fi filmmakers (and authors), as nerds, take themselves very seriously, given the high proportion of bad things of the genre. I think other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I just invented, relax) like terror or even romantic comedy or action, seem to have a little better understanding of the fact that they are not changing the world with some deep "message. "<br /> <br /> Sci fi can certainly succeed on a serious level, as several great filmmakers have proven. But there is a huge drawback in the whole concept, which is represented by "Robot Jox" with its cheap construction of "the future" (element of good and lonely design: the bizarre and attractive advertisements of billboards all over the place that encourage the women to have more babies) and their painful parallels "Iliads" (He is NAMED ACHILLES BY THE WILL OF GOD! I did not really realize this until I saw the movie for the tenth time, but I went to public school, so the filmmakers are not exonerated.) <br /> <br /> Of course, if you're crazy about movies like me, this downside has a big advantage. I absolutely love movies like that because bad movies are often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than the good ones. It's kind of a Lester Bangs approach to movie viewing, I think. <br /> <br /> Note: The lead in this movie (Gary Graham? Is that his name? I refuse to go check it out.) It's not that bad. . He does that. He's cool, especially when he's drunk.
