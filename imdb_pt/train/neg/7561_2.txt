Anyone who does not know the 1973 British film "The Wicker Man" would undoubtedly have left the cinema with the impression of "Poor" and "Peurile." <br /> <br /> As a devotee of the original I left the impression Purely Poor. <br /> <br /> From the sad reality of haggling inbred teeth that draw the force of law and order to a pagan barbarian ritual web on the remote Scottish island called Summerisle. near an Amazon colony on the coast of Maine in the USA, called Summersisle, the remake hardly gets to the point. <br /> <br /> This is, unfortunately, a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake. of a classic being tampered with to serve a simple audience. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS. <br /> <br /> Sirs (or given the reworked context of the movie) Ladies involved ... hang their heads in shame.
