In the USA, very few films were made about Rome that were not defined in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. The Hollywood sword and sandal epics have a Christian theme, which makes it difficult to get into earlier Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and found some resistance in Hollywood because there was no Jesus in it). It is interesting to see at least one photo that not only occurs before the time of Caesar and Christ, but is defined when Rome was only one city among many in the Italian peninsula, and had just overthrown the hated king. Tarquin and formed the Republic. <br /> <br /> However, this is not an historical film; is peplum, and while the production values ​​are not from the bottom of the well, the performance and characterizations are of cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian, but with wooden dubbing in English it is very exaggerated. I have some good laughs in the beginning. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many films of this genre, having lost most of the 60's Hercules films. It's fun to some extent, but as the film continues, it gets a bit boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: if I had seen this movie when I was ten years old, I would have loved it. At that age, I went to anything with Romans and sword fights in it. So at least this movie brought back some childhood memories.
