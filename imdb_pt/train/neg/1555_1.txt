When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS, starring those twin bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be so bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for making vulgar movies but well made movies. Well, THE BARBARIANS is a remarkably useless action / adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN, and fails on all levels. The look of the movie is all wrong. Some scenes were well filmed, but the tone and filthy, sloppy "disco" of the clothes and hair are simply not made any sense, even for a low-budget movie like this. <br /> <Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairstyle and fantasy. He should be menacing, but he looks like a clown. And it's funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of ALL MY CHILDREN's stars, appear in her first movie, walking in a skin bikini. I'm sure she wants this thing to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbarian twins are very much like the muscle-bound heroes, but it is almost impossible to construct a proper criticism of their performance, because their roles are, like everything else in this mess, really ill-conceived. The only way the movie tries to differentiate a twin from the other is to have a twin wearing a thong that covers her butt, while the other twin's thong barely covers her muscular butt. I'm not kidding! Do not ask me who's who. <br /> <br /> Deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this movie. And his despair is perfectly reflected in this useless film. Is bad.
