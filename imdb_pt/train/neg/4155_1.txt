OK, I knew it would be a dead-end F movie (well below the B movie standards), so I thought, "Man, I could have a good laugh, so let's see some inferior beings killing each other." Well, what I got may have been found at your local toy store. Random lesbian scenes, very little fight, and no plot. <br /> <br /> For example, a particular scene that I remember (for its sheer stupidity only; I've seen better porn on ABC) is where the two main characters (I can not remember their names improvised .. and the driver was tired of driving and stopped: Driver: "Let's pull over, I'm tired, do you want to take over?" Passenger: "Sure, I can drive for a while." (Once stopped, the driver starts to pick up the passenger's breasts.) Passenger: "What are you doing? I'm not like that!" Driver: "Alright, everyone does it someday." Passenger: "Okay then." (Proceed to take shirts, pet, kiss and do oral sex.) Now, the last time I checked, horror movies were not in the Hollywood Video porn section (unless you're on the S & M, then you go somewhere else), and definitely should not be in the top Blockbuster videos. Do not misunderstand me; I'm definitely not one of those people who hate pornography, but I just watch when appropriate and definitely do not want to watch it if I'm looking for a movie in the mainstream stores, since the one I rented was one of the two retailers I named (and probably in the other too if I went and looked). Worst movie ever, no one should rent it, and it should only be bought for a public fire ceremony. If I could give a 0, I would, but I can only give a * of 10.
