A lost call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone. I recently rented a Korean horror movie based on a cell phone called "Pon". One Missed Call was as annoying as that. Maybe the phones are not scary or something, but this movement was monotonous and monotonous. No tension or emotion to me, and the final monster was disappointingly tacky and unarmed. The film shuffled a bit in different parts and seemed very long. Did not keep my attention. It seems like the phones are hard to scare, it's like trying to make a machine pop automatic sales. And it's ridiculous to compare this to "The Ring," it seems that all Asian horror movies are compared to him and so far I have not seen any that gave me any value. For horror directors - take the phone off the hook as a terror device.
