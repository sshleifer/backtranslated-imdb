this movie has no plot, character development and no budget. It's really bad to put it on short notice. As there is no development for the film, it can not even be seen trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture. Which leaves two other reasons for possibly watching it. To be shocked or to leave like a sick madwoman. Well, it falls short here, too. The girl's reactions seem dumb. it's extremely easy to say that it's fake (honestly professional wrestling seems more realistic than the crap they try to get through in this movie.They play inside it but she's sleeping for most of the time so it's kinda stupid) . The worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene before the needle gets into your eyes but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake, except for the eye if you want a good movie about torture, go see Hostel and Hostel 2. Not only do they contain realistic violence but there is also a real plot that attracts you and makes you worry about people. Also, trailer movies really work on a deeper level, considering topics such as American fears of foreigners, questions of morality, testing how far a person can go, human instincts versus civilization, and many other things. They are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story is not focused on v iolence. These are much better choices about this piece of crap.
