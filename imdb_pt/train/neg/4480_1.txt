Let me start by saying that I did not watch this movie at the beginning with high expectations. It was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies, and "MTV" was pasted on the cover, so I was not expecting much. What I expected was a shrill, overly dramatic, but at least effective, movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, let me start that I had never read the book. nor did I watch any other version of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was my main complaint with the film. For God's sake. The lead girl is pretty mediocre, but when compared to the rest of the cast she's Maryl Streep. The main "Hero", Heath, is simply awful. He can sing clich√©d songs of decent sounds, but that's about it. His performance broke the "sad" moments by being so bad in points that I just laughed. The girl Isabel was also pretty, and the brother was just a plain character who was played by an actor who could not demonstrate any emotion. And when he tried, he failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor, playing Edward, although it's obvious that the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what I saw him do. Oh, and the father was not half bad for my memory, but he was in the movie for such a small period that I can hardly remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More separations than you think. Predictable story (until the end, which I misunderstood). EXTREMELY unilateral characters with no real depth to them ... Overall, it's not interesting or attractive, nothing we've ever seen done so MUCH better, and nothing worth watching here. <br /> <br /> The end is supposed to be a tearjerker. Did not do anything like that. The ending is not built at all, it almost seems like a belated reflection. In fact, I had to ask my friends why the ending actually happened, which when they explained to me, I must have taken a look at my face of "Wait, when did they say that?" That's never a good sign. The editing was probably the worst I've ever seen, although I understand that fade-ins-fade-outs are made because this was originally done for TV, but that's no excuse. <br /> <br /> Overall, film is just crap. I'm a sensitive guy, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this crap, not even close to that. Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tearjerker, look elsewhere.
