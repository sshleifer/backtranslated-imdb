0 * Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Based on the video game director, Uwe Boll tries to recreate the game in an action-packed nail biscuit, alas, he can not. Instead, it makes one of the worst movies ever made! Despite having such small celebrities as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film lacks the fundamentals needed for a movie to be good, like a plot, and some basic relativity of what is happening in the dark and the light. The movie jumps around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used in making the monsters. Even if they looked cool and the blowjobs were fine, a little boring. Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating 0/10.
