This may not be the last Mandy Schaffer movie. Somebody do something! :-( <br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> What a little life this could have had, the direction is over. <br /> <br /> Do not blame the cast, they went well.Even the winemaker is younger O brother was very well done, and he did not even get into the movie until halfway. And please, please put Mandy in a few more movies! She's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age. <br /> <br /> Two specific criticisms, in case anyone cares (apparently no one really liked this movie) First, the way Traci kept appearing in the right melodramatic moment, in order to see everything she was supposed to see, and it was never seen in return, it was very boring Hollywood: please stop giving the bad guys the perfect sort of timing that ends just when the climax arrives It's stupid Write better scripts so you do not need to use this lame plot device anymore. If your script is not good enough to stand without it, then do not . <br /> <br /> Second, Carmen would not have fallen. en for this trick of false injury that Traci pulled. She already had Traci fingers. Worse writing / direction there. <br /> <br /> I could ruin this movie even more, but mercy forbids it. In fact, I did not hate it as much as others seem to have. He simply did not have much reason to be done, unless it was just a vehicle to show off beautiful Mandy. Oh, and for those who did not think she was sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how can you say she was not sexy?!? Either one of us needs glasses, and I do not think it's me. MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I would also like to see her again ;-) Q. Did I mention that I hope Mandy will make me more movies? <: - D
