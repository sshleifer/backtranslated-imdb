I think this proves that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a buck. The concept of the movie was not too good to begin with. This movie has so many bad things about it that I do not know where to start. The acting is horrible. Cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was very bad. The score is terrible. There is a reason why this movie ended up in the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before writing this and I can not believe that 9 people really think this "movie" is great. They must have liked the two go-go dancers. The ultimate justice would be if they blocked this stench in the movie safe outside of Wichita and never let anyone see it again! A rating of 1 out of 10 is a lot better than it deserves.
