My favorite part was when the credits started rolling. I wish I could give you a .0000000000001 of 10. I really would like to have that Hour and thirty minutes back. Do not waste your money or time on it. I really could have watched the grass grow and feel better after the wings. <br /> <br /> Nadia was very beautiful and I hope the film does not destroy her career. But she chose to be in it. <br /> <br /> In short, it was more shocking than any other movie. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That's saying something. <br /> <br /> Do not <br /> <br /> Do it !!!!
