With a film by Bo Derek, the audience gets exactly what they expect. A fine paper plot and some pictures of Mrs. Derek without clothes. "Ghosts can not do that" that's all. The first fifteen minutes are ordinary TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor, with long experience in several different roles, but it seems that even a famous actor needs to work only for money sometimes. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a very pretty young woman, with or without clothes. The movie is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or bad acting, rent any porn movie.
