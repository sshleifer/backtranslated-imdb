I think this is a horrible produced and directed movie. Benicio Del Toro should not be working on film production, he should emphasize his performance and that's it. Steven Soderbergh lost all idea of ​​the revolution, his ideals and the life of Che Guevara and so on. Camera is horrible, as someone with 2 days of work experience is shooting with her, the music is ... I do not know .. is there any music in the movie ???? I will not recommend this piece of sh .. to anyone. It's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever .... I can not figure out how anyone can rate this movie more than 3 stars. Disaster .... Disaster .... Disaster .... Disaster Do not watch please. Save yourself from this misery of the "movie"
