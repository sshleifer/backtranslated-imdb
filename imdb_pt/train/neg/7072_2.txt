My title almost sums up all this crap I should have had a tip when I saw it was a Fred olen Ray movie - but I thought, "HEY, IT CAN BE BETTER THAN YOUR US INCH", I was wrong! This has to be the worst film ever aimed at kids. The acting was horrible, the humor was non-existent. The direction was the worst I've ever seen and the special effects would not seem out of place in a 50's Disney movie. <br /> <br /> WHAT HAPPENED TO DEE- WALLACE STONE! Who has ever had such a promising career in the 1980s. Film veteran and former child actor Russ Tamblyn was a terrible villain and the budget was so low it was unbelievable, even a childish film. <br /> <br /> I did not see the sequence made in 1999 and I do not intend <br /> <br /> If you want a good child's movie Watch 'HONEY SHRUNK / BLEW UP CHILDREN / KID' OR ANY DISNEY MOVIE <br /> <br /> MY RATING LIKE A 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> MOVIE CLASSIFICATION: - 3/10 AT THE BEST!
