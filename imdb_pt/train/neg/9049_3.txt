Supposedly a "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970s, "Nightmare" is full of bad southern stereotypes, complete with fake accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners, but this tasteless job just seems like a "baby in prison" movie - disguised - especially in its original uncut version. However, acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors in particular does a good job at making viewers hate him - even though he seems uncomfortable in several scenes. There is also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed, who appears as the lascivious director, and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger of Gilligan's Island) has made a sadistic prison guard believable.
