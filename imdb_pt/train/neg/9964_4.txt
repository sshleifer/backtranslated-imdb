In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I could not find much about To Paris With Love. I'm sure Guinness made the film to get a free trip to Paris. The film has no other reason to exist. <br /> <br /> Paris, of course, is well photographed with that wonderful Guinness opening and her son driving the Champs Elysee with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it goes down from there. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between Guinness and the young man with whom he has a brief adventure in Paris. According to Guinness's recent biography of Piers Paul Read, Guinness did not like the girl, he found his behavior unprofessional. As for what Odile Vernois thought of his co-star, no record is available. They have as much chemistry as two neutered cats. Guinness has a good time in the movie that went straight from one of his Ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to get a badminton shuttlecock. But I would not wait for the movie for that. <br /> <br /> At least Alec got a trip to Paris out of business.
