Fans of feature films have to endure many horrible movies lately. Blood Surf unabashedly joins the list of stupid and redundant titles of pulp horror about ridiculously large animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful, as we have had to fight against the abyssal "Crocodile" (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and "Lake Placid". Blood Surf is as bad as these other movies and ?? on top of that? likes to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater crocodile is supposed to be 90 years old, over 30 feet long (!) And kills for fun! During the movie, he revels in devouring a bunch of completely stupid surfers and idiots who have come in search of new emotions while surfing in a crowded area of ​​sharks. The only beautiful aspect of this movie is the tropical location. While being a completely unsuitable setting for a movie like this, the lagoons and nature look wonderful. All other aspects are simply disastrous. There is a little blood, but everything seems false and laughable. The dialogues are frankly painful to hear! You will not believe some of the speeches these actors have to say! I know surfers must be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope they are not so stupid! At the beginning of the movie, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a "mechanical toy", but the croc here seems at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurs and the massacres do not impress. I will not say much about the acting, since it is secondary in films like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their breasts happily jump as they flee from the beast. You guessed it right: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. So bad that it becomes fun again. But 'funny' for a reason completely different from that intended by James Hickox.
