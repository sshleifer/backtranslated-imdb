Here's the usual formula for getting a new recruit - this time the first African American (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman breaks down the Armed Forces - through the US Navy's deepwater divers training program that is run by a racist zealot De Niro). If the program was not bad enough, it should be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the presentations. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and screams nonsense. Cuba Gooding, raised by a stern father as a poor black southern farmer, is the ideal model of righteousness. The girls - could hardly call them women - are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have smaller roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense. Other decent artists - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have even more superficial roles. <br /> <br /> That's about it. Almost everything else could have been mounted by a computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro welcomes indoors, discovered. After a brutal attack on the hospital staff, he is transferred out of his clothing instead of being arrested. Someone shouts "I'm out of here" in the early 1950s. (Maybe it was a common expression at the time, in that case, "my bad.") People address each other by rank - "Lieutenant," " "," Commander ", as they do in the Army, while in the Navy they are simple" Lord "(if an officer) or addressed by their surname (if enlisted). I did not bother to check if there was a post called "Senior Master Chief" in 1950. Cuba Gooding has a hard line for hoeing. Everyone in the Navy, it seems, hate blacks except for one Wisconsin guy. He stutters and is despised by others in his class. It's like the scene in "Animal House", where the candidate for a Tony fraternity is invited to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man and a blind boy. <br /> <br /> Gooding is an enlisted man. man, a second-class officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school. In one of his arguments, she begs him. She just wants to be a doctor and he should join her, leave the Navy and lead a quiet life. "And letting life pass you by?" He replies. Yes. Yes, just be a doctor's spouse and let life pass you by. You can wave to him from the golf course in Boca Raton. <br /> <br /> These types of movies were quite common in World War II. "Bombardier," "Airial Gunner," that sort of thing. Cheap as they used to be, they had some educational features. You have learned something about becoming a bomber or a gunner. Here, the technical details are ignored, perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them (except Boyle's law, which we learned in high school chemistry). <br /> <br /> I could not keep up with what was happening for a few years. of emergencies without which such a film would not exist. If I solved the mechanical problems, it was because I guessed correctly. The direction also does not help. The film is abundant in close-ups, so many that they lose any dramatic impact they may have had. And emergencies are confusing because they are poorly focused. <br /> <br /> Why continue? Want to see a better example of this kind of movie? Almost anyone will do - except maybe "G. I. Jane," in which the abused hero is a hero. Try the training camp scenes in "The Young Lions". There the victim is Jewish. Or try "From Here to Eternity," in which no easy sympathy button is pushed and the victim is an adult man who refuses to bow and who is active in bringing the conflict, as well as "Cool Hand Luke." Easy excuses are not offered, because easy excuses are very easy. <br /> <br /> Completely stereotyped and not well done.
