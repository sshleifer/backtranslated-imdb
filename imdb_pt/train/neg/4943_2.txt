I've watched 3 Caveman episodes, and I have no idea why I continue, except maybe hoping it will get better. <br /> <br /> For me, this show is ending the commercials, without real humor. While we were sitting watching these shows, we all speculated about what would happen. <br /> <br /> The woman-cave-woman episode with an attitude was really a big, yes, right, for us. She is coarse in a theater and acts tough on strangers, and truth be told, she needed a slap <br /> <br /> I consider myself a good reviewer taking in everything, but I must say, Cavemen is comparable to the show old, my mother, the car. I give 2, just because they deserve 1 better than 1 because they really spent money on it.
