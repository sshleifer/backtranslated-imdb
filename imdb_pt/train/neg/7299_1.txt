Of course I've seen bad movies in my life, but this was so bad that I really got angry at the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to reimburse my movie ticket, of course I did not get a refund (or even an answer), but that's the point that matters. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a -42. Why did the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stop being hit by a baton? Why did they hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat first, instead of breaking the bum's skull? The plot was thin, the movie full of obvious cliches, and certain parts of it just did not make sense.
