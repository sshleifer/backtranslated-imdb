There is a reason why Jay Leno himself will not recognize this film. It is consistently rated as one of the worst movies of all time. The acting is horrible, the script has no direction and the director himself does not seem right about the way to make this film. "A friend movie", "an action / comedy", "mystery". It seems in the middle of the road, it gives up, and it is just for the ride. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated artists. It's a pity that they lost their time and gifts making this movie a mess. Jay Leno and Pat Morita, before getting involved with it, spent years hitting their jobs on the Hollywood circuit. Morita was already a star in her own right, acting steadily since the mid-1960s as the star of TV classics and films like "Happy Days," and the sombre but affable "Mr. T and Tina." And he captured the hearts of America with his roles in the powerful film "Midway," "The Karate Kid," and a host of others. Leno can be seen on TV shows dating to the mid-'70s. And she was a top performer in America's comedy clubs. It can be seen in countless TV commercials and in major movies. It's a shame they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
