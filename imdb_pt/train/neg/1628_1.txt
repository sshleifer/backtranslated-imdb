Undoubtedly one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, GAOTS really seems to want to be something important. The tragic truth is that it is so utterly worthless on all levels that we can not help laughing. Arriving in despair at the earthly elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, he follows the days of a couple from the city in the desert ... they walk along a dark path, all pontificating as a U.C. Berkeley coffee clatch. Almost every line of tarradiddle dialogs delivered here is noisily bad ("I feel like life itself is made up of as many little compartments as this pomegranate .... but is it so beautiful?") After what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening (well ... OK ... we are treated with some nudity and a soft sex scene), there is finally a very anticlimatic confrontation involving a pair of Nam vets who are doing the nature scene and performing some popular ballads with a guitar . <br /> <br /> Nothing interesting or interesting happens in THIS WHOLE MOVIE. I thought Larry Buchanan's photo "Strawberries Need Rain" was a weak example of a tribute to Bergman. "Golden Apples" is so bad, but the incessant random wryness that it makes makes it memorable. 1/10
