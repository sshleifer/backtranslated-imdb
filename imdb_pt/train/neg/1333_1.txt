I was totally disappointed with this movie. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some critics here wanted us to believe. I thought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 moves in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Performance: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I deleted the movie from my DVR to 70 minutes. in the movie. Much better movies out there than that ...
