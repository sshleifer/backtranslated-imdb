I watched this movie today and not only is it terrible and horrible, but it looks like the director just joined some friends to make a movie about a sick man. I also think that this movie has the appearance of a porn video with a clear and well-shot vision. <br /> <br /> Thank God I work in a video store and I did not have to pay for it because this movie sucks x infinity..DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE !!!!! You'd have a better time watching Dude Where's My Car than this piece of crap! And that does not mean much to the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and the film is very unacceptable. I was watching this movie and wanted to kill myself during and after the movie. <br /> <br /> I came home and threw up after watching this filthy movie, then took a shower and burned my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had an idea, I would take the film from the outside and burn it too, because nobody should be subjected to it ... well, maybe members of Al Queda ... especially the ones we have in custody and also child rapists who are in jail in life imprisonment sentences without parole ... just make a setting like an orange work clock, and then force the cheese head to watch over and over again.
