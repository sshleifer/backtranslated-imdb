This is one of those movies that I remember being in the can for years before anything happened to it. I do not think it's terrible, but it's also not very good. Alec Baldwin was very good, but the plot is a bit fragile at best. The cast is very good at what they get, but again you're as good as the script. Baldwin directing this, although I could swear he did not direct all of this, I found that I read somewhere or many re-shoots was not bad but it definitely has some potential there. Although his work on "30 Rock" is nothing short of genial and should keep him busy for a little longer. I just hope the show goes out gracefully to la Seinfeld, but maybe not so long. 9 years ago. So if you want to see a movie you will not get much but really do not hate it well this is for you. I can not remember the last time a movie was wrapped up for so long before finally being released and only on DVD. It was cool to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins again together as their excellent people, though not much, saw "The Edge". Now get that great movie for some real entertainment.
