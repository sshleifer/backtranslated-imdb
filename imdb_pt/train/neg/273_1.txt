The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a good red wine. This movie is no Cabarnet and certainly no Casablanca. I agree with the other critics that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us every night in sit-coms and the dialogue is flushed and boring. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie. <br /> <br /> With the passage of more than sixty years of history comes wisdom. From Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman was exposed as a plagiarist in Bidenesque, with her so-called "Julia" real-life story from her book "Pentimento." As one of the most odious of a plethora of Soviet apologists in the West, it is obvious that his theme in the play and in the film was to incite the US to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and the international communism of the fascists who had just proven their military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one critic correctly remarked, this is not a pro-American play and film, since Lillian went to his tomb a communist of American aversion. This film chronicles the presumptuous familiar stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the American left as well as now the more complete left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore incorporated the conspiracy theories and once again gave aid and comfort to those who destroy America.
