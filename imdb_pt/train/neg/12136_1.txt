I saw this movie on t.v. this afternoon and I can not see how anyone can sit through this piece of crap. It's nothing funny and takes its I.Q. descending a few notches. I know this movie is for kids, but that does not mean writers should have their intelligence as guaranteed. I bet the writers were sitting around a large wooden table and imagined that: a) The word "poop" is a big laugh. (b) A four-foot-tall kid can bury into a ten-foot-high basketball net. c) Children should always fight armored hijackers because hijackers will fall in love with anything and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat the so-called "ninjas" with swords. One good thing I can say about this movie is that it contains the world's weakest suburban "gang" that could not scare anyone. Maybe the MST3K guys could use this movie to have a good laugh. Do not bother with this excuse for a movie.
