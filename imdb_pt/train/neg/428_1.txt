Wow, a movie about New York politics, apparently written by someone who never set foot in New York. You know there is a problem when at one point you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues for another half hour. The characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is laughable and the plot swings between boring and laughable. A horrible movie.
