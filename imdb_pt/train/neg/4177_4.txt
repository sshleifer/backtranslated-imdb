Second movie in the boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, this movie was very average. It's kind of boring in parts, but there are some good bloody effects, but they're not great. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have dominated the entire world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, which also has its own spacecraft and is led by Churchill, who is captured by the vampires, receives a message from an Earth and the team, formed by Quintana (played by the very tasty Natassia Malthe). ), the rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman being played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused). V-SAN later meets the Mucus vampire leader, played by Michael Ironside of Total Recall. He has no plans to live peacefully with humans, as he is inclined to world domination. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll put it on the DVD player any time soon.
