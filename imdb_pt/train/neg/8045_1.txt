I'm so confused. What in the world was this movie about? What was the killer's motivation? He looked rather annoyed, but I still have to figure out why. Nothing in this movie made sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. Which I think would make a hill. Or a pile. Crap. The acting was horrible. When I looked for some of the actors in this movie, they had been in very few things I had heard of, and that was no surprise. I can not decide if I feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in such a bad movie, or feel that they should never be offered another acting job again. Getting started. . . NOW! (Seinfeld Reference.) Really, however, do not waste your time on this. There is so little substance that there is nothing there just to make fun. This was undoubtedly one of the worst horror films - NO, one of the worst movies of any kind, which I've had the misfortune to watch, and I've seen a few.
