I was looking at Imdbs 100 background because I thought I've never seen anything so bad as outerspace plane 9 or the Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur won both. <br /> <br /> This, among the countless movies I've seen, is the worst number one movie I've ever seen. Bad Direction, Wrong Characters, Horrible Performance, Horrible Story There is a reason why no one besides Sam has said anything positive about this movie. Sam was a horrible actor, but his direction was so bad that he could just topple Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The director should be ashamed of his work, unfortunately I have to give at least 1 star, but it deserves - to be continued stars.
