It was a thriller, like I thought when I saw the cover in the video library? No. Was it a "thought food", as the author might have been trying to do that? Not really. So, what was that? It was a very average movie, which had great potential, and was well directed, but disappointed by a confusing story with no strengths, starting in the middle and the end, with little expected performance of the serial killer, which despite seeming overzealous in some points delivered the best overall cast performance. It was a nice cinematography, with good colors, cool hi-tec stuff, beautiful scenery, but leaves you lost where you're going and where you've just come. And with a feeling of just quickly wrapping you in the end. OK to see if there's nothing else on the TV.
