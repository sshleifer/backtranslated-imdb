Sorry guys, I already wrote my opinion on this movie, but today was the first day I looked at some of the other reviews. There are a lot of people who agree with me, but what is scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie. I do not like writing nasty reviews or criticizing other people's opinions, but I think it's fair to warn anyone who is debating whether or not to see this movie. This is not a good movie. I really like movies and I watch pretty much anything but this movie went into the incredibly short list of movies I watched and I was happy to get out of the way. If you're really unbelievably tempted, watch the trailer ... that was the mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially in the trailer ... after that there are no surprises, just some shockingly bad dialogues to waste time. I love Michael Vartan on Alias ​​and would hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to prevent other people from wasting hours of their life on a movie like this!
