The fact that I do not like music is a very personal opinion, historical inaccuracies are not. I realize it's an opera and not a documentary, but some important things are missing, especially if other people comment falsely because of it. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was the mentor of this operation, which was staged. and reorganized due to the discovery aboard the ship in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of whom was Samir Kuntar, a heinous terrorist whose history you may find looking for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even though he had never stepped on Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never set foot on the planes that hit the WTC, did he? The film almost excuses the actions and reactions of the terrorists because of the horrors they could have experienced, always accentuating and exaggerating how much the Israelis did to harm them. However, they never portray the pain that the Palestinians caused to the Israelis. The film uses images (very horrible!) From the terror of Sabra and Shatila, and nothing is said, underestimating the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible, without ever mentioning that it was a Syrian-Lebanese army that led the war. massacre. <br /> <br /> The acting was generally pretty bad, but I guess that's what can be expected of opera singers? On another note, I am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists by killing a hostage because the hostage tried to incite the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists, and added that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a defender of Zionism. Imagine how unfriendly his wife was, spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw her body into the sea. I hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is (wink wink)
