LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - Wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he's the star? I should have known better than renting the EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew better. But in a moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in a STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. As in sat-on-a-shelf. What it did. And with good reason. The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt murderous cops at MAGNUM FORCE, and the "journalist" Timberlake is the only brave enough to discover them. He is the target of his efforts - or perhaps I should say for his horrible performance. I hung up after one of the bandits was shot in the forehead and even had the premeditation to turn to his sniper and smile before collapsing. Simply horrible. The real hint for how bad this movie is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the film sporting an undisciplined beard, looking like nothing more than a hobo. You just learned that the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly sloppy.
