Problem with these types of movies is that literally dozens of them are made every year. Fortunately for use only a handful is given a theatrical release, while others are being pushed directly to video or TV, like this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this film is really its originality. It's one of those movies that uses the "Hard To Kill" formula of a tough but troublesome guy, being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, he is a character played by Casper Van Dien, who works for a security agency that thoroughly tests security procedures for businesses and individuals. In this case, he is being sent to a cruise ship, which is obviously hijacked. You can see this movie as a kind of mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One" and the film does not even try to hide that these two films were probably their greatest source of inspiration. So you can not consider this movie as original. It uses all the clich√©s in the book and this movie does not really offer surprises or anything that remotely remembers something original. <br /> <br /> As you might expect from a movie like this, it has a very weak script. Or rather, it features some very lazy writings. As I said before, the film does not present anything original, but also the story itself presents some elements that are far from likely and are simply ridiculous indeed. I mean, hijacking a huge cruise ship with only eight men, half of them carrying only a few small guns and then asking for a ransom of "only" $ 10 million for a ship worth about 10 times that pretty ridiculous amount . How do they plan to split that money later? Does each person get a little more than a million or something? This is hardly profitable for such a big and risky venture. And then there's the case of taking the passengers hostage. Somehow they manage to take all the passengers from the huge hostage of the ship and manage to put them inside a room with only one face with his pistol, which he does not seem to be able to hold right, watching them. You never see more than 30 hostages, as if they were all the people who were on board at that moment. Also, when the Van Dien character goes looking for his son and vice versa, no matter which room they enter on the huge cruise ship, they always meet instantly. Just a few examples of lazy writing inside the movie. <br /> <br /> But of course it's an action movie, so the story, of course, becomes secondary. But again, it's not as if this movie had any good action. Half the actors look like they've never held a gun before and the movie is full of ridiculous slow motion. It's really ridiculous on some points. <br /> <br /> Of course the film also does not feature the best actors, although I must say that Casper Van Dien really is not an 'action hero' and actor as much as the genre and B-movie circuit is in cause. He nevertheless also also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise; no matter how old he is, he never seems convincing enough to play the father of a teenager. Van Dien once started as a promising young actor but starring in movies like this really does not help his career much. He is probably capable of something better, though he never has the right opportunity to show it. All the other actors also do a fair enough job, but their characters are so stereotyped that they never really become interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, it's not the worst genre film I've ever seen, but it's also just the most original or memorable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
