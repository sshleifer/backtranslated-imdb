Oh, dear, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and nasty ... Remember the shot of the "Natural" where the lightning strikes the tree (leaving a shiny stump) that Roy Hobbs does a bat of ?? Well, the producers of this movie used the same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch hit the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid to use the footage from The Natural, or did they just expect that anyone who would watch the movie would pick it up? <br /> <br /> So in the end where they were trying to get away in the truck. Such over-action in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A very bad movie, a very bad movie.
