This is a great idea for a movie, but unfortunately, it's not a great movie. What starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his out-of-control Fluffee spirals in a bizarre combination of genres and a true stew of plots, with liberal loans from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even a curious "trace" of 400 shots thrown at the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but in the end, this well-produced film does not contribute to anything. However, all the actors do a game job with the material and there are some good laughs in the behind the scenes world of gay porn. <br /> <br />
