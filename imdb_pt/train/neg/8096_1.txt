Most of the book adaptations are bad, but this movie left out important parts of the plot and changed the description and some characters. They reconnected the plot and combined scenes and changed the order. They added ridiculous things that never happened in the book and would never happen. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book beforehand, it would have been an incredibly tedious film, it did not make you care about the characters, like them or did not like them. Turn the characters into jokes. <br /> <br /> Horrible. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Waste of two hours of my life.
