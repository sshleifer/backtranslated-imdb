A disappointing musical version of Margaret Landon's "Anna and the King of Siam", filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, has Deborah Kerr as a widow teacher and mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to take up work as a teacher. many sons of the king - and perhaps teach the Royal One a thing or two in the process! Stagy picture starts well but quickly loses energy and focus. Yul Brynner, reprizing his triumph on stage as the King, is a dominant presence, but is used - according to the invented story - as a clown. Kerr retains his legal dignity and better fares, despite having to make a sync with Marni Nixon's vocals. Perhaps having played that role until his death, it seems that Brynner had no more remains for the translation of the screen except the bombastic. In the second half, with Anna and the moppets staging a musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is pretty ridiculous, and the songs of Rodgers and Hammerstein are heavy. Brynner won an Oscar for Best Actor, but is grumpy Kerr, who keeps that trinket above water. Overlong, heavy and 'old-fashioned' in the worst sense of the term. ** in ****
