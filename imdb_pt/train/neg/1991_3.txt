So what's the big desire to make an aspiring INDIANA JONES when you have an actor who is cast as a fictional character from adventure story books who does not want to go out on an adventure ??? Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired, but for whatever reason, this movie does not have much emotion! This does not mean that it has no action, but look at the dark side of the image. This bears no resemblance to INDIANA JONES or other action-adventure thrills containing cliffhangers and narrow getaways, and JAKE SPEED was promoted that way by using clever advertising to make me and several others interested in it! Also, I've never heard of the guy, so who needs your attention?
