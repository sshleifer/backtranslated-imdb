The Three Stooges in a feature-length Western musical comedy? Perhaps "Rockin 'in the Rockies" was designed to combine the short Stooges comedy with the Western musical, in a matinee; if so, this was a pleasant way to end a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (as the blonde June) and Gladys Blake (like brunette Betty) are beautiful women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; their songs are quite melodious; however, this is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film is not exactly "rock." There are some laughs; but the mood of the Stooges is more moderate than usual. The talking horse is also underused. Rockin 'in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
