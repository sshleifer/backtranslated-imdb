I read the story of John Everingham years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking what a great movie he would make. And it probably would have been because Michael Landon never put his hands on it. As far as I'm concerned, Landon was one of the worst actors in the world, and his artistic license went much further, which is similar to the massacre of the "Little House" series of books. The acting, for lack of a better word, is atrocious, the sloppy script, and there are more close-ups of Landon's pus than should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This film reflects the history of Everingham as much as "Little House On The Prairie" reflects the books it is "based" on. It's just another vehicle to show Landon's horrible hair.
