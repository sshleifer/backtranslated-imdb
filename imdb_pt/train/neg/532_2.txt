Just PPV'd this. I do not want to waste too much time on this, since most posters put it better than I ever could, but I wanted to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I did not know which one was funnier: Redgrave chasing little moths and stumbling on her nurse; A deep regret that her "precious" boy (whom she and Mr. had decided to be a drunken loser) had been turned into a run over; that the deaf Ann spoke to Peggy Lee; or the horrible CGI of the Crypt Guardian, Annie, looking at her younger self! <br /> <br /> I never bought the Danes as the young Redgrave. I also did not buy Richardson and Collette as sisters. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, it's better if Mom gives her some lessons! I had no idea why any girl (or Buddy) would play foolish role on the insipid stallion Harris! Ann's daughters are as whiny and unthinking as she is, Luc is a latecomer in crack, and I did not give a shit about any of them! The night gives a bad name to Chick Flicks!
