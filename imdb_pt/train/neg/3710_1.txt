The king is dead, long life to the king! The triad of Caddy Shack Two, The Family Under The Stairs and Beverly Hills Troop had been tied to the worst movie ever for so long that they looked like icons by themselves. But there is a new king ..... yes ..... everyone hails the new king .... "Down to Earth". But some things, like Tiny Tim, for example, are so bad they are good. Someday this could take away the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult movie. So go and see this .... this ... well, just take my word for it. Go see that. All salute the new king!
