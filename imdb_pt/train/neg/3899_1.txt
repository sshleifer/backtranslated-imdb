Where do I start? By the title of this film, I expected some degree of authenticity, in the end I was completely disappointed. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, it's a Hollywood story (or choose your movie production center) based on some real-life characters. I should have had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent giving the introduction to the film in German; the red blood text (title, artists) should have been the second clue. The plot is invented (Lale was not deceived outside the parents of Switzerland Rolf Liebermann, there is no information that Liebermann helped to smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song had been recorded out of control of the NS regime not under control, the record played in the station was caught in Vienna while a lieutenant was there on leave, etc., etc.) the costumes are poor and incorrect for the deadlines (SS black uniforms used everywhere from border guards to positions, these were far from daily use a Once the war began, etc.), the characters are stereo types (SA aggressors in a club, since they were essentially out of power). Do not waste your time.
