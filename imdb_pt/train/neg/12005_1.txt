We've all seen some endless epics in our times, but this one really outlasts them all! The film is so long and so slow that, just to put things in perspective, I felt much older when I left the theater, than I entered. With almost 4 hours in duration, it could have been turned into tele-serial. <br /> <br /> What starts as a promising comedy slows down slowly. Nikhil Advani traced the plot around 6 love stories and he can not do justice to any of them ... There is no interconnection between them to begin with, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes seem only to be forced to connect the story. <br /> <br /> The situation worsens with silly dialogues (mostly repeated in Hindi cinema over the years) and idiot cinematography. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not realize that she really needs to interpret it. paper instead of just looking glam on the screen ... A total waste of beauty without acting skills. <br /> <br /> And then there's high-is-humorous Govinda & my face-twists-better-than-Jim-Carrey Akshay Khanna, who continue to belch their lungs to annoy tired viewers. <br /> <br /> Only a good part of the film is the love story of John & Vidya and good acting / comedy by sohail & Isha. But they are so good in their roles that only these two couples could have justified the film without confusing it with other types of characters. Its brightness gets lost in the midst of other below-standard plot lines. <br /> <br /> My guess - the director was making two separate films (can be more!) And some beginning assistant mixed all the discs, plus a point of sorting them, so the director was left with no choice to show all as a single movie ... <br /> <br /> Watch only if you want to test your patience !!!
