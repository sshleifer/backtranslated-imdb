With a "borrowed" title from Werner Herzog and liberal aids from Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay is considered a cut above the usual kind of trash that our British cinema produces. "Robert Carmichael" (shortly) presents itself as a realistic study of youthful alienation and, at the same time, apparently a criticism of the war in Iraq. The problem with realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical - unlike the ghostly imaginations of "extreme" filmmakers, most teenagers are not raped by drugs. As a criticism of the Iraq war, a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - subtext society has harmed this sensitive individual) is so childish that it can hardly be thought of. There are signs of technical skill, but some reviewers have exaggerated. Like Kubrick and Noe, he shows that the desire to shock tied to a supposed serious intention may be the film's worst trick of the recent film. People liked "Mechanical Orange" and "Irreversible" because they liked rape and violence, but most of all they liked to feel culturally superior because they liked the things they hated most. Kubrick and Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) label it as one of the most idiotic films of recent years. Doing this in earnest is a difficult trick - people in theaters applauded Alex in "Mechanical Orange" showing how Kubrick's alleged intent was lost in miles.Free violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many movie directors.
