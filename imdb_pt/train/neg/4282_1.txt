I just can not understand why all these relics of the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. One can clearly see how frustrated they were during the censorship of the commissioner who banned them from showing so many things in their films, and now imagine that it is not known how much artistic freedom fills the screen with people defecating, urinating, vomiting, swearing and any other kind of horror imaginable. THIS IS NOT CINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget the Bunuels Chien Andalou, about David Lynch, about Forman and neorealism and other filmmakers who could work with an aesthetic of ugliness. These people were dominating their jobs - well, you did not! Do us a favor, all you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other old veteran obsolete, and leave us alone! There is little time to see some Romanian films on screen, enough with their immature terribilismos! You are not a director, you are illegal !!!
