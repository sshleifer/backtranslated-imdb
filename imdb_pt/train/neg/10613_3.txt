The dance was probably the only thing watchable about this movie - and even that was disappointing compared to some other movies. My God! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst kind of movie - it's supposed to be a work of art because it has all the elements of the film as art. Yes, it is beautifully photographed but ultimately does not have the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself. Tango is a provocation, it is hot, it has drama, it is audacious - precisely what this movie is not.
