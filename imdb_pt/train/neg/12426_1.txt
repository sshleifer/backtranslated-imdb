Whoever thought that ANOTHER Movie Alone at Home would be a good idea should have his head examined ... Same plot, different child, more villains (which leads to MORE endless stupidity in the pitfalls). The other two movies have been bad enough, and that's where it hits the bottom of the pit. People can also watch the other films by plot, since everything is identical.
