Anyone who has watched some Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that is removed from the planning table. Then, when Lara went crazy, she moved to Patti's house and methodically began to drive her mistress crazy, nor did I blink. When Lara eventually increases her activities to threaten poor Patti, and challenges her to do something about it, I just nodded. You see, in Planet LMN, people do not behave the way they do for any particular reason, they just do it to keep the action going. Only in Planet LMN could anyone have the owner of a house thrown out of their own home by their seductive powers !! Poor Patti - she trusted too much, and Lara got out of the drug, and then there was this big fight at the top of the ladder involving a syringe full of deadly things that ended up being injected into someone's belly, and a body bag coming out the front door . The horror! <br /> <br /> But take it away from me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You need to watch it once, just for the good laughs you'll get. On the Improbability Scale, I give this movie a 95/100. Make a large batch of popcorn and get some apple slices too. You'll understand later.
