The movie Underground Comedy is perhaps one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. I should have known it would be bad when the box had the phrase "guaranteed to offend" written ... meaning that filmmakers would focus more on filling you up than making you laugh. <br /> This movie is an amateur mess of children's skits, bad characters and worse jokes ... from the pathetic sketch of Bat-Man to Arnold Shvollenpecker's sketchy, painlessly dull sketch, they just are not funny . The few sketches that are a little funny are few and far between - watching Micheal Clark Duncan play a gay virgin, for example - but they still linger long and are ruined by Vince Offer's ineptitude in the comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep the underground comedy movie underground ... bury it!
