An incomprehensible and confusing mess. Most things in the movie look more or less like 1987, but then there are futuristic things, like the cop's gun. And this car! The director seemed to be in love with colored lights. The only really remarkable performance was the girl who played Valerie, but since there was no cast, I do not know which actress she was. This is worth losing. Grade: F
