I have to admit, this version wears out early Shakespeare! No one can act except the nurse who was my favorite! Juliet had good adolescent skills, but she can not give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect with her. She is worse off making the scene when she is thinking of drinking the sleep potion ... god stop whining! I would have spilled it on her mouth to shut her mouth! Anthony Andrews ... dammit! Considering his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he is very shocking in this film. And do not get me started on Romeu ... puhleasssssee! It is still good to see if you are hunting to see all the Romeo and Juliet made in film history. The version of Olivia and Leonard is still the best, followed by the version of Leslie Howard and then the current Leo and Clare!
