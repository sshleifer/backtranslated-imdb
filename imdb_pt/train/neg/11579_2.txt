I have to admit, I do not remember much about the characters or the story, although I'm not sure if there was one, I was so annoyed by this movie that I had a bit of trouble concentrating on it. How can you name a "Keys to Tulsa" movie and then film it in Texas? The country desert around Arlington (I think was the place) does not look like the green hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much better neighborhood to live in. Obviously, no one in the movie WAS ALWAYS gone to Tulsa, or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even looked like it. No one had seen at least Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know this sounds picky, but I can not help it. I watched this because I love James Spader and I often find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not animate this sinuous and petty story of self-centered people who ARE NOT IN TULSA !! Sorry, it can not be more expensive to film in Oklahoma. What if "Living and Dying in LA" had been filmed in Toronto? Would that suck? Well, it happens.
