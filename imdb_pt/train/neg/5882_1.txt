I'm not sure why this movie was advertised as a wild, quirky comedy, full of laughter. There is not much in this movie that entertains or threatens the viewer. Annette Bening (whose performance was rated as Oscar-worthy) comes here as polite, with her performance looking routine. The character of Brian Cox is confusing and annoying, and the protagonist playing Augusten? Joseph Cross? seems to simply not have the personality to play its part. The best thing about the film is Evan Rachel Wood, but she is not enough to endorse this boring and nasty movie. <br /> <br /> The movie disappeared quickly and seems for a good reason. I found some of the scenes unpleasant (the scene with Brian Cox and his newly-used bathroom rivaled some of the worst scenes of 'You and Me and Everyone We Know' and 'The Squid and the Whale'), some embarrassing and most of them. they are haunting. I found the whole experience a waste of time. Do not you waste your time?
