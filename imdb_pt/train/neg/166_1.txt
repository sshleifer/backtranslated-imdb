Ok, first of all, I did not sit to watch the premiere of a "Star Trek" series to see a cowboy flying in space. This is how a normal Enterprise episode works. <br /> <br /> 1 Archer encounters a nebula or something like that and wants to take a closer look, but it can destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 he sends a bus to the nebula and the space shuttle is damaged ... <br /> <br /> In all the episodes I've seen, all the problems are happening because of the errors stupid Archer. Oh, and did you see the preview of an episode showing Archer and T'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch this episode, but after that I totally gave up the Enterprise and turned back to the TV. Let's go!!!! This is the trek star !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also what went with the banana slug? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug, but he had to leave her behind for some stupid reason. Okay, a little dumb to bring your slug into space, but whatever. Ok, that's what I thought until they left on a desert planet !!!!! A BANANA SLUG CAN NOT LEAVE IN A DESERT !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid these writers are. <br /> <br /> Either way, just saying if the company is on, DO NOT WATCH!
