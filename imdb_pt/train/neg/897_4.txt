Two years before writing and directing "Arthur", Steve Gordon had a small success with his screenplay for this crazy comic vehicle by Henry Winkler, then TV's "The Fonz." A 1950s stage actor (and idiot of all kinds) is a co-ed and marries without any prospect of employment on the horizon; to make ends meet, he turns to the extravagant world of wrestling, eventually becoming a "Gorgeous George" celebrity. Turning the sympathetic Winkler into an unpleasant jouissance probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from his televised alter ego), but the jokes and situations are often misguided and miserly, staged sloppily. by director Carl Reiner. Particularly coarse is a little that involves Herv√© Villechaize (of "Fantasy Island") putting the movements in Polly Holliday (Flo of "Alice"). Like Henry's beloved, Kim Darby seems a little out of character-particularly when surrounded by all those hamsters-making the novel's script look inconsequential. * 1/2 of ****
