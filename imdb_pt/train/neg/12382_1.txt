Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would roll in their graves if they knew this movie went to theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director Stanley Kramer's 1967 masterpiece. This day is a joke. So a white guy from an overly stereotypical Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African-American girlfriend home (Insert GASP here) to his father's funeral. The reactions of his family members were naturally predictable. This movie was so painfully wired from start to finish, that my girlfriend actually started making a false snore, to signal that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and rent the original. Take a look at Wake.
