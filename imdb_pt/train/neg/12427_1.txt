I hated this movie. It was absolutely horrible, poor, poor, acting REALLY stupid criminals who were not even the LITTLE LITTLE funny (unlike the first 2 homemade home movies that were very good). All boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuses for ideas barely copied from the first two, which means that the people who were writing this movie were just lazy because their salary did not exceed $ 20 a week. This movie is absolutely lousy, not worth renting. In fact, we did not even watch it on t.v.! Go use your eyes in a more useful way, seeing the first two! I am VERY giving this 1 star (out of 10). Just trust me when I say, if you liked the first two, and you're not a complete stupid person, you will not like this movie, do not watch this movie !!!
