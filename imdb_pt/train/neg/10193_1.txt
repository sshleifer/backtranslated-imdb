With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all the force of the film, while clearly stating in the film that his work is "objectivity." Obviously it is not. For a reason, many scenes "filmed by sheer chance" are obvious scenarios (when that poor goat "accidentally" falls off the cliff, you can actually see the smoke from the gun to the right of the screen!). On the other hand, their concealment of important information: the Hurd people were the way they were for a specific reason that is only suggested in the film. That is, goiter, a disease caused by lack of iodine (salt). This goiter is the cause of his cretinism and had Bunuel only had time to do his research (hell, if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he would have found 'goiter') he could have just told the truth about these people (still, doubtfully). Instead, with his film, he constantly judges them, talking about them as "cretin", repeatedly, dramatizing the action, setting up scenes to create the show, all very unacceptable to a documentary filmmaker who claims to work for a movie. All-powerful objectivity. Bunuel talks all the time in this film, not leaving a word to the people he is filming. He speaks for them, and yet he judges them. This piece has flaws in its roots, in its ideology and is a pity that it is considered a great film.
