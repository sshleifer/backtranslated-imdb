I found "The Arab Conspiracy" in a bargain box and thought I had discovered a lost treasure. Guys, there's a reason you do not hear much about this movie. The plot is muddy, the pace is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is as vivacious as the cold and simple tofu, and the finish leaves him flat. Even Sean Connery can not save this one.
