I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie of all time. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a Power Rangers villain, and has about the same rubbery range of motion. This may be good if manufacturers are not as proud of their design as they seem. That is, for a guy with a big rubber suit in an action / science fiction / horror movie that could benefit from some mystery, the shark gains a lot of time on the screen. Granted, it is generally unstable and erratic. I think you should assume it's so scary that until the camera guy goes crazy. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to a person about to be eaten, the camera goes to the shark. The camera comes back to the person about to be eaten, but now they are screaming and without arms. And so on. <br /> <br /> The costumes are bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are insignificant, but writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten, or something like that can explode. Because let me tell you, the people who made this movie definitely came with a more explosive = better mentality. Characters shoot at cars and there is a huge explosion. They shoot helicopters, there is a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, whatever, they all explode, so much so that the damn shark even explodes in the end. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, I do not care how crazy a person is, I think. It's hard to believe that someone thinks that trying to get a giant half-shark half-person to have sex with a woman to making weird babies with sharks is a good idea. That is, UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie. The bad thing is that the film is so random (and sometimes boring) that even evil is not enough to hold a movie. interest of the person. It might be good for MST3K with your friends, but after that, if you catch that bad boy, do yourself a favor and change the channel.
