"The Home Front," by Frank Tashlin, is one of the shorter shorts Private Snafu, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military. Instead of getting Snafu to take some disreputable actions that lead to disaster, the 'Home Front' focuses on their loved ones at home and how much they have to offer as well to the war effort. Snafu realizes he was wrong when he thought it was easy. It's a concept with few possibilities for good jokes, and instead Tashlin plays the heaviest card, long jokes involving strippers and half-naked girls dancing instead of a very effective comic relief. The result is a well-intentioned short that today has little relevance or entertainment value beyond a historical artifact.
