If I could give ZERO stars for this, but unfortunately I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There is not a single scene that I can laugh at ... but the game did not make me laugh either. So if you're a badly retarded people, go to the local movie theater, watch this movie and get 10 stars, as some people have already done. <br /> <br /> But for me ... in a movie where children are shot dead to get humor ... good taste goes over the edge ... this was the third time I wasted my time to see a Boll movie and it was definitely my last time! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I'm ashamed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE KEEP IT MAKING MORE MOVIES !!!!!
