Imagine pulling back the mask from a deadly killer and finding Barbara Cartland there ... that's what happens with this movie. <br /> <br /> The opening showed the promise, but soon all the pretensions of being a thriller (or even a story of imaginative love) fall, and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear: filling a gap in her female-viewing market by creating yet another re-hash of 'misunderstanding and melancholy bad boy' (Andrei) finds' innocent 'capricious beauty' (Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting time creating an original premise, the filmmakers went straight to the picture: the bad boy being tamed by the extravagant beauty. Hence follows a series of insincere love scenes and heavily cliché sprinkled with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fluff. Andrei's admission of being a 'poet' is harnessed to complete the perceived qualities a Byronian hero should have - but even when they tell us in heavy letters and underline who and what he is, it is still hard to believe it. - or care. <br /> <br /> For a Byronian hero / antihero to work, history needs subtlety, style and innovation - which are absolutely absent here. This is not a modern phantom of the opera, it is only what happens when a weak and rather silly woman (with loose knicker elastic) dates from a bad man, who, after knowing her, looks as dangerous as rabbit slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances could have saved this film if they had been good: the female protagonist is preoccupied with appearing sexy and "supernatural", no matter how forced or ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott seems to have been drugged while fumbling with his part. This is not your best job. Glimpses of interest were brought by Jürgen Prochnow as "Vashon" and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer / brother. A better movie would have killed her sister and kept her brother in her place.
