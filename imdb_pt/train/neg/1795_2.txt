I had the opportunity to view this movie as a member of a test audience, and the only thing that kept me in my place was the chance to fill out post-screening research. I felt the biggest problem of the movie was the lack of a main plot. Instead, it was made up of (many) many subplants that competed for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character sufficiently developed for the public to form any kind of attachment. What the director and producer did not do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters. In fact, any sub-plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed without serious damage to the film. (The time gained would have allowed the much-needed development of subplots and remaining characters.) Simply put, The Hungry Bachelors Club's board is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when one is wanted in between.
