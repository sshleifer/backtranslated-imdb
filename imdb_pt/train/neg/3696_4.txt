Usually, I would have given this movie a 6. It tackles a very important topic and does this relatively well - despite Katie Wright, who is an achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> I have no idea if she was actually instructed to interpret the character like that or is naturally annoying but she did an incredible job at making it impossible for me to take care of Lexi. There is no dimension to her beyond how confused, helpless and clueless she is, and how good she is in whining. I can understand how a young woman who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder got out of control would be disturbed, scared and suffering. However, all of Wright's performance is based on incessant whining and whining, the rest being unfortunate. I could not help feeling that this particular girl's problem was caused not by the demon who is Bulimia, but because she did not have a backbone. I very much doubt that this is the purpose of the film.
