Jack Black can usually make me laugh just by breathing, but in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Beyond direction, writing, lack of plot, constant assault (aided and aided by constant camera shots) and an average jokes of 050, was still a total loss of time. The idea looks promising but the potential that exists is wasted with a complete lack of comedy and one of the worst directions I've seen on this side of your tube. <br /> <br /> I learned that this movie portrayed Mexicans very negatively. While this is certainly true, I really do not think this movie is racist. I think it's more a result of a "creative" team trying desperately to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them shouting behind the camera: "Hey, look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all things tenacious, Laughter!" <br /> <br /> But put the racism charges aside. When you get to that, it is someone who has spent a lot of money and time to watch this pile of refried bean scraps that should be offended, IMO.
