These writings write about the end of the plot, so do not read if you have not seen this crap. <br /> <br /> I found this junk movie in the horror section that made me think it would be a horror. . If I owned a video store, I would put it in the BORING section. This movie is so bad it will make you feel like you have lost your socks. <br /> <br /> This movie contains endless photos of people driving as if this were scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me, it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little boy does it too. Back and forth it goes and it never stops. What's so scary seeing a kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch, you will not think so either. <br /> <br /> The family in the car arrives in a big castle and they get a ride just walking around without stopping looking at kitchens. So the man walks around for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you can see, it's crap.
