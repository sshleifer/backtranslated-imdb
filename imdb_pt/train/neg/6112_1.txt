I was thirteen when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was rated at 16 in Germany, I joined the film as a replacement. It was so annoying. Then I realized that this was just crap, where a husband shows off his wife. I mean today you do it via the internet and pay for instant access. For over 20 years, but I'm still angry that I wasted my time on this movie. This is a soft-porn for students. Undressing Bo Derek and painting it with color - cool. But then they should name the film Undressing Bo and paint it.
