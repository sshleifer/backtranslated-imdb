This could be a cute movie for kids. My grandson attended once. he was watching for the second time I was watching him a bit with him. <br /> <br /> When the teddy bear gets lost in the ice and he's in the water, he's trying to get a piece of ice. He says, "Come back idiot idiot." <br /> <br /> I do not want my 3 year old grandson watching movies with words like that. <br /> <br /> That's why its rated for kids. You must be friends with the child. This is what I would expect. laid out by warner brothers and rated G I would expect this to have no swearing in it. The words do not even fit the movie in most places, as it seems added later. And the film creeps into many parts.
