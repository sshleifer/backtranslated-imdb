I'm sorry for Jean, after having had an original movie so good to be followed by his worst film in his career. This movie was horribly shot down by horrible performance works by Goldbeg (Romeo) and whatever the name of the computers. Also, some scenes may have been just a bit incoherent. Truly, bad movie.
