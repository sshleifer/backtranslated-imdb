I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics to his credit. He does well here as the heavy one, but the steering is so bad and the pace so boring, it never leaves the mark. The story begins well, though it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself. Still he mugs well and transports things. The death sentence is twofold. First of all, if we take the amount of time the characters walk from one room to another or from one part of the house to another, that would take up about a third of the movie. Add to that the character of Robertson sitting on the bed in the blue light, looking confused, who could add another piece. I agree with those who said that a shorter half hour would have made that a decent, albeit insignificant, film. The greatest weakness is just a complicated plot that, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questions. I'm not putting spoilers, but when it's over, do not think too much. I can get to ten what-ifs without lifting a sweat. It would have been better if it had stayed like a ghost story.
