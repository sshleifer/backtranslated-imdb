Everyone said that the movie Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake in playing the actress Kareena Kapoor. It was unbearable throughout the film. Your boyish look is not going well. Even the movie the story of the movie makes no sense at all. Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay, but it's not Quetin at all. The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie. Anil is an actor of great caliber and this film is not. Akshay Kumar also fell victim to this movie as everything is Saif. The style and Phoormola is not very good in this movie I was disappointed
