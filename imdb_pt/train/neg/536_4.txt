The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts about her past. The flashbacks are about a weekend when young Ann is at her friend Lila's wedding. In marriage, she meets Harris, who will affect her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life, she remembers him as her true love. His daughter Constance is older, more "responsible", mother of two children and has things together. Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and from job to job and is not sure of her direction in life. <br /> <br /> First of all, good. The detail of the period in the film is great. Dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. really put you in another time and place. And there's a lot of acting in the movie. Vanessa Redgrave is very good at portraying the main character and her fragile state of mind when her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young (and she is an excellent singer). Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to the character of Buddy, Lila's brother. <br /> Now, to the bad, which unfortunately is everything else. Things constantly disturb the story as it is being unfolded to us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. So ... you must believe that she really does not like him more than a friend and that her yearning just irritates her. And I thought the whole thing, "he might be gay" was out of the way and did not serve a purpose. <br /> <br /> So we have Harris. The character acts of wood and chilling. If this was another genre, you would know that Harris was the serial killer from the beginning. It's unbelievable to think that all these girls loved him that much (but they portray the other boys as fools to try to help him). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem of all. Why does not Ann and Harris meet? They fall in love with each other. They have this great sex night in an old dirty gardener's hut, come home to find out about Buddy's tragic end, and then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> They find one A few years later and they all got blurry eyes from each other and I could not help but wonder why. BECAUSE? The movie does not let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so I had a hard time feeling sorry for them. <br /> <br /> The part of the story in the present is quite annoying. A good daughter cliché and bad daughter cliché. Nina changes throughout the movie, but I do not know why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene where the daughters are connecting which coincides with the old Ann dreaming that she is chasing a butterfly. It is really lame and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There are no mistakes," advises Ann. The statement is not true with history. And that does not sound true after watching the movie and wishing they had not squandered the talent of such good actors.
