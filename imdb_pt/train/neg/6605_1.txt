Designed just to annoy (or amuse) any smart person who cares. If the director's intention was for the viewer to dislike the title character, then everything would be fine, but I know there is not a Hollywood director who criticizes the pro-Marxist movement in the US, especially not a filmmaker of the 1970s There's a lot of idiotic dialogue going on here that sometimes I wondered if I was actually watching a comedy. Would not you be guilty of thinking that this is a satire? that's how the movie is naive. Spacek has been in his share of left-wing films, which brings me to the obvious and inevitable conclusion that the redheaded hick is one of those Hollywood idiots. But, I mean, are not they all? Nice breasts, but s ** t for brains.
