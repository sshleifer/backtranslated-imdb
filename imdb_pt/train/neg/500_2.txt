The Bloodsucker leads the dance - what a ridiculous title, it's totally misleading. Not surprisingly, filmmakers try to fool us because this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island. <br /> <br /> Very little happens in this movie. And when something awakens the viewer from his stupor, it is invariably an unintentional comedy in the form of an atrocious dialogue uttered by a hopeless group of voice artists. These guys are so bad they make the actors they cast voices appear as a group of corrective-level idiots. It's really hard to determine how bad the acting is when you dub it abysmal. But the voice artists can not be blamed for the script. It's a fake. Unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. History in general is, to say the least, uneven. The female characters are particularly idiotic; men are scary or tedious. <br /> <br /> The whole company smacks of pure exploitation of the public. Do not remotely deliver what you promise and even when the murders (finally) begin to happen, they all occur off-screen. All we got were a few severed head shots. <br /> <br /> Some people have said that this movie is a giallo. I can not agree less with this opinion. Anyone who likes Italian thriller must give ample space to this movie, since there is nothing exciting about it. It's basically a soft-core porn movie with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic either. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this to anyone.
