"A Town Called Bastard", a British / Spanish co-production, was made shortly after the success of Clint Eastwood in the Italian trilogy "Man With No Name." The model used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors, whose careers were largely declining and voiced their voices. This film is no exception except for the fact that they used some British actors as well. <br /> <br /> It's hard to summarize the plot, but here it goes. The story begins with rebels or whatever, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau invading a church and killing everyone inside, including the priest. Advance to the subject town a few years later, where Shaw's character is disguised as a priest. The city's mayor (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who thinks nothing of getting justice with his gun. <br /> Play in the mix a widow of mourning Alvira (Stella Stevens) who is looking for her husband. killer. Add to this the fact that she rides in a dead carriage as if in a coffin, for God knows why. After the mayor is assassinated by his captain La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city is invaded by a federal colonel (Landau) in search of a rebel leader (I'm sorry, but the name escapes me). The Colonel takes over the city and begins to summarily execute the city's inhabitants to force them to reveal the identity of the leader. <br /> <br /> Although they have opened the film side by side, it is difficult to say, through dialogue, that the characters of Landau and Shaw know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) says he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does this and .............................................. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the directors regret having made this movie. It's just horrible and well deserving of my feared "1" rating. Shaw spends most of the film fixing his trademark on anyone who is at hand. Even Landau can not save this movie. Beautiful Mrs. Stevens is totally lost here, too. Having just done Peckinpah's "The Ballad of Cable Hogue," the year before, I found it odd that she appeared in this mess of a movie. Savalas made several of these images, ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" come to mind) during the pre-Kojak period. Michael Craig is also somewhere as a character named "Paco". <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these "westerns," although he emerged to play the villain in the two "French Connection" films. Al Lettieri would also appear with a role in "The Godfather" (1972) and move on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, the version I watched it lasted only 88 minutes. instead of the longest 95- or 97-minute times listed in IMDb, however, I do not see where 7 or 8 extra minutes would make a big difference. <br /> <br /> Avoid that one.
