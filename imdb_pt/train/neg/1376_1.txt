Of all the movies (and I'm a movie grad, if that's worth anything to you), this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I know there are probably some worse ones that I have not seen yet, but I've seen it, and that's the worst. A friend and I rented one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and retarded. She is without credits! His role was incredibly small! How did she get on the cover? The IMDb does not even list it in his filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little note to the store when we gave it back, and put it inside the cabinet. He read something like "please save your additional customers from having to see this movie complete and totally bad!"
