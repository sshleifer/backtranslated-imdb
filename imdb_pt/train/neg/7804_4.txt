THE TEMP (1993) did not do much theatrical work, but here's the rip-off direct video you did not want, anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new wife of Millenium Investments, a large brokerage firm, which begins to receive helpful tips from Deidre (Sheila Kelley) eye-popping secretary. Deidre turns out to be an ambitious daddy girl who will stop at nothing to climb the corporate hierarchy, including fucking a top-notch brokerage firm she does not support and murdering anyone on the bad side of it. She digs up skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to cause trouble with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills while making her appear responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to divert money from the company. <br /> <Harris and Kelley have competent performances, the supportive cast is well and reasonably well organized, but this does not completely compensate for a roadblock that runs down a worn path and offers few surprises.
