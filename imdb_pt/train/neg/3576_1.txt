Even when I saw this movie in a teenager, I wondered how ironic it was that Pia Zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Mrs. Zadora is, even she could not keep that excuse sorry for a tanking movie. Not even her photo shoot for the Penthouse, in which "The Lonely Lady" was promoted "at the time," could prevent this movie from being shot. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A completely different script. Give this one a miss.
