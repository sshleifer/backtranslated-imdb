Okay, I struggled to put aside the fact that by selling the EVP as real, the movie was basically lying to me from the beginning. I reasoned hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still liked Dracula so I could live with that. <br /> <br /> However, even with the acceptance, the film is not very good. He is made and acted with competence, but does not capture it at all. There are several "jump" moments, and I just looked at them and thought "yes, I did not expect that" without actually jumping in the least. <br /> <br /> The resolution also makes no sense. If the strength behind this is able to do the things it seems to be, then why the hell does it need to use a proxy? In addition, the final legend was absurd. They obviously put it there as part of the "give credibility to the movie claiming it's all real" thing, but for this to work, it really needs to be in the beginning. But they can not put it in the beginning because then they give the plot away ... putting it in the end just made it stand out like a sore thumb.
