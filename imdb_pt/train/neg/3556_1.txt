You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes is operating at half speeds rather than accelerating in a movie, and "The Incubus" is a terrible and pessimistic scenario for a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills. . In fact, looking at John Hough's Hammy script and John Hough's "baroque" art direction, one can hardly blame him. The film has something to do with a series of rape murders happening in a small town, with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed up. Somehow, the direction manages to suck the tension and the interest of all the scenes, and Cassavetes seems visibly PO and sometimes. Incubus himself, who does not appear until the last scene, is a well-made creation, but not worth the wait. <br /> <br /> 1/10
