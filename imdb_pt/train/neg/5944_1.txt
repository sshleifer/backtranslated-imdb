Not exactly my genre, this direct street fighting action for the DVD is one that I only found due to a friend putting it on while sipping a few beers. I'm relatively open minded, and a big fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sat back ready to have fun. <br /> <br /> Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, an ex-convict who becomes a street fighter for obscure reasons that eventually unfold as the movie progresses. Blah blah blah. What a tedious movie. I understand that movies like this do not depend on plot very much, but do they have to fill such a silly, predictable and totally stupid story? It may not be important, but the chewing gum irritates me. It is better not to be a plot and pure action than a half-breed narrative. Infused with an entirely unfounded and unwavering sentimental nonsense, it is the cinematographic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey stuffed with rotten bowels. I should probably mention what is, of course, the point of drawing the movie: the fight. Even in itself, the fight is quite weak. Bone succeeds in eliminating successful, well-established street fighters in individual punches (a big one or two idiots is the filmmakers' attempt to correct this inconsistency); fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a silly trick. Even this is repetitive and stupid, broken arms and kicked faces with a constant enthusiasm that we can see over and over again. <br /> <br /> A "movie by numbers" movie that deserves a straightforward DVD status, doing absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen over and over again. And not even particularly well.
