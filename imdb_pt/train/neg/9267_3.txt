After the already disappointing "Final Conflict", the series reaches the bottom of the pit with this fourth very weak entry. At least the third film tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien, while Damien simply re-enacts and copies ideas from the "Omen" (animals are afraid of Antichrist, a man's death is very similar to Antichrist's death). photographer in the first film). But what looked exciting and creative looks just plain stupid here. And the little girl just seems like a spoiled child.
