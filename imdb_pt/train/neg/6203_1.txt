I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was terrible! Every clich√©, violent, rich boy fantasy was on display, you just knew how it would end, especially with all the photos of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the Q & A with the director / writer and writer / producer, they tried to come across intellectuals, but you could say they are the guys that come out of the violence. I'll bet they go to brothels and use drugs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I had to stop my boyfriend from getting out of it.
