Just a blistering steal of the infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote," it's absolutely incredible that this poorly written litter lasted eight years. I'm sure most of the people who watched this undisclosed piece of crap were in their sixties and seventies and tuned in because they had nothing better to do or just remembered their old Dick Van Dyke Show star. Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, has never been much of an actor (by his own admission) and he was already too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. He looks absolutely old as a result of years chain smoking and heavy drinking. His untalented royal son, Barry, a wooden actor who has rarely been involved in anything that did not involve his father, plays his son in the series.
