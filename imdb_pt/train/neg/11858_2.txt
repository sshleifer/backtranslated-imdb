I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this movie - which I came across on cable - is absolutely pointless. I see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same, so there was no one around to check their worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines and no original characters. The goldfish was basically the nicest character. What a waste of all this talent in action. Given how expensive it is to shoot in New York these days, I have to wonder how this was done in the first place. And if you're wondering why I watched at all, it came after a movie that I like cable and left on while I worked on the computer. Not a very demanding photo!
