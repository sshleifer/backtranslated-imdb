Note: I'll reveal a key part of the storyline, but if you've seen the DVD cover or any promotional material, you'll already know. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been written by an eleven year old boy who is not very smart and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between a chemist and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the UN and the NSA seem to be running the show in Hungary. Forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents pursue someone whose simple touch will kill him in a minute, they do not wear protective gear (not even gloves). These are discussions in the context of this film. In the scientific world within this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes to the side. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the people in this movie do not behave (with few exceptions) the way humans behave. Almost every time a character responds to something, it is inappropriate. The love story (of course there is one) makes the novel scripts look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can not believe we wasted a free movie rental with this thing.
