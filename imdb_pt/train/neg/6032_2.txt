I am a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you need to have a well written script. Left Behind fell woefully on this. On the one hand, this deviates radically from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page romance into a two-hour movie, but in this movie I saw changes that made no sense at all. <br /> <br /> Another thing, there is no character development. When the characters in the story are saved (I do not say who), the book makes it clear that it is a long process of soul searching. In the film is fast and artificial. The book is written decently enough, where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the film's scenarios the consistently fast treatment is given without anything substantial. In another scene in which a character becomes annoyed at being left behind (again, I will not say who), it seems artificial. <br /> <br /> I realize as a Christian that it is not edifying for me to say that I did not like this movie, but I can not, in good conscience, recommend a movie that I feel dreadfully done. Maybe it was better to make the first book in 2-3 movies. Either way, Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers, we need to start putting together a movie in a qualitative way. I realize a lot of effort was probably for Left Behind, but that's how I see it.
