This movie is really bad. Maybe it's hard, but it is. It's really. Poor script, every vampire clich√© in the book is used, and no sympathy is given to all the origins of the main character ... ie, Dracula. There have been some truly brilliant Dracula / vampire films in the past, but this is not a "ghoulish" slot. <br /> <br /> Take a selection of people who seem to have given up on a movie. move teen-slasher, add a dribble of Dracula Lore and mix a heady tonic of religious / surreal daydream ... and you'll get a mess of a movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I can not find anything good to say about this movie as if it was not bad enough that it was done first, they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller effect an English accent ... What's the problem with what I hear you cry ... Well, he is English, but he looks like an American trying to make an English accent. <br /> <br /> Alright, you can also tell your money (if you were thinking of buying it)), or rent, watch and find out for yourself why it's as scary as the Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> Although La La is quite scary!
