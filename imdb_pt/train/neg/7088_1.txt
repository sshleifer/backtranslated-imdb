I was subjected to this atrocity by my wife, I tried to turn it off after 10 minutes but was forced to go through it all. This must undoubtedly be the most horrible pretense of a movie ever ... <br /> <br /> There have been great screenplay moments like: <br /> <br /> Sammy - "If she recovers here immediately, she gets a bonus "Madame -" A horny? Sammy - "No, a bonus" <br /> <br /> To summarize: horrible script, terrible performance and incredibly illogical.
