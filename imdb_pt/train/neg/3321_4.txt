Usually, I know after the first minute of a movie whether I will hate it or worship it ... but now, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The beginning was great; "That's based on a true story" and the blah blah blah thing was funny. Then the cartoons and description of the life of the guys with pictures made me think that I had made the right choice. <br /> <br /> So seeing Toronto's fake and hilarious look was cool. Besides, the situation and the appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> That was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which then seemed like forever. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just do not understand the English Canadian mood (this is possible, the English Canadians also do not always understand Quebecois humor), but hey ... there was enough material for a short movie, * nothing * more. Maybe this could be a meaning for the title? Anyway, almost everything was filling, and very few things were even funny-looking in my opinion. <br /> <br /> In fact, the making of was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind what made it all bad. The potential of the idea was great; that's why I rented the movie, interested in the "disappearance of annoying people" thing. But even so, I did not know that the whole universe would disappear, and with that to a point for the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are Canadian English, it seems like you can appreciate the local mood considering the amazing number of people who gave this movie a 8. Otherwise, think twice before wasting your precious time. ..
