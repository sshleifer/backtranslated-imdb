I rented this movie for a reason Tom Savini, I respect his work, but this was a real disappointment, I had horrible cliches, half of the movie was naked women called "fallen angels" running around trying to scare, oh and then there were the occasional black-and-white "Blair Witch" movement that caused heavy camera scenes. Tom's character was really horrible, horrible script. And you have to love those lines that they use. "There's someone there, who's out there, that's not funny." No, but his acting was. I wish I could give this movie a 0! Ah, the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but left Anthony, The Breakfast Club, gathered in the jungle for unforgivable performance.
