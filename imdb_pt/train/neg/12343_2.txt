Oh brother. The only reason this very annoying movie avoids the total "bomb" of me is because it is at least historically remarkable as the first Three Stooges movie (when they were not yet alone and were still overwhelmed with that painfully bland Ted Healy) . But even as a longtime Stooges fan, I would have to say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are barely used here as three zany assistant zits to the highest chief caretaker of Healy. They are not presented constantly through the film and their bizarre scenes of impromptu paint us more like super fun cartoon characters trying very hard to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> Most of this toothache deals with Jack. Pearl looking in vain to laugh at the audience itself as a man posing as Baron Munchausen (here is a good example of the mood level: "I object!" "On what grounds?" "Ground coffee!"). His helper is none other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even schnoz himself is annoying.
