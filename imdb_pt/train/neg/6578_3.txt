Unentvering, a non-hybrid hybrid of "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it's not as good as any of those trash min-classics. It's about the acting sheriff, Artie (Taye Diggs) being called to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose in an elegant upper-class university, but to keep it at the lowest level. As he goes deeper, he thinks it is much more than it seems at first glance. We followed Alicia, the girl who also had an overdose of flashbacks. In about 90 minutes, if this movie were welcome to begin with, it would have worn out. This movie does not bring anything new to the table. But it's the only movie so far that has Miss Swain topless, so the note is higher just because of it. <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain goes topless (fixing a "Happy Campers" error); another girl is topless <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy: more ass men than tit girl
