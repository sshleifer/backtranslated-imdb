He had all the cliches of such films and no substance. The plot came to nothing and by the end of the movie I felt like a sucker to watch. The production was good; however, the script and acting were of B-movie quality. The cast was bad because there were good actors mixed with rude actors. The good actors did not stand up or raise the others. <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding Jr. make caricatures of themselves in other films. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for senseless entertainment, I still would not recommend this movie.
