I am studying Catalan and I was delighted to find El Mar, a film with a mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art film rental. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... I'm not too happy to have seen it. <br /> Yes, as other commentators have said, it is well-made and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it is successful and convincing. (For the most part, this is ... Would the Mallorquins take a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the deceased's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well ... minor detail . Up to this point, it had something like the feel of a non-magical Pan maze, also set in the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident came of age. Francisca is a nun working in a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, are both patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, as with so many Spanish films (apologies to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are so crazy * strangers *. Their motivations, personalities and dialogues are often simply incoherent. <br /> <br /> In addition, it descends to a terrible and horrible excess. Be prepared for a lot of pain and lots of blood. The reviewer he called the "potboiler" is well on the way. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would have said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE !! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY !! BETRAYAL!! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is not enough to make credible the personalities and relationships of the characters. To work, this should have several flashbacks to detail the characters. So it looks like a bizarre and depressing intersection between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction." If this sounds like something you have to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I'm going with something that does not make me feel like I need to take a shower to wash away the blood and melancholy. <br /> <br /> As for the Catalan, it is the dialect of Mallorqui, quite different from that of Barcelona. dialect, although I was surprised by the comment that even the Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan legends to understand it.
