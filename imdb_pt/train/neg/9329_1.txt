One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only thought was, "How can I get my money back from Hollywood Video". That's not worth four dollars, or any dollar. I think it was an attempt to rip the movies from the Mexican, or Vin Diesel, but failed miserably to do that. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors that they could not find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable. The protagonist's Mexican accent was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Skip this.
