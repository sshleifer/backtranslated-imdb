If you have ever seen an eighty slasher, there is not much reason to see this. Originality is generally not one of the strong points of cinema slasher, and it is something that this film is seriously missing. There really is not much you can say about Pranks, so I'll do it quick. The film was one of 74 films included in the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason to see it. The plot follows a group of children staying behind in a dormitory at Christmas. As they are in a slasher, someone decides to start picking them up and this leads to one of the most dull mysteries ever seen in a horror movie. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre because, despite some bloody scenes, this movie would hardly corrupt or deprave anyone, and slashers more frivolous than that (Friday the 13th, for example) did not end up banned. But again, there are forbidden films that are a lot less bloody than this one (The Witch Coming from the Sea, for example). Anyway, completing the movie is the best thing, as if the audience did not really care who the aggressor is up to that point; is well done. Overall, this is a gloomy and somber slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss.
