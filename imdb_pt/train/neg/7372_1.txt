I'm so confused. I've been a big fan of Seagal for 25 years. I've seen all your movies, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this movie as "bizarre". Steven Seagal shares the script of writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a hard time believing that he would choose to voice his own voice in many of his lines with a thin, tearful voice of impostor. What I do not understand either is, if they had to dub some of their lines, why does their own voice appear in the rest of them? I hope Seagal will age like the rest of us. But the film Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same arrogance, confidence, bravado, charm and sex appeal that he so easily showed us in all his previous films. What scared me the most was his arrogant and confident attitude and his disdain that easily turns into that lovely smile. Where is this attitude and charm that gave you such a big star? I hope this movie is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to admit to the Seagal we all knew and loved if it was.
