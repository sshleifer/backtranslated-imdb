haha you have to just smile and smile if you really did all the way through this movie. As it says something about me, I think. The movie itself was created as a kind of psychological test, or as some kind of drug, to get you to a place where you've never been before. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece, Tractacus (sp), he said it was meaningless and was useless, but if you read it, after it was finished, it would take it to a new level, like a ladder, and then you could play get off work and see things with clarity and true understanding. This movie is the same as I think. <br /> <br /> As a film, it's arguably the worst movie I've seen in a long time in such a unique way. First of all, this is snipes. I loved watching this guy kick ass in several movies. and I suffered with some weak. however, although you know that the movie may be bad, you would never suspect it could be as bad as it really was. What's the fun of it? I mean this is snipes. You know it can be good, but it's going to be okay, right? smile. <br /> <br /> So this thing on all levels is pure boredom, pure lack of originality. the reference to the professional is dead and obvious, but so poorly done as to be comical. there is not a character in this movie that is interesting at the very least. and to make the whole thing more surreal, they have a soundtrack that sounds like parts of various types of Bourne identity movies, but it's not right. in fact, although it seems close to the background music of the action movie, it happens that this is done in a way that will impress you fantastically. <br /> <br /> Then all the scenes in the total tone of black, where honestly since the characters are so boring, you do not care what will happen, but regardless of that, after that happens and someone is dead , you say to yourself: should I see this? what else? such as over blind, nasty scenes blinking at a pace of strobe lights, for a period of time that is too long to bear. Of course we'll throw that in. when you're pushing and your eyes can not take it anymore, do some more of them in the dark where you really do not see what happened. and besides, let's face it, you do not care. You were bored from the start. <br /> <br /> So I went in and out a few times, but I got almost all of this movie. and becomes something that you can watch without something that involves your mind at any level, so it becomes something with which you can effectively focus, and start thinking about your life, where you are going, where you have been, the that we are people. <br /> <br /> And this is the real magic of this movie.
