This movie is just terrible !!!! Slow acting, slow to get to the point and wooden characters that should not be there. The best part was the Iron Maiden show singing in some video in a theater and that's it. the end was worth watching and waiting for but it was !! The characters in this movie let me sleep almost. Avoid this !!!
