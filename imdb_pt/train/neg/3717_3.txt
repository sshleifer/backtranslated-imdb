Chris Rock, apparently desperate for a starring vehicle that would cross his appeal to black and mainstream audiences, updates the 1978 hit comedy "Heaven Can Wait" with an urban agenda. He plays a fighting comedian involved in a car accident that has his soul removed very early from his body - hence his angels must find another body to put him, and can only reach a white businessman. Rewriting a movie as insipid and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" only shows that Rock's eye was at the box office (it was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of Hollywood players). Why not fight for something more sublime or memorable than a bizarre comedy of reincarnation culminating with the Evening at the Apollo? An excellent supporting cast (including the normally dependable King Regina, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy and the fantastic Frankie Faison) do their best, but Rock seems clumsy and unsure of himself. * 1/2 of ****
