I was forced to watch this whole series of movies as a kid and they told me they were REAL! Talk about child abuse. I would be less afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this ridicule and want to indoctrinate their children to believe in it. In addition to the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there is also poor performance, poor writing, and the "special effects" of ADB. They are just around terrible and terrible movies. Yes, believable (and creepy) to a child, but I can not imagine an adult buying that sort of thing. Although, I must say, I would be interested to see them today, as an adult. They may have a certain midnight / cult movie for them.
