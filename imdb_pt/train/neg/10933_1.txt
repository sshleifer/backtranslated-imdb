Trot all the stereotypes and misrepresentations you've heard about semi-devout Mormons, and you'll see that they all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a movie. Finally the luck of Kurt Hale has changed (thank God) and we hope it takes a while until we see any of his features in theaters. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was amateur (I think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes). The plot was flaccid and very bland. You really did not understand why someone did something. It was as if I had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give negative to this movie was because the scale did not let me.
