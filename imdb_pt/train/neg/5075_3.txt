The animation was good, the picture was good, though not entirely original, however, the story was too long, too confusing and dramatic. After about an hour I could not wait to get it over with. With so many characters who have nothing to contribute and plot elements that come out of nowhere or go nowhere this movie really was not a movie at all and would have been better as a short series or possibly two movies. If you like this kind of typical story, you might enjoy it, but frankly, I've been spoiled by far more creative stories that really have some message to tell. Go rent a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, you will have much more than that.
