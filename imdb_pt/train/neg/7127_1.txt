This movie was bad to say the least !!! The plethora of superb cars is unfortunate to have been shown in this movie LAME. It starts with a race from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min ... on a Ferrari F430. I made it in 1HR 50min in a small 4Cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie does not do these cars justice. Obviously, these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with @ 10 and 2 o'clock hands. I remember seeing on the news as Eddie Griffin dropped a $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo going 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... o director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest SELLOUT !!! He brings shame to his own race. I wonder how many people he happily pleased just to invade Hollywood. He participated in a film that portrays Asians in a negative and FALSE way. Asian women >> cheap money pluck whores. Asian men >> lose compulsive gamblers and thieves who win all the time. What the hell is all the fear about Asians? Why the need to portray them always in such a negative connotation? I'm so sick of the way Hollywood ALWAYS portrays Asians on a false and false pretext.
