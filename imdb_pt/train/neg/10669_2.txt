A set of uninteresting and unpleasant characters spins and clears the way through a fragile plot that may be interesting if you could care. This "twist and turn" I am talking about does not refer to the story (which contains all the suspense of a recipe for the tuna casserole), but to the director's inability to keep the characters' faces even remotely centered on the board. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very beautiful nostrils and left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the movie are the big names they convinced them to make. When you consider that this movie has never been released in theaters despite having a cast of stars, you may be inclined to think that something smells bad. <br /> <br /> And, in fact, it happens.
