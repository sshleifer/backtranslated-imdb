I'm afraid I did not really like this movie. In addition to some saving graces, there is nothing to write about. <br /> <br /> J-horror has grown in the last five to six years, but the films themselves have more than one account, repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a supernatural horror movie. The beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue, where a dead girl has her eyes sewn graphically, but then opens them. However, after that, it is quickly downhill for this movie. <br /> <br /> To be kind, I'll start with the things I like about "Gawi." On the plus side, the visuals are flashy and the movie looks great for the type. For those who like their horror movies, there are some well-executed murder scenes (no pun intended). We also get some good sequences / thriller sequences. <br /> <br /> However, there are also some drawbacks ... <br /> <br /> First, and my main complaint about this movie, is that the plot jumps and jumps forward and back in time with an alarming intensity. Usually, this is not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same, no matter the age, I got confused on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> The performances are fine, I find it difficult to say when you do not know the language), but it seems a bit harsh. And for a horror movie, I do not think it was scary enough. For a while I was really bored, actually. Being a fan of giallo films, I was expecting a lot of "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was quite disappointed.
