Suck case is murdering college students, can new teacher stop the madness? <br /> <br /> Believe me, you will not care. <br /> <br /> With a title like Splatter University, it would immediately gather that this film is not just art. But worse than Splatter University does not even qualify for the fun junk. Splatter U is so poorly done - the story is stupid, the characters are disposable, and the whole movie has no essence of imagination. Needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares. This asshole is not brave enough to play nudity (for the cheapest emotion of all). So, all around this infinitely flawed slasher offers nothing in terms of entertainment (not even cheap laughs) and only becomes a complete hassle. Bottom of the barrel staff - even slasher fans will want to think twice before seeing, let alone pay for that movie. <br /> <br /> BOMB out of ****
