Not that I want to be mean, but this movie really surprised me a lot. Throughout the movie, I was like ... er ... about what is this movie? I do not understand the animations. Probably this movie will only be suitable for who belongs to the 80's. During the movie, there is a group of people leaving. After the movie, many people said, "Is that it?" Frankly speaking, I can not believe this movie was awarded the Best Children's Film Award. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you do not do it. You'll regret it. I'm not kidding. You will find that you are just wasting your time and money going and seeing it.
