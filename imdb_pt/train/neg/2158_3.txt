I can see clearly now why Robin Hood failed quickly. The first episode is probably the worst thing the BBC has ever broadcast. The opening scenes were as intense, meaningful, and intelligent as two monkeys fighting, Robin Hood had no character, and sword fighting was laughable. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood kissing a cow dressed in makeup at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century? Nobody. The series may have improved dramatically since then, but this first episode quickly put people's hopes down, and is essentially a pile of cr * p. A great hero of England was dishonored. <br /> <br /> "Will you tolerate this?" I will not, of course, unless the BBC begins to understand what a wise investment is. 3/10
