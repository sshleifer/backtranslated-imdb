My roommates and I almost shortened our TV from the countless skewers we did while watching this hilarious 1970s piece of self-important pseudo-zen dreck. I had read about this camp a long time ago, and I scanned my late-night TV listings for YEARS in search of that indescribable shit. Several years ago, our local ABC affiliate was known for showing cool films for their weekend film (ie, "Frogs," "Night of the Lepus," etc). Then one day it happened: at 1.40 am on Saturday (more than 5 years ago) there it was! We had more than 15 people and the movie did not disappoint! <br /> <br /> See! Andy Griffith as the most stupid and unthreatening guy ever since Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! <br /> <br /> See! William Shatner sports a variety of things in his head that just vaguely resemble human hair (or anything organic for that matter). <br /> <br /> Listen! jaw droppingly inane 1970 psychobabble that makes "chicken soup for the soul" sound like BF Skinner <br /> <br /> Feel! The content that any decade was better than the 1970s. For those who are still reading ... the plot involves a bunch of middle-class middle-sized holes that decide to suck up their boss boss (Griffith ), joining him in a cross-country dessert run across California and Mexico. They all wear leather jackets, looking more like Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way they stop at a canteen, get drunk, smoke together (the view that Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smokes a joint is an image you will not forget), start a fight, try rape, and act like a bunch of jack offs middle class suburban. Although I have an excellent copy that I recorded on TV, I WOULD LIKE it to be released on video so that the whole world can enjoy its half-cooked goofiness.
