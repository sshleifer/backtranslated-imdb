Hey, <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen try doing about Leonard Cohen! This is filled with just enough Leonard to annoy the viewer who will be wondering why they are listening to all these other singers (some of them questionable) talk about themselves. Puleeze ... it seems they revive their notes in high school - who cares about you, and Leonard? Guess what people, if you "do something" worthy, maybe someone will make a documentary about you. I found it particularly insult the U2 members' parade as if this added credibility to this movie - NO. Leonard does not need Bono or the Edge talking about his spirituality. What would have been good would be for the filmmakers to incorporate part of their spirituality through the film. Wow, what a concept! I'll give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their cohen covers - the rest of the performances were boring and some were unbearable. <br /> <br /> Cohen fans, do not say I did not warn you!
