I do not like to use the word "horrible" to describe any film work for which a great deal of time, effort, talent, and money is spent on its creation, but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Jane Eyre's novel Charlotte BrontÃ« is a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> The script is lacking in finesse and power, all explained to the viewer in uncertain terms, leaving little to the imagination. The main actors are woefully miscast, clearly hired by their star names, and the musical score weak and bland. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with each other. She is like wet noodles, worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of some emotional involvement in what should be a frustrated passion story. And William Hurt acts the entire movie in a tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy. It is clear that the soft and insipid lyrics do not help any of these actors in their efforts to bring a little life to this film. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Fairfax of Joan Plowright is like a Disney creation that keeps popping up. to sweeten scenes in which she would be best left out. <br /> <br /> There is no mystery around the history of Rochester's first wife. The role of the so-called second wife, played as a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson, is an empty cipher. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a great actress, is completely lost as Jane's aunt, Mrs. Reed. She would have been better like Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as Jane's beloved teacher, evokes any genuine sympathy or credibility. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of 'Jane Eyre' after watching Robert Young for British television, made in 1997, starring Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. The vital, romantic, deeply moving version of Young is like a new explosive compared to Zefferelli's wet squib. <br /> <br /> I will now be interested to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, about which I read some very good things on this site. I am impressed by how many people liked the Yorkshire picture book by Zefferelli. <br /> <br /> About all I can say well about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored, moreover it is a complete failure.
