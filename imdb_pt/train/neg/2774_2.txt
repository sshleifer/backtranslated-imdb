This is just a bad movie. With what appeared to be a good budget, it had the potential to be so much better. Almost gone. With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like, say, Conan ... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just boring and it's hard to find something interesting in it. Maybe besides John Rhys-Davies dueling like those hero warriors or the Crouching Tiger mentioned earlier ... I'm really ashamed of poor John. He is after all a good actor and deserves much more. So, like you - so if you still have a chance, just watch something else.
