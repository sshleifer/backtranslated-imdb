Have I seen a more shockingly inept movie? I can think of much like this, but none that can overcome this. The cast are all horrible stereotypes loaded with flat dialogue. I'm ashamed of all the people involved in doing this. Each uses an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the perception that this project could easily nix his career. Even the many charms of Mrs. Diaz do not provide an adequate reason to be subject to this. Avoid, obviously, it's a movie style that Americans have not yet understood. Watch the final result if necessary, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DO NOT say I did not warn you ...
