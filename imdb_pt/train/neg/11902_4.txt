The hysterical thing about this film is that, according to the director, he has a hard time finding a distributor in the US, because most of those who saw him failed to reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of Christianity and American anguish. The thought of someone seeing this as a religious movie anyway is laughable. <br /> <br /> Why does a minister on a mission pray to the homeless or want someone "Godspeed" to make him a "Christian" movie? One can interpret that it is actually mockery of religion in the "Land of Abundance" with all its material excess, the best that an organized mission can do is deliver a bowl of soup and a Bible verse. Plenty of unhappy or overwhelmed perhaps? Many useless missions homeless? What about many veteran psychopaths in Vietnam? As a delirious survivor of the "pink" agent, are we thinking that America is a "land of plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have many psychiatric patients? Certainly we do not have a lot of people worried about Palestine politics based on the phone conversation of the main characters of the film. Of course, if you worked in a German homeless shelter, the unhappy would be far more concerned about peace in a distant land than with their personal survival, for the world knows how Europe is the "Continent of Abundance" when it comes to of sophistication. <br /> <br /> Actually I agreed with the title at the end, since the United States is the "Land of Abundance" and in this particular case, it refers to the abundance of poor scripts, amateur performances and impartially directed films. Life is very short and one, even an American, does not have "much" time to lose watching this play.
