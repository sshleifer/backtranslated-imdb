First, this movie is not a "thriller." Nor is it "thrilling, tense." It may have been based on the script, but the slow pace of the steering hinders entry. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we only have a * like * ingenious feeling after the image is gone. This leaves us with more than two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that do not catch the viewer, and scenes of "cunning foxes" that inject a little more open intelligence. <br /> <br /> I wish this was the fast-paced thriller the box promised. It would have been an excellent movie. Instead, Spike Lee moved on to the end.
