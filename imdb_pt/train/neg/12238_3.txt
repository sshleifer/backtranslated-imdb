A concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two icons together, but ... Rudolph's shiny nose did not require the "explanation" offered in this film - much like The Force in the movies Star Wars did not need the explanation of "medichlorians in the bloodstream". But mostly, the movie made me cold because of Winterbolt's complicated plot to destroy Santa. He has the power to put suggestions in people's minds, so why does he do things so indirectly? Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to melt the Frosty family ... Pinky's exaggerated comedic entanglements and brain and "Dr. Doofenshmirtz" by Phineas and Ferb (who are made that way on purpose and play to laugh ) seem simple and direct compared to those of Winterbolt, which we should take a little seriously. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly funny (and funny) moment when a character throws his two guns at the bad guy, like boomerangs. I understand if they do not want to have guns being filmed in a family movie, but then why the guns in the first place?
