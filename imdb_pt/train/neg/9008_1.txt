There have been many unfamiliar movies or negative reviews that I really liked. This was not one of them. <br /> <br /> It was over-end and I used camera techniques that made me feel like I was watching a novel. It was ridiculously predictable and took most of the movie to go, then let you ask "is this?". Since I decided not to take the film very seriously and watch it from a purely superficial point of view, it has become more enjoyable. This is a movie that would have ended up on the MST3000 if it was still on.
