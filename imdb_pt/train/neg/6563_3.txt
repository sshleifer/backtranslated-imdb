Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up at the South Pole while trying to vacation in Florida. Where he finds a little penquin, which he tries to save from an Eskimo. This short tries and the penquin is lovely, but in the end it is a little light in the laugh department. The Eskimo is not really very good for Bugs and I've only seen much better Bugs Bunny cartoons frankly, even other shorts when he's paired with other unknown antagonists. So I can not in good conscience recommend this. However, it is good to see it in its uncut form. This cartoon is on Disc 3 of the "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My Note: C
