Good sadness I can not even begin to describe how poor this movie is. Do not get me wrong, I was not expecting too much to start. Let's face it, a PG-13 slasher movie is pre-intended to be missing the ummm ... hacking, so no one should be surprised by the lack of blood. But it was the level of incompetence and clich√© on display in every other aspect of this movie is what really surprised me. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is simply so completely useless that you find yourself cheering for the bad guy. And here's a change to the books ... SHE NEVER CHANGE - thus breaking the fundamental rule of basic screenwriting - character development. If you think that by the end of this movie the poor girl will turn around and finally kick some asses, then think again. <br /> <br /> In addition, we have the chance to be the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer who has ever graced the genre. I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has villains more frightening than this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could be left to fill 2 hours of time on the screen? <br /> <br /> Lockers, that's it. <br /> <br /> Many and many closets: large closets, small cabinets, mirrored cabinets, closets for Narnia, so many damn closets that you will not want to wear for another year. In fact, this movie should have been called "CLOSET," and had a picture of a big, scary hanger in the DVD case. In the back we could have a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote from Roger and Ebert - something to the extent that: "what the f * @! We just wasted our time watching!"
