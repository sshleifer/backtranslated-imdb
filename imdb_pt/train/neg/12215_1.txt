On what I can say was a steal of my time I was taken to see this movie and I must say what a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is not convincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer. The plot is fine to say the least, the Cantonese dialogue is not funny. Watch this movie at your own risk. <br /> <br /> David Tang of Shanghai Tang should be behind the film for the little or no recipe this movie will generate. The banal plot tries to compete with other rom-coms out there, and just mingles with the scenery. It was like watching paint dry. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was a total waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on youtube.
