Anyone familiar with my comments in the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a moody bastard from time to time. There are many films I do not like and that, for some unfathomable reason, I felt the desire to review. However, if someone out there is curious to know the name of the worst movie I have ever seen, look no further than Transylvania 6-5000. No doubt this takes the title of all time no. A horrible movie. I can not believe I actually did this from the beginning of this clunker to the end! <br /> <br /> It's clearly to capture the flavor of Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, but where this movie was funny in horror movie traditions, this is a desperately tense and misguided attempt to tease laughter from embarrassingly weak material . Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr are ashamed to be here as a couple of journalists in modern Transylvania (they may have realized from the outset that they were doomed to failure). During their research, they are faced with all the major monsters of past horror favorites such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can face this movie to the end may pray that a stake be directed through his heart to relieve them of the agony of boredom. It marks a career low for all involved and proves that when comedy fails on a grand scale, it results in an awfully awful entertainment.
