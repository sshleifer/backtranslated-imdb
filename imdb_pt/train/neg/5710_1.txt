Well, it looked good on the part, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborate again, this time in a mix of assault movie, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But, oh dear, this is for Indiana Jones what Speed ​​2 is for Speed. A reasonable cast (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights a childish script and loses it badly. But these Freemasons are not their usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and no one mentions 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.) I do not think I've revealed any spoilers because there are none. There's practically no suspense, no surprises and no climax - it just stops. The National Treasury targets Dan Brown, but reaches the same intellectual level as a Scooby Doo episode without humor.
