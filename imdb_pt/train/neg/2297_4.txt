I call the 700 Club from time to time and only agree with some of the statements made - I am one of the many believers who is considered liberal by most Christians and conservative by most non-Christians. I vote in my mind, and usually is not a representative. or dem. "I do not believe the 700 Club tells people what to believe in, but that this represents many older Christians who have grown up in very conservative contexts. I think a lot of people misunderstand what's being said at club 700. This makes me confused by hearing the name calling any direction. I think 700 clubs really love Jesus, but they're so busy trying to make people vote conservatively that they forgot to show love to certain people and promote peace as Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus based on ignorant people who believe in him and we will not be so ignorant of our comments about them. Why are people so bad for each other?
