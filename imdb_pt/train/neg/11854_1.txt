For the life of me I can not understand the good reviews about this piece of crap. It was useless. Matthew Modine was horribly miscast as a main ladies man. Gina Gershon, well, others have said that, but I will reiterate, why the stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And her acting was bad. I do not know if it was thrown by the accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And the girl Modine was in love with, suddenly she's pushing half a lettuce head into her mouth and acting silly? Where did that come from? I think we should feel sorry for her when we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to fall apart, but frankly, I could care less about any of these people.
