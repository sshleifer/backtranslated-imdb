Very poor Firestarter clone that looks more like a bad TV movie than a bad movie. How disappointing is this coming from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Government contractors make a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The boy born to the couple is constantly experiencing a 100-degree fever, and when he is an adult, people in his life begin to spontaneously combust. He tries to figure out why. <br /> <br /> The people on fire are well made, but when they get to the point where they are well made in another sense, they are obviously changed to mannequins. When jets of fire come out of the characters' arms, it looks silly rather than alarmed the way it should. Also ridiculous is the fire that evidently travels over phone lines and explodes into huge jets from the receiver's headset. How should this happen, exactly? <br /> <br /> Another thing that seemed silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his deceased parents. Later, we see exactly the same pictures of these visions in home movies.
