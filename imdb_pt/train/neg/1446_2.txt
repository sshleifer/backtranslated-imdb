The film is an extra long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the spirit of the original adventure. The rather horribly American Patrick Swayze is cast as the British hero Allan Quatermain, despite the obviousness of his nationality. <br /> <br /> The film continues throughout the "Hollywood-ise" story, changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold. The film can be predicted everywhere, even for those unfamiliar with the story and is plagued by some extremely acting and terribly disappointing fighting sequences. <br /> <br /> In all, a terrible addition to the already very poor collection of films based on the legend of the Mines of King Soloman and Allan Quatermain.
