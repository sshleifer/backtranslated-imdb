Probably one of the bloodiest movies ever, misrepresented and poorly written. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT Five students getting back on holiday closing a dorm, but someone has designs on them and begins to kill them on the one hand, the prime suspect is the creepy gardener John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll , or it could be one of five characters. It's not that bad so far from Daphne Zungia who dies very quickly and should have been the main heroine, and the rest pretty annoying, although Laura Lapinski, the main heroine, sometimes has its charm and you'll mourn for her in the end. <br /> <br /> THE KILLS can not I really see why they banished it, the killings seem fake most of the time, a guy has his hand cut in half at the beginning, which looks really fake, but the others are pretty unpleasant as a girl gets her head hit by a live boiled car and another burned alive. <br /> <br /> It's not really a big I've been much better
