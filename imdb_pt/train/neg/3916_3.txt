We all know that a movie never does justice to the book, but that's exceptional. Important characters were cut, Blanca and Alba were essentially mixed to the same character, most of the subplots and main elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was greatly underestimated, making her seem a far more superficial character than I knew in the book. In the book, we learned more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people, which in turn was a key element in the family's life. In the movie she was no more than a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Third-third-by the way, it is the son and thus comes after Segundo-second) and its connections with that between Esteban and his grandson of Pancha Garc√≠a (not son, that he also did recognize ) is cut in half and its importance underestimated. <br /> <br /> One of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is practically stripped: this is called "The House of Spirits". Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family should revolve around the "big house on the corner", a line stated so many times in the novel. The house is fundamental to the story, but the film unfairly relegates it to a simple backdrop. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book before, I would never have imagined such a shallow film and be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.
