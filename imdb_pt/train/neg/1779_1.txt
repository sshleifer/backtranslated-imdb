It could have been a wonderful story based on the ancient races of cat-people, but it was not. <br /> <br /> This work could have been just that; wonderful and full of mythological references that kept my fascination fed. The protagonists (Charles Brady, played by Brian Krause, and his mother, Mary, played by Alice Krige) were shallow, devoid of personality depth and hardly amiable or drawn. Not even MÃ¤dchen Amick's character (who played Tanya Robertson) fits that description. <br /> <br /> However, as I have said many times, when you adapt a Stephen King novel for TV, you simply must take into account the fact that your books are not written for TV and your screenplay . the talent unfortunately does not have the fire and depth it exhibits as a novelist. <br /> <br /> This is another failed attempt to pick up the magic of Stephen King's writing, be it from his novels or from an original script. To simply cut and paste your work on the small screen. Your novels are completely bastardized in the process and everything you end up creating is a good movie; nothing less, but certainly nothing more. Your scripts are unpredictable. Unfortunately, this translation of the script was a lack. <br /> <br /> Sorry, sorry, sorry movie. <br /> <br /> This movie earns 1.0 / 10 from ... <br /> The Demon :.
