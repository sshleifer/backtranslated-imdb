Our teacher showed us this movie in the first grade. I have not seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this sound like a first grade movie to you? I think not. I was so horrified by this movie that I barely saw it. It was mostly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting the little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was terrified of this movie. Nowadays, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe little kids should not see this movie, even being PG. Be aware of the possible results of showing this to children. I do not even remember what it once was enough!
