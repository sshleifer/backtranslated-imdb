Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and co-wrote the screenplay for the Aronofsky movie. This film was successful on all levels, delivering an intimate and impartial portrayal of the horrors of the characters' lives and the vices that destroyed them. "Last Exit To Brooklyn" still has the addiction and multiple characters living sad lives, but they hardly do the same justice that Aronofsky did. <br /> <br /> The movie looks ridiculously anti-gay at times. Especially when in the movie homosexuality equals death. A gay character is stoned, thrown into the sky by a car at high speed and falls on the sidewalk. Another is crucified and still more are simply beaten. Another exaggerated amount of shock, which may have been really convincing if done right, are scenes of unionized workers who literally struggle against breakdowns. Who would have thought a drama about Brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck blasts? <br /> <br /> The director, Uli Edel, has a skill level like that of a TV director, but he is far below the actual cut. movies. The film is clumsy and does not seem to be content with a genre. Lake gets a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and Baldwin seems to know how to sound stupid in his equally scarce part. And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our leader, a disgusting whore named Tralala (Believe it or not, I'm not joking). His performance is not good at all, and his character's fate is dirty to say the least. Inappropriate use of color and composition makes it look cheaper than it is, and also takes the "real" edge out of the most provocative bits. Failure.
