First lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - only "style" does not sell. I think Tashan when translated will mean style. Second, if you are determined to sell style, this does not spare you from having a decent story. Tashan has a story that could have sufficed for a better director. But it is not slippery. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at different points in history. But this setting is not used correctly. There could have been a better combination and correspondence of their narratives. The sequences of actions are from the seventies. <br /> <br /> The choreography of the movie is horrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just slept through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar got a good score but does not belong to this movie. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is not the cool music of Hinglish (Dil Dance Maare) not in Anil Kapoor when he's crazy English? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the movie. But he's in his stereotyped self. You will not mind losing this movie.
