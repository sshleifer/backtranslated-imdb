Lipstick is another brilliant cinematic failure. I'm trying to think of a good thing I could say about the movie, and I'm having trouble creating something. I think the red dress Margaux Hemingway was wearing at the end of the movie. Breakfast was the best part. The writing and the script were not the worst I've ever encountered, but it could have been a lot better. Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to see.The sets were very bright and good to look at. The cast was fine. I felt that Anne Bancroft's character was the only viable character in the entire film. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this one.
