I understood that the character Diehl must be a microcosm of America itself - see Arab terrorists under every rock, only to find out in the end that it is their own actions all the time that have led them to this siege state and really if they practice goodwill for all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops. Sorry for Wim, you have made incredible films in the past that remain politically neutral and for good reason, polemics are your weak point and weaken this well-done film, amazingly filmed, with characters, dialogues and absurd plots. Best of luck in your next movie. Another thing that ripped off my crank was the point of the homeless part of LA being there for starvation reasons, these people did not have enough to eat. Truly these people are not eating royally, but the real hunger of these people is a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. They need self-respect, self-esteem, dignity that you can not give a man. Yes, these people are hungry and if they need to, they are available. Least the center of hunger in America, I would say it is more the center of alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Coping with hunger, despite a noble effort, is to help the band with a more deeply systematic and ancient human problem of homelessness. Bill Diehl was good, and Michelle Williams was cute as the young soul (cliche) ever.
