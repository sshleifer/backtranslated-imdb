Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just do not see why you should waste money on a movie that you could shoot with your father's camera. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a MOVIE, not a lot of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDV tapes. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate this so much because the guy at the network said it was great, and it was not. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, it has the stupidest plot of all time, the most unrealistic characters of all time, and the really, really, PIROVIO worse in movie history. Even Tom Savini can not save it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a complete waste of time.
