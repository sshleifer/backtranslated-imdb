I went to see this movie yesterday and although I did not have high hopes for this movie, I was still bitterly disappointed! I really can not believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was so bad !!! The plot was shameful and the acting was terrible (despite having great names like Uma Thurman). This movie depended heavily on its special effects ... but they personally had no effect on me. I honestly wished Id never watch and I strongly warned everyone not to see this movie. It is a total waste of money and you will only end up being disappointed later. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just do not go and see this movie ... You will live to regret lol!
