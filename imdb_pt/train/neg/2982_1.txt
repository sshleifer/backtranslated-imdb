Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** Few movies are "so bad they are good", and Zombie 3 is not bad, it's unfortunate, unforgivable bad of so many ways that a completely new language may be necessary just to describe them all. <br /> <br /> More than that, it is a film credited to Lucius Fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherence, sense or reason. However, we can not blame Fulci as he was not really directed by him, but by Bruno Mattei, who does not even have the sense of Fulci's style to help carry the film. Mattei seems to have brought little to the film, but disconcerting unfitness. So I'm embarrassed to say how much I enjoyed every useless minute of Zombie 3. It has no redeeming features - in a genre known for lean characters, weak history and lack of ability to make movies, Zombie 3 pushes the boat out, but doing so is even funnier than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> The "action" begins when the "Death 1" gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in flight. Who is the thief, why he stole it, and why the US military thought creating cannibal legions of the undead would be a good idea? All these questions and more will not be answered in Zombie 3 .... After hiding in a hotel, the infected thief drives all the green plastecina that grows on his face before being tracked. by the army who somehow foolishly decides that the best way to get rid of his corpse will be to burn it by sending "Death 1" into the atmosphere, resulting in ... birds zombies! Who then attack people and turn them into zombie people !!! (If zombies are cannibals, why do not zombie birds attack other birds?) Next, we find our "heroes," a trio of excited soldiers and a bunch of girls. There are a couple of other guys with them too, but they are not important - NOBODY is important here. You will be hard pressed to remember someone's face, let alone their name or find a reason to care about them. They end up hiding in the same hotel as the thief ("a week ago, this place was full of life, now it's full of flies!"), But there's no escape from the undead. <br /> <br /> point you will be completely sucked or you will have turned the damn thing. The script is so terrifying that even the best acting in the world can not save it, so it's best that they have some of the worst - and not just the human characters, the zombie who is performing here is one of the lowest of all time . There is no consistency in the way zombies behave - some confusion in the honorable style of time, others engage in fights or attack with axes, not to mention zombies that are still able to speak (a trick that gives the movie is HORRIFYING THE END OF THE TWIST). They die from chest shots (instead of the head) and are even eliminated by a good left hook. How can you punch a zombie ??? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on the badly done action of the 1980s often makes it resemble an episode of V ... <br /> <br /> The zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, apparently waiting for hours on ridiculous places. The sap will pass and you will have the scare of your life. They hide in shrubs, garages, huts, roofs, in the water and even under pregnant women. At one point, a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat her? Not! To push her into the water, those zombies and her crazy sense of humor! <br /> <br /> But there's a lot of horrible things. Members are hacked, wounds squeeze green pus, and there is a lot in the way of eating meat and people are left with sunken faces. There is nothing to match the original piercing of the eyes, but if your makeup effects are bad you will not be left. All this and I did not even mention the horrible music, the inexplicable flying zombie head, the scientist whose acting really succeeds highlight how REALLY bad, or the final chilling ... In an ingenious twist on the original radio station being invaded by zombies, Zombie 3 gives us a real zombie DJ !! "He went to their side!" the scream of our hero escaping, before promising to continue fighting the undead in a sequel that unfortunately never came. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 is crap - it would not be a loss to the world if all the letters were destroyed and all records of its existence erased, but somehow I feel that my life is richer by having it visa. <br /> <br /> I said richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
