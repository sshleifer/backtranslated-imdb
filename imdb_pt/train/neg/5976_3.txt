The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than expensive. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. Jersey girl goes to New York to become a songwriter. And after the initial frustration of being unlucky, he hears some girls celebrating the $ 300 they made last night. She auditions at the bar where they work and surprises! The place is completely full of "two-year-olds" exploding to see dancing girls. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are friendly, especially Cammie (the part "fashion coordinator" was cute) and security, but let's face it, the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning . Violet and her father looked very ridiculous as they related during the film. And check out Violet playing too much on the keyboard with the break dancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time I could think of how the production could be so terrible? For a brief moment with this movie, Hollywood could stand and show a new record without much public outcry without saying, "You've been warned!" Instead, it looks like COYOTE UGLY intends to try to kiss all the major rear lines in the world. Advertising babes in a bar but showing a thin paper "chase your dream" story disappointed every male teenager you targeted! <br /> <br /> And finally, the music. There was absolutely no break from the music I found in this movie, especially when it was needed (the hospital scene). Each scene looked like a short video clip that you just wish it would stop until the bar opened. But the climax was a final laugh: a song from the 80's that you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on stage and play with Violet. Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi would jump out with long hair and jelly as well! <br /> <br /> In addition to some really smart cameras working with the coyote girls while dancing (especially the wet scene), and a few cute cliches, COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely ashamed of. If you watched or did, it seemed like nothing but time-killing. Or waste, depending on how you look at it.
