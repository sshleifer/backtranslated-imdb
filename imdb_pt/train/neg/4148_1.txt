I got this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was getting into. <br /> <br /> I started the film and was soon pulled into a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> I finally know what the hell is like. It's this movie. To Eternity. This movie is worthless. It did not even have a plot. There were things going on in every scene, but no general explanation of why something happened. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, I suggest you line the nearest blender with oil and try to put as many bullets in it as you want. can. You will find that the result will be much more enjoyable than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even watch. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you watch, it means they win.
