Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing "Apocalypse Now," which made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie? <br /> <br /> You must wonder what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" was thinking about when he made this film flabby. This gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle, playing a woman who travels back in time and manages to rebuild her teenage years knowing all the things adult life has taught her, and Turner, the soldier she is, does what she can with more this movie could not be saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> It has no style, and, given its director, one would expect that even if it had nothing else, it would have it. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
