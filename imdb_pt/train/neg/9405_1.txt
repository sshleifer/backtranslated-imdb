I just watched it on TV and what can I say, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm ashamed to be from Melbourne where the movie was made. Devilish action, amateur makeup effects and a very bad soundtrack. As for the plot, well, that's even more stupid! Some of the scenes just left me stunned about how bad it was. There is a reason why they put these types of movies on TV late at night - because they are rubbish! Avoid at all costs.
