I only saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the comments on this site. Those who give more than one star should be fanatical about Buffy. Well, I'm a Buffy fan of the first order, but I know crap when I see that. At all levels, this movie is terrible. Technically, most of the time you do not know where you are in this movie, even inside a scene, it skips the POV like crazy for no reason. No logic in cinematographic terms. Emotionally it is heartbreaking for love and tries to be a psychological thriller when it is just confusing. Throwing nasty-looking necks at your movie is an inexpensive way to convey "atmosphere." I was out of patience with this long before the last act, but I was having a lot of fun with my friends making MST3K riffs to turn it off. Since leaving Buffy, SMG had two hit movies, if even listing "Scooby Doo" on their resume could count. Gellar is a good actress, but she (or her agent) certainly can not find a vehicle for her. And Mr. Shepard, if you're having trouble paying off your mortgage, I'll send you a few dollars if you promise not to show up in a movie like this again! (In addition, Patsy Cline's estate must sue for defamation!)
