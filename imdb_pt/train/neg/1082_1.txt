I think I've seen all the Grisham movies now and generally they're all very poor except for The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad it's unbelievable <br /> <br /> SPOILERISH WARNING <br /> /> It's one of those films in which the character does the irrational things that no one would do. He's a lawyer for God's sake. Because when his children disappear, he does not call the police. Oh yeah, it's because all cops hate lawyers, so they just ignore him and let him get attacked. <br /> <br /> When he is arrested for murder, they simply let him go free, he would be locked up in a cell. awaiting bail hearing. <br /> <br /> Why would you drag your children to the other side of the country when you could easily protect them at home? <br /> <br /> The police do not bother trying to find a mental patient who escaped, they do not bother to interview their daughter. <br /> <br /> As for the ridiculous end? <br /> <br /> In short, silly, very unreal and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
