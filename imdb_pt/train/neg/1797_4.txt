This film has a very difficult premise to swallow, even by the standards of that genre. We are asked to accept not only that a disc played backwards can bring a dead man back to life but that the record also contains hidden messages SPECIFICALLY directed to a child when the singer had no connection with the boy when he was alive, and of course there is no way to know in whose hands the record would end. Anyway, the movie is fun for a while, but eventually foolishness and lack of purpose reign supreme. If they were really trying to create a new terror icon like Freddy, they were a long way off: the villain here has no personality, motivation and variety. (* 1/2)
