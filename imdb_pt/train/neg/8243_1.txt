The word in the summary sums it up;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home, when they stop at a store for instructions, they hit a parked car breaking a beacon, jump the scene just to stay in distress, but suddenly they see a beacon coming after them (ooooh). From outside, everything is screaming, crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost because of a beacon;), well, the cry and cry practically stays throughout the film (much boring) The movie is filmed, with a cheap camera trying to make it look "real" or "shocking" I guess, it's just embarrassing and useless though. Lacking something better to compare with, "Blair witch style". <br /> <br /> The screams and crying for pretty much the whole movie with low quality sound was over annoying, you literally have a headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but this does not it was scary, just a painful piece of film.
