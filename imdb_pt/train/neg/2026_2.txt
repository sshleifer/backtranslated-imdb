There was such a hype about a game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially immediately following Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So of course everyone had to tune in to see what all the fuss was about the new game show. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein so stoically and nasally says, "wooww." <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about this show was the fact that you knew it would end. Sitting for an entire hour was like going to the dentist ... you find yourself looking at the clock at 10-minute intervals, only to find that only a minute has passed (but it seemed like forever) since you finally looked at the clock. So why did not I change the channel? Well, probably for the same reason most other people do not ... out of sheer optimism. I mean, no one really * wants * to think that a show with Bill Shatner could really be that bad. Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought this was the kind of vehicle that shows the talents of William Shatner. My main complaint was that the set was so dark. Watching me depressed me. You still wanted to get a little excited, but there was nothing to be had. There was not enough light on the set to feel the energy of the audience (you could not even see it). <br /> <br /> Dear Network: People do not watch gaming programs to cure their insomnia. ... they watch games shows to be excited and have a good time. Please do us a favor and lose it in the safe.
