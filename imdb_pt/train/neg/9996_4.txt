Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson are definite improvements, "Airport '77" is not much better than "Airport 1975": submerged commercial and slippery (this time literally) a decent cast. Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a crowded aircraft that is kidnapped by art thieves and crashes into the sea (all advertising said it was near the Bermuda Triangle, but there is no mention of it in the film itself). When rescue ships come to take the plane out of the water, we see all their cranes falling (somewhat blindly) into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh (imagining the cranes obstructing the plane, passengers, and soggy script). NBC used to broadcast what appeared to be the "director's cut," with at least an hour of extra scenes - mostly flashbacks - injected into the process with all the subtlety of an episode of "Gilligan's Island." The most exciting moment is the plane crash, and some of the players have a little fun: Lee Grant is a nasty drunk, Brenda Vaccaro a flight attendant, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting old men. Yet personality clashes and excruciating military details end up ripping someone's patience. ** in ****
