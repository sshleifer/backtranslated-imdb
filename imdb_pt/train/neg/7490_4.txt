This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and lackluster. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as the perfect fair and only promoter (not to mention executive producer), the film never showed any of the defense councils or tried to challenge the public with a meaningful debate about how a country could be led by a path so terrible. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody wants to defend the Nazi's point of view, but that was the point of the Nuremberg trails! Four hours simply by attacking the Nazis ... come on! This has already been done! <br /> <br /> I really think Alec Baldwin should be limited to being Kim Bassinger's husband. Soon after the film ended, TNT showed the 1959 film Trail at Nuremberg. . This movie is far superior.
