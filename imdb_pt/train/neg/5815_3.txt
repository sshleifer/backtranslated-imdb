I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press I received, but after seeing it I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally bland movie mixed with a kind of disturbing family reality of Todd Solondz without Todd's kind of humor. The story drags on and each scene is worse than the previous one. Maybe I missed the point, but if this movie is an example of every girl's growth experience, I'm happy to be a man.
