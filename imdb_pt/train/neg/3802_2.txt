I know actors like to try different types of movies - hey, no one wants to do typecast - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (Happy Birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should know better than that. "Angels in Outfield" is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day. Do I really need to tell you how it ends? The film is just plain escapism (examples of high escapism are the various science fiction films of the 1950s). If these films had any political tone - or at least give us a new look at life - then they would be fine; this is just useless. Much closer to the devilish than to the angelic. Also starring Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect they do not wish to emphasize this on their resumes.
