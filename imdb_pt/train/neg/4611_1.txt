I think it's Jack's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer he is, but empathy has a price like all things - when he's surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it. He is a joke as a mafioso (also because the part does not match him at all, he is so extroverted) and only herding avoids making a fool of it. Kathleen Turner had a career too long for being tall and blonde because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes when she opens her eyes that she is convinced she is soooo sexy and Anjelica Huston is the same (granted interesting) in everything, as did Robert Loggia. <br /> <br /> The film is a bad sketch (and this will be the only mention of the script they call the script) of a gangster movie, with a cast that was probably only interested in getting to the after-party more (they certainly brought together the party elite in this). What, they filmed in 1 day? Because that would be the only explanation.
