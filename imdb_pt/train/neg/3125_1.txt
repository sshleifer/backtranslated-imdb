Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a lonely madman who lives in the Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend: "Do not try to medicate me, doctor! I'm disgustingly healthy!" He invites his nephews and nieces to his home and warns them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by "shrinking the brain" (?) *** SPOILERS *** * Morteval / Karloff ends up dying and murderous "toys" (created by his dead brother) begin to kill the relatives. A mini cannon fires real bullets at a guy's face, a life-size knight in armor attacks with an ax, and a dancing sheikh stabs people with a knife. A guy being strangled makes some faces hilarious. In the end, Julissa and her boyfriend discover that Karloff is still alive and hiding in the dungeon, where steel gates seal the room. He plays the organ's recurring theme song (a sort of death rattle used for the killings), the brother's spirit begins to speak ("The whole house will go with me!") And the mansion is caught in flames. <br /> <br /> This pointless mess is very dark, boring and stupid dialogue never fits with the lips.
