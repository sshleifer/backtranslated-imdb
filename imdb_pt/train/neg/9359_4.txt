This movie is probably pro-Muslim. <br /> <br /> Why do I write this? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film, he is apparently a Muslim because of his use of head, which he kept his amulet and his clothes in general. He has a six-year-old son who wears the same hat and is therefore probably a Muslim, although the mother is a Christian. The main character thus chooses, it seems, to be a Muslim and his son becomes a Muslim. None of the other main male characters, who are Christians, seem to raise a child. There are more Muslims in the world than this movie in the end, it seems, so.
