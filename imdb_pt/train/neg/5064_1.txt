I can not believe they made this movie. Completely unnecessary. The first movie was good. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. This movie looks like a novel. The writing is so bad, it's totally simple. The jokes do not appear, the performance is flat, it is shot like a soap, it has no direction. The first movie had a good emotional spine behind it. Each character had a small bow. It was very simple, but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that movie. But this time, there is no cohesive story line. The characters are boring stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays the son of Axel Daeseleire is very well chosen. This was the only moment of creative success in this film. I heard they've already recorded a second TV series as a continuation of 'Team Spirit 2', but, please God, do not let them do a third edition ...
