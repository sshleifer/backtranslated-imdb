This is the worst movie I've seen since "I Know Who Killed Me" with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you decide to go and see it. Hey, Tim Burton, I used to be a huge fan of yours ... have you ever filmed this movie? I mean, seriously, what the f # # k? <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, here is the story in a nutshell ... Nine wakes up, he does things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert! At the end of the movie ... it rains. I think a part of my soul died while watching this movie.
