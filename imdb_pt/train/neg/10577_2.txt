Some of the filmmakers who participated in this series have made some really good movies, but certainly do not show much skill with this series. Particularly the writing. OK, the first season was a little better, but these new episodes are creating just stink. I'm a big fan of horror and, in my opinion, the vast majority of these episodes is total crap. Nothing new or genuinely interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just a typical Hollywood crap, uninteresting, childish, ill-conceived and, in some cases, ridiculous. Much like Tales from the Crypt, the only good thing this series has offered is great nudity! Other then this series blows strong. Sometimes I get the impression that they hired a group of eighth graders to write the episodes. Maybe they did.
