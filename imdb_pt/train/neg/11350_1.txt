Since there is 3D technology (I think in 1950) there was animation for her. I specifically remember a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale. I do not remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald worked in a circus, was feeding an elephant peanut and Chip and Dale were stealing the peanuts. This was done to watch in 3D probably in the 1960s. If you watched Meet the Robinsons in 3d in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of its origin. There are probably about 100 cartoons made specifically for viewing through 3D glasses. This statement was a bad move because it is not difficult to prove that they are wrong. Also, this sounds like a bad movie.
