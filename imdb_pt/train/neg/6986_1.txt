I can not understand Al Pacino. I see him at Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I've been watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. So I see him in Two for the Money, Any Given Sunday and Revolution, and I wonder what the guy is thinking. <br /> <br /> I stumbled into Revolution a few nights ago, and thought about investing the next two. hours on this. Here's a flash of news: Do you want the prisoners to talk? Forcing them to watch this over and over ... they'll confess anything. <br /> <br /> I will not remake the plot since there is no coherent plot, but it happens during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved but gets involved. While he has no money, has no education and dresses like a caveman, a hottie Natasha Kinski falls for him for no apparent reason, since they have only two minutes of dialogue together. <br /> Frankly, if "Al Smith" starred in this film, instead of "Al Pacino," it would have ruined his career. The script was awful, but Pacino's unmotivated performance and obvious false accent made it even worse. The role of Donald Sutherland was laughable. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character but has 5 lines in the film. Actually, nobody talks much about this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the film's most laughable premises is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this unusual ability to continually find themselves on the battlefield. It's like all Northeast is a Starbucks. "Hey, it's funny to see you here again, on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away ... See you in a few months." <br /> <br /> I'm forced to give this star by IMDb, since there's nothing here for a negative score.
