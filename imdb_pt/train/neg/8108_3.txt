After reading the book, which meant so much to me, the film did not give me any of the feelings the book conveyed. It makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book because he managed to turn it into something else. Either this or it is simply bad. More importantly, where is the lightness? From the first scene, the music stifles most of the dialogue and feeling, and it continues until the end of the film. I think the creators thought that by listening to music during the movie it would make the story seem light - but they have completely failed here. Instead, music manages to give everything the movie feels, in a way that dramatizes the events so that we stay in them, so that everything really seems heavy. <br /> <br /> Another example of how this adaptation fails is by beautifying the story line, making it more dramatic. In the film, we see Franz passing by Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this casual encounter / passage, which certainly did not happen in the book, gives Tomas's story more meaning than it clarifies. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has changed, but for the worse, however, this may have been done because the book simply does not become well into a movie, such is the style of Kundera. This makes us wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with the book And experience the movie in mind instead of just writing about the movie. A movie that is as long as it is uncompelling. For those who have not yet read the book, I recommend only reading this. For those who have it, I have to say that you're just wasting your time and probably end up writing similar warnings here.
