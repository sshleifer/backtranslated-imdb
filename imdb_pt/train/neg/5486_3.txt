First of all, this movie begins with a really stupid note: a 10 year old girl playing in a moving vehicle decides it would be funny to cover her mother's eyes with her hands and cause a horrible accident kills her mother ... . duh .... I'm sorry, there's positively none of 10 years I dumb. The rest of the movie does not look much better. After the mother's death by the most idiotic 10-year-old on the planet, the father moves the family to Genoa, Italy, where he will teach at a local university, but here is the decisive argument: he does not say anything. word of the Italian! Then the girl has "visions" of the mother (which she killed), and often subsequent night terrors that always end up by the father holding and pampering her. So we are forced to see this family get lost and find and then embrace and then cry and lose and then find (followed, of course, more hugs and crying) to the point that I'm really craving some kind of natural disaster to just clear all these insipid and ignorant people on the planet. Do not get me wrong, because I love indies, but an indie about dumb people (and I mean really dumb) is simply ridiculous and meaningless. It's really a shame that this movie was based on insipid characters that accumulate in such a delayed setting because the place was interesting.
