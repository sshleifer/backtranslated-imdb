First seen 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud and Brian Smith): Supposed and not spectacular sequel to the classic animated 101 Dalmatians. Yes, the movie continues where it ended in the first, but the problem is that it looks a lot like the original. One of the great things about the original was the pace of the story, which this one has not. The animation is also very little spectacular for Disney and all we have are the same characters who go through the same kind of story again. When will Disney stop boring us with sequels and redo etc. etc. Probably when we stopped renting or buying that mediocre fare they launched.
