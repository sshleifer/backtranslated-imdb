There is only one thing essential to the full appreciation of The Indian Runner. Unzip your pants. Peek inside. Is there evidence of a Y chromosome? Okay, you will. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the male requirements: blood, guns, car chases, fond women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, alcohol, violence, pyrotechnics - what do I have? abandoned? "Ah, yes, torches." As a woman, I sincerely hope Sean Penn regards this as a kind of effort "when I was a child ...". Since he wrote and directed the thing, he is almost solely responsible. An uneven cast (Viggo Mortensen, as usual, demonstrating brilliantly how the work should be done) tries to save Penn. Very late. The lines and actions are there. Even devoted, skilled acting can not change them. <br /> <br /> I found this film childish and silly as well as predictable. The dialogue advances - Sandy Dennis has my respect for trying to bring to life a maternal monologue that does not have maternal authenticity. Then she dies. After a while, the father of the protagonists is also played by Charles Bronson. His absence is hardly perceptible. <br /> <br /> At intervals, pyrotechnics, etc., mentioned above, seem to cheer things up and scare the audience into thinking that something significant is occurring. <br /> <br /> If you are a man and you are under 25, you may love this movie. Plan to return to him at age 35. Do you think you'll still like it? <br /> <br /> I do not think so.
