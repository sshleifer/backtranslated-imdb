So when Herbie made her first appearance, I was perfectly happy watching Dean Jones assault. I just wanted to have fun for a few hours and eat really buttery popcorn. Now, unfortunately, I have expectations of a fascinating / fascinating story whenever I watch a movie if I'm not on some kind of medication. And this is another good film for the medicado. There are no significant laughter, no complex entanglements, no hard twists. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for the fully charged. <br /> <br /> This was the first time I've seen La Lohan onscreen since she moved with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought she was great at it), and I can not say I was terribly impressed this time . In addition to her constant change and unnatural hair color distraction, she just did not sound real like the boy next door who had spent her entire life strolling down street aisles. Her "need for speed" was not consistently portrayed in the movie - maybe it was somewhere else - she seemed older than her part, and seemed to be always looking for something (a party? Designer new place to spend money?) Set. I could not see any chemistry with Justin Long; that novel seemed obligatory at best. The only time Lindsay appeared to be engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon, who I thought was appropriately on top as Bad Bad Guy Trip Murphy. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Herbie again, and I loved the introduction of film with footage from the old films. If Disney had come up with some jewelry from the car, I might have used some to be fair. His new feature (?) Was a bit incoherent (does he channel the thoughts of his driver? He now skates?), But whatever. We all knew how it was going to end, but I wish he'd ended up with someone a little less doped than Maggie. And my head still hurts from that lesson that Maggie and we spectators hammer at home. <br /> <br /> What would have made the movie worth it? Having old Herbie in a real story with a real plot - at least Herbie is as good as Lassie - but clearly that's asking too much. Why does Disney always return to the same level of "Herbie Goes Bananas" and "the computer that wore sneakers" when it comes to innovation? <br /> <br /> I'm sure this was a great movie for kids and people with no expectations. For the rest of us .... it's for when you have the flu and you simply can not have the suspense of Rear Window.
