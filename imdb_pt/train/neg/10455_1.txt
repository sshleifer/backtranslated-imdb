Pyramid Clues of $ 25,000: Deep Blue Sea. Slither Tremors Eight legged legs. <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: Movies that were funnier and more thrilling than Snakes on a Plane. <br /> <br /> Hell, with that definition I would have to include Ted and Elaine's relatively harrowing trip on Airplane! as superior to Snakes in both laughter and emotions. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this is not even close to the mother of all the intentionally intentional funny snake movies: Anaconda! In addition to being never seen again in the cast of JLo-Cube-O. Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same movie, you had Jon Voight taking the cinematic assault of all time. Her final scene alone represents everything SOAP tried and failed to do as a "so ridiculous-is-fun" movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, Snakes on a Plane is the ultimate proof that studio executives and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible. All the great scenes were discussed and dissected both last year, all that was left to amuse on opening night was the amount of sweaty fanboys on the floor that had to be washed in my theater. I heard more forced laughter here than in a studio recording "According to Jim".
