It is not always that I see a movie as terrible as this. I kept watching, every minute hoping it was a joke, only to find out it was to be taken seriously. Well, as seriously as this genre asks. The acting was shameful and the situations horribly invented and clich√©s. If a film was made in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its direction, we could think that cinema at that time was naive. It turns out that this movie was made in 2000 and I have not yet seen an age-of-silence movie that has as little charm as this. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not for serious moviegoers. /> <br /> [Not worth a rating]
