One of, if not the worst, movie out of Britain in the 1980s. This tawdry tale of a middle-aged swindler who 'seduces' two teenage nannies who take care of him and his false wife has nothing to rescue him. <br /> <br /> Childish, coarse and unreal, this movie plunges into the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the way the strong cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely sewn together by such a stupid script. Not surprisingly, this was the only work of the late Andrea Dunbar to enter the screen. Complete and absolute rubbish on all levels.
