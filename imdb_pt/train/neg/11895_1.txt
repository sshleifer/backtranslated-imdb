Oh my God, what the hell happened here? !! I'm not going to say that again, but what kind of late movie is this? The dubbing is much worse than the dubbing in "King Kong vs. Godzilla", Linda Miller had to be the worst actress and the suits are really extravagant. It's about a villain named Dr. Who who gets henchmen to build a robot. gorilla who has the same strength as King Kong, but when this robot breaks he builds another and then tries to kidnap Kong. When he does this (that's when Linda Miller gets annoyed) he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes So Dr. Who sends the robot after him. Later, when I watched the movie, I had a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning. While I sat in the misery of watching the DVD While I was playing, I was hoping the madness in the movie would end until the fight. The ending has to be pretty bad because they could have shown Kong back to his island by fighting the dinosaurs again. <br /> <Do not watch the movie under any circumstances or if you ... Beware of the disappointment ent you will receive.
