IT'S OK. I think the TV show is kind of cute and always has some kind of lesson involved. So when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to go along. I wish I had stayed home and watched the TV show. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie. The plot is beside non-existent, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum and, worst of all, Gadget has no lesson at all. It seems Disney has picked up all the things that make the Inspector Gadget run on TV and played them all. To be fair, my youngest son (8 years old) liked the movie, but the oldest (10 years old) went away thinking silly (he was too old for juvenile humor but too young for any adult mood). Overall, I like Disney movies, but that's a problem. It is OK for a very narrow age group (say 7 to 9), but one should miss out for everyone else.
