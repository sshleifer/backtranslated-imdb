Good. Where to begin. Let's just say that; Avoid this movie at all costs. It is based on a series of cartoons. The film makes the cartoon look like Hamlet. Filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be here, lousy camera work, lousy music and enough product placement to make you never visit Yahoo! again, this movie really is the bottom of the barrel. To quote the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett make their way through this photo with the gay abandon of men who have seen a rare kind of salary in the distance. "They must pay us some of the millions they have earned to watch." Horrible.
