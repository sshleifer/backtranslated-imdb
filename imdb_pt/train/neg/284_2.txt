I just today, I picked it up at the only 99-cent store today, and I still think it was stolen. "Dream to Believe" is a very annoying and unrealistic gym drama and $ 1 is very expensive for that. This movie is probably only notable for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. E 2. It is directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also made Promo Night. Now in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo) who is seriously injured in a car accident that also cost her father's life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastics tournaments, she is often chosen during her classes and eventually meets some wild boy named Tommy (played by Keanu). Robin, when not in training, works part time with his mother. and a half-sister, in a laundry owned by her abusive stepfather. Eventually, she is chosen to compete. <br /> <br /> Overall, Keanu alone and some catchy songs from the 80's are what keep me from giving this 1 star, and it's also not one of the worst movies ever, but it's still far from being good. The DVD itself is not receiving any medals as it seems to be coming from an old VHS and in the end the sound is out of sync and when the end credits are almost over, it turns black even though the sound can still be heard . So, this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The art of the DVD does not make sense, as it has what appear to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the film, since it is not in the film itself either, so the cover is obviously photoshopped. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you're a Keanu fanatic. I probably will not take it anymore. I'll probably give it to The Cinema Snob, who is a big critic of YT. Hey, if any of you have any low-quality movies that they do not want in your view, feel free to donate to him to keep your show going.
