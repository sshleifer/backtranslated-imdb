After Mafia boss Vic Moretti kills his lady who is cheating on him with Derek, his new driver / Vietnam veteran, and blames the poor guy, Derek is in prison where he has to face a corrupt guard, Vic's prison brother who runs the jail, and, oh yeah, illegal experiments conducted by an obscure CIA agent (great master of the genre and first-time director John Saxon) to turn several prisoners into superhuman invincible zombies. Of course things are out of control and it is up to Derek, and the rest of the prisoners unchanged, to save the day after those infected go to jail. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a great talented actor & as director Saxon is a great talented actor. To say that this film (John's only boarding trip to date) does not have a certain visual talent would be a bit of a euphemism. However, the film is not totally without merit. The dialogue, though stupid, is bad enough to be humorous at times. Unfortunately, that's not enough for the film to rely on it alone and it takes forever for the movie to start appearing (which is quite late in the movie). As such, the most I can recommend this movie is to say that if you are a fan of Saxon (which I really am), it is worth a watch, just go with low expectations and you should be fine. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure go topless <br /> <br /> My notes: D +
