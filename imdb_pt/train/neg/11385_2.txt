Before you begin, let me say that my experience with this movie may have been influenced by the dubbing, which I recall from other reviews was the original that is considered inferior by some. So, it is entirely possible that subtitles or the seemingly new version of the DVD will make a difference. I did not read the corresponding book either; I'm just familiar with another Japanese manga and may be lacking in cultural context. <br /> <br /> Potentially smaller spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I usually like darkly dyed science fiction stories (the likes of Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I did not like that movie. Although it started a bit intriguing, it became tedious at the time when it was just in the way. There are all kinds of problems; Let's start with what is probably the most serious: the dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they are not yelling each other's names for the nth time, they are usually grunting monosyllables ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc.). This leaves most characters totally underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It does not help at all that many of them have only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that they developed them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals. <br /> <br /> The growl is augmented by some random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all seems random, thrown randomly from various pieces of science fiction ideas without any coherence. <br /> <br /> The little bit of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the final sequence of escalating scenes of chaos and destruction. Not that there is anything wrong with a good bit of destruction and destruction, of course; but in this case you're going to ask yourself "what's the point of all this, and how long until it ends." The character development in the last 30 minutes consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> The ending resembles that of 2001 - a bizarre sequence of images that until now. to solve or explain anything, let the viewer feel that he is just looking at a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some will say that this sort of thing is art; but to me it was just an admittedly imaginative use of colors and shapes. (Some of the songs were also quite interesting). Unfortunately it's all style and no substance. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with "adult" themes? I'm sad to say that you're more likely to find this sort of thing in "South Park."
