I am a big fan of Karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this movie after seeing Fiza, which was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are bad, and there are movies that are cr * p. but this movie just takes the cookie. <br /> <br /> We were so annoyed that we were fooled by paying our money waiting for a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, do not even rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
