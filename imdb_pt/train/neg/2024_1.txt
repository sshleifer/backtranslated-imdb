Trying to profit from the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100, comes this tattered excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy "dancers" dress in bright red. A competitor receives the beginning of a phrase, such as "Which team lost ..." with three options, A, B or C, each completing the phrase. The competitor has three chances to respond to one of these three options. The presenter - William Shatner, in his most intelligent nasty - asks the competitor if he wants to "stop the answer" and when the competitor says yes, he chooses a "dancer", whom he shouts "Show me the money!" She opens a parchment that has an amount, and if his answer was right, he adds that amount to his winnings; if it was wrong, the amount is subtracted. (So ​​theoretically it is possible for a competitor in this dismal disaster to actually end up with Shatner money.) There is also a "Killer Card" and if the competitor chooses the girl who has that vile parchment, but he answered correctly, nothing happens. If he responds wrong, the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he makes a mistake, he leaves with nothing. Before going to the commercials, Shatner shouts: "let's dance" and Shatner, the competitor and the 12 dancers shake the serve. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the women for "one last dance" and they all shake a little more. <br /> <br /> I give this show 6 episodes at most, in which I hope this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door. (It could have been worse - they could have somehow bribed Cuba Gooding Jr to be the host, though I bet he's a better dancer than 'Shat', as they currently call him. > 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! It lasted only 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
