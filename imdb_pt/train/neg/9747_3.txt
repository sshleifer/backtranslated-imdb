Ok, first of all, this movie sucks. But let's examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it and then transporting it and assembling it is at least intriguing. But that's as much as they take that premise. Instead of investigating what could happen if someone made this kind of machine, they would break the damn thing. This could have been a good premise. Living with the responsibility of this kind of power, and dealing with the constant temptation, that is, the invisible man. But no ... they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. Then the doctor jerry-rigs the thing back together, and tries to move. Just to have him enjoyed by his pretty but dumb secretary, (duh). What would not happen if Lembach had not decided to leave. So now he's wandering around the country killing people because his little experiment failed, and they did not give him money. Wah So, to make matters worse, make a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent teachers hired to help you. Between their love sessions, they make a few attempts to find him while he kills half of London. All this could have been solved without breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach had not left. This movie tried, so I gave him an honest 2 stars for the effort, but it would have been better if they had not broken the damn machine, causing Lembach to leave, making him try again. Damn Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
