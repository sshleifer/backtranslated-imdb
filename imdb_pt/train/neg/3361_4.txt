This movie was one of the best movies ever made, "" I had everything to make a great movie. Amazing acting, awesome special effects ...... oh wait I must be thinking of a good movie. Well, that was not one of them, just sucked. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is, what kind of bonehead would think this movie was a 10. When I cast my vote there was 206 out there, God knows what goes on in their minds. Now, as for any other vote, an 8 or 9 was still very loud, but a 10 ??? Come on, what made this movie soooo good to give 10? I know these are the same ones who thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.
