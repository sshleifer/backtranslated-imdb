This movie could have been an interesting study on the character and could have given some tips on the subject, but the real problem with this movie is that it does not have any of that. It gives no vision, or solutions to the problem. It's just the portrait of the "old" male junkie and the problems that this is creating for his normal life and his family every day. Why do you want to watch it? It's all so meaningless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> It also does not help that the main character is a man over 50 years. You will have difficulty identifying and sympathizing with it. He looks like an old dirty playboy, which is a constant pursuit of women and sex. He has all kinds of sex about 3 times a day with different women and not just with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It also does not have a bad visual style, although it seems a bit forced. But even so, it's prettier than most other direct-to-video productions. Who knows, if the filmmakers had received better material to work on, the film would have deserved better faith. <br /> <br /> History really scoffs at times. There are actually some pointless plot lines that are often more laughable than they obviously should be. I am speaking, for example, of the whole plot line of Ordell. Things get worse when the movie starts to come to an end. Also all the way the story is being told, going back and forth between the events that took place and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist, seems a bit cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But when it comes to bad movies, this is not one of them. It's not really better or worse than any other random direct-to-video movie with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> It still seems strange and incredible that they managed to launch Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. into such a thing. a small insignificant simple production like this is. I think they were really desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
