I lost 5.75 to see this low quality movie, so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What was the point of the dog being split in the middle at the beginning of the movie, the disease had nothing to see with the split in half. <br /> <br /> What was the point of dragging Karen into the shed, she already totally infected her room, they could have locked her there where she would be safer. <br /> <br /> Why would the Hermit be running through the woods asking strangers to help him when he could simply ask his relative, the pig, to take him to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why not? None of the characters bothered to go into town to get help when things started to get bad, are they really that lazy? <br /> <br /> Even if Paul was threatened by the guy with the shotgun to spy on his gun. wife, Paul could have sent Jeff or Bert back home for help. The girl he loves is deteriorating. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the box? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was infected? was he so stupid to leave first, if he had not come home? If the police bothered to gather the children and burn them in the fire pit, why they threw Paul in the middle of the river, was not even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated . <br /> <br /> Who makes lemonade in the river water, this crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it. Because the two children could not use tap water, it was also contaminated, so the stupid end would still work.
