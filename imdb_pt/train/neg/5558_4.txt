I will not be long here, I just wanted to say that Darkman 3 is incredible. I have all 3 on DVD, added these to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman is up there with the best ones, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Hard, you get it. There is not much good horror, suspense, settling there. Many thanks to all the staff and ready to give us the Darkman trilogy. By the way, if your wondering how I came across this on DVD. I bought through the internet, it is however region 4, as you know most US DVD players are region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player as it is a player of the whole region. Just go to configure, then choose the witch region setting that you want (1-9).
