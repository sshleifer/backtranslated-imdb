Okay, but does that make it a good movie? Well, not really, in my opinion. Not much to recommend. I found it very slow, really boring. It's also predictable. Number one and two were a little predictable, but not so much. I also felt that this movie was pretty overdone at times, which I really do not think fits this series and the character. Jeff Fahey plays the main villain in this issue. he's a decent enough actor, but I felt that he played his character too. I think it fits with the tone of the movie, which would have been great if I had liked the movie.plus, there were some bad liners. Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role, but little is given to work on this movie. The character did not really evolve, as I expected. Well, that's just my opinion. Anyway, for me, while this movie is not horrible, it's really bad. My vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
