Eytan Fox, though generally backed by the apologetic side of Israeli politics, has made several interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and the simply wonderful film "Yossi & Jagger." In "The Bubble", however, he took this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. Far from applauding this movie, the people who attended the exhibition I watched quietly stood up and left. I also went out silently, furious with the rage of such a ridiculously one-sided movie that translates self-preservation as racist bullying and racist intimidation (and terrorism) as outbursts of justified rage; implying that the Arabs are so harmed by the evil Israelis that they react angrily to a steady stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and that they therefore should not be held accountable for their actions. <br /> <br /> This movie was not worth the money I paid for the ticket (in fact, I considered demanding my money back), and it was basically an Israeli apeing of the Palestinian movie "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israeli, then, by all means, watch this movie because it really justifies such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, even worse, by a talented Israeli director, is a shame. In fact, as Israel may be surprised to be considered a pariah state when Israelis themselves make such anti-Israel propaganda, beg the belief. What a shameful and horrible movie!
