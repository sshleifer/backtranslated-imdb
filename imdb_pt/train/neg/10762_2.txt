This was a boost for me from the local video store. Do not make the same mistake I did. This movie is tedious, unconvincing and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered; I cringed in all the scenes they shared. Dennis Hopper makes some sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self; his role was clearly not a stretch for him. And although the film is supposed to be set in Puerto Rico, it looks much like a Hollywood movie; all the main characters are Caucasian and several tend to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Odd. Anyway, when you see this on the shelf of your local video store, keep walking.
