My interest in Dorothy Stratten led me to buy this video. Although it had great actors / actresses, there were many subplots going on to keep the interest going. Besides, it was not that interesting. The dialogue was hard and confusing, and the story turned too much to be believable. I was quite disappointed with what I believe to be one of the last Audrey Hepburn films. I will always love John Ritter better in pie. He was very pathetic here.
