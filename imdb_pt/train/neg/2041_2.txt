Well, I'll start with the good points. The movie was only 86 minutes long, and some were so bad it was funny. Now for the low points. My first warning signal came with a real "warning" in the movie. When the following "warning" began, it was displayed: "The movie you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images. Because contrary to popular belief, being dead is neither fun nor romantic." I should have saved the 86 minutes and then hung up. The first words of the film were: "I'm in the glue factory". It was a guy talking on the phone and referring to a nursing home as a glue factory. I do not know why. So the basis of the movie is that some kid is obsessed with the Zodiac Killer and starts to imitate him. The budget for this movie was at least $ 50 and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find. The acting was worse than I was reading straight from a screenplay. That's what it looks like they were doing. The script was horrible, and the big "twist" was that this guy who wrote a biography on the Zodiac Killer was actually the Assassin of the Zodiac. Of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious in the first 10 minutes. Without more painful plot details, here were some horrible highlights from the movie. They try to make the Zodiac Killer compare to an "army of one" because the soldiers are really just killers. So they tried to do a "Satanic Worship" showing some black hooded guys in a meeting. The big "computer hacker" got this boy's address when someone gave him the boy's name and phone number. For some reason, he had to break into the FBI to get someone's address. I do not know why he did not look in the phonebook or use whitepages.com. There was also a random allusion to 9/11 for no reason. I also learned that no matter where you take a shot, blood will come out of your mouth in seconds. <br /> <br /> So if you like bad acting, sub-par routines, bad camera work and an obvious plot, you'll love the zodiac killer!
