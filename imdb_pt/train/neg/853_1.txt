Okay, honestly I do not see why everyone thinks this is so good. Actually it is not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good, I can tilt my hat to him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No other then that got too stupid. And what was Stanley Kubrick thinking of drawing Shelly as Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the ending. I'd have more respect for that if Kubrick had ended differently. And the film above all was simply stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So do not watch the movie read the book and you will be much better. 3/10
