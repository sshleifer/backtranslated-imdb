Oh a vaguely famous actress in a movie where she plays a mother for a child. It's being aired on BBC 1 at midnight and a half, I wonder if ... it's a TVM <br /> <br /> You have to hand it over to TVM producers, not content to make a mediocre movie , they usually give us two mediocre films where two themes are mixed and NOWHERE TO HIDE is no different. The first issue is a woman in danger cross-pollination theme with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme, which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving an attempted murder followed by a scene having her son Sam ask why she divorced And being a TVM, she responds that the reason is "people change" instead of saying something like "I'm a right pat" or "Your father crosses public toilets for sex," as in real divorce cases. Sam feels sorry for not only his parents getting divorced, but he is as thick as two short boards. In fact, since he is so stupid, he deserves no sympathy because he does not know that a man is stuffing things in a toilet is a drug dealer, unaware that you can die if someone shoots you, and unaware that I love Lucy is painfully dull, if our own childhoods were so innocent, as Orwell said "Ignorance is strength." Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life! Is it the development of a character or poor routing? I know what my money is. It's strange that Sam, the genuine boy, did not notice that if the story goes on in 1994, then why do people usually wear clothes, drive cars, and ride a train from the 1950s? It turns out that during a turnaround in history is the mother who is the mannequin. So there's a final twist that left me as an idiot to watch.
