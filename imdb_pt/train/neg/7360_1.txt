This is one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility (as an obvious agent going through a bank loan officer while making it clear that he is talking to someone through a thread or the scene where the scientists assume that it is safe to enter a room where the virus was released despite "not having found a viable host" does not mean it will ever find one), cheap assemblies (the bank seems to have been poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon) and poor performance. It is the story of an organized crime group that successfully stole a lethal virus capsule. However, the boss who decides to take him out of a bank deposit box does so while a bank robbery is falling, the same FBI agents have been informed of this and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts. . It goes without saying that the consequences of the earthquake are confusing in more ways than one. However, the results do not contribute to a compelling action film, but, on the contrary, one that has obviously been z-quality junk from the beginning of the film. (Maybe that's why some of the screenshots on the packaging seem to be created with computer graphics, instead of being actual screenshots of various movie sequences.) What the hell Ron Perlman was doing in this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was as ashamed to be in it as I was to see him.
