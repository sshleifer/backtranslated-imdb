This is really the weird movie ... First, we have a former American gymnast trying to become an actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role he's ever had (which I know anyway) - and for a good reason. While it plays the part well enough to keep some interest, it's a fairly bland and flat performance. Secondly, we have the WORST sound effects ever used in a movie !!! I'm not kidding. This in itself makes the movie extremely comical, but in this way annoying. hehe And thirdly, while we have a generally decent acting support cast (including the yummy required!), not a bad story, and some cool visuals; the dialogue, fight scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!) and general plot execution are weak. This movie would have been just better as a network TV movie (too bad Fox was not around in 1985). It's one of those movies that's just plain bad but you can not resist watching and even having fun when you get used to it, especially now that you've found the perfect eternal home on TV and cable late at night.
