This has to be by far the worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it, I realized that it could not be a very bad movie, since he was in some decent movies, and he was a fairly fair actor. WRONG! No one should waste your time on this movie. I made rapid progress by 80% and did not feel like I lost anything.
