Like most reviews, I saw this movie with the name of The Witching, which is the title of the reissue. Apparently, the Necromancy that is the original is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most witch scenes still include scenes of necromancy and these are still bad. In many ways, I think the added nudity of witchery has at least added some entertainment value! But do not be fooled - there are only 3 scenes with nudity and the people standing around the variety. No diabolique rumpy pumpy involved! <br /> <br /> This film is so inherently horrible that it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is horrible and comes straight from Troma's closet. At least, Troma is a little ironic. This is straight face boredom personified. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora, the child possessed in The Innocents, you believe!), The worst with her raucous and raucous voice. Welles seems to be just waiting for his paycheck. The other female protagonist has a scary face, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie! And the doctor is also very bad. He also looks a lot like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It is inept filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is unstable. This is because witchcraft is a copy-and-paste job and not a subtle one at all. Only the lighting is good. The sound is also horrible and it is difficult to hear with the new soundtrack that never quiets. The "ghost" mother is also equally idiotic, but the actress is so hilarious in acting that at least she gives some unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> Really this movie (the witch, at least) is only for the unsuspecting. He can not have many healthy fans as it is quite unattainable and I actually found it boringly boring! <br /> <br /> The best part was when the credits rolled - enough said simply better for this poor excuse for a movie like the plague!
