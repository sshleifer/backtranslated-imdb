Oh, my dear! Rarely did a "horror" movie bore me or made me laugh as much as this one. After a witty start with an intriguing premise, it descends into not much more than a horror movie, with some supernatural and sexual aspects. The normally excellent Alice Krige is wasted on this one, and the twists are ridiculous. Do not bother unless you're really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
