One might think (as I do) that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese, a movie should be at least decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest comedy works of all time. <br /> <br /> Well, apparently I was very much mistaken - this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Confuse as one joke after another can be so deeply bland. It was painful to see these talented actors performing one of the most positive screenplays I had the misfortune to encounter. Based solely on the big names, I remained hopeful for a long time during the duration of the film, but it consistently failed to provide any kind of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Usually with both movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and generalizations. But with this movie, it's hard not to let go. I can count on one hand, maybe two or three fingers, great Hollywood productions that made me more bitter than that. This is easily one of the worst comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy this - I really liked it. But The Out-of-Towners finally failed miserably. If you really want entertainment efficient in terms of time, just grab your money and watch it spin while you wash the toilet. Just please, do not watch this movie.
