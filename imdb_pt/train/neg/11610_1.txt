Undoubtedly, Frank Sinatra was a talented actor and also a talented singer. After all, very few actors these days can have one scene at a time, and that was basically Sinatra's modus operandi on set. <br /> <br /> I feel that with the 1960s, the quality of man movies really began to tank. The detective series Tony Rome was nothing less than trying to compete with the Matt Helm series of Dean Martin, which came out at the same time. Maybe even a James Bond competition, but nothing worked for Frank during those years. His personal life in shambles, his music fading ... Sinatra looked more like a throwback to the 1950s. Sinatra's last major film of this period was probably Von Ryan's 1965 Express.
