There is only one word for this movie. Terrible. The director clearly has talent, but as his character Robert Carmichael throws it all away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has potential, but as Cray he can not be bothered to use it. Being attracted to petty crimes and then falling into depravity is Cray's vision of British youth. Like the British tabloids, this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect. Cray cries out for attention, but he deserves nothing. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by the act of violence that Cray chose to thrust into the faces of the audience. He assumes that the public ignores world atrocities. Like a piece of obscene graphite on a bathroom wall, it shows us male depravity with teenage delight. <br /> <br /> Some quality actors have small parts in this movie. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville make short appearances. The acting is otherwise amateur, the young Joe and Ben are embarrassed. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is scary. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive wife of chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); how she was able to submit to such a trial is unbelievable. The film is never subtle and Monica is treated with the most gratuitous violence that is cut with the action of war. War images are used to convey the idea that young people can not help themselves, that acts of violence will occur even within "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and symptomatic of our altered society, where men have an increasingly less important position, but Cray descends to the level of the barbarian males he seeks to expose through the use of such brutal and violent images. The female characters in the movie offer no relief. They are victims or in the case of Manville, a fainting mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is Cray's first movie. I heard what he had to say during a question-and-answer session in Edinburugh and he is not at all clever, he simply has no experience and his film exposes his naivety. The film is due to be released later this year, but I hope the company fails because the public does not really need that kind of messy stuff.
