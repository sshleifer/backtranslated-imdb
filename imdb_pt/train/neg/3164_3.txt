Eva Longoria, obnoxious, dies on the wedding day, when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her in the back of a truck and kills her. She then tries to ruin her ex-boyfriend's relationship with her new girlfriend, a psychic who can see her. <br /> <br /> An obvious non-original movie would not be bad in a clich√© way except that Longoria's character is hateful and nasty as she drains all the fun of the movie. It's like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper. To be fair Longoria, no one in the cast or team, is not the problem, it's the horrible script that goes down the process. It's really very stupid.
