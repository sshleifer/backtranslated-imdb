If you've seen a Brian Avenet-Bradley movie and compare it to the feedback you receive about IMDb, you know most of the comments and votes are fake. Trust me: you'll be bored! The people on the production team write their comments for themselves (sometimes even admit it). But this is not enough: they also constantly click "no" whenever there is a negative comment about the movie. That is why negative critics are always placed behind the sensationalists. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. Believe me now! If not, you'll believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley can be a good businessman. Otherwise, it can not be explained that he meets people who still fund their films. (Okay, they're cheap, but anyway.) But as a creative person, he's a complete failure.
