Let's be honest. As a film school project, made without budget and with "real" actors, this is a reasonably interesting film. As something to be released on DVD to an innocent bystander, it is a very poorly produced product. If I were switching channels, and by chance I would accidentally take this film, it would probably catch my eyes and my attention for a while. As a person who bought this DVD with the impression that I would be getting a suitable movie product, ie a movie, I feel deeply disappointed. It's a piece of TV recorded on video, something along the line of the old sixties series, but without that certain charm. In addition to the protagonist, Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors seem to be from the campus (a little too old for this), or members of the director's house, who appear on camera with no help from not only the couches, but also the makeup artist or hairdresser (a hat on overlaid permanent fringe or a top hat on mullet is a very long way to create 1840s). Everything is filmed using a camera still mounted in a small and nude studio, sometimes using the blue screen for outdoor backgrounds. Synthesizer has generated uninspired punctuation for "period" inspired romantic karaoke insults the listeners of viewers on more than one occasion. The film tries to be "dreamy," while in reality it is just a collage without conceptions of the images that came to the edit (and, believe me, the patterns were not too high to begin with). There are interesting dialogues from time to time, but overall it is a rather weak and two-dimensional production in more ways than one, without flashes of genius from the director or any member of staff. That's how "artistic" movies tried to look like in the 1980s. Redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director.
