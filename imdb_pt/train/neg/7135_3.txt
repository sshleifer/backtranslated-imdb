I am sorry to say that there is really no way, in my opinion, that an Enzo would actually be able to accompany a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power to take advantage of the S7's weight would be great. The S7 has a power-to-weight ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp while the Enzo is 4.61 lbs / hp. The low-end S7 is also much better. Sorry for Ferrari fans, but Saleen does it a lot better. <br /> <br /> As for other parts of this movie, I have to say it's so bad that it's pathetic. The story is very weak. The performance on this lemon is worse than daytime soaps. <br /> <br /> I can say that, insofar as it is a treatise on negative psychology, it is a kind of jewel. This film is nothing but a glaring definition of what narcissism and sociopathy are. It's all about these rich punks taking away their stones while showing only traces of remorse feigned by all the innocent road users who cause injury or death as well. <br /> <br /> I can not give the movie a "1 Star" rating because it did not force me to actually leave the theater. I also think having an incredibly beautiful brunette with blue eyes as the main protector saves her from being completely abysmal ... although there is no way that her singing will put her on the cover of 'Variety'. <br /> PS: The guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the skid row version of James Vanderbeek.
