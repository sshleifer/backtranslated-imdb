What can I say, this is a brilliant movie that should have won an Oscar. A copy must be kept in a safe deposit box for posterity. It should be necessary to view all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the coolest screenwriter / director / producer / chef / nanny / receptionist at Walmart to forever grace the movie world with his art. <br /> <br /> Where do I start with this? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so utterly breathtaking! And Mraovich like Arthur, wow, he's so attractive that it surprises me that he has not gone to Mr. Universe. I could not contain myself during the nudity scene. I lent this movie to my brother and he called me on the phone saying how Arthur's nudity scene made him gay. I'm totally supportive, of course, because of this movie and it's beautifully crafted lessons of tolerance. Because yesterday I burned a church and wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in their smoking ash. Cinematography was the best thing about this movie. When that Fed-Ex plane hit the skies through the Vermont palm trees, I cried! Why, I did not even know they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed-Ex airplanes before this movie. This opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities. This film inspired me to enroll in Sam Mraovich's school of writing, acting, direction, composition, casting, production, production design and real estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich.Thank you for bringing this creation to the world.We can never pay you enough."
