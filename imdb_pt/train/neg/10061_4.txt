'The Curse of Frankenstein' is true to Mary Shelley's story for a title word, which would not be so bad if the changes were good. The tragedy of the creature that destroyed Frankenstein's family was completely extirpated and replaced with ... nothing. The heart and moral center of history is gone. It does not help that this Frankenstein is a conniving and dishonest murderer; he deserves all he receives. The plot is basically a shallow list of Frankenstein cliches. Even taken on its own terms, this is bullshit: a bland movie with a fucking-looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut. As it is Hammer's first horror film, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in the history of terror is safe. But it sucks.
