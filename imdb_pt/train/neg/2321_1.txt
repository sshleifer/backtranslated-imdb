I can not believe this show is still rated 9 out of 10. I could see if those votes were in the first two seasons but what would someone else continue to rate it after that? I was a big fan in Season 1. I was addicted - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next. In Season 2, I was still watching faithfully, but I was getting a little frustrated that some basic things still had to be explained. And instead of giving him more answers, it seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, but you have to throw people a bone once in a while to keep them watching. <br /> <br /> Now, I can not even remember what finally discouraged me, but somewhere in Season 2, I had enough. I'm not a big fan of making appointments - and you clearly can not miss an episode to keep an eye on what's going on. So it was not worth the effort for me anymore. <br /> <br /> It's a shame they could not be a little smarter and more considerate of loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that ABC seems greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show. They do not realize that in the end, they will lose more fans than they could win.
