This movie has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen. It's as much fun as doing hard manual work with stomach cramps. The movie starts badly (I would rate the first few minutes of the movie by 1/10) and then gets progressively worse, minute by minute. The only way to evaluate it would be some sort of negative number in abyssal spiral that grows by ninety, long minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but it best describes the mood in this video. Somehow, the video can even make cute, little-dressed women and sex look grotesque and unpleasant. This movie is unbelievably bad. I would say it would be better to be locked with the TITANIC theme repeatedly and with the Buscemi character from ESCAPE FROM LA in his ear than watching this movie. The sequences are not so bad. If you have to rent a movie from Troma, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather watch 5 Tony Back commercials than see NUKEM HIGH CLASS again. Do not get me wrong, it took some kind of criminal genius to make such a terrible movie and if any movie deserved a prize for being horrible, that's it.
