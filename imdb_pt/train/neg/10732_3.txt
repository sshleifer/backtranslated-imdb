The Russian film, "4," follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet one night at a local bar. One of them is a musician, a frozen meat seller and a program girl. "4", I understand, aims to show the sadness and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have to invent stories to make their lives seem more interesting than they really are), but the film is so incoherent and annoying that I seriously doubt that many people can sit through it all the time. There seems to be a suggestion in the film that the obscure Russian government is doing some obscure things behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities, selling frozen meat for decades - but the film is so formless and incomprehensible that I doubt it. anyone could imagine what anyone really wants to do here. <br /> <br /> Despite decent acting and some incisively driven scenes, "4" is a two-hour endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.
