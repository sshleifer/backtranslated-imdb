The movie starts with some scrolling text that takes almost five minutes. It gives the basic summary of what is happening. This could have been done easily with acting, but you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind that this is all you will learn about them. The plot begins to leave the ground and then breaks the entire film. Not only does the plot change, but you may even wonder if you're watching the same movie. I've never played video games, but I know people who have them. From what I understand, whether you played or not, the movie does not improve. Save your money unless you enjoy sleeping in the theaters.
