So, I'm looking to rent a DVD and I come across this movie called 'End Game'. It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a political thriller taught. It is worth taking a look. Or so I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong? <br /> <br /> The final game has the most ridiculous plot I've ever had the dislike to endure. Now being something like a whodunnit, I can not really tear it as I would without 'ruining it' for those who have not yet experienced this monstrosity. But questions like "Why did he / she do this?" And "Where did they get the resources to do this?" are very plentiful after the movie's unintentionally hilarious conclusion. <br /> <br /> As for the acting - you know those movies where you can almost feel that an actor realized that he made a terrible mistake when signing a contract. movie, and this shows in your performance? This is one of those. Follow this with a laughable script and a seriously flawed and annoying direction, and you have the recipe for cinematic venom. <br /> <br /> Of course, this was not for the movies, and for the same reason you should not allow it in your living room; it's terrible.
