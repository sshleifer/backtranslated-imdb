As me and my other half are big fans of the horror of garbage, we did not resist leaving a movie that contained the two great hits that made us excited! However, for a 2004 film with a cover of Freddy Vs Jason this is a shame! The worst movie I've ever seen, but it's worth a laugh if you're able to sit on it! <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible, the effects ... well, I could do better on my camcorder indeed. It's so bad that they only bothered to put makeup on the faces of the zombies and left out the neck , hands, etc. No story line, weird flashbacks that do not make sense and terrible screenplay! <br /> <br /> "You broke my tooth!" of a vampire "You broke my cigar" was the response of the human who looked like Uncle Jessie of Dukes crossed with Santa!
