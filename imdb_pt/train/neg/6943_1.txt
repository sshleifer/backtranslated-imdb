This movie is deeply idiotic. A man wants to take revenge on a crime - but when he does his revenge - there is a video camera pointed directly at him all the time. What man with a brain cell in his head would stay there and do it for so long in front of a video camera? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this script could never happen, except with someone unable to dress destroy it for me, but it got dumber! <br /> <br /> I'm thinking that writers have some serious habits that are cooking their brain cells and causing them to lose plot holes that you can drive a battalion of armored tanks PLOT: A man seeks revenge for the death of his dear ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes wrong, and then the unexpected unfolds. <br /> <br /> If only these people writing this story were not so dumb as to write wholly unreal stories that could never happen that way. To the writers, I say, seek help for your grave mental problem.
