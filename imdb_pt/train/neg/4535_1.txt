slow, incomprehensible, annoying. Three enthusiastic words describing the book's film. This is certainly a case where the film should never have been made at the expense of the book. The best part of the movie was the setting, great. The worst part was the slow interaction of the actors, combined with endless meaningful looks. Editing is abrupt and erratic. However, despite this, the actors worked hard, at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script. It was surprising that, although established in Peru, there was hardly a person of Peruvian descent wandering around the scene - even in the flashback scenes depicting Peru in the seventeenth century. If you have some sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
