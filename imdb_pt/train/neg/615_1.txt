I have to say, I usually like horror movies that I have never seen ... however, this was just pathetic to my bloody taste. I'm used to the bloody, harrowing types ... but this particular movie was lame. The acting was horrible (still the bickering (no pun intended) a-liner were cute). And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yeah, probably when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose are released, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow look like children's. If you want a movie to pass the time, choose this one! Special effects are cheesy as hell. But seeing it was a low-budget movie, I kind of see where that would fit in. This will remind you of the movie "Children Of The Corn". Independent rock movies .... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with ears of corn, or in sequence, 2 scarecrows going there, then those movies would be for you.
