I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war, avoid idealism, and respect some rudimentary military principles. Zvezda hardly does the first. Being Zvezda a Russian war film, I was expecting patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic pictures, a lush score, Slavic cheekbones and vicious Germans. What I did not need was the naive unrelated love, the unreal war scenes and the abuse of the mellow soundtrack of a film that carefully avoided all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust) only to end in a passage but even so, insulting our sense of history, final note on "liberating Poland." An opportunity missed as a movie, but not as advertisement, apparently.
