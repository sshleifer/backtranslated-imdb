*** Comments contain spoilers *** I was barely holding on to this show as TV appointment when they started annoying music under each scene, when Don Epps was on average almost one shot per case when the own nasal Diane Farr was pregnant (but we did not notice) and when Colby was with a TRIPLE agent. But now, in today's episode, David is stuck with a paranoid job, sow that is an obvious amateur with a gun, in an elevator and .... CAN NOT disarm him. A trained, experienced field agent, who has been first by the door many times and is experienced in hand-to-hand combat, can not take a freak. Not when the work of walnut blinks, looks to the side, lowers the head, closes the eyes; not even when he looks at the wriggling fiber optic wire around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the scene came to let me know that as much as I like to learn from the chubby, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick / love interest Amita, my nights of Friday will be better spent busy otherwise. Don gives David the "word of anguish" which is the code for "Hell is about to fall"; David is ready, they kill the lights, fall off the elevator, scare the nut job and ...... <br /> <br /> David can not disarm / KILL / BEAT IN THE NUT WORK DELIVERY. The bad guy ends up with GOOD ARMS, David ends up with SHOT. <br /> <br /> I'm ready. I hope NUMB3RS is fun.
