I feel a lot less generous with this movie than others of its kind. The picture of the crazy in this century is always made with them being so totally bizarre that they are a different species. His antics are so outrageous that they are totally fictional. Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figure; or they have a fascination with chickens. They are on the mark or hitting each other. It's as if the screenwriter says, "What can I do to make them do it without the feeling of insanity or mental illness?" Watch the wonderful human portrait in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," where diseases are believable and real. I once worked in a state mental hospital. I have not seen any of these guys. These are very smart and calculating to make them come alive.
