Acclaimed director Mervyn LeRoy places drama in the movies that competes with the best of novels. The great drama is found in the loves and infidelities of the New York social group. Oh, yes, do not forget that jealousy can cause tainted hearts and murder. The cast of all stars: Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, James Mason, Ava Gardner, Cyd Charisse and Nancy Davis.
