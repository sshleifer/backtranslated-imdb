I have to admit that I'm a huge fan of this show, so you must know how disappointed I was when I watched this movie. First of all, the plot was horrible, I thought it was going to be something more interesting, I would see what happened to Arnold's parents, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house among many other places Many people try to stop it. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the plot was not so bad, but what really sucked were the steps that Arnold and his friends make to stop this maniac, they become friends of a spy; they drive a bus (based on a video game, for God's sake), and to make matters worse, they make superlindings on the bus, things that many people have tried and died but not Arnold, Gerald, and Helga, because they are experts in one video game. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my mother, my sister, even I was disappointed after watching this movie because it was the worst way to end a good cartoon. I must admit I used to enjoy "Hey Arnold!" It was one of my favorite designs on Nickelodeon, but after that fucking movie, I'm not sure I'm going to watch "Hey Arnold!" like I used to watch in the past. <br /> <br /> Another thing, Nickelodeon, with this huge number of dynamite, I can guarantee that not a single street would explode, I think the whole city could explode with it. and please, if all your future good cartoon films are like this, do not make more movies, you poorly criticize the cartoons that used to be good. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think this was the worst way to end this show, a good show turned into that filthy movie.
