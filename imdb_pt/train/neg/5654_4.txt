I've never heard of this movie until it played as part of a retrospective of Robert Mitchum at the National Film Theater in London. Nearly 60 years on the cast list looked tasty, to say the least with seven names - plus the first-rate Mitchum - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, not far from The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and possibly even more well-known as the daughter of the theater director Norman, Walter Brennan, who did not need presentations, Frank Faylen, the sadistic nurse of The Lost Weekend and the much nicer small town mensch in is a wonderful life, Robert Preston still a decade away from Harold Hill in The Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter doing the numbers. Unfortunately, most of them were wasting their time. I searched all the 'signature' scenes in vain, since it was Robert Wise in the megaphone. By now he had made about half a dozen movies and still needed to find a style. The story is from our old friend of war and Mitchum must have thought it was just a cut above the baths of Hopalong Cassidy in which he had cut his teeth. There are no new twists - if you do not tell the unbelievable scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to inquire about his father's plans to move his cattle. That's perfectly true, but how did Mitchum KNOW? We have seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered this. On balance not much to be said for this.
