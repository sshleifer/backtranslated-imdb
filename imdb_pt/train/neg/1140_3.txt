Scary, but mostly in the sense that it will end before I turn 70. I saw this as a late replay of about 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but only). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a bit scary because it looks like it has been stuffed by a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux seems to have smoked the whole beautiful city of Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> It's kind of a Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's baby. This is a turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and it's 1:30 on a Saturday morning and there's nothing but replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, so I think it beats that. But God help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
