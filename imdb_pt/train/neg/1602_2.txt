Anyone who thinks this movie was not appreciated by their comic genius should be smoking with the two drugged in the movie. This movie is not underestimated ... it's a bad movie. There should be no comparisons between this movie and The Naked Gun or Airplane, since the last two films are well written and funny. Class reunion is not any of those things. The sad thing is that it had that potential (good cast, good stories), but good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that were supposed to be funny came out more annoying than fun. The stoner guys, the vampire, the blind girl ... IT'S NOT FUNNY. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> The National Lampoon made some really good movies (Animal House, Vacation), but this is not one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.
