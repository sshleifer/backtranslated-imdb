This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. All. Ice-T is unfortunate, the dialogue is absolutely horrible, and the hokie does not begin to describe the performances of all the actors in this film. The plot steals strongly from the executive decision, but compared to Air Rage, the executive decision is the Oscar material. I've never been so disappointed when I watched a movie. Air Rage must be burned with its ashes trapped in a safe to never see the light of day. Anyone who has seen must take a shower and wash away the stench of their horrible movie. The best part of this movie probably comes from the end, when the credits rolled. This was easily the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should stick to Law and Order, and the other people in this movie should retire early or commit suicide. Either way, they should never try to be in a movie again.
