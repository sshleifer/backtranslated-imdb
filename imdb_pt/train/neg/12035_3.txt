I hoped that would be much better. I love Tim Burton's work so I was very excited to see these short films online. Well, they were nothing I expected. <br /> <br /> I really do not know what exactly I do not like. I think they're kind of boring. The sound bothers me, and most of the characters, though I have loved Roy the Toxic Boy, and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The Match Girl episode probably bothered me more, though it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> I also do not like the way some characters die. Sort of like Match Girl basically set fire to the gas station, or like the Girl Who Wanted died in general. Roy's death was fun, surprisingly. Death by a car purifier. Very original ;-) It made me laugh so much ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not appropriate for children. Just some language and gore. That's all I have to say! 3/10
