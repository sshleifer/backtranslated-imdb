Although in many ways I agree with the comments of other reviewers. I think the plot and the idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this movie is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure, I've never seen a less talented actor. How that person has been in a movie or on television, I can not imagine. In my opinion, she'd be better off as a bigger one at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low level of talent involved in the payment of papers, asks the question ... "Who does she know?" I would very much like to see this movie redone with some talent. I do not blame the writer for the failure of this movie is worth the time to view it.
