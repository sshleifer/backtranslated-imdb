The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that really scared me. The acting was not so bad, and the killer of "Cupid" was believable and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The plot and plot of this movie is incredibly weak. There simply was not much for that. The way the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle blood. <br /> <br /> General: A good scare, but a bad story. out of
