This is the movie ??? Is this what the Indians are trying to show? I think this is another effort by a sick director to refuse Pakistani soldiers and indeed the country ... but what we Pakistanis know we are always ahead of India in all parts of our lives ... not just on balustrades. Well ... this is badly filmed as Frontier in early 1997 ... and the director and writer tried to overcome the shame of the defeat in Kargil by the Pakistani military, creating movies like these. . One thing is very clear ... Whenever there is a meeting between Pakistan and India ... we will win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta tries to make good films instead of meaningless films like this one.
