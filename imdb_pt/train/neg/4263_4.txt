Disappointing movie. The performance of the actors is weak. Sets are fine, could have been better. The story is also weak. Battle sequences are terrible. Sounds and movie quality are useless. The story of the Kazakh people was told very badly. This film should have included more Kazakh actors in leading roles. And it should have been in the Kazakh language as well. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are of Hispanic origin. I dont understand. Since when Hispanics play in the Mongol-Turkish people. This film is a shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. The director of Czekh is excused, since he is not of nomadic origin, he can not know the true spirit and history of the nomads.
