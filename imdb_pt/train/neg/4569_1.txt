I can not believe the town of Muncie is so difficult for the attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there. This show is like a slap in the face of real cops who work hard. I've never in my entire life ever seen anything so stupid in my life. If they had advertised this as a comedy, that would be one thing, but to say that it's reality is nothing less than a lie. I only saw it once and was shocked by what I saw. I wanted to see the boy get in a chase with a bad guy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing in the program was anywhere near the real world. The town of Muncie, the chief of police and all the officers should be ashamed and should never want to admit that they came from that city. No wonder you did not stay on TV
