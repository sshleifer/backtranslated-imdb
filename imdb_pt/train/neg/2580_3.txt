well its official. they just killed American Pie. The first three were absolutely hysterical, but this and the others were terrible. I mean, the story is about two university brotherhoods struggling against each other over their homes, I mean, let's talk about a weak plot, the first three dealing with growth, change, and marriage, which are all worthy developmental points in society human. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know it's hard to compare to Steven Stifler, but he does not have a cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there are 2-3 funny parts in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this movie is Jim's father, I do not know why he keeps doing these bad things developed films.
