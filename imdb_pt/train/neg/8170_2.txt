A friend and I went through a few phase (years ago) of selecting the horror movies from the video store for one night's entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably see V. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The cheap synthesizer soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There are also some really fun scenes. Among them is a scene where a man is attacked and defends himself with a number of improbable objects, it made me laugh at the time (it does not look so funny in retrospect, but there you go). <br /> <br /> Besides, it's total crap, remember. But it's probably worth watching if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yeah, I saw that too.
