In an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken down by such parodies as Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday, Valentine 13 failed. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and it was beyond all that has ever been done. Why did they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has almost nothing ever. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend, it's not funny. And by the time the killer shows up on the screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. The teen slasher genre is DEAD Supere! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
