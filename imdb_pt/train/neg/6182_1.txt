This film makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably non-Robin-Hood costume and ignores all personality traits in him that really matter. This movie makes Wendy a babbling idiot. And poor Captain Hook, a TOTAL clown. And of course, as every Disney cartoon must have a character who had many hits in the head, they made one of the Lost Boys. The only character that has not been dishonored in this movie is Tink. The only star is for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself then? The parents do not even have time to realize that their children are gone !!! Probably one of the most significant points in the original story and they ruined it! Also the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is an impressive piece - There are no thimbles and no acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story so unique. It is a wonder that he even lost his shadow and she helped him to fulfill it. (Same as for your shoes and that does not make sense to me.) <br /> <br /> Ruining a great story like this just to amuse the kids should be illegal. So now, if you have not met him before - this version of Disney has nothing significant in common with the original story - which is not really a children's story but just a great, great story. <br /> <br /> It only annoys me without end.
