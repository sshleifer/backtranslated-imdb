Julia Roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to get rid of her Pretty Woman cotton personality with this spurious thriller of wife abuse, but it's hard to imagine that she would end up being as powerful and compelling (and Oscar-winning) as Erin Brokovich based on the back of this rubbish. And do not worry about it, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately its performance is not the most mediocre thing about it. The plot has all the marks of a made-for-cable dawn, and do not get the impression that it will offer any insight into the black world of domestic abuse, because none of the characters is sketched out. enough for you to really care. <br /> <br /> Ultimately disappointing and unsatisfactory, without the name of Roberts above the title, I'm sure he would have totally failed, deservedly.
