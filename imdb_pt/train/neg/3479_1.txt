I went to see this movie in theaters and was shocked when I entered the room. There was just me and my girlfriend! This shouted to me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not to my surprise, the movie was terrible. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It's a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl who hates him. His acting is OKish, but for the comedy aspect of the movie he is not very good. The plot is poor and the comedy almost nonexistent. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is crumbling and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review prevents others from wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I left the room !!!
