Really, really bad horror movie. A psychotic person escapes from an asylum. Three years later, he kills a professor of sociology, end of scene. One semester yesterday (hey, that's what the title of the card said) a new professor of sociology is in school. She befriends another sociology teacher who works there and starts dating another teacher. Students are bored, just like us. <br /> <br /> There are several titles that indicate how much time has passed. The scenes are very short and cut to different characters somewhere, which represents little progression of any kind. Many scenes involve characters walking and talking, or sitting and talking, and serve little purpose. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters are always wearing the same outfit. Sometimes the passage of time unclear means that when we see a body the second time, we ask ourselves: how long has this body been there? And also, at least one of the dead people seems not to have been lost by others. <br /> <br /> The assassin manages to kill one person by stabbing it in the chest, another by stabbing him in the groin and another by cutting her forehead. Is your knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The cover of the video box has a cheerleader: there are none in the film. The back cover has a picture of someone in a cap and graduation dress threatening a group of women in a dorm. The redhead in the picture is in the movie, but no one wears such clothing and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one-on-one.
