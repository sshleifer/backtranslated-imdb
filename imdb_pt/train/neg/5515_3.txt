There's a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon; the scenery is rich, colorful and full of art deco details well done. The animation lives up to the usual studio standards of the time, which are unquestionably superior to those of today. However, I find this tedious for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> The Music: It definitely does not live up to Scott Bradley's usual standards. Although it is supposed to be evocative of a "Great Gatsby" scenario, it turns out to be somber, drowsy, repetitive and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous are not the same, as attests to Beethoven's 5th Symphony). As most people (including myself) tend to close their eyes when they yawn, there is much of the visual part of the drawing that will be missed by the average viewer. <br /> <br /> The plot: I am not giving away any secrets that are not yet in the plot summary - good country, bad city. This is a common theme in films, both animated and live, from that time. It is a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll, which, today, is reflected in a similar nostalgia for "values" that never existed.
