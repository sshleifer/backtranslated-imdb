This obvious pilot for an undisclosed TV series features young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with incredible powers that should be used when a demon who turns a man is loose in the world. The CGI is even for a TV job, and Appleby is good as an amnesiac, but difficult to swallow as a superhero. Familiar TV face Richard Burgi is together for the tour as Appleby's mentor, but he can not do anything to raise this dreck above the mediocre level. We see a lot of the cartoon flying demon from the start, a bad sign. In addition, the scenes in which Burgi is training Appleby for battle are laughable. They are a poor copy of similar scenes in several other films, most notably REMO WILLIAMS.
