Jeremy Northam fights a clone script "Total Recall" and a romantic disposable piece to bring life to a confusing character. Lucy Liu is formed from the debut of wood to the finish of a worker. You can not help laughing at seeing her interviews on the DVD when she uses the term "Femme fatal" and "Romance." French actress noir she is not and they do not have chemistry together. <br /> <br /> This film fails, not in the plot or in the action sequences, but in the lack of attention to detail in the film photography and prey portrait of the technology world around the main protagonists. Little attempt is made to dress the scenery to represent any landscape or contiguous cinematographic period. Cars are much of the 1990s and the architecture is hardly modern, with open plans that suggest a tight budget rather than conscious dress techniques. <br /> <br /> Technology is positively hilarious. Massive "2001: A Space Odyssey" Portable CD-ROM-powered mainframes with data collected for some unexplained reason, despite the proliferation of the communications network that even the most unsuspecting technologist today would obviously be aware of. There is an obvious lack of research done here and given the open source nature of the cyber community, the research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and a personal time. <br /> <br /> The interviews on DVD also reveal the original. The name of the movie was "Company Man," but that probably ended the hype of the Matrix. The title "Cypher" has only the slightest link to the film. Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and completely rewrote the Decalogue. <br /> <br /> This is the quality of telefilm and extremely disappointing for a long lasting production. You may have made a good sub-chart for "Alias".
