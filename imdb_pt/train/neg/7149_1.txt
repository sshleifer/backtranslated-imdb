Whoever wrote "Redline" as a great car movie should get paid by Daniel Sadek to promote this crappy amateur trash. Easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made. That makes the Showgirls look like Citizen Kane. <br /> Take all the cliches from an 80's action TV series, put bad special effects and lame characters of no relevance, and you have lively proof that Daniel Sadek should not write scripts and produce movies but must stay in real estate business. <br /> <br /> This is such a lame movie with such an idiotic plot and the most planned action sequences of all time. What offends me is not that the creators of this movie are stupid, but that they consider the film going public to be stupid enough to fall for this crap.
