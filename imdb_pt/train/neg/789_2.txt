five minutes after watching this I joined the IMDb to warn you all out there not to bother with this movie ... genre: horror? had moments of light suspense and throughout the film I was thinking to myself "some things have to happen soon" this did not happen ... when the movie was over I felt so embarrassed by the screenwriter / director that I was never the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this excuse sorry for a horror movie I went from not being the biggest fan not to watch another of his works .. <br /> <br /> I went taken by the plot summary, please do not make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 for the actors ... they were not bad and it was not their fault. bad direction
