The opening scene was the best thing about this movie, because it gave you the hope of seeing a well-crafted and passionate independent film. Damn it the opening fired for filling me with hope. As the "movie" progressed slowly and slowly, my thoughts varied in relation to this "movie": was there too much butter in my popcorn? Have the actors had to PAY the director to be in that "movie"? Did I receive my validated ticket in the box office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! This would be the only exception I will make in watching a movie at home in a movie theater, because at home you can turn it off. Was there any redeeming value? Peter Lemongelli as the "nerd" standard college had his moments, especially on a dog leash. Other than that, this "movie" went from trying to be a comedy, a family drama to a spiritual exalter. It was unsuccessful on any of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was really bad. His performance was the only comedy I found.
