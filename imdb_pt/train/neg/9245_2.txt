This video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995. Well done! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have great chemistry on the screen when they talk about what the Start button does. I'm waiting for Microsoft to release a full-length DVD with deleted scenes, comments from Bill Gates, a documentary on how Windows 95 compares to Windows XP and more! <br /> <br /> General: 10/10 (Must have won at least one Golden Globe)
