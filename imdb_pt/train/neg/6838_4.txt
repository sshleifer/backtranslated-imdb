Synopsis of the Plot: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, is murdered along with his wife by his associates. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, are separated. 25 years later, Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, a smuggler who lives in Hong Kong, join forces to avenge the murder of their parents and claim the tunnel justly. <br /> <br /> This is the second time. that Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Lettich worked together, having previously done "Lionheart". This is also the first of three films featuring Van Damme playing double roles ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicant" are the others). The plot is a very simplistic view on the revenge story, the only redeeming feature of the film being the performance of Van Damme as two very different people ?? the rich and affected boy and the tough - and - tumble, the tough guy in the cigar. Meanwhile, Van Damme does not do a good job on any of the roles, although his opinion on Alex is a bit of fun. It is confusing to have the brothers confused one with the other, with them wearing different clothes and having different hairstyles. Bun Yeung is a very decent henchman of bandits.
