Your mind will not be satisfied by this no? Thriller budget of the end of the world; but, well, who is the will? A young couple spends the real end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens disguised as Church people. <br /> <br /> Little thematic tour _apocalyptically, the END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and lack of coolness and style. of the purely 50's similar films. And not only that, but the EOTW plays as a hybrid - not just the Last Judgment, but the convent also creeps. The villain in the film is a well-known actor. <br /> <br /> This totally shameless sloppiness looks like an exploration of the convent, a genre of the 1970s that seems so outdated today. Anyway, the secret lab of the convent is a kind of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of the end of the world; but the end of the world is not at all your pride!
