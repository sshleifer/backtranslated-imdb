The words "Swedish" and "Action movie" do not mix. This becomes more and more obvious with all the attempts made in the genre. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works at a military airbase with top-secret computer systems. One day, foreign criminals threaten to hurt their family if they do not do what they are told. They want the secret equipment and will do everything they can to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has ups and downs. And generally in Swedish action films there are no "ups", only "downs". So I think something in this movie showed some quality. To begin with the positive remarks, I can mention that the film is technically well done. The filming of airplanes and helicopters flying are well filmed and look really cool. The performance is of variable quality. Shanti Roney does a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is tough and unnatural as usual (I wonder how long the Swedish directors will continue to use her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank?). Stefan Sauk is risible as the man of the "legal" special forces coming to the base to investigate. <br /> <br /> What about the action scenes? As well as I said above the backstage of airplanes and flying helicopters are good. But besides that, there is not much action to speak. And that's a common problem in Swedish action films. There simply is not enough action going on. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's a movie making culture. I do not know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because, frankly, the story and the acting are not good enough for this movie to rely on just that. <br /> <br /> I rate this 4/10 for effort.
