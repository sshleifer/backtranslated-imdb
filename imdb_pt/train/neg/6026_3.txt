* Review may contain spoilers * Predictable, exaggerated special effects. has a feeling of TV movie. The idea of ​​the UN as being dominated by Satan is an interesting turn-around for the end of the world, according to the Bible. the premise is interesting, but his excitement falls quickly. If you want to convert people to Christianity with a film like that, at least make a quality movie! I was gravely checking my watch while watching this piece of drink. I can not say much more about this movie since I've seen it for over a year, and there's not much to say about this movie other than ... skip it!
