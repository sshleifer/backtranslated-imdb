I just saw this movie on a local TV station ("Big Chuck and Little John" on TV8 in Cleveland, Ohio). I had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I do not know any thesaurus that might even help me describe how bad this movie really is. The script is horrible. The performance, very different from one of two exceptions, is useless since there is nothing in this material that deserves any real effort. <br /> <br /> It seems a lot of small ideas, leftovers from several writing sessions, which where thrown in the blender. It's not just funny. The "parody" aspect is strained at best. Some references are almost out of date (even for the moment of their release). No wonder I've never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything that Saturday Night Live, MAD TV or even In Living Color erased on their worst days. <br /> <br /> If you watch on TV, it's a great example of how NOT to make a movie. Whatever you do do not lose a cent. <br /> Adam
