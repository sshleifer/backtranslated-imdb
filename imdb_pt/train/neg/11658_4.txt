Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 movies as there is not much plot, bad acting, very boring and some really cheesy jokes. But. And that's great, but there's a good actor, a good recurring joke and a good start. The good actor who is Tim Curry, the only good recurring joke is the scary, weird butler with the disgusting hand that always makes fun, but laughs worthy things. And the good start is the parody of the Excorsist. <br /> <br /> The plot for Scary Movie 2 is the main characters of the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to spend the night in a chilling. old mansion, but will they survive the night? This movie is not very good, but if you are bored, you can watch it!
