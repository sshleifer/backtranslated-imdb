What to say about this movie Well, it's about a lot of good students who have some bad drugs and become delinquent students who sell more bad drugs to people. Two of these people have adverse effects when they become a type of toxic avenger and his girlfriend vomits some creature that grows in the basement of the school. That's all there is and they extend it for 84 minutes. This movie is very bad and should be locked forever. While this is not fair, some people like the Troma movies and can watch if they want. But Troma movies to me, though, are the worst movies out there. I just watched this out of morbid curiosity.
