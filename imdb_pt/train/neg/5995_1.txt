This is a truly horrible movie. What they did was get a TV show, which was never directed at young children, and give him George Lucas's treatment (ie ruin him by making him attractive to the younger crowd). <br /> <br /> OK, so the Thunderbirds TV show was not exactly the most cerebral of the shows, it was actually stereotyped, but it was always nice to watch (especially when the models exploded) and the voice cast did not it was so bad. <br /> <br /> This suffers from bad casting and bad acting (with the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope and Ron Cook as Parker who appear to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be touched) after this farce, I would not leave the direct traffic of Frakes. <br /> <br /> The main point of the Thunderbirds was that it was about the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team, avoiding disaster or rescuing those involved in disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this garbage like the plague. <br /> <br /> I only give 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported.
