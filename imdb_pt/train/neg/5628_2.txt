I'm not an artistically inclined individual. I am a science-minded woman and felt that this movie was perhaps one of those artsy campy type movies on a budget. I watched part of it with my fianc√© and my future adoptive daughter. We tried very hard to find something in this movie to keep our interest. My fiance and his daughter voted for him and we moved to Ocean's 13, but that's another story. Not to be dissuaded, I woke up the next morning and gave the movie another chance. I started again by watching this movie seriously. I just did not get it, I thought I could do it. I thought the funniest part was the blush of ashes and the urn finding a spot near the hearth being used as a vase for what looked like dead flowers. Interesting and still had dead things inside. It was a strange and bizarre movie. Maybe that's what they were after, however, I will not be fooled a second time!
