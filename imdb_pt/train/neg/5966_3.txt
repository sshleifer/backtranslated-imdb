Wow!! I watched the trailer for this one and though 'nah, this is not for me'. I saw my husband and the faces of our friends during the trailer, and I knew this was a 'boy movie'. I mean, hello! A bunch of dancing chick-girls - another striptease? <br /> <br /> So, I started to watch, it did not seem that bad. So I kept watching. I watched until the end. What a wonderful film. if anything, this is a girl's movie. these girls have attitude. it's really a well-being film and a little love story. really leaves you with a cool feeling. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story of a girl from a small town becoming big in the city, after passing through the usual big city, c ** p. there have been some of these, is almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think about your life and what you have achieved. well, I do anyway. I think it's because the whole job in a bar scene is very familiar, not only to me but to many people I know. Do not rely on the trailers for this - it aims to bring the men inside.
