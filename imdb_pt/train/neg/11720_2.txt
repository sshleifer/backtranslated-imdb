I read in the papers that W.Snipes was broken, so it's no wonder he took part in low-budget projects like The Contractor. He's just the next action star to join a growing club: the action stars of the '90s (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he stars the protagonist in a cheap action movie that was filmed in Bulgaria (supposedly we believe the place is London, as only a complete idiot would buy it). The story is that of another 1000 films: retired face special forces is hired by the government again to do a wet job - after the government wants to get rid of it - good guy stays away after killing thugs (was it a spoiler? ) The star of the film: The Girl (Eliza Bennett) beats everyone else in the cast! A star is for her another star for eye drops Lena Headey, makes 2 stars. Only for the hardest Snipes fans! All Others: Avoid!
