I was gifted with this movie for having such a premise, the friendship of three women involved by someone who fell in love with a younger man. <br /> <br /> Intriguing. <br /> <br /> NO! I rush to add. All these women are drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of each other and conspiring and trying to overthrow each other. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could not go wrong in my book before seeing this, but here they get a dark script and say to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which does not work very well when women are all well-known professionals in a very small town. <br /> <br /> And by Smart Women spend a whole pile of time lamenting the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I felt that a lot more could have been done with a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot came to nothing and those women who smoked / drank (all over the age of forty) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene "Screw the baby, give me a cigarette!" Right. <br /> <br /> Like I said, a shame of a waste. 4 out of 10.
