This is a film of immense appeal to a relatively well defined group (of which I am not a part). I went to a preview of this movie without knowing what to expect - I finally found it disappointing. The story of a terribly dysfunctional (often totally "distorted") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. An epic saga like this should really provide viewers with something more in the end. Ultimately, images like this are about the human condition - this image barely sheds light on its most significant facets.
