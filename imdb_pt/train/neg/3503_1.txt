And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky and irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so bold, boring and worthy of yawning. She is also totally lacking in anything humorous. The expressionlessness with which she tries to deliver her lines is dead when she arrives, because she is not funny. I watched two segments of his program and was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> Damn, my son (19 years old) saw his promos at Comedy Central and said she was a "dumb girl". I thought that was a compliment. The one where she says "Watch my show or I'll kill my dog" is really believable. I know she wants to be a comedian. She only appears like a crazy deformed. I never want to see her again next to my dog.
