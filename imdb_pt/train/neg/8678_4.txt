After watching "The Bodyguard" last night, I felt compelled to write a review. <br /> <br /> This could have been a decent movie if it was not for the lousy camera work. It was beyond annoying. The angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the fight sequences. The closes were really awful. <br /> <br /> The story has Sonny Chiba hiring himself as a bodyguard for anyone who wants to take him to the top of a drug ring. He is approached by Judy Lee, who is never very direct with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, since the Mafia and another gang of thugs are behind her. <br /> <br /> The story was decent and, despite horrible dubbing, this could have been a good movie. Given the best direction and editing, I'm sure this would have been a classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it's more like another 1970s action movie. Note: The opening sequence has a quotation familiar to Pulp Fiction fans, and then continues to a karate school in the Times Square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
