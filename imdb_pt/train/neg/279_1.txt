Wow, here it is finally; the action "movie" without action. In a real low-budget setting (do not miss the hilarious flying saucers that fly over a few times) from a future Seattle, we find a brainless hard body looking to avenge its childhood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing remotely original or interesting about the plot and performance of the actors is only rivaled in stupidity by attempts to steal from other films, especially the "Matrix" without having the money to do right. Yes, we can see some running on the walls and shooting in slow motion (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are as cool as the stupid hardbody attempts to make jokes about male incompetence every once in a while. <br /> <br /> And, yes, we also get a series of leads that get absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought by the previously invisible cast while filming the scenes. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it's as bad as it gets. In fact, it does not deserve to be taken seriously, but maybe I can make some of you not rent it and save your money.
