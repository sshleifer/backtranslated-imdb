<br /> <br /> If any charge was intentional it should be taken into consideration. If there were still feeling cracks between Caucasians and African Americans in Georgia in 2000, as shown in this film, obviously there is still a somewhat backward mentality among many people out there. It is hypocritical, to say the least, if everyone loves Halle Berry, Whoopie Goldberg, Beyonce, Noemi Campbell, Denzel Washington, Will Smith, et. while, on the back, manifest racial divisions persist. <br /> <br /> The white grandmother suddenly imposes a black granddaughter on her, only to meet her black grandfather in a very white social backwater. The story is sweet, not lacking in tragic tones, and eminently predictable as in most of these types of TV movies, although the final scene has guessed ............ will it? will not he .......? <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere interpretation, and Louis Gossett is a good match for her; Little Penny Bae, fortunately, does not steal the show. <br /> <br /> A 'nice' way to relax after Sunday lunch without having to force your mind too hard, though you may come across a little nap in the middle of it.
