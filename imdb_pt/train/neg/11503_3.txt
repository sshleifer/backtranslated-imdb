Quentin Crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully, one is romantic. When things are unbearably dark, they are realistic. And when something gets the ironic treatment, they are in place. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second category. This director obviously tried very hard to make a Spanish "Ken Loach" movie, without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters, which elevate Loach's films from being simply "depressing." Los lunes al sol, is just that, just depressing. Things are not realistic. The final moments of the unhappiness of the characters reach the climax at the same point, and if the sad story is not enough, Aranoa ends the story with a visually gray and dirty color palette. The films were ridiculously overrated in Goyas. A film that shows empathy for the weakest citizens of society, in this case unemployed people harbor workers, does not automatically create a good movie, although I am the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This film can only make me disinterested in its destiny. In 21st century Spain, the unemployed do not live as beggars, and public transport rafts have decent bathrooms, and it is difficult to find a bar with so few customers and little happiness to be found in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously does not have a clue about Spain's working class, and does not do them any favors. Pretender is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene in which men watch a free football game was copied directly from a film that deals much more realistically with the theme of the "poverty" trap, that is, "Purely Belter," which is much more engaging , humorous. and still sad.
