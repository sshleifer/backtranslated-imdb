I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life, as well as for her talent as an actor. I therefore found it strange that she appeared in a film that distorted these facts so much. The rescue of his character from the South Pole was made by a Canadian company from Edmonton, Alberta, piloting a Twin Otter aircraft designed and built in Canada. The trip was denied by the US Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard, in addition to its capabilities. The same company held a similar rescue a few years later to bring a man from the base of the South Pole. I feel that the film was quite a very exciting subject and documented a very brave woman before a daunting task. I can not understand why the producers would find it necessary to ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a USAF Hercules.
