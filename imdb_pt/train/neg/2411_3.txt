Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick, who lives with his brother in Oklahoma City, where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then one night, Rick's brother is shot by a street gang who fought with him earlier. Desperate, Rick calls on his scientist partner to bring in the latest formula they've been working on that brings diseased blood cells to health. The formula has not been tested on a human, or even a dead body, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. It gives the body a double dose of the formula, but nothing happens. Then Rick calls 911 and the body is taken away so that he comes back to life and delights in human flesh. Now Rick must find his brother zombie before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead. Hood of the living dead is a piece of garbage. The plot is a direct rip of Resident Evil, the acting is simply horrible, especially with Rick's false cry for his brother, the guns are so fake, because every time the gun is fired, sparks are emitted, and the makeup is only lame. It's just fake blood covered by the faces of the actors. Zombies are also modified. They run, growl and must be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should only fight, moan and must be hit in the brain to die! This movie is so horrible that the outtakes is the only real good time in this movie. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a bit of entertainment here and there but only succeeds as a low budget festival.
