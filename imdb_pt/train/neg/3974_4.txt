I agree with everything Calamine said! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it's time for the girls to go on to better roles. I would like to see them succeed as they were a very inspiring couple growing up and I would like to see them grow as people, actresses and in their career as well as in their personal lives. So producers, please give girls a chance to develop something that goes a little off the tangent, moving them into a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talents in many facets. This movie that is being commented is not so bad, but as I have seen in other films, their films are still the same as the typical plot and typography. When in Rome it is good for the younger generation's audience but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and therefore think we adults would like to see them make films of different kinds, maybe some are like the sixth sense, the time, the chocolate, that kind of movie - do not say have only serious movies for them, humorists too, yes, but see them in different roles for what they have played in their movies newer ones like this one and the New York Minute. (Note: I'm from Australia, so sorry for my strange spelling as I recognize with s instead of z)
