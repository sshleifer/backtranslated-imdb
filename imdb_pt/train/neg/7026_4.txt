On his birthday, a little boy tells his mother that he is not his son, and that he wants to go home with his real mother. <br /> <br /> In a way, Comedy De L'Innocence seems to come from a different movie era, perhaps from the 60s or 70s. I certainly remembered the Secret Ceremony of Losey (1968), and the Complete Circle of Richard Loncraine (1977), both dealing with loss, sadness and relationships between parents and "lost" children (curiously both films star Mia Farrow). > <br /> All three films are filled with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and inexplicable ways. All three films have a cold feeling, both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-child relationships, and ultimately all three films pose the question - "what is real, what is imagined?" <br /> <br /> Beautiful, but imperfect, does not offer easy answers and leaves much hanging, inexplicable and strange.
