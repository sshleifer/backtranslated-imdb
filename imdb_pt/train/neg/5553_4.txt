This third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but still much worse than the original movie. What made this better than the D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy was changed and Durant was not brought back. Besides, there was really some hint of character development when it came to the bandit's family and Darkman himself. It made my heart soften and I gave this movie as much as 4/10, ie ** / *****.
