I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. Actually, I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One more of Hollywood's faint attempts to come up with a new idea. Glad I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They should give Nic Cage a hat and a bull whip. Swashbucklin '. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas outweighs this "lemon." People who are completely and totally commercialized (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this movie had been animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I'd rather pay to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was an incredibly stupid movie and made an even more incredibly sad attempt to hide this FACT. <br /> <br /> Every SHEEP seems to love it.
