I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a good Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This movie, however, scared the hell out of me. You may be wondering, how could a movie about Santa scare someone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one of his subordinates, Pitch, to Earth in an attempt to kill Santa Claus and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon from hell to kill Santa. Pitch chases Santa throughout Christmas Eve in an attempt to trap him on the ground when the sun rises on Christmas Day, because if Santa can not get back to his home in space, he turns to dust. Do not get me wrong, the movie is funny and quite entertaining, however, the image of demons and demons dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is simply creepy.
