The Underground Comedy Movie, is possibly the worst train accident I've ever seen. Luckily I did not pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to see him again, for being so horrible, but he needed to prove to me how horrible it was. I love comedy of colors. I imagined that at least I would have this and I would be entertained. No, instead, the acting was so horrible, the "jokes" were extremely extravagant, and the plot was no where to be found. Maybe it should not be a plot, so I can not hold it against this movie. It's very sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit by a bat ..... by Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat. Hilarious. Simply genius. I have the feeling of watching this movie that its creators did and laughed hysterically with their friends about it. Maybe this was full of inner jokes that we just did not understand. Or maybe it's the worst piece of crap ever made and must be locked in a safe and thrown into the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> Q. Do not buy this movie!
