Throw this lame dog a bone. Sooo bad ... you can watch anyway. Kol (Ross Hagen) is an evil intergalactic guy who escapes being vaporized by a zealous spacecraft commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol manages to steal a space shuttle that crashes on Earth. An unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the dead or living villain. John Phillip Law plays a ranger / park who asks for caution when dealing with these two visitors from far, far away. Costumes are scandalous and the script has no intelligence. Vincent certainly took the money and ran. The law shows the only sign of effort. So bad that it's almost comical. Also in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Smith.
