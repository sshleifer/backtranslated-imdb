It's interesting in the beginning. A naive ranger (Colin Firth) marries a beautiful and mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) who has only recently known. They look happy, so she disappears without warning. He searches for her and, after a few dead ends, faces part of his abused childhood and his recent past, which may include criminal activities. And then, it seems the filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. The beginning, though not as suspenseful as it seems, is at least watchable. So stop being interesting or even makes a lot of sense. And the end is so dumb, so monotonous and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you'll think the writers did not know what to do with it and got tired of trying. What a waste of a good idea!
