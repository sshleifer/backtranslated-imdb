From the star of "MITCHELL", from the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are slogans that usually prevent me from seeing this movie. And the worst part is that all of the above statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every other five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake of "Coogan's Bluff"
