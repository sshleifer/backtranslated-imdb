Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a bad script and a bad direction. This is the case of "The Tomb of the Mummy". <br /> <br /> The script is a leftover from earlier and better horror films like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein." The direction is banal and obsolete. The acting is mediocre. Even Chaney's Kharis are weak compared to Tom Tyler's in "The Mummy's Hand," and the producers are foolish enough to add images of Christy Cabanne's much better prequel and point to the weakness of their own movie! <br /> <br /> I realized how bad this movie was, and essentially redo it from scratch two years later as "The Mummy Ghost" with a much better screenplay and better director. The result was probably the best film in his four films "Mummy," although not as good as the 1932 original by Karl Freund. <br /> <br /> The filming of Cabanne elevates this film to 3. The "new" stuff is a 2 at best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably glad to see their characters being wiped out so they did not have to show up in a pile of crap!
