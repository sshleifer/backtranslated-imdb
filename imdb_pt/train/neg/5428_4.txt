Another film Priyadarshan / Vohra another film that was seen for TP instead of real desire, the only reason I saw this movie was the fact that regulars were not there in this film (Akshay Paresh and many others), but needless to say I had low expectations with this movie. <br /> <br /> I was happy with the cast in general, except Rajpal Yadav, who once again irritates without limit, he nonetheless draws a few laughs, but these were those original no-joke standard antics actually this whole movie is like playing dhol, I mean it takes almost no talent to make loud noise, or even play the strange good beat on dhol for a little time is not it ?? They are just those who get to carry different beats in a nice sequential manner, for an extended period being considered great. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the other instrument, Dumroo hardly requires any talent, has no variations, and can be enjoyable for a time that the monkey dance (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but no is an instrument that will entertain you for a long time or even make you dance like Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This movie was like dhol and dumroo being played, sometimes Dhol was sometimes played the dumroo, sometimes the two of them together, but mostly Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like any other 24 year old, sooner or later I was bored. <br /> <br /> The film has some good Dhol moments (good ones) but after a while all I heard was the annoying Dumroo (fun initially, then tolerable and annoying), the big parties really guarantee that this film is mostly good for some funny clips in "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you have not already watched, see on Filmy, it comes at night and it's very funny) This movie had its moments, the actors did a good job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can act, I saw him in the main Meri Patni) who annoys more than entertain, I've said it many times and I'll say again that I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a great career ahead in the comedies multi-star, especially. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were very funny. like the aborted attempts to impress the girls' father, the crazy attempts to win the girl and take her away from each other. <br /> <br /> But after that was over, Attempting to make this movie into a lot more with an added mystery, this means that once the girl was in, the next 45-60 minutes was increasingly torturous, the climax was "SO BAD YOUR ALMOST GREAT CATEGORY", I mean what they thinking if you had to have a tense end, at least make some attempt to make it palatable. <br /> <br /> The film is also extremely predictable, there is hardly a scene that you can not predict and you will not be breaking into spontaneous laughter. here, it's more like you see her and almost start laughing before the gag. <br /> <br /> The film follows a gradual decline throughout the films, except for the strange collision, down or up, and then falls quickly once they befriended the girl. Most of the really bad scenes were in the end, one that the movie tries to be more than a comedy from the factory, too many of the jokes were very, very stale and smelled of repetition, THE LAST 10- 15 WAS ESPECIALLY DISTATEFULL AND COMPLETELY SPOILS THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I did not find Tanushree Datta as the mermaid she would play, and her talent in acting is in serious question, especially in view of her unattractive looks, if you can not be a HOT and can not act How long can you survive. <br /> <br /> Technically also this film was weak, with the constant feminine look and poor lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> The songs, except for The title track was also not good, when the songs played in the second half I could feel the collective sigh of the audience. <br /> <br /> Throughout a movie that is simply ordinary just because of the cast, and very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoiding this will not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if you have to be watched watching on TV for free or a very cheap matinee or something is a must, if you pay full multiplex fees, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> -s many obsolete jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINUTES AND LAST 15 MINUTES ESPECIALLY, technically bad, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s tries to be more than what it was, not the regular cast (I'm happier about it), Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + s some good scenes heading to the beginning, title song, good acting and cast except RY. <br /> Overall 4.5 / 10 (I'm trying to be objective here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie really met my very low expectations, so I'm giving it the benefit of all doubts, on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4)
