"True" story of three girls who enter the Connecticut jungle and end up being hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the kind of film that would have played in the United States thirty years ago with mixed acclaim. Not particularly much of anything that the film works with its low budget for mixed results. The film is watchable, but not at all scary (blame as some of the attacking scenes for this). It's the kind of movie you'll probably forget when you're done. The odds are you'll never think of seeing this unless it's delivered to you by someone and you say, "Look here," which is what happened to me. If you get a copy, return it, the movie is not worth the effort to see it, even if it's watchable.
