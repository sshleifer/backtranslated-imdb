I hated that. If you believe everyone in the South is dumb, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, crazy religious or child molester, then this movie may be for you. Everyone is poor and apparently ignorant. In one scene, two older men are talking in a general store and one of them mentions that he molested a group of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man clearly understood this as a normal part of life. Very enjoyable. A teenage girl walks the back roads looking for her sister and no one offers to help her - despite an obvious lame and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). The character of Strathairn is not only utterly disgusting and slimy, but he is shown as a religious believer (typical of Hollywood) reflecting the vile nature of Christians. A scene in the movie very much resembles the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNiro) - Bible verses being cast by the villain. I'm from the Great Northwest, but I found this movie offensive because of the wonderful people I know who are from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.
