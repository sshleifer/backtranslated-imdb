Sorry, not good. <br /> <br /> It gets interesting, but loses its way a few minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> It does not help much that none of the great actors normally (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto etc.) delivers really good performance. <br /> <br /> It may be due to the fact that I saw a dubbed version (in German), but Dennis Quaid's character was especially wooden and boring, and Danny Glover is not a real villain. In addition, the character of Jared Leto does not really contribute to the story (except saving the life of a main character at one point, but this scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper in a submarine in the first place ;-) <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really the tangled plot and clich√©: The detective (of course!) has to solve a personal problem with the villain and is (of course!) Suspended from his official duties , courtesy of your personal involvement. The killer (of course!) * Wants * to be tracked and plays a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years ... I do not know how many movies build a similar storyline - most of them are better, though. <br /> <br /> The plot has many holes and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute or work well with the plot at all (eg, the truck stop scene or the car at the edge of the cliff etc. We have seen * much * finer finals with a similar type of final battle configuration in a train-in-a-helpless-winter-landscape ... In the end, there is the supposedly moving meeting of father and son ... mushy, at least.
