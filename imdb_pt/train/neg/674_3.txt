I am known for falling asleep during the movies, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, very tired, being warm and comfortable in the sette and having just eaten too much. However, on this occasion, I fell asleep because the film was crap. The development of the plot was constant. Constantly slow and annoying. Things seemed to happen, but without explanation of what was causing them or why. I admit, I may have missed part of the movie, but I watched most of it and everything seemed to happen on its own without any real concern for anything else. I can not recommend this movie at all.
