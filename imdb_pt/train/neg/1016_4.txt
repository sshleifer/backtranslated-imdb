The movie itself is not so bad; many comments have pointed to the obvious flaws of the script, but it is watchable. What really gives me shivers is that people like Justin Timberlake are even scaled to movies and, above all, to movies like that. I have to admit that I had never heard the man's name before watching this, but the instant he appeared I was simply irritated. The voice is crap, the face is a lousy idiot of Legolas, the posture is horrible, and he can not even properly coordinate all three. Said to say, I was blown away when he jumped after leaving the nightclub because I was hoping that from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason I give this 4. <br /> <br /> I watch a lot of movies with Timberlake's little cast ... and I can not believe .
