Gods, I have not watched such a horrible movie for a long time. Maybe not since 'The New Guy' or several Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes, it's so frighteningly awful. The white and wooden performance of Mira Sorvino must surely have been inspired by Freddie. The staging of the film was strange (like a play, and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well in the film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was horrible and her sexual appeal non-existent here, so it was painful to see her "seducing" other characters and they "falling" for it. And what about the occasional shots of a live audience in garden chairs? Meaningless! I had to turn off the DVD player, it would be a self-inflicted pain to finish this movie.
