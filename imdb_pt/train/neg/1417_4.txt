During the beach vacation, the red-haired brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (as Arthur and Petey Loomis) find a seal. The boys call their "Sammy" animal and spend the summer playing with the sandy sea lion. When it is time to go home, the boys begin to suffer separation anxiety. Does young Mr. McGreevey decide that he can not take "Sammy" back to "Disneyland" ?? er, "Gatesville" - but young Mr. Mumy packs it anyway. At home, they try to hide "the" Way-out "seal of adults, and, of course? hijacks follow! <br /> <br /> Sammy - The Seal of the Way, 1 (28/10/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevey, Bill Mumy, Robert Culp
