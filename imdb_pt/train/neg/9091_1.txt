Seriously, I read some of the reviews on this movie, and I have to ask, were you watching the same movie? <br /> <br /> Yes, I give the set directors a lot of credit for power to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles, but so what? <br /> <br /> No character is friendly, history seems aimless, Karen Black simply is not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just disgusting. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me wish the animated version.) So you had the scary kid actor, the scary Billy Barty, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies movie fans love and the rest of us look at each other and say, "What the hell!"
