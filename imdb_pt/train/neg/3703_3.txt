I did not expect much from this movie, but boy-o-boy, I did not expect the movie to be that bad. Chris Rock is not showing a good act here, you may not have the feeling that your character is real, I think the film would have been a bit better if it were drama or romantic scenes would have been a smaller part of the movie and more humor was involved. The movie is how the filmmakers were having a bad hangover. In "making of" they do not show a single smile. This is a really bad movie! I gave three of ten because of the few smiles they gave me, but I never laughed!
