First of all this movie is not a comedy; Unless you really force yourself, you can barely laugh. Secondly, the film is slow and boring. The acting is not bad, but it's not special. There's a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with a big nose and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town ... you'll laugh a lot more if you read this instead of wasting time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source for a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a similar comedy "The Home Masters"; this had some good times. My last comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring movie.
