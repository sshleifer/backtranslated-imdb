I own this movie. Not by choice, I do. I was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me. So I put it on the old VCR and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying "Why God, why?". The plot was not so bad, as a player I could appreciate bits of it. I think maybe, if you're into romantic scenes of cheese geek, you'll like this movie. "I always thought of myself as a Vulcan you know as Dr.Spock ... unable to love" There are very few good things to say about this movie, it really sucks. But if you're really making a bad movie, this is the best for you !!! The real story is much more interesting, however; <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this movie in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
