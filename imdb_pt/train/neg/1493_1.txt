I really do not understand how people made this movie and I thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more intriguing are those who watched this movie without feeling cheated in 88 minutes doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> First of all, they certainly could have found real Irish people, and some pretty women who could deliver their speeches better than the weary and downcast porn stars scattered throughout the film. Granted, the blood works - but strangely, it's not as troublesome as you think of seeing organs ripped from the hot (old) hot bodies of porn stars, left and right. It probably has something to do with the fact that after your horrible and inhuman acting you just want them to die of pain. <br /> <br /> So if you do not mind the following: <br /> <br /> - acting (seriously, everyone sucked. <br /> I've never witnessed this before. <br /> <br /> ALL sucked). <br /> <br /> (Some bad horror movies are remotely linear, or at least surprising. <br /> <br /> Film does not make sense unless you're as destroyed as the writers obviously were). <br /> <br /> - theme (Nothing to learn from this movie. Nothing to scare into bed at night, nothing to contemplate or understand, or explain to others). <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap. Music as common and dull as the script). (It could have been the saving grace of this movie, but no ... nothing nice here. Even the rocks are fake). <br /> <br /> So, yes. If you do not mind this, and you're just a teenager thrilled with musical tastes and "women", this movie is for you. Positive comments: interesting cinematography sometimes wasted on the other elements. Gore very realistic; again, wasted. But the gut scene is classic. I agree with the mutant dismemberment solves the problem of the false accent.
