- Bad things: This movie sucks. Bad tricks for one thing, they looked so fake that I thought this was "The Twilight Zone". Flashbacks are pretty much useless. Part of the movie, he thinks taking his anger out of a window will make his life better. I want to meet the casting director and if he was stuck because the acting, even of the adults, was horrible. A kissing scene in this movie even sucked. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I do not recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> Good things: I do not know what I can really say. There are some suspense parts that make you go, but they are quickly plagued by stunt work and acting. <br /> <br /> - My Verdict: Do not watch.
