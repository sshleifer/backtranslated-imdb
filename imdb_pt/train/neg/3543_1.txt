I've been lurking for two years or more. I've never been moved to post here before, so maybe this movie is worth a star for this, but I doubt it. I watched on DVD, having lost in the movies due to illness and have never been able to watch it until now. I had not read much about it, certainly not even thought about the movie in a few months. That's exactly what his friend got in the store, so he was assisted. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The shot that I said at the top of the summary is in the trailer and the poster. From the beginning, Jason Statham has hair. Like no other GR movie. Or any JS movie I've seen. At least not in the quantities shown here. And Ray Liotta in briefs should be advised in advance. It's scary and funny, but not in a fun way. Its more in the almost-the-office-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-failed-type-of-humor. Each of them says the same thing: "This movie is not like anything you expect this movie to be." <br /> <br /> Now, based on the previous, extensive experience of watching movies, I expected this movie to be a movie. few things. Like: <br /> <br /> () Consistent, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or engaging, <br /> <br /> () Not a complete and complete revelation of looking at the navel, <() Something more substantive than a heterogeneous flock of ill-fated fables from what is just a standard oriental mystical ideology, dressed as a "modern, intelligent and self-conscious art form" () I hope it's better than "The Idiots". <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed by my tone, he could not check the box above. Instead it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Very poorly edited (pace throughout the store, 70s-amateur high-style 8 jump cuts, incomprehensible "plot" "twists !!!" delivered through flash back mounts, I could continue ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Shot as if by a 14-year-old gothic who had just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with drawn curtains <br /> <br /> (x) So, your own back with the whole "I'm really smart, I" motive / message, you feel determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or more, just to make sure that dumb people (ie, everyone who does not like them) in the audience make sure they understand the point, <br /> <br /> (x) A genuine waste of my time. <br /> <br /> As for the unquestioned ability of some people to "get" something out of it, that's fine. I'm glad you liked. A poster said something that caught my attention: those under 25 probably understood better because of the issue. Maybe, but editing should make your work more accessible, not less. As for the "genius only recognized by the brigade" out there, go suck an onion and grow. There is nothing prettier and selfish than the people who say that the other person does not know the great art is because they do not understand the 'craft / materials / cycle of the moon / filaments of supreme rational thought' than the 'author / poet / artist / palm reader / wise idiot 'is using to explain his' vision / grand scheme / drive with Gaia / big sick dog pail'. <br /> <br /> For me and many, many more people, your trash. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poetry, anything designed to be seen by another human being should be engaging and exciting. In some direction, be it metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you are having. <br /> <br /> The only way this moved me was forward in time, two hours closer to my own inevitable end. "The biggest trick he ever did was to make you believe that any part of this movie meant anything." And now, please, toast my loaves for me.
