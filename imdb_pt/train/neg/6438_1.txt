I really did not know what this movie was like when I went to the theater to see (the hype about Satanism etc etc etc), since the trailers from the last movie I saw looked very interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh dear, Roman Catholic mythology? It's not my idea of ​​a good scare and honestly, I just felt like I was watching a really good and scary movie, not some vaguely planned religious farce that tries to score cheap thrills having a girl getting blood every few minutes! <br /> I will try to keep away from the spoilers (!), but I find it very strange that an atheist, who receives a string of rosary beads from a dead priest, could suddenly do away with the wounds of Christ (stigmas are not supposed to be deeply religious?) I mean, she comes out with losers, does things that are losing, behaves like a typical rebel, and here she is exhibiting the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come on! <br /> <br /> Scenes from his crucifixion, head thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, became quite boring after seeing him a dozen times. It was neither scary nor scary, just repulsive. However, it became quite painful to watch - those flicking scenes were highly annoying ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If you're a Catholic, you definitely do not see it. If you're not, I still do not see it.
