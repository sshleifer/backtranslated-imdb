"Scary Movie 2" is a disappointment for the horror movie franchise. Scary movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good, but this was kind of annoying and not very funny. Luckily, they chose the role after that and made two more great horror films. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a group of teenagers who is cheated by their teacher to go to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not horrible, but they could have improved quite a few things. It's a bit of fun and if you like the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise, then give him a watch - but I do not think you like it so much.
