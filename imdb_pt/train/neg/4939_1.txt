Peeew that stinks! As everyone knows, it is based on some Geico insurance commercials; What no one knows is why? These commercials were fun on the first viewing at best; hardly fodder for a series. (And what the hell ABC's - as reported in the press - do you really agree to buy the character rights of Geico's cavemen for that? After all, the idea of ​​cavemen struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to TV; Phil Hartman played a recurring role on Saturday Night Live as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, more than a decade ago. And that's how a concept like this works best - as an occasional installment. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A 1960s series called "It's About Time" also used cavemen in the concept of the modern world. It lasted a season.) One of the directors of the series, who was also responsible for commercials of Geico, was recently quoted as saying, "We were so excited when we were filming our commercials because we felt we had something that was unique and we had bigger stories to tell." Wrong. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad TV, this is destined to take its place next to "Me and the Chimp", 1972, as one of the worst ever. The main actor of the embarrassing fiasco of the chimpanzees actually entered the hideout of shame by association after being abruptly canceled. No doubt our friends of cavemen will follow suit.
