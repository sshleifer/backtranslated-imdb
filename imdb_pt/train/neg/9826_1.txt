I think this would be a great movie for a true believer in the Organized Christian Dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation between Church and State and GOOD Science Fiction, is a terrible joke! There are some well-known actors who either were in deep need of work or had the need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us pagans. <br /> <br /> I was entertained by it. movie the same way I was entertained by "Reefer Madness". This film has tried to teach drug education with fear tactics in the same way that this movie attempts to teach "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery for people who otherwise do not share their interpretations of the world. <br /> It made me howl with laughter and at the same time it scared me to realize how many people really believe that our society should return to the good old days of the nineteenth century!
