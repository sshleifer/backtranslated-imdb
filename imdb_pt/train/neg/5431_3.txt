This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - a lot of crazy characters on some silly mission. His signature climax has the entire cast of the movie coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit about hidden money. Whether it's a winning lottery ticket at Malamaal Weekly, black money at Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" at Phir Hera Pheri, etc., etc., the director is becoming ridiculously predictable. Do not misunderstand me; as clich√© and absurd as his films may be, I usually end up enjoying the comedy. However, in most of his previous films, there was really good humor (being Hungama and Hera Pheri worthy of note). Now, the hilarity of his films is disappearing while he is using the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks incredible. Rajpal Yadav is annoying, and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is fine, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
