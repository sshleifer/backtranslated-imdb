I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd give your sister a chance, Rain Phoenix. I regret checking this out. She was ashamed and the movie only has this weird plot, if that's what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits in a bathroom that both sleep with this old man in the mountains, what's going on? I've never been so dissatisfied in my life. It was just crap. I can not believe the actors agreed to make such a waste of film, money, time and space. Having Sissy being 'beautiful' did not catch me. I thought she was anything but. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHAT IS THE POINT ??? 0 out of 10, sorry that the poll does not have a 0, it does not even deserve a 1. I hope Rain is better in other movies, I forgive her for this performance, I mean, I would not do much better with this movie.
