Dewaana as a movie goes through the usual cliches. Man and woman fall in love and get married, the husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants the fortune of his family, the wife marries again and surprise husband surprise No. 1 reappears. The film is reminiscent of Chandni's Yash Chopra and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan perform well. Amrish Puri as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain Nadeem Shravan's music is superb, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge pyar tummy or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the motions.
