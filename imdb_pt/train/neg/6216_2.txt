9, the movie I was looking forward to for months ... was little more than a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the lack of history and development of strange characters from 9. All the incredible action sequences in the world do not make up for a single unfriendly character. Strangers, almost thrown into hidden sequences, were not just out of place, they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists ... why suddenly he turns into an aspiring necronomicon with mystical symbols and ghost lines of green magic instead of giving answers to what could have been extremely frightening story devices ?? <br /> <br /> How, what, when, why ... questions that only augur if you care and become less and less likely to step away from the theater. <br /> <br /> A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth ... I watched this movie drawn in crayons if the story was good. But the filmmakers relied on CGI witchcraft and the name Tim Burtons to lure the crowd. Which ... was what attracted me, but he could not earn my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could have been incredible ... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from their own creators.
