The plot, character development and jokes in this movie are extremely weak. Very much a waste of time. Saving Grace's conclusion should make someone feel hot and confused as if the characters had grown through their struggles. There was no such development to make such vague and warm feelings possible. Drug jokes are clich√©s and much of the film does not ring true to life. The plot builds what is supposed to be tension, but the characters are not developed enough to care. Then it runs through a resolution of all the outstanding issues in about a minute of time on the screen, leaving the viewer feeling that they just wasted their time.
