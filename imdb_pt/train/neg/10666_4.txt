I'm a huge fan of 1930s movies and watch most of the things I see in Turner Classic Movies that is new to me. So I took a chance, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent-film comedian. I watched much less of the silent films of Lloyd than of Chaplins, but I have to say that I am a much bigger fan of Chaplin. Anyway, this movie was so flat for me that I did not finish. I can understand why his sound career was so limited, he did not get very good stuff to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing parodies (or violence in general), this is very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really liked him in Paths Of Glory, but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have entered boxing earlier because at least half of the movie (at least it looked like that) is before he gets into a ring. I can say there are lots of Lloyd fans here and this will not be a popular review but I should rate this compared to what else was out there at the time, 4 out of 10. Do not watch this for anyone trying to start liking movies old, as they may not see another with you again, very flat. For an alternative to who really liked or is looking for more little-known comedies in general I recommend "Kelly The Second" made a few years before, no one else becomes a boxing comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. Both were shown on Turner Classic Movies.
