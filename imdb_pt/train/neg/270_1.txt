I'm watching now in pink (Serbia TV station) and I must say that sucks. Shallow, no acting, very sloppy effects I mean, who made this series? <br /> <br /> This was a stupid studio attempt to make more money from the success of the movie. IT'S OK. The film was great in 1994 when it was released. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how lines are idiots in the characters' speech. I mean, did they really pay someone to write this, was it somebody relative in Studio? This is not science fiction. <br /> <br /> The movie was the bomb, the series sucks.
