First off, I had my doubts just by looking at the DVD box and reading it saying it was about the bunch of teenagers flocking to a lake where they will find do or something. Any movie that has a premise like that failed miserably, even as a horror movie, except for the first Friday of the 13th. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I just kept thinking I had to get a little better. This did not happened. Normally, I think every movie has something you can get out of it. That has nothing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself papercuts or eat dirt.
