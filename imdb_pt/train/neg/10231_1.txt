Frankly, I'm a little indignant that, based on the stunning reviews attributed to Steven Smith, I lost almost two hours on his debut offer. Were they all written by your friends? The action continues, the music is annoying and overused, the script is simply terrible and the actors (except the gardener) mediocre at best. I think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker, but to say that he is brilliant when he is not, will certainly encourage him to make the same mistakes again, ie continue writing his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture. Yes, it's your first movie, low budget etc. - I get it, but it's also out there for members of the public to buy and it's not just up to scratch.
