When I saw the commercial for this, I was seeing everything. Now, pardon me, but it's been so long since I've seen you that I do not remember what it was like. Suffice it to say that the movie I saw had no resemblance to the "movie" in which they sold me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, annoyed and incredibly disappointed with this movie. And if it was not bad enough, they had to sink even more with that horrible reggae song. Not exactly music for a horror movie, eh mon? I think if you've never seen the commercial (or trailer, I suppose) you may think this is something hot. For my money, the commercial was so much better.
