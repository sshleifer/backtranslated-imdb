What a movie dog. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is very good, but he's in the midst of a jungle of abominable scripts, mediocre directing, and most of the cast's acting. Many of the characters are miserably confused, particularly the always overrated Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> Very little works in this pretentious garbage. Much of the "character development" is done through a silly voice filled with anguish and often completely contradicts the behavior of the characters on the screen. In fact, it's hard to even find out who the voices are talking about because they describe characters so different to who we see on the screen! How should we know that Colin Friels (Javo) is an erratic, violent and unreliable junkie? One of those silly voices tells us. By crying aloud, the nature of your character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a joking voice! The real killer are the characters. All about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack, despite the fact that we are constantly reminded that they must be indigent. They are all absurdly well spoken by "junkies". None seems to have any real understanding of life in skates or kissing and yet this is to be the case with most of them. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip deserves no more attention than a TV movie matinee on weekdays. Crud like this, perfectly well filmed and technically presented but an anguished drama based on clich√©s that shoots so far from being plausible and snakes for hours without actually going anywhere. At least Noni goes to his birthday suit at every opportunity. There is no other sensible reason to bear this rubbish.
