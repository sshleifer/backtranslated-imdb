Oh, dear, Jerry may be the undisputed king of the talkshow, but movies are a completely different game, and he's out of his league. The screenplay for this movie is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and it is sad to see vaguely familiar actors like Michael Dudikoff (B'movie action movie 80's), Michael Jai White (last seen on the Sci Fi flop) . Spawn ') as well as surviving William MacNamara's games (which is involved in the only situation half-funny throughout the movie!) Lower this low for the job. If you are Jerry's fan, stay on the TV show as this is a total waste of an hour and a half. After I finished reading this, I got the last half hour of Rocky 5 on the TV, which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison, I think this is more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
