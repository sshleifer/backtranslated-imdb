I wanted so much to believe in this film, after the only form of conventional comedy that this country recognizes is that of slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it went completely to the other side - let's be cool and nervous - and left. the other side with little to show. I bet One Small Seed went crazy for it. I know SL did. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters has the comedy style to do this. Even Danny K had better timing. I'm really serious. Every time they introduced a little character I kept thinking, "Damn, that person should have been the lead!". Independently does not mean that camera work needs to be horrible. The black and white did nothing for this movie - in fact, with such a flat dialogue, it further harmed, bringing boredom to the fore. The black and white was also not sharp. The composition was horrible. The use of the music was horrible. Strangely enough, I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition of it was superb - maybe that's why the shortcomings in that movie are in my mind. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (who was funnier than the leads) before he even said anything) was talking to this movie and not David - see and you will understand. I'll bet the guys who organize Oppikoppi were discouraged. One would think that nothing happens there. I had the feeling that it could have been filmed in someone's backyard. I know ordinary guys who have much funnier, more witty and witty conversations than any of these comic books. The guy they finished with was fine. <br /> <br /> I think the comedy of SA will be in stone age a little more. Good job guys.
