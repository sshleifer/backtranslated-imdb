Here we go with another slasher movie, beautiful people and acting of all was very good! <br /> <br /> Few kids playing phone calls pranks and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids! 20 years after they are still friends, they go home huge, have fun, Drugs and Sex (no nudity) for at least half an hour of the movie! Once again they start playing tricks again! and then the killer back kills them one by one and the killer is in BIG BLACK COAT with the ax as the movie Urban Legend, the scene of the deaths is really very strange, very strange times as well. <br /> <br /> The good horror movie in this part would give 7/10 but the turnaround at the end of the movie made the whole movie a bit pointless <br /> <br /> The turnaround killed the movie for me, so I'm going to give 4/10
