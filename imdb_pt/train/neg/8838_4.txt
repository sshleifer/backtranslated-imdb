Are there similarities between Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his last film "Lantana" ?? a corpse and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives. But while "Lantana" offered some hope and resolution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unsolvable in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unhappy, perhaps even cheated. <br /> <br /> The plot - the aftermath of a fisherman's discovery a corpse floating on a remote river - is based on a tale by Raymond Carver. It became an element in Robert Altman's classic 1993 set, "Short Cuts". Lawrence uses this theme to explore and expose relationships within a small Australian community under stress. The film raises some moral questions: "Would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend?" and more poignant for the Australians. "Would it be a difference if the dead person were Aboriginal?" The performance, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music, not unlike "Picnic at Hanging Rock". <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - be prepared for a disappointment, the pace is too slow and murder is shown near the beginning, thus eliminating the element of mystery. And so we get these desolate lives and a blank ending.
