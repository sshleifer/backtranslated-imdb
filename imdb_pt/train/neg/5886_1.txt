I would have left the movie in the middle of the road if it had not been with people who liked it. The film is based on actual incidents, but it is so exaggerated that it does not look anything real. I have some psychological knowledge, I go out with many psychotherapists and I know very crazy people, so it's not that I think people like that do not exist. But in the film, the only characters who seemed consistently human were Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a sense of fun). There were some fun moments, but the overall tone of the film was somber, bizarre and unpleasant. What a waste of an excellent cast! As I watched them pass their laps, I just felt like I was attending an acting class. This was brought home during the credits, when two people were shown sitting there, without acting, without speaking. Those few moments were more fun than in the previous two hours.
