Do not do anything about it. There are many things wrong with this movie. It's cliché all the time, not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start from the beginning: characters. There's the boring, unlucky guy - giving Stiller another point in his boring and unlucky belt - the supposedly wild, but actually just normal, love interest - which Aniston plays well, but really did not need any effort to do so - fat, jovial friend, and then the variety of clichés: a boring Australian, a confident Spanish guy, etc. The plot: the beginning is a bit unusual, but then it goes into the standard style of any movie, with each plot as predictable as its average knock-knock joke. The biggest problem was that the "development" of Stiller's character really seemed to come out of nowhere - like his average playing in school, writers knew where he started and where he ended up, but did not invest enough in the middle. Finally, the so-called "jokes" were nothing more than highly diluted versions of coarse standard humor; there was a regulatory scene, sweaty fat men, etc. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the simple fact of this movie is that learning the meaning of the word 'shart' was the only good thing. Hamburg actually prepared a dog's dinner here, and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may have attracted the viewers, but the taste left at the end was so rancid. Final comment: This movie may have been horrible, but Aniston still chose a better movie between Friends-Seasons than Kudrow's hateful "Marci X".
