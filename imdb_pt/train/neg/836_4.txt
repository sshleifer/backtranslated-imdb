A fan dedicated to TLK films, with the first being a landmark and the second probably the best sequel that Disney has ever produced, comes this movie ... Now I'm not arguing with animation, voice work, music, but that's no more than a Timon / Pumba screwloose in the TLK atmosphere. Although not bad, it does not add anything. Basically, this movie is a big joke ... and it's about all that saves. Make a true TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
