While some training scenes were realistic, many of them portrayed military instructors as ex-Nazis. Obviously, the people who wrote the screen were either anti-military or wrote a movie for this audience. <br /> <br /> I am a Vietnam veteran, and even then, military instructors who behaved in some of them would probably still be serving time in prison. <br /> <br /> And I really loved the scene where the "hero" and his friend (both private) are sitting in the Captain's office, smoking. cigarettes and talking and cursing at the captain as if he were his friend. This kind of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose of the scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, I asked myself, "What was this movie about?" as it seemed to wander all over the place without focus, except "I hate all authority." Thank God, I picked up the library and did not pay to rent it.
