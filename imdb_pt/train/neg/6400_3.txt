The comic power of Pryor and Gleason could not save this dog from the fine plot, weak script, discouraged acting and laughable continuity in editing this mess together. There are very few memorable moments, but the well dries quickly. As a kid I remember this as a Luke vehicle for the two comedian actors, but there was always something strange about the flow and feel of what was being broadcast in each scene and how it relates to the plot in general. Watching again after many years, shouts schlock-a-mania. I'm not so worried about racial controversy, as I would not mind watching a movie take that issue with a bit of lightness. The most obvious fault for me is that the scenes are arranged as an unordered and unrelated series of 2 minute comedy bits (which are not very good) that were stapled by the publisher after a whole night. the local drinking fountain. Characters change feelings and motivations into a penny, without rhyme or reason, between scenes and inside scenes, making you feel like no one has any idea what to get out of the script. Not that it was a gem to begin with. I feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marked by this disaster that should never have been done. Maybe my sense of humor has become very refined ...
