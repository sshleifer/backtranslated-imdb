This is a fascinating and horrible movie. It makes little sense to start creating a kind of strange internal logic. Well, it would be if he did not continue to walk through dead ends until eventually he struggled under the weight of his own indecision. The film can not decide whether it's a direct "Man Turns into Monster" movie, or a horrifying conspiracy movie, or a mystical movie. history of contact after death, or ... or what? Make your choice. It's just a mess. Grotesquely over and firing in all directions, leaving loose ends pounding all over the place. It was as if Tobe Hooper was taking pills from David Lynch. Unfortunately he did not take enough.
