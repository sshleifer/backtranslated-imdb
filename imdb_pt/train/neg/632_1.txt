Well, that was fun ... except for the fun part. <br /> <br /> It's my second least favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'. Let's start with the good. The teaser was incredibly well done and also emotional. Being the great animal lover I am, it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But then there's all the evil, and believe me, there's a lot of that. Little made sense, so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa ??? the dialogue was also pretty awful. There were about one or two quotable lines. <br /> <br /> And worst of all, having pretty much all the dead animals was very unpleasant for me. In the end ... what's the point? they all practically died. We learned nothing, were not entertained, and I could not find Sophia's death sad ... just very frustrating. <br /> <br /> * Star. Shame because the second season was going so well.
