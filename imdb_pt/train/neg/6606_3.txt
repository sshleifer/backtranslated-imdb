Please do not hate me, but I have to be honest, watching this movie, I had so much fun, <br /> <br /> It's a movie with a stupid cast and idiot songs !!! <br /> <br /> Unnecessary music !!! Mehbooba ... A total insult to the original A Holi .... well .. it was OK! due to tradition each movie has to have one !! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... Very stupid stupid Song jee Le ... It sounded like a Playboy Song stupid Song ... <br /> <br /> Other Than Songs. The movie was OK This was the Adaptation of Ram Gopal Verma ... If you think so, you will like this movie <br /> <br /> Well, this movie only depends on the Viewer and his judgment if he he / she would like to hit her head in the Cinema Seat OR if he / she thinks in the Directors' own look he / she would be relaxed and would take a look at this movie <br /> <br /> From any way I looked at the two ways I'd like to compliment and abuse Ram Gopal for this disaster he did ... <br /> <br /> Well, a few other things that bothered that CAST was incredibly bad. > <br /> Amitabh Bachchan Like Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his own movie Funny Remake, who was the director thinking) Ajay Devgan Like Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol could have been better) Prashant Raj Like Raj / Jai (Abhishek was meant for this role Although making a special Appearance in music Mehbooba) Sushmita Sen C omo Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was right Tabu was right for this role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think Es ha ha would have been great) Mohanlal as Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute .... Oops sorry hehehehe, he was fine, I could not think of anyone) <br /> <br /> The movie would have a FAIRED Little if the cast was OK <br /> <br /> I movie was not even exciting, the movie was just OK, just to watch <br /> <br /> The General Rating <br /> <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I got him some credit Cinematography ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 BAD Scripting Songs ... 5/10 Unnecessary in the movie, it could have been better, Easy on the Ears to be played on PC and IPod and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3 / 10 <br /> <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
