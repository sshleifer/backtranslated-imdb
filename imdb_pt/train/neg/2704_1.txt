I do not understand why people rave about this crap. It's wrong, stupid, unrealistic, horrible, and almost everything else. The film is an insight into life, racial issues, prejudice and everything else that happens strangely in college. This is where it fails. You have no apprehensions about reality. Of a lot of questionable nonsensical scenes in the film, such as <br /> <br /> A black man chasing a white man with a gun, the black man is stopped by the security guards handcuffed and executed while the shooter passes straight through for them. <br /> <br /> The same white man who comes up against people from a roof topic that is stopped and shot down by the same black man is then stopped and gets a Rodney King style while the gun man runs. free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards. <br /> <br /> As a previous reviewer pointed out Several white men 230lbs being beaten by several black men weighing around Â£ 160, including the 105lbs Bust A Rhymes <br /> Another critical flaw in the film are the main characters uninteresting. Of frightened and confused whites and petty blacks, angry and yet fair (?). It's almost like an insult to black and white people. I am a white man and I know many blacks and Hispanics who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and give them these characteristics exclusively due to their race. <br /> <br /> The plot I'm going to explain now revolves around three characters. One is a black athlete, the other is a frightened and confused white girl who questions her sexuality, and the third is a white man who is also confused and frightened, then blames her problems for black people in which he becomes a Nazi later in the movie. They all have their share of problems and adventures, including sex, rape, fights, love, hate, prejudice, racial warfare and, yes, do not forget about education. That everything goes down at the end for the fatal shooting. Then they go back to their boring lives and think "being white is bad." Does this sound a lot like your college years? I did not think so. I do not think the principal attended college, especially if he was to make this terrible mess. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very bad, bad and ugly movie. If you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see American History X. If you want to see a more accurate view of Porkys college rent. Just avoid this mess.
