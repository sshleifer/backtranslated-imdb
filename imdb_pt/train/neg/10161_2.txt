I really did not expect much from this movie since there are people from Parkersburg WV, which are where I live, acting in it. This city is boring and so is this movie. There were some decent scenes in the movie, but I was distracted by all the bad landmarks that they made a point of showing. This movie may have been good if there was a real performance, but there was none. Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see every day, stay away from that movie. The dialogue will put him to sleep, acting will annoy him to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after throwing crap like this. It's a predictable movie with no surprises. What you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute ride from Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.
