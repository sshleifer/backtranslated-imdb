... Ok I read about this movie somewhere on the internet, and many criticized how bad and bad this movie was. And I could not have agreed more with that. So after I saw this movie on DVD, I was thinking twice about it and then came commercial of that movie on TV. Luckily, I saved my money for those crap. I was sacrificed my sleep for this movie and soon discovered that this movie could not make me please. So I can not judge how the movie was made, but still ... it still sucks. As for those who liked this movie, I would apologize for flaming this movie and tell how bad this movie is. I do not know what you think about this movie?
