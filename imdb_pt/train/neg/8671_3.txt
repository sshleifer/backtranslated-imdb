I watched this movie on March 21 this year. Must say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev". Plot is banal. It runs on Prabhat who lives with his father, wife and his younger brother. The movie opens when he saves a bride. Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad makes a plan to kill his younger brother. He makes a plan by sending few men. They come to a school pretended to be friends Prabhats. Kill that kid. His father throws him out of the house. and Aakash go to Kenya to find him. The sun gives a good performance, Chunky was annoying at best, Naseerdun is wasted. Divya was good, Sonam was wasted, Jyotsna was wasted, but it looked cute. The movie was cute. Too sad that he had to kill his character. The girl was cute, but it was annoying. The other boy did good. Little did well. Kiran was appropriate. Amish and Gulshan did well. Cinematography is excellent both in India and Kenya. Scripts are weak, but have some nice dialogues. Also drags the movie. The music was good. only liked a song "Saat Samundar", the lyrics of this song was good. The other songs were forgettable. Do not watch this. Classification-3/10
