This movie was terrible. I thought with all the actors that decent, would be better. do not waste your time. Eva longoria parker was horrible. she should be left with desperate housewives. Paul Rudd is becoming an actor B. The mess he made in the movie I could never be his wife was the epitome of what I'm saying. and the bell on the lake she was cute, but definitely needed more acting lessons. watch as the sky with Reese Witherspoon ... was a little better. or any other ghost movie. you will be grateful that you have not wasted your precious time. PS I love you is also a good addition to the serious novel! time to start watching movies rated 7 out of 10 and listen to people who have seen it.
