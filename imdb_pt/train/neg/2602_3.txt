Drew Barrymore continues to see his alter ego all over town and is really starting to become a pain in the ass. <br /> <br /> After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer, his encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. The writer says it's his responsibility to take "the real Drew" out of his stupor so he does what he can to help, including seducing her as soon as he has some free time. Not very interesting, and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when she gives a bunch of rude construction workers the finger ... yeah Drew, this is hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene might be where Drew stabs his mother in real life, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
