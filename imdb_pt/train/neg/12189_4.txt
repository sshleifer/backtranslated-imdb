I'm surprised that this film is so well rated, although if I were with typical grade-level 71 it's a c or d so maybe everything's fine, but this movie was just a typical thriller except tediously slow and unrealistic. Not that a typical suspense is realistic but this one seemed to be trying, and yet the woman who was beat did not press because she did not want to be questioned in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm, beat the shit out and raped her for life, but also protecting the lawyer for whom she had feelings and her family, not just random people she did not even know. There were other similar problems with the film, which would have worked if there was some kind of moral to be taken from the film, but the few moral issues, as if it were right to try to kill / beat Kady before he did something illegal, were A little aside since Kady turned out to be just a crazed bastard and determined to take revenge, then the lawyer was right to protect his family since Kady actually raped his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd. So now I just lost more of my life for this stupid movie, so please do not see it, at least your life will not be taken from the waist and so my two and a half hours or something meant something.
