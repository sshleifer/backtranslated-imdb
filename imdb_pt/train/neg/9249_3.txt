While watching the movie, I'm not sure what the delay was. There is a reason why a writer should not direct his work and even act on it too, you can not do everything. I felt the story really suffered in this movie due to the director wearing so many hats. Ms. McTeer is the movie. To add to her incredible talents, her portrait of this woman was the reason I was engaged. Here's a British actress who can do anything. In my opinion, conflict is what makes drama and a great story. I felt that this movie did not have that. Everything was a little easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles that would prevent the chakrasters from getting what they wanted. Watch the movie for the sweetness, but above all for McTeer's brilliant performance.
