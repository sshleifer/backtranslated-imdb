The only reason I even saw this was because I found it in my local library (and I'm going to scold them ruthlessly for having wasted public money on it), and despite the multiplicity of breasts and butt, it did not take long to realize that the button Fast forward was my friend. Terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad performance to almost passable, colorful effects and one of the worst scripts I've had the dislike of seeing brought to life (as it was, horribly mutilated and crippled) in a very, very long time. In fact, the best laughs come from the "Making of ..." in which the poor saps involved with this mess try to justify their efforts as if they were working on something special instead of something that would not be totally forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somehow someone drew Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, of all people, to do a small part, along with Kane's "Friday the 13th" Hodder! How it happened, I'll never know, and to be honest, I do not really care. Watch at your own risk, and do not say you were not warned. That's making movies in your pretentious and coward worse. Just get a 2 of me for having some good-looking naked women, and even then, just for little.
