I watched this movie last week and had the biggest laugh I've had in a long time. The plot of the film is rather dumb and complicated in a poorly crafted way. The only advantage found anywhere in the movie is Corey Savier's stunning sit-ups. Alexandra Paul (I think that's her name) is horrible as the pastor's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is disgusting and his character is an idiot on top of everything. And as if the fact that you think she is having sex with your child is not enough, they play on unnecessary saxophone solos at all times! The ending and climax of this movie is absolutely lousy and also laughable. I mean who the hell wants to take the son of a cheater who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him!
