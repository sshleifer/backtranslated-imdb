This is so bad, very very bad. Acting is the biggest joke in history. I do not even bother to see, I did it after 20 min and it was just as disappointing at the end as at the beginning ... I really do not understand people's taste, I'm a fan of horror movies and I'm not meticulous, but I have a limit! Maybe it was a better star room than the beginning of The Hoast, but that's it. So I recommend that you do not miss the 15 minutes you can watch. I mean, the acting is best done by monkeys. And the older brother with the parental role is just awful. They do not pay characters in C movies? No, I must say this is not the first time I think a horror movie is bad, but it is absolutely one of my ten movies and will be places of charm with the picture of a vampire, Cabin by the Lake, The Hoast!
