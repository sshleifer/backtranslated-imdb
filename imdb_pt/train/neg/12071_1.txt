Terrible ... just terrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen some really bad photos over the years. The sound is terrible, as is the quality of the image, the direction, the performance ... etc., etc. The only good effects (which means funny because they are so bad) are the special effects. Overall, there are about 5 minutes of laughter. The rest of the movie does brain damage.
