.... CAUSE IT'S CRAP! The kind of movie that makes you want to hit the movie maker and say "WHY?". Horrible camera work ... count the times the camera tries to remain stable in a person and can not. The dialogue is ridiculous. The acting is comical. It looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie with as little money as possible. I'd bet $ 10 they used homemade video cameras to do this. Either that, or most of the cameramen was drunk. Really the trailers are more fun than the movie. If you want to host a "Worst Movie Party", bring this one. Want more entertainment ... look at a wall.
