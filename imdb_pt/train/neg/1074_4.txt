I should never have started this movie, and I stopped watching after 3/4's. I missed the really failed end. This movie was a disappointment because it could have been so much better. It had a nice atmosphere, a high level cast and director, good venues. But a story of baaaaaad, a bad script. I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent-it was better than the script. The plot was stupid - driven by characters acting in unrealistic and improbable ways. No one behaves like that off Hollywood scripts.
