This is a sequence of just a name for "A Christmas Story," originally titled "A Summer Story." Ralphie recounts her family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere. The hilarity, unfortunately, does not follow. <br /> <br /> The original worked because of its irreverent nature and honesty - everyone could relate to it. This one is just stupid and not very funny. Charles Grodin's latest movie - no wonder! It's one of their poorest roles. I felt sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen has little to do, everything is terrific, and you have to wonder why they bothered you. <br /> <br /> And I mean, come on - a competition with pi√µes?! Unfortunately, it's the best part of the movie ...
