I wish it was known, that I do not rate movies below 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. His countless TV hits for several months made me REALLY want to see this movie. So the other night, when I saw it was available at FearNet on Demand, I got popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed intriguing enough - a guy is massacring innocent people on the subway. There is a photographer obsessed with missing people. Where are they going? What is happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some of the photos he took and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The movie had a way of sucking you, even if the plot was highly predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look back behind you" I say, very bored with cheap emotions. <br /> <br /> The plot, though predictable, was intriguing-that is, to the very end. "That was good until the end ... Then it was silly," says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers ... See, I was hoping it was some crazy killer, a psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was a secret society that kept the creatures alive for centuries. Woo As original. How unrealistic. How dull. 3/10. Come by the Lionsgate. You had incredible movies, but this one sank.
