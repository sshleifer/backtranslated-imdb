This is one of the most odious and cruel films I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I was misled, as the presence of Donald Sutherland gave him credibility. [This is the last time this will happen.] Lesley Ann Warren's character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come. There were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the movie. That's just one of the many things in this movie that made me ask, "Where's the justice?" <br /> <br /> Why is the morning haven so full of sadistic trash full of pathological chaos? Most of these movies seem to have a particular problem with women, and it seems to focus on them being terrified and murdered. This movie could have been so full of suspense without being sick and twisted in the process. All he ends up doing is turning the viewer's stomach with his illness and insulting the spectator's intelligence. <br /> <br /> The cast is deceptively good. My guess is that they messed up Sutherland first, and used it to entice others as lemmings for it. <br /> <br /> I'm kicking myself for wasting time, giving this piece of junk a chance.
