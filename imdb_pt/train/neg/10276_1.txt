So you may be reading some of the comments posted in this movie, and you may be thinking to yourself: "Huh. There was a lot of RAVE REVIEWS posted on December 30." The funny thing is that most of these compliments sound as if they were coming from the same person, or at best a small, coordinated group of "Open House" groupies. The truth, my friends, is that this movie is truly unattainable. Just because it is "independent" does not mean you get a free pass. If you're going to make a musical, whether it's in the movies or on the stage, on Broadway or in the local community theater, you should probably make sure that (a.) Your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dance .) you have a decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well written score, and (e.) you have lyrics that are spirited and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can not save this. It's one of those unfortunate movie experiences where I really felt deeply embarrassed by everyone involved.
