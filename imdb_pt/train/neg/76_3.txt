I saw it at the premiere in Melbourne <br /> <br /> It's superficial, two-dimensional, not affecting and, hard to believe, given the subject, annoying. The actors are passable, but they do not have much to work with given the very heavy and unimpressive script. For those who may have worried that Ned Kelly would be overly intellectualized, you can console yourself with the fact that this storytelling is absolutely without any literary depth, told entirely on the surface and full of central cast standards. However, it does not work like a popcorn movie either. His pace is very unbalanced and his craft is insufficient to satisfy even the level of a mundane actioner. <br /> <br /> I doubt that Gregor Jordan could sit down and say to himself, "This is the best I could have done with the material." Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally is the national response to it. Possibly popular genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he dominated the true Australian mythology for more than 120 years. Once again, his story failed miserably on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Such is life.
