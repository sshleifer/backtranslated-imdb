This Drummond entry is lacking in continuity. Most of them have their elements of folly, the wedding postponed, and so on. However, this has an endless series of events occurring in the dark, as the characters run from one place to another. The house looks more like a town. There is also Leo G. Carrol, who is such an obvious suspect that no one seems to even look. He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious, but Drummond and the staff do not seem to notice anything. Still, it is a reasonably good action and a very good end. <br /> <br /> I know that Algie must be a comic figure, but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies, he's such a fool that it's hard to imagine someone with good taste or intelligence around him. Is there a story behind him that explains how he and Drummond became associated?
