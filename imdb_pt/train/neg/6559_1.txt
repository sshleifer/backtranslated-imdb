My girlfriend chose this one; as an African-American born and raised in the South, I found the plot and premise of the film totally unreliable. Believing that racial and class prejudices would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the Southern Antebellum. Totally absurd !!! I wonder how they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who from the south knows best) to take part in that crap
