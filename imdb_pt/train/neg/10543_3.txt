The only thing The First Power really has to offer is that it gives Jeff Kober the opportunity to play one of his adorable varieties of psychotic villains he has done so well in the last 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger, who specialized in those parts in the 1950s. But it's not enough, The First Power is a horror movie that Lou Diamond Phillips squandered as an LAPD detective. which has a specialty in catching serial killers. Kober is his latest attack but Kober is in league with a smaller power and they will come together and make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober receives the gas chamber, his spirit returns in all kinds of appearance. Mykelti Williamson is present as Lou's partner who faces an unpleasant ending involving a horse possessed by demons and Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insights are close by to help Lou. Will he be able to fight the forces of the beyond? <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you do not care anymore. Lou really got stuck in a turkey. Maybe the devil made him do that movie.
