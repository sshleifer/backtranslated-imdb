I'm sure this was one of those "WOAH!" attractions in 1982, when Epcot opened, but now it's just silly. The message from the movie is clich√©. The Circular View is misleading. And that horrible song at the end is annoying. And I really would like them to install seats. After so much walking, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear that there is a movie to see it sounds very glamorous! You have fun while you're sitting, right? WRONG! You're there for over 18 minutes leaning against a small railing. Disney should make a new Maelstrom as an attraction to liven things up and replace this bland and dull movie. IT'S NOT FUNNY. Skip this. In fact, skip Canada altogether unless you're eating there. Move directly to UK.
