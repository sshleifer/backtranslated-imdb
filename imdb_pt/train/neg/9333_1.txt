Terrible!!! I do not want to be too negative, but this movie has a stupid monkey IQ. What a disaster. I just could not believe how bad this movie is. The dialogues are very strange and off the subject, the camera sometimes only horrible work, the music sometimes as a soundtrack to Lawrence of Arabia, I just watched this movie to see how much worse it can get. Some of the "actors" side kicks are total disasters. Sorry, but all my thumbs and fingers and anything that can fall on my body is falling to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor, but who knows he is in financial crisis to participate in such a fiasco film. . . . . this film should have been presented to all students in all film schools only to teach them a lesson in how not to make a movie
