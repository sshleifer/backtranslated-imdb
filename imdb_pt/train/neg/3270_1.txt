It's nice and fast. <br /> <br /> There is no way on Earth that the actor who is playing Mat may be eighteen. However, the main thing is that he acts eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to climb it. I soon accepted him as a young and naive boy from the field. <br /> <br /> Although his performance was the best, most of the others were also very engaging. In particular, the interaction between police officers was natural and well balanced, and it worked very well. <br /> <br /> It's only 45 minutes long, so the plot is not complex. More important is the style of the whole thing. It is very smooth and vibrant, and the scenery is atmospheric, especially since all the colors are extremely rich. The gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences, but still manages to be distinctly Australian.
