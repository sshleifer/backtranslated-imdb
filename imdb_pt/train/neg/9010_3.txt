When you want the dragon to eat all the cast members, you know you're going bad. <br /> <br /> I walked in with very low expectations, having read some of the other reviews, and was not disappointed. Unlike some other cheap and unsuccessful movies, however, this is not really funny (and unintentionally) funny all over. <br /> <br /> -SPOILERS FOLLOW- <br /> <br /> First of all, plot is very inconsistent. Looking beyond the "small" mistakes, like the dragon growing in 3 hours, the whole idea is based on clutter. You see, the movie wants us to believe that the dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites that really were dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show some peasants poking one with their trident and the dragon appears. Later, the obligatory "mad scientist" babbles about how the dragons survived the dinosaurs. So apparently the humans were around when the dinosaurs were, or we have only a small hole in the place. The other important thing is that the laboratory is blown up with a "half as strong" force as the one used in Hiroshima. So two guys later come in to check everything out, and it's almost unharmed! There is even another dragon, who grew from who knows what. All in all is very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned cloning, I figured they'd clone a dragon. That means Mr. Smarty-pants's security guy is not as intuitive and intelligent as the movie would make you believe, if you ignore what I knew this movie would be about, you know, dragons. <br /> <br /> Putting this aside, the second worst thing is the "special effects". Others mentioned the fake rocks that fell during the beginning, the CG helicopter and the dragon. It looks a little better than a bubble, but it ruined everything it had when it crawled down the hall the same way, over and over again. To his credit, the flying dragons at first seemed well from afar (although that of the cave is probably the worst of the whole movie). These things are fun to watch, though. The scenes in which a million different scenes of the same person who are facing different ways are shown are not. Neither are the "introduction" screens with vital statistics. <br /> <br /> Coming to the actors, they were not the best, but I think at least they tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors who participated in the recent "BloodRayne", for example, and you have to give them points for it. One thing I noticed was that the woman who plays Meredith used to have her face covered with makeup that was lighter than the rest of her. She seemed to have a fight with a white face. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and tacky. You really do not notice the music, but it's not really that bad most of the time. <br /> <br /> The point is not to watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it is bad (like I did), although the only funny things are the bad effects of CG. Other than that, do not waste your time and money.
