the worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I saw this movie at the Austin Film Festival in 2004, and it occurred to me that this movie was accepted at a festival. It was an interesting premise, and it looked like it might go somewhere, but it would fall apart every time I tried to do anything. First of all, if you're going to make a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of playing the cheese piano that sounded as if they were playing on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terribly written, and when they were not obvious rhymes, they were rhymes that induced the moan that showed how far they were struggling to try to make that movie work. and you'd think you'd find people who could sing while making a musical, right? not in this case. fortunately they were half talking / half singing in rhyme most of the time, but when they sang it made me shiver. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and this only touches music. some of the performances were very good, but a lot of the dialogue was terrible, as were most of the scenes. they obviously did not have enough coverage in the scenes, or they simply had a bad editor because they consistently skipped the line and used terrible choices while they cut the movie. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook to make it a musical. I hope investors make sure that someone can write songs before they make the same mistake again.
