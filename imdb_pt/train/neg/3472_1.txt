James Gandolfini is a good actor, so whatever it was, he played a part in that bland piece of trash. Affleck is just a lightweight who simply can not hack it, the rest of the cast is truly unforgettable. I saw this in the US in an empty theater, I soon learned why the place was empty after 10 minutes. I left before the end was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I returned to England, I saw that the film had a brilliant report of that yo-yo "Paul Ross" on one of the market Sundays. I always trust Ross to save me money on movie tickets, if he says the movie is good, I'll go straight to that site to check it out. This movie should have gone straight to the Â£ 1.99 DVD in a supermarket near you.
