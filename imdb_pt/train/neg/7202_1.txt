Ever since I loved the cartoon of the Inspector Gadget in the '80s, I went to see this movie. I lost my money. The plot was very thin. Also, the movie could not keep me interested for long. I'm glad it's over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Inspector Gadget, watch the cartoon. It was much better than the movie.
