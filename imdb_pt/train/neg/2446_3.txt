Rajkumar Santoshi Without Any Doubt Directed The Biggest Movies And Greatest Hits Of Indian Cinema. <br /> <br /> This Film Stands Out Of All Expectations Like This Movie Stars Two Great Actors Mr. Amitabh Bachchan And Akshay Kumar And When You Have These Two Actors In The Same Film You Have To Make A Magnum Opus. <br /> <br /> In the back of the movie, you may notice that the voice of Amitabh Bachchan was dubbed by someone else who was unsuccessful for his illness. <br /> <br /> The film has not yet had adequate character development and the cinematography was not good either and one thing Bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when needed and when applied should be done with a budget high. The script has had so many flaws that it gives the viewer an excuse to answer their phone calls instead of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The new marketer shakes his leg well but can not act Well but where the movie loses a lot of time It is the script and the plot of the film A talented actress like Bhoomika Chawla was wasted in the film as well as Sushant Singh. <br /> <br /> But every director, from time to time, in his career, makes a bad movie. So watch only if you are a fan of multi-starrer flop movies.
