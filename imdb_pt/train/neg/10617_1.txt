Probably encouraged by admirers of her much better "Orlando", Potter here offers a vehicle for herself in the worst way: she writes, directs, stars and actually co-writes the song, including a sulky love song. The film is very reminiscent of a high school or college project of a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her. But Potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of his romantic obsession is unpleasant, and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism disguised as tango celebration. Maybe if she had not gone, it might have worked. She simply can not act, whether playing herself or not. Pretentious, overly ambitious, monotonous and silly.
