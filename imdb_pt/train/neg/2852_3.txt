This is a completely nasty movie if done well. I tried because it stars Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot - a mafia boss is about to be released from a mental institution - looked promising. The movie is billed as a comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of scenes - you must forgive the pun - of people in dimly lit, elegant, though slightly surreal, places-in-the-head, stomach, knee, foot, and heart no part of the anatomy is avoided, it seems, at the same time that vague and enigmatic dialogues are uttered, some of which are supposedly, of course, humorous in a postmodern way. in a 3x5 card, and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic smile - everywhere Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do their best Burt Reynolds plays a special role Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I missed them (a good move on their part) .The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unpleasant, an heir, I suspect, for the style of "Pulp Fiction", "Fargo" and "Natural Born Killers." Did you like these, prov? you'll probably enjoy it.
