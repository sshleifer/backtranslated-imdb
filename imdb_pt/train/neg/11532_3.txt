I rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend nor I saw her, even though we had heard from a mutual friend like "It was great." <br /> <br /> Now, I'm pretty conservative in my life. but I knew entering would be very liberal, given who directed it. I imagined before the movie began that Michael Douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal, loved by the masses, and there would be an indigestible conservative opponent as his antagonist. But I thought that's where the political statement would start and end. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot was solid: the only president falls in love with a lobbyist. OK, this has potential that I found quite entertaining, since the plot was unique. But then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial. The film became more about gun control and environmental issues than about the relationship between the president and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There were several ridiculous premises in this film: 1) The character Sydney playing lobbyist of six figures who is a "closer". Could she have been more voluble? She was constantly disorganized and seemed to marvel at everything. Hardly a "closer". I am a sale, and she could not "close" a glass of water to a man dying of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Secondly, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right-wing fanatic? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and she's playing some right-wing ideologue. Give me some time. I liked how he took his conservative character and made it as sinister as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech at the end was just ridiculous. The phrase about "I am a proud member of the ACLU card" was a joke. First, no president would admit something like that, being an active member of an ultra marginal group. Second, why bring something like that? You have just separated half the audience from the movie that is moderate or conservative. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was great and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the film went from being a "movie" to a leftist political statement, which is why the film failed. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a big plot ruined by Hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
