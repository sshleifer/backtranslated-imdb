I agree with most of the other guys. A waste of photons and valuable time. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke worth the paper is written. The only highlight of my pov is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") This reminds us of the old days with the RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the actors' performances, since most of them do not even seem to have a good time during production and just "do their thing". The camera is fine, plot is laughable, I think you'd be embarrassed even if you discuss this with many beers. <br /> <br /> In addition I yawned all the time, wondered how such a script could even be considered for production and waited the end. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son was satisfied, but then he is satisfied by so little at that age :-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, a 1-point rating here is almost 1 too much point
