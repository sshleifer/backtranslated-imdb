Billy Chung Siu Hung (Hong Kong, 1993) is among the strongest products of the Category III boom that inhabited HK cinema in the early nineties. It consisted of movies with strong sex, nudity and violence, more or less gratuitous and only with shock value. Love To Kill definitely belongs to the "plus" category with some unforgettable ideas and bits of celluloid disease. <br /> <br /> The psychopath HK Anthony Wong (from the award-winning The Untold Story of Herman Yau, the same year) plays a businessman and husband who likes to torture, humiliate and rape his young wife (Elizabeth Lee Mei Fung) for some reason, does not leave him and saves himself and his little boy from the disturbing tormentor. A police officer (Danny Lee, the well-known crime thriller like Dr. Lamb (1992), by Billy Tang (and co-directed by Lee) and John Woo's The Killer (1989), problem and begins to protect his wife and son, but Anthony naturally does not like it, and takes it all to the typical ultra-intimidated and graphic finale during a rainstorm. <br /> <br /> The film is almost completely without any serious merit, since it is just a holding to make money when this type of film is so popular. Images and events are something never found in Western cinema, at least in the mainstream, and everything becomes even more mind-boggling when some / more Western taboos, such as violence and perversions witnessed by a child, are broken in these movies. of the plots, by itself, would make most viewers feel bad, which is also perfect for this movie. <br /> <br /> The film still has a rather interesting and chilling soundtrack in the tradition of Dr. Lamb. who practically started the whole boom in 1992. Usually music and soundtrack in HK movies are interesting and contribute to the images, especially in these horror films. Also worth mentioning is cinematography as the film bathed, especially at the end, in the blue colors and lens of the cameras (as well as Assassin, too), and the furious storm is captured right on camera. Otherwise, there is nothing that classifies the film as anything other than evil. <br /> <br /> Actors and actresses are talented and professional and therefore do not aggravate the film with their acting. Still, the film has the usual HK humor, which makes the sick person become even sicker as some "humor" is thrown into the soup. That includes some jokes about Danny Lee's erection and so on ... Something that could never be found in the "serious" western movies. And this thing usually destroys HK movies, otherwise noteworthy, since humor is such an obvious way of trying to entertain the public and the masses. <br /> <br /> The film has a very high level of scandalous, as it has countless scenes depicting the scene. abuse of Wong's wife in various ways. She is raped and molested, beaten and kicked by her husband. We can also see some flashbacks of Wong's own childhood, which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now. These flashback scenes, especially at the end of the movie, also include some totally unexpected experiences as the image is accelerated (for example, the blows of an ax) and creates a completely insane and stingy atmosphere for the scene. Once again something that only the operating companies of HK seem to be able to create. The end itself includes an abundance of sudden and shocking blood when the madman wields his ax and also finds some nails, for example, on his furious path. <br /> <br /> The film is also genuinely "suspicious" in my opinion. as violence and terror are realistically painful and deals with things that should NEVER be taken as entertainment, most I mean rape. The version I saw (I've seen two versions) includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible. I'm not sure if the HK audience really likes such images, but I do not think anyone with any sense of morality in movies / entertainment would ever accept or do something like that. Women are brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and lowest way, so that the fate of men seems almost tame when compared to females. <br /> <br /> The other version I saw, the newly released DVD in HK (without subtitles) has this scene "table brutality" in a much longer form than Taiwan's subtitled DVD, which is otherwise identical to the HK version. I also heard that old HK Laserdisc is different from these two and as the final credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the movie, it is impossible to say how "uncut" versions that were released or theatrically shown. Obviously many scenes were cut, possibly even before the release in theaters. <br /> <br /> The film is written by Law Gam Fai and Lau Wing Kin, the first having also written films like Dr. Lamb, The Untold. History and Gunmen (Kirk Wong, 1988), but out of his other films I've seen, Love to Kill is the most free. Dr. Lamb and The Untold Story are very brutal and violent, but they also have some attempts to criticize the authorities and men in general about how easy it is to turn into a beast when pursuing or countering one. The untold torture image of The Untold Story, the victim being the criminal, is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in society and between the police, for example. But there is none of this in Love to Kill, it's just an honest, calculated and quick exploration that is by the way produced by veteran director Kirk "Organized Crime & Triad Bureau (1993), Crime Story (1993)" Wong! <br /> <br /> Love to Kill does not get more than 2/10 from me, since I do not really appreciate movies like this. (HK) Cinema is to be and may be more and movies like Love to Kill are just commercial parasites that live among the actual pieces of art.
