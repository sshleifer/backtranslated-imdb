T.Z. Post, a college professor, receives a fake letter saying he inherited $ 750,000. Now, with financial means, he withdraws his savings of $ 4,000 and finally decides to leave and live. After having his luggage shipped on a train to Chicago, he meets a vaudeville troupe, and decides that there is enough for him to do a Broadway show. On the night of the show, poor Professor Post has to hide from his creditors, solve the relationship problems between girlfriend Pansy and diva Eleanor, and still be sure that the show should continue. After watching many of Keaton's silent gems, this is a pain to sit on, but I felt that it could have been much worse. The supporting cast During, Todd, and Selwyn leave very annoying at times, but still enjoyable. A pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as the director of the show frustrated. 90% of the screenplay is misspelled, as MGM is trying to get through it like a poor man's Marx Bros. movie, where many of the vision jokes are lost from the start. Compiled with Keaton's drinking problems at the time, this movie is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating-3.
