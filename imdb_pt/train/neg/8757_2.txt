Ostensibly a film that predicts the upcoming trends of British popular music, it is wrong on so many fronts that it is laughable. Tommy Quickly? Honeycombs? The film includes a song from the Spencer Davis group, two from Animals, and one from the Beatles live movie making their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But after all, a strange display of British music around 1964. Oh, and Herman's Hermits.
