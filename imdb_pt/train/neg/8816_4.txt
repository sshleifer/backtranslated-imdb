I saw Mom ... well, she was not exactly kissing Santa Claus; he has a hand on her thigh and bad thoughts in mind. <br /> <br /> That was enough to frighten emotionally a boy who wanted to believe. He grew up to be a bitter man who was upset about the quality of the toys being made, and the lack of Christmas spirit. Waiting for a true horror movie, I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people die, and there was no nudity at all. What a bummer. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie, but it was very slow and did not have a good script. I did not expect great acting, but I'm sure I wanted some action. There simply was not any.
