Okay, I kind of like the idea of ​​this movie. I'm in the age group, and I kind of identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes tacky and nonsensical dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different film would have been forgivable. <br /> <br /> I'm trying as much as possible not to ruin this movie like the others did, but it's not so easy when the filmmakers were not trying anything. <br /> <br /> The issue of this movie is terrible! Possibly the worst issue I've ever seen in a movie! There are things you do not have to go to film school to learn, leaning to good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is. <br /> <br /> In addition, the photo ... Oh my God the shots, just awful! I can not even get into the details, but sometimes we just see random things popping up, and this, along with editing, will give you the most painful experience of watching movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is being made low or no budget with 4 cast and team is not an excuse too. I saw shorts on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what the hell you were thinking, but this movie is just a masturbation of both your egos. You should be ashamed of yourself! In conclusion, this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it were filled with 3 or 4 bad sex scenes separated by long, boring conversations and a disgusting masturbation scene. If that's not your type of thing, avoid it at all costs!
