I've been a fervent supporter of Hal Hartley since I saw his short "Surviving Desire" in high school, and yet he was still completely inattentive by his brilliant "Henry Fool." But this sequel of 10 years later is not only unnecessary, it is shameful. <br /> <br /> After a hectic and quick start, "Fay Grim" turns into pseudo-intellectualism, bores boredom and, finally, unwarranted - and unwanted - nihilism. And this is just the plot. Most of the new faces are as frivolous and underdeveloped as the film: a particularly boring character ends up taking up half the time spent with the infamous Henry Fool, and it's his only spoken scene in the movie! Jeff Goldblum's Fulbright agent, it seems, is the only brilliant character (a pun intended certainly by Hartley as well). How, then, did he leave? ** SPOILER ** Killed through a car bomb, easily making it Hartley's most violent movie of a gentle nature to this day, and tonally all wrong in a movie that's all gone wrong right from the start. <br /> <br /> As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is Grim?), not to mention Fay herself ... well, I will not spoil their fates, since the movie does a good work on it all (when he is not dealing with another divine angle, which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving behind Auteur to a bad movie student). <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete disaster, terrible mess that is not even good-humored enough to revel in its mess. Instead, he self-indulgently cramps his director's typical funky hippies into the "real world," a more ugly and meaner than it needs to be, but not nearly ugly or bad enough to come close to having something to say. In doing so, Hartley traces all of my memory of these people and the wonderful world he originally created for them. <br /> <br /> I've rarely been so depressed in the movies, and I'm counting "Leaving Las Vegas," which at least developed new characters that we grew to love before destroying them, rather than immediately disregarding loved ones. <br /> <br /> Grim, in fact.
