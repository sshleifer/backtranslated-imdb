My title above says it all. Let me clarify. If you've seen the BBC's "Planet Earth", which I'm sure most of you have, then you will not really like this movie. And I own all the disks of "Planet Earth" I had seen the rating for this movie very high, and read good reviews about it. I was excited to take a look. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I went to the theater and the movie started, I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, I recognized them from my DVDs at Planet Earth's house. <br /> <br /> The movie continued and continued and continued, my friends and I kept acknowledging the scenes were all from "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed because I think 90% of the footage is from "Planet Earth". I'm saying 90%, because some of the scenes I did not recognize. I got the feeling that I just did not remember them. <br /> <br /> So, finally, what this movie really is, is a compilation of different tracks from the different albums of "Planet Earth", with a narration aimed at children. Yes, the narration is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar cubs moving away from their mother's cub, the narrator says, "Polar cubs are not like human children. They do not always hear their mothers" (I do not remember the exact words, but that's how it is) in a few words. This is condensed "Planet Earth" for children!
