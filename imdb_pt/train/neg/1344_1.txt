Any movie with such a ridiculous title as "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover, but the plot is very different from what you can expect after seeing the DVD cover. Bagman is by no means a good movie. It falls into the category of movies that appear to have been (and probably have been) filmed on a home video camera. The acting is horrible. I have not heard and seen such a wooden performance since Troll 2. There are many scenes with nudity and sex, but they are clearly very fast. The characters are stupid and totally forgettable. The ending (which I will not ruin) can be easily anticipated after watching the first scene. Due to the tacky nature of the film, nothing but terrible production values ​​is truly scary (terrible attempts at real blood, a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Recommended only for fans of bad movies.
