Unfortunately, the film is more concerned with making bad comments about a real event, but does not have the courage to legitimately document what happened. The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame (I have the impression that Ben Coccio is an avid gamer), or how media and music are completely devoid of influence is the obvious message (we even have a laughable scene of the two boys burning all your CDs, talk about subtlety!), but the movie only creeps on because it's 'fiction'. Good try. Yes, it's a great idea to lighten the media of influence, but how do we know that children who actually planned and executed a school shooting were not influenced by the media? or video games? We do not, and we do not go with this movie because again these children are smart enough to completely abandon the media, but still stupid enough to burn a Nazi symbol on the floor? haha I somehow do not think so. <br /> <br /> The film hits your head with your portrayal of the normality of families, it is almost a disservice to think that there was a serious flaw in the dynamic family of children who actually went out and threw their classmates. Why is everyone so worried about making the killers look "normal" when they obviously are not? A completely false and false representation.
