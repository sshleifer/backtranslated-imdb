Starting with the poster (with only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole movie was a scam. One stereotype after another, this movie was about nothing - or anything new at least. After 10-15 minutes, you realize you just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another cop movie. <br/> <br/> Basically, the story is about the corrupt system in some city, all secretly backed by the backbone business and in the city, under the watchful eye of some politician. The all-powerful and above-the-law organization is called FRAT and guess what? they have a crazy policeman firing and pounding at will - suspects, girlfriends, his name. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that are discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. An hour later, after a series of incredibly poorly made filming scenes and more stereotyped lines, everything ends happily and we serve the last line: you can not beat the system. Bah! Do not watch this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 mins together!
