No wonder this movie has never seen the light of day. The timing of the launch was horrible. The Gong Show had already "jumped the shark" by the time the movie came out, so who would just pay to see some of the censored clips from the original series? And the clips from the show are just a little bit of that pathetic 90-minute chuckle of Chuck Barris about how difficult his life was as a host of the show. Did he really expect us to feel sorry for him and his messy millionaire life? Does he really think we even wanted to know about his life? (Obviously, ever since he wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA agent.) Did he think the joke of having everyone everywhere testing him would be cool for 90 minutes? Or the network executive chasing him every turn? This may have worked as the plot of an episode of a 30-minute comedy, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was cool to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and Unknown Comic again (although, to make the movie "spicy", they included only their more vulgar routines). And as someone pointed out, this is the first significant part of Phil Hartman's film (though it lasts only a minute). Note that his name is written HARTMANN in the credits, which is the name with which he was born. You can not lose your voice and facial expressions, even though he is much slimmer and younger than in the days of SNL. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; one of his first after leaving the soap world.
