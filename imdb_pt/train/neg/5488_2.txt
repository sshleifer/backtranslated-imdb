Why the hell is Colin Firth in this meaningless movie? Did he really run out of money? <br /> <br /> The movie is not clear about what it wants to be, mourning ?, exotic places?, ghosts ?, a vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It's a muddy, muddy mess. <br /> <br /> There seems to be some kind of idea that Italy should be good in itself and that Italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland. <br /> <br /> There are senseless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads - but what it is, or why anyone should care, is simply not clear. There was also a woman in the movie. It was not clear what the job was here, but she seemed to be there just to make insipid, inappropriate, and sentimental remarks to the girl. Was it to be about pedophilia? <br /> <br /> A terrible mess, though. I gave 2 instead of 1 because it does not have the charm of a horrifying movie.
