I thought I would never find a horror movie as bad as "The Return of the Chainsaw Massacre," but this movie competes with it. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person who falls asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after Trance started. I woke up and started watching him agian. Why do I deserve this? The whole movie was torture, I have to use the fast forward to watch it complete. <br /> <br /> I can not stand it because one of my favorite actors of all time (MR WALKEN) could do that. I have to think that he did a favor to the director, or he was really in need of money because film after film he is doing, he is ruining himself; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> And the movie? is not scary, stupid plot, characters are terrible (but I really liked what was interpreted by Jared Harris), the effects are very bad, lack of deaths and blood, etc; in three words, there is something. And I mean it. I can not stand how a director can make a movie like that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I was most disappointed was when I saw on the cover of the video, that the movie was presented by "Stephen King", I think he could never present such crap, right? (I rented in Argentina). I would not recommend this in a million years. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie with 2 out of 10. (As I said in my article "The Return of the Sawmill Massacre", there will always be worse films, which is why it does not deserve a 1 out of 10 )
