I will not say that this movie was bad, but it was not good either. I expected something good, but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was a lot better than that. That was completely outdated. In every phase of this movie, I expected some turnaround and what I get? The girl burns herself and wins the love of her aunt. <br /> <br /> Although they are involved, they have to be allowed for every little move they make. They are so shy even after so many meetings. I hoped her aunt was much more brutal than that. All she did was cradle madly. <br /> <br /> Hey, we also have kids, but we do not watch them and we always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. A happy family, a cruel woman, good in-laws, and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the father of the poor bride and now it is vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I think I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.
