First of all, I was also expecting another hero - a fantastic work of art for the genre of action. I've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine it's better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The basic elements of Hero are found in HoFD: Great landscapes, hypnotizing filmmaking and sincere acting (I mean, if you can not understand a word of what they are saying, without the subtitles, but you still <br /> <br /> What started out with political intrigue wanders in a love story <br /> <br /> Worse, it's a novel-like love triangle. <br /> <br /> You have three characters which I think falls in love with each other - with no good reason. This movie basically goes away after the chain escape (I fell asleep for about forty minutes.) It's almost as if they changed writers at that point. a character is "like the wind." Also, you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe in action sets.This is not unique to this genre, but since the story is weak, you can not wait for the action and when the fight begins , it's not that good. The beginning catches you, but this movie ends up running out of gas.
