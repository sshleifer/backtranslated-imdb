This science fiction adventure is not the best and by no means the worst. I agree with the statement that bad science fiction is comical. The bizarre hue and unusual special effects make this a favorite for late, late, and late viewers. Space explorers on the planet Mars fight against strange monsters resembling giant amoebas and other strange creatures. Very cool. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Be comfortable and enjoy. Do not feel bad if you doze for a moment. I agree to add this to the list of cult classics not to miss.
