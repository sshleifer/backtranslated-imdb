This movie, supposedly a thriller, had about five sub-plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end, but ended up more like a yawn. <br /> <br /> The writing was banal, the rhythm slow and disjointed. and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym, Matt Damon pretended and the others seemed to read his lines from a teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so did not say anything about big business, oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentaries provide more excitement. Watch only if there is absolutely nothing to do.
