Raised and drugged, like a kidney stone through my aching urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkillers take me to semi-forgetfulness, I happened to take this film in the telegram. I would not want anyone to think I paid to see in a movie theater, or rent, or ?? Heaven is sorry! ??? that I watched STRAIGHT. Having played this sensationally horrible video game and eagerly trodden the doomed rooms and passages of fear of the house, battling Chariot (type 27), hanged man (type 041) and other impossible sentinels, my curiosity was aroused about how the game would be transferred to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> He does not. <br /> <br /> Does the banal plot revolve around a group of "crazy kids"? to the Scooby Doo? attending a remote island for a "rave" shaking the world? whatever that is. (You children today with their hula hoops and their skirts and their Pat Boone ??) After bribing a boat captain in cash to transport them there (a stupidity that begs their own network of rhetoric), they find the " rave. "The passing mention is made of a" house "- presumably the titular house of the dead - but most of the action happens in fake outdoor sets and other divorced places of any semblant of haunted residence. <br /> <br /> A fallen video camera acts as flashback fill, showing the island in the middle of a party ?! Is that it? Oh, so this "delirious" thing is In the grand tradition of re-euphemizing "used cars" as "pre-owned," or "shell shock" as "post-traumatic stress disorder," the word "party" is now too small for have you implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? <br /> <br /> It is well known that the party was destroyed by violent zombies Intelligent thinking here? <br /> <br /> I do not think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the myth behind the re-animation of zombies. Can not zombies die? they are already out of money. They do not bleed, they do not know pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue to be animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me. <br /> <br /> Which means that a 45 shot in their "hearts" will not stop them, nor a machete in the torso. And a burst of shotgun in the chest will certainly NOT bring blood jets. At least in the logic of the video game, the shooter pumps so many rounds on each monster that he is completely wiped out, leaving a fetid gruel that can not cheer up again. <br /> <br /> However, each bar-actress model gets its moment from the Matrix's circular camera, killing zombies on all fronts with unique bullets and karate chops in the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the "Return Of The Jedi" Stormtroopers, who are knocked out when the Ewoks trample them. I suppose the writer of the movie, Mark Altman, wrote the not-so-much-Shabby "Free Enterprise", felt compelled to insert a reference to Captain Kirk in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who must have desperately needed the milk money to succumb to appear in this aromatic dung dung. There is also a reference to Prochnow's prime role in the magnificent "Das Boot," when one of the untrained actors B mentions that "he looks like a U-boat captain." "I wonder how many target audiences of this square-eyed pig film caught ANY of the malicious references to other movies, like when Prochnow states," Say hello to my little friend, "presaging his machine gun moment. to a demographic that does not have the means to understand the Sisyphean futility of the concept of video game (ie, the game ends when you die - you can not win), this is merely a horror movie for the stupid. dies in due course except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People. <br /> <br /> A better use for the scarce and poorly used budget of this film may have been to send the cast through Acting. Ona Grauer's left did a good job as well as the right breast and those slomo scenes: invaluable! I especially enjoyed the final scene with Ona trying to act as though she had been stabbed, but looking like she Just eat ice cream very fast. Trying to do something more structured with my time, I removed my anamorphic Widescreen Digitally Restored DVD, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, from "Hands: The Hands of Destiny." Ah yes! ??? the drugs were adequately numbed by the brain - HERE were some quality movies HERE? <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
