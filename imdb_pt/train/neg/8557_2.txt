I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for your frankness ?? pubic hair cut and masturbation, especially from the leader / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the truth for everyday "private" occurrences. Unfortunately, the film fits into the realm of 'The Brown Bunny', albeit with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, does this reflect "Bunny" with a lot of nothing happening, or many photography plans focused (or sincerely blurry) on absolutely nothing ?? feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this movie was released, and why people are renting it: real-life sex scenes and frontal nudity (equally, both male and female). Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learned about a couple of post-college male / female roommates in which the man has obvious feelings for the woman who sees him as just a friend while having sex with her ex-boyfriend. Other than that, we are subject to the daily events of their boring lives: she works for her parents; He works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. For all this to work, the dialogue has to be interesting and real acting. Neither work and is as annoying as watching someone drive for an hour, ie, "The Brown Rabbit". The only actor who stands out is Kate Winterich, and even she makes some questionable interpretations. (The extra DVD with it in front of a microphone is worth watching / listening to). Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for showing everything and not being afraid to expose or shower, but overall the film falls flat. It has narration that does not fit into the scenes, lots of boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you imagine, aside from the soft pornography factor, why you rented it.
