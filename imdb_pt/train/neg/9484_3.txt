If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then I have to give it a low 3/10 rating. <br /> <br /> But it was fun, and there are several good things to say about the movie. movie. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist candidate James Bishop is assigned to St. Andrews Hospital for his resident, and is withdrawn and eager to "change the world." Since the beginning of the film you know that the hospital is hiding a truth from evil, but James thinks it can make a difference and does not recognize this evil. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds reasonably well, you know all along that there is a truth in what patients are talking about some resident evil, and they wonder when and how James will discover it. Also when the break arrives, James is somehow hunted for evil, and you feel some suspense until "the fight" is over. <br /> <br /> Add a beautiful innocent girlfriend who arrives at the worst possible time and other standard terror elements, and you have the picture. <br /> <br /> The accumulation of characters is really very good, you are introduced to most people who are dead, some of them you "know". The film sets a nasty scene, this is also done quite well. There are mysteries that are revealed - in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The main character, James is very believable - the story about an anxious student starting work is good in this scenario. What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of "Plan 9 from outer space" - bad type (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad performances (or probably very few taken during filming) - The main characters sometimes act badly and sometimes good. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking "I could make a movie like this with my home video camera" throughout the movie.
