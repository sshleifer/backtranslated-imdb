'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of Australian postal service employees struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and the current mentalities are represented clumsily and schematically. The most disappointing of all, however, is the portrait of life in the title office of the film: there is no mechanization at all, and it is completely impossible to determine what any of the employees actually do to make a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this type of office certainly closed in 1930, if it really existed. It's a pity, since the overall tone of the film is poignant and ironic, and there are some promises on the stage: but few details convince. Overall, it seems like the work of someone who has not experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and a sketch, but unfortunately little more.
