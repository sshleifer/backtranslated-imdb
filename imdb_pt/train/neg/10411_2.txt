It is funny. I've seen a lot of Fassbinder movies and I found some extremely creative and interesting, while others are disgusting and self-indulgent - like this movie. For me, it ranges from great to crap - without much in the way. I know he has many fans among the "fancy" but I can not help but think that much of his appeal is pure hype. From my point of view (and I know that I will have many negative ratings for this), he made many films very quickly and was very self-indulgent. His gay or genre films (like this one) tend to be really bad - made sloppy, sometimes boring (like QUERELLE and PETRA VON KANT'S TEARS) and sometimes they are gross (like this movie). Could not his message about accepting the gender confusion of a person be treated better than showing him being slapped or seeing the cows being cruelly slaughtered? Show some sensitivity to the subject and make your characters more human and friendly - so maybe I care about the movies. <br /> <br /> I'm honestly on the point after watching this movie that I should not worry about more Fassbinder movies - the bad seems to be overcoming the good.
