The Zombie Revolt is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's well below the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the zombie-making trick after World War I, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for their own evil ambitions. And he can, at least in the beginning. A love triangle complicates the story. <br /> <br /> This was really a tedious movie, with a horrible performance that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who was not. The dialogue was a bit better and the plot was unbelievable (not part of the zombie, but parts related to "romance"). And while I'm no student or photography expert, camera work did not really help the film either. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen some movies that are worse, this is unlikely to please. anyone. It's bad, and not in such a bad way that it's good.
