I watched this movie at 3 o'clock in the morning, an hour of the day when I'm usually very open when it comes to movies. But I still think it was not good, this movie was not good. The reasons why are many. <br /> <br /> The acting is not so good, and one hour after the other situations occurred that reminded me of a Chevy Chase comedy of the 90s. I mean, let's go, like the situation of the shackles, and the poker situation between the servants ... This movie was so obviously based on the first, and that's fine. But if I had not seen the first one before seeing this, I would have sucked even more. As the ending, came very suddenly, and I felt as if I had no closure what so ever ... Sebastian has changed a lot suddenly, and this movie looks like it was done only to explain No. 1, and like no time or effort was used in doing anything else good. The result is the same as the first, and it did not look like a movie ... They should have dealt with situations with more style and class, but they did not. and therefore this movie turned out bad ...
