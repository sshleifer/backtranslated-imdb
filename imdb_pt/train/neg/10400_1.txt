Enough is enough ... sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that has been dead for a long time. The first shiver movie was great. The second one was ridiculous. The third one was nauseating. The tv series was depressing and awful. And this movie just pushes the stake deeper. <br /> <br /> Basically, another excuse for computer effects and cheap puppet theater, we now have the series set in the Wild West in the 1800s, and they fight boys. As a repeat of the first, they have to learn to beat them again. Gentle fun, I suppose. Otherwise, this direct release for the video, like Tremors 2 and 3, is going too far. Oh, and I keep wondering how there's ever any record of these events going on ... they just forgot to record this unprecedented event? I think something like that would be history, so our friends in the first movie would not be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Movies like this that spoil the original just drive me crazy. Avoid this garbage.
