I just watched this DVD at home. We loved faroestes, so my husband rented it. He started to apologize halfway. Saddles, costumes, accents-everything was off. The part that made me so angry is where the guy did not shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow while taking the fat man's soul. His only excuse was "he only had 2 arrows." We watched it all the way, and as someone said ... lots of bad things to highlight any reason why it sucked. I mean, the fact that the kid snatched the collector stone in the same month and the day it was found, what's the point of it? And why was there a cemetery where everyone died on April 25, but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still walking around? If you want a movie to make fun of a few beers, this could be your movie. However, if you want a true western, you will hate this movie.
