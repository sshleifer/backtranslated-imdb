Let's put it this way. I really get this movie. I understand what the writer / director was trying to do. I understand that the dialogue was made to be dry and emotionless. I understand that the plot should be non-climatic and obsolete. That's what the writer / director was going for. A very very very moody / comedy dry. With all that understanding, I still think the movie sucked. It seemed that the writer / director was trying to recreate Napolean Dynamite with this movie. He had all the same resources. Even the main character behaved like Napoleon. But the Napolean Dynamite was really funny. Your script worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose. Well, let me rephrase that. His only goal is to steal Napolean Dynamite and try to capture that appearance. Too bad that did not work.
