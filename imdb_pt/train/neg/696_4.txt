Eh, not a good horror movie. So-so acting, effects, decent soundtrack yet familiar and uninventive. <br /> <br /> There are three deaths in succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a pretty good scene in which everything seems to be worth it. In addition, there are a lot of characters wandering, not realizing what is happening, or chasing red herrings; more killing time than people. There are other deaths, and the killer is a killer of equal opportunity, not partial to anyone to implement. The killer also likes to put other people to kill innocent people as well. Identity is not revealed until the end, and the reason is very thin, and we really do not care. <br /> <br /> Supposedly the movie happens around Christmas, but that's not an important factor. A scene is lit by Christmas lights, that's about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is kind of dark with a muddy image most of the time, at least on the videotape I watched. Part of the dialogue got a little lost in some of the opening scenes. The end should have been stronger than it was. We think we realize what happened, although there's a chance something else will happen.
