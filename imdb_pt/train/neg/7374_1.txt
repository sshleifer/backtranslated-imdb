This is without a doubt the worst film that Steven Seagal ever made. And that says a lot. Do not be fooled by the rating, it's very good. This abomination had not even earned a 0/10 grade, if that existed. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no plot <br /> <br /> - Worst action scenes of all time, and not many of them too <br /> <br /> - Seagal does not do anything , including fights, conversations (much dubbing) and so on. As always. <br /> <br /> Seagal is fat, lazy and could not care less about this movie. Something that is very obvious to the end <br /> <br /> Take all the other DTV movies that Seagal has made, multiply them, multiply that by one billion, and all the evil you earn will not even describe 1% of this absolute crapfest.
