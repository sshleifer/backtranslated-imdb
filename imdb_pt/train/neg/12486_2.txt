Rich lady Joan Winfield (a Davis Bistro) is engaged to the stupid selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson looks lost). His father (Eugene Palette) is determined to disrupt the marriage and has his kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney. They fall to earth in the desert and hate each other, but (sigh) begin to fall in love. <br /> <br /> This seems to be getting a high rating from the reviewers here just because Cagney and Davis are in it. Both were brilliant actors, but they were known for dramas and not comedy and this movie shows why! The script is just plain awful - there is not a genuine laugh in the whole movie. The joke running on this Cagney and Davis falling first on a cactus cactus (this is done three times!). Only their considerable talents save them from being utterly humiliated. As it is, they both do the best with the bad stuff. Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis yells each line with full force, but it does not work. Carson has this "what the hell" look on his face throughout the movie (probably because the emotions of his characters change in seconds). Only Palette, with her distinct voice and above the superior readings, can provoke some smiles. But, in spite of everything, it was monotonous and bland - a real chore to sit on. That earns two stars just for the acting of Cagney and Davis and some beautiful cinematography, but really - not worth to be seen. Cagney and Davis hated this movie in recent years and you can see why.
