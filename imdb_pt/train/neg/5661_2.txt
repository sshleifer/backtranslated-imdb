The premise, while not ridiculous, was definitely ridiculous. What should have happened, in the second encounter with Tritter, was that Tritter should simply be wasted. House hires a guy and dematerializes Tritter. In real life, Tritter would have been harassed for harassment, the rectal thermometer episode would have been exposed in court, providing motive and opportunity and the hospital lawyers would have made mincemeat out of Tritter and the particular department for which he worked. He would be in prison like anyone who was an accomplice to House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson, and Cuddy. The lawsuit would have gained a palatable solution for the Chamber, enough to keep it stocked with Vicadin until old age. While Tritter would end up somewhere driving a cab, trying to rehabilitate himself, doing good to people for two years before people fell for having seen all this before.
