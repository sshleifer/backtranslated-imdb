Stupid movie and simply weird about a child who gets traumatized when he discovers that Santa Claus is not real (???). He grows up to become an adult (Brandon Maggart), who makes lists of people who are disobedient or legal. One Christmas, it fits and goes out to kill people mischievous - dressed like Santa Claus, of course. <br /> <br /> Bored and simply bad killer of the movie Santa Claus. If you're looking for blood, you're not here. Only a few of the murders are shown and they are not so bloody with very false effects. Most of the film contains only Brandon Maggart talking alone and slowly going crazy. The script is banal, the acting is terrible and leads to an ending that left me staring at the TV. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure I was not hallucinating! Really REALLY poor end. <br /> <br /> If you want a scary Christmas movie rent "Black Christmas" (the original version of the 70's --- NOT the terrible remake). Avoid this at all costs.
