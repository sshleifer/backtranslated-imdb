And cheese. If all you want is a video game, complete with what appears to be straightforward cut sequences for action, the movie was too cheap to actually make special effects, that's it. My friend and I actually had a lot of fun watching this, since the theater was almost empty and we could do a lot. This movie REALLY requires interference. <br /> <br /> Plot? Was there a plot? Okay, some idiot college students or later are invited to the "rave of the year" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ("If they had stayed in Seattle, they would have survived." - direct quote, or almost.) To attend. They get there and everyone is gone, and the site is a bit destroyed (but, hey, the barrel is still full!). With the help of an old rough captain and a Coast Guard woman (who acted only slightly less - and a little less well - than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight with many zombies (some who spit acid), pick up a pack of weird legends, and especially be killed. That's about it. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as Demonicus, but not much, and even better than Severed (they're kind of my own alpha and omega for bad movies - the first is bad, but fun to mess up, and the latter is too bad to watch more than once). On the other hand, if you're expecting a video game movie as good as Resident Evil, run! run away now !!! <br /> <br /> OK, some big questions (without too many spoilers): Since when did the Spanish ships of the eighteenth century venture into the Pacific Northwest ????? Why is someone in the Pacific Northwest smuggling guns and who - CANADA, for crying out loud? Why is it rave about an anonymous (oh, sorry, it's called "Isla de muerto", shya, right) San Juan Island - and outdoors, still keeping in mind that this is the NOROTE OF THE PACIFIC . And the rave has about 30 people present - "the rave of the year", my talk. <br /> <br /> Lucky thing, there are lots of axes out there. A lot of them. Everyone has them. Must be a selling point for axes nearby. <br /> <br /> Finally, while the movie started playing with a little "parody" (with nudges in I know what you did and jaws), it did not get you through close enough. <br /> <br /> OK, really finally - when the introductory comments (loudly, no less) casually mention that one of the characters "gave up on his boyfriend to focus on his fencing" you can be sure there will be some fencing until the end of the movie. Not GOOD fencing, but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords, anyway.
