To be completely honest, I have not seen so many western movies, but I've seen enough to know what's good. This is by far the worst western on the planet today. First, blacks in the wild west? Let's go! Who thought this could be a wall film that everyone would love was a little, no, no, completely retarded! Secondly, especially black women were not prone to carry and use weapons. the Asian girl speaking perfect English? If the scenery is western, Asia is not where you are going. Finally, the evil gay girl was too much the film was just crap from the start. Now do not get me wrong I'm not racist or white either, so do not get angry after reading this, but this movie, this movie is the worst Presentation of black people I've seen!
