Not too impressed. It's hard to offer any spoilers for this movie because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything is clear in the first ten minutes and from there it's like you're watching paint dry. The acting also looks very poor, and reminds me of the old Maoist black-and-white films occasionally shown on Chinese daytime television. Although this is difficult to say with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to require only her walking like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of the fading star, Gong Li, who somehow earned her reputation as a good actress in the West by having a frown on her face all the time. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's 'Blue Kite' movie was a much better film. But do not be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late 1940s. Unlike Blue Kite, the fact that this movie is set in a turbulent moment is irrelevant to the plot itself, the The ruins of the city seem to be nothing more than a scenic setting. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to take advantage of the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can not tell the difference between a movie that is' beautiful '' deep 'or' hypnotic 'and one that is simply tedious. and insubstantial. <br /> <br /> If any movie fits the description of 'overrated', that's it. I see no reason to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
