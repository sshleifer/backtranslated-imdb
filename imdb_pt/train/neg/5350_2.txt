Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Moranis stars in this terrible third installment of "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" once fun and funny. The concept basically works the same way as the first movie, but with the adults instead of the children being reduced and the home interior instead of the garden as the universe being explored. If you think this sounds interesting, think again. The film is boring at best, at worst, a constraint. <br /> <br /> First of all, the continuity of the series was completely discharged in the toilet. The only remaining actor in the first film is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress who plays her wife has changed, the actors who play the children have changed, the ones who played the neighbors have changed ... his name. They try to make us believe that this is the same family, but the results are intriguing to say the least. <br /> <br /> Second, history is a repetition of the first, with not a bit of originality. All the few jokes (and almost none) and the dangerous situations presented in the film are only copied directly from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids". <br /> <br /> Third problem, special effects. I'm sure this was done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, much worse than those appearing in the rest of the series. You should admire these tiny figures wonderfully exploring the huge domestic area, but you will probably end up shrinking most of the time. <br /> <br /> Fourth problem, locating the action inside the house is just annoying. Only a few things happen, and when they happen, they are nothing exciting. The first movie was fun because the kids were dealing with the nature, the grass and the insects that live in it. In this, adults (who are relatively boring, compared to children) deal with dust, a cockroach and a cheap trap. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the idea of ​​launching such a banal sequel to the already moribund series attracted Disney executives, except maybe because they needed to make a profit without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I'm telling you: leave this tasteless garbage where it should be: picking up dust on the store shelves.
