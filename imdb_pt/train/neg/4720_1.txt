When I saw this "documentary," I was disappointed to see Propaganda Serbia in action again. Even though Serbia and its nationalist politics are the main reason for the Yugoslav breakup, it is not mentioned in this "documentary" which is made by Bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his film that he is far from objective. It is one of the lies imposed by the Milosevic regime. All others are guilty only the Serbs were right and the victims, although most of the war criminals tried in The Hague are Serbian, although the Serbs have committed genocide against the Bosnians and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, all recognized independent nations The overthrow of Yugoslavia was not preventable because the Serbs did not want to release the control that nationalism imposed on the Yugoslav federal government, so that Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations to protect their interests. are interested in an objective documentary on the break-up of Yugoslavia, and fact led documentary is not it. You should watch "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation" by Discovery Channel and the BBC.
