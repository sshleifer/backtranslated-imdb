The plot and the characters are ridiculous and poorly qualify AS as "plot" and "character". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out of focus and out of focus. The fact that Fulci filled the entire film with fog does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and full of sex and violence. The inconsistencies are a lot of fun, one of the main characters says he has no friends but he catches the new guy in a minute of time on the screen, and has a lot of women aside. Although he shows his anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow on some poor drunk who is just taking care of his own business! Images of blood or blood flowing receive more attention than the characters, but what do you want from Fulci? . Maybe it ruined his career, but he was not much more stupid than Zombie. It pays to rent if you like bloody Italian movies or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre. How do you sleep with someone being sucked into a hole 2 meters from your head and screaming for help?
