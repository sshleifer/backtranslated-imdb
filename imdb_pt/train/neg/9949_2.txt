This movie could have been so much better with a rewritten script. Not that I expect too much plausibility in movies, but you'd think even the homeless and city dwellers, Jack Mason, would question why a group of seasoned hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide. And on reaching the hunting ground, poor Ice-T does his part as if he were really going to take these men through woods he has never seen before. <br /> <br /> And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns in Seattle? ? <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie was based on Richard Connell's tale "The Most Dangerous Game." A few years ago I showed this film to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story. I reissued the film, cutting through all the senseless scenes and all the profanities. It ended up being 43 minutes long.
