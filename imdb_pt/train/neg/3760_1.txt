This is the biggest piece of lick I've ever watched. It is terribly boring that I would rather have attended a seminar on creationism than to have seen it if I knew it would be as boring as it was. Not even 40 seconds of hot bikini with big tails redeem this from something smaller than a 1. The comments of this movie claiming that this movie is "unintentionally funny" are absurd and simply wrong. It's not a funny thing about this movie. they spend the first 50 minutes walking through the woods talking about things you do not understand or care about and it's so bad when people start dying because you do not even know who they are because they are so ININTERESTINES. Honestly, I did not watch in the end, but that should say something about how awful it is. WORST FILM EVER. <br /> <br /> Immediately after ejecting this filth from my DVD player, I began to scrape it against the cement in front of my house, not wanting other box office clients to fall into the same mistake I had committed. how to rent this movie. Then Zach peed his pants. Thank's for your time.
