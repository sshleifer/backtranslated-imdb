I wish I could give a zero to this movie. Cheese effects and performance. The only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is. Let's start with the boy who plays Brian. What a nerd! I could not believe the mullet! Then there was the conversation to himself. I think they could not just have the movie in silence, but still. Of course they had to make him dive too much, it was not something I wanted to see. But Jared did a great job compared to the special effects department. Everything from the bear to the accident was something I could do alone and the best. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with production, since the film was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think the writer has read the book, since nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie stinks like a stinking goat!
