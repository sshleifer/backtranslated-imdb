Set in the 1970s, "Seed" centers around serial killer condemned Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. He is condemned to death, but in the electric chair he does not die, even after being hatched three times. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other cops cover up this secret by burying Seed alive. . Seed bursts forth and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin. <br /> <br /> Filmed by the world's worst director (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is nothing more than a movie about trying to extend the envelope of decent society and delivering on no aspect of a plot. And he said that this is based on real facts, because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times, it will be released. This is an urban legend, and that would never happen. Like Boll's other abominations ("Alone in the Dark"), "Seed" is just plain awful.
