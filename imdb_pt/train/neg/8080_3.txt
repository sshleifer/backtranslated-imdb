I had high hopes for this movie as it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But those hopes fell to earth in the first 20 minutes. Palance was ridiculous. Not even Heston's acting or the beauty of Annabel Schofield (or short nudity scenes) could save this movie. Some of the spatial effects were very good, but others were cheesy. The plot was ridiculous. Even science fiction fans should skip this one. Grade F
