In his brief 40 years on Earth, author Jack London has managed to capture as many adventures and possible incidents. This 90-minute film, supposedly a biography of man's life, but patently fictionalized, does not even scratch the surface, and remains a very mature story for a rereading of modern times. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his earliest roles, portrays London, and his performance is both robust and empathetic. It is not the problem here. Nor is it a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, who plays her future wife, Charmian, whose biography in London is the "basis" for this film. The life of London was divided into a series of episodes, which the film traverses slightly. So we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, a sailor in the Bering Sea, a gold digger in the Yukon and a correspondent during the Russo-Japanese War ... colorful events, of course, but hardly given anything as a deep treatment. And the direction of Alfred Santell (he also directed one of Susan's first films, "Our Leading Citizen" in 1939) is, at best, somewhat indifferent. Making things harder here is a very low quality DVD, with a poor-looking print source and a sizzling sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie location for me has been one of the DVD extras: a catalog of all Alpha Video movies, with hundreds and hundreds of color movie posters. Let's just hope these films are in better shape than "Jack London"!
