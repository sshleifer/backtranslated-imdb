The First Power (1990) was a terrible movie that came out during the late 80's and early 90's of cheap horror movies. I found this movie very annoying, but extremely hilarious in some parts. This film does not have so much sense and credibility that neither is funny. The swift justice system in this film makes Texas seem weak in comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips is in his head with this role (he plays a tough cop) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's most attractive sister) plays a psychic. Do not waste your time with this because it is bad. What a minute, I'll take it back. This movie makes a great party movie. Check out the cross-curry nun, she has the most beautiful legs I've ever seen in a nun who was not in a nunsploitation film by Jesus Franco. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This marked the end of an era for L.D.P. His star was stained and he could not attract flies to a dung heap. It was D.T.V. for him until his "resurrection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you are desperate.
