I tried twice to get through this movie, getting it for the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and crashing for the second time despite a great DVD transfer. The problem? It's just too boring. <br /> <br /> If you can get to the dramatic court scene that occupies most of the second half of the movie, you have done it, but it is difficult to get to that point. There are some interesting conversations of "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The end is ringing as Lincoln walks away and they overlap his Memoral statue on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a nice story, well-represented and such ... but lacking sparks in the first time and discourages the viewer from hanging there. I suspect the real Abe Lincoln was a lot more interesting than this movie.
