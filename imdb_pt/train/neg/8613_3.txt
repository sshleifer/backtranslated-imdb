I almost started crying watching this movie. Not laughing, but the memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield movie. Candyshack was her first and stole the movie, Easy Money had its best, and Back To School is by far a classic masterpiece of the '80s. Then there were Ladybugs and that's when it started to show. Poor Rodney was getting old (Meet Wally Sparks was a small step from Ladybugs, but not saying much). In My 5 Wives, Rodney plays Monte (a name he must love, since that was his name on Easy Money), a rich guy (he's not always) who loves women and marries as if nothing were. Well, now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the Amish, he inherits 5 wives. That sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is everything. The script is so bad that Rodney seems to be saying his linings to the camera and all the minor characters have nothing to do. The film seems to have been videotaped with some really bad stunt sequences that obviously are not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who seems to be dying to say the word F (what he should do since the movie is rated R, but plays as if it were PG) and Jerry Stiller has a good 2 minute turnout. Do not get me wrong, sometimes I laughed at some of Rodney's jokes, but the poor man is getting too old and too slow. We can see his jokes coming from miles. And the movie turns out to be very PC, which thanks to the horrible 90's, 70's and 80's, Rodney simply does not work anymore.
