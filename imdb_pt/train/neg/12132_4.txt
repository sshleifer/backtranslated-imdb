A trio of low-life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, makes a break-in late at night. They flee, but quickly intersect with the police who happen to be chasing a terrorist. Of course the police confuse the gang with the terrorist, the real terrorist runs away, and the thieves are forced to take refuge in a small bar, holding hostages, not knowing why the police are so interested in picking them up. And guess who else chose the bar as a sanctuary for the night? Unbelievable? Absolutely. And down the hill from there. Spacey has acquired a good acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh, but all are lost. Mainly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar, all they do for the rest of the movie is to argue. Endless and aimless. Long before the movie was completed, you stopped caring about what happens to them.
