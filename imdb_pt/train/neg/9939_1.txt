Film school intellects can drool all they want on the important (imagined) meaning of this movie, but that's all it is: the intellectual baba. This movie is creatively bankrupt, and some confuse their self-indulgent endless masturbation as substance. Yes. <br /> <br /> Obviously Godard was not a Stones fan. Too bad, because this could have been great. He is capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses to cover the song with a guy reading a True Detective magazine or some crap. <br /> <br /> Then there are endless images of what the 1960s librarians look like by spraying the words on people's cars. And then there is the seemingly endless "interview" in which the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer yes or no to all really deep and intellectual questions. There's a guy in a purple suit reading another crap from a book that lasts only 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in a junkyard. <br /> <br /> It almost seems intriguing? Well, it's not. <br /> <br /> But for the film school drop-outs who do not mind the missed opportunities of having full access to the Stones bringing Sympathy for the Devil to the world and prefer to listen to some English guy reading instead while looking at the nudie mag covers, this movie is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More precisely ... maybe Godard just blows.
