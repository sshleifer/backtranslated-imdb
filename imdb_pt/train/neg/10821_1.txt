I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time in 1986. It was at this time that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was a great version and a lot like the book. Years later, I set eyes on this version and I was horrified. William Hurt is totally misfiled as Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character where, as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is a story about love and passion, but I could not see it in this version. No, back to the BBC version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.
