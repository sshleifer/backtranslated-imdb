The young group in St. Elmo's Fire, who has just graduated from college, can barely get through high school for less than four years at any prominent university. For the most part, these kids are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but co-writer and director Joel Schumacher seems to hold them as touchstone for a generation. With a cast now surpassed by "ups and downs", a background sound that sounds a lot like "Terms Of Endearment", which writes about the presumption of this circle over us, "Fire" is an insignificant flame, even more embarrassing over the years. * 1/2 of ****
