Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion going on. First, how do you know which movie you are buying? Henry Cele star in all of them. I bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries ... WHAT IS AN ATTACK !! It would have been a comedy, except for the young girl being raped. David Hasselhoff is good for popcorn TV, but he was not believable in this movie (where was his English accent?) And what about the love story ??? The movie was supposed to be about a young man's rise to military power - not the slave-master capping himself with the English maiden in search of his father ... If I had paid more than US $ 7 so film, I would have to call the police - because this would be a crime!
