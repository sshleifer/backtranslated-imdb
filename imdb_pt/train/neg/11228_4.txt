The main flaw of the film is its uninspired script. It comes and goes between vignettes from Bettie's story and recreations from Klaw's short films. Although Klaw's re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to re-create them almost entirely. Page Richards, although not an incredible actress, does a decent job overall. And sometimes she has a striking resemblance to Bettie. Also noteworthy is some true attention to detail. Costumes and clothes well done, as is a bit of the direction set. The ensembles are usually sparse and sit on the stage, but feel the era. Sometimes it is surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought to give a vibrant and retro look to the overall look.
