After seeing the trailer for this film in the movies, I thought it was an original concept for a thriller, putting it in the competitive world of computer companies. The cast of all the stars was another message that this movie would probably be good. But when I did not go to watch in its first week of release, then it disappeared in week 2, I feared something was a fault. Patiently I waited for the DVD release, so I bought it rushing home for a pleasant night vision. The anticipation on the way home was a lot better than the movie. For starters, the direction is shocking. There is no thought at all and the director is only part of himself so that he can appear in the film. I would not be rushing to hire you in the future. Second, the lead role is completely misfiled as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe is usually a cool character as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun but in this he is supposed to be a cheat hero who he tries to portray slipping when he is running and having nerdy friends but he just does not look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani, do not show enough, but when none of the performances are close to their best performances. The only highlight of the movie is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temperament and mysterious ways that drag the movie together. The bottom line is that this movie is another that fills the trailer with scenes you do not see in the movie and instead only appear in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Causing even more disappointment, although some of these scenes are crude, they fill important gaps in the story.
