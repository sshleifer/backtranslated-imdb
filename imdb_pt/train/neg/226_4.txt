Andie McDowell is beautiful as the 40-year-old woman whose late start in a serious relationship takes her to a considerably younger man and a subsequent disagreement with two longtime girlfriends. Seeing a gigolo / A prospector in the sincere young woman, the "girl-friends", who end this "stupid relationship", go beyond the call of duty to "help" her friend (who obviously is blind because of the gigolo). complicated game ". <br /> <br /> A short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous.Long is no longer addressed.Without these unbelievable scenes, there may have been hope for a sweet love story.But instead, every viewer is left with with is an involuntary shake of the head - these things simply do not happen! Without giving cliff-hanger details, I warn the viewer to have high expectations for this movie, most (like me) will be very disappointed. , this one is weak 4. There is much better stuff out there. It's not worth your time.
