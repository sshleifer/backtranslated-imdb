I do not know about you, but I've always been attracted to the 'ART' cinema. The first 'art' movie I could get was Peter Greenaway's 'The Cook, The Thief, The Woman and His Lover', which blew my mind and creative spirit. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... it was about what 'art cinema' was about, exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose. Life, real life, can be like living in an insane asylum, and express art shows that for what it is. I love movies of all kinds, but especially those who entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with their position or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN" is a dry , "clinical comedy" in which father and son join a harem to satisfy their many sexual fantasies. There is only a brief allusion to Fellini in the film, contrary to what the previous ones suggested. The main focus of the film falls on the "near" relationship between father and son, reunited after the death of the mothers. In the first scenes of the film the sadness of the parents is believable, you can feel the pain of it. What happens next is by Greenaway standards, the meeting of the harem, remarks about love and death, and meat displayed for the sake of the flesh ... One could argue this, but I feel that the film is superficial and meaningless. And the idea that this could be a comedy is disconcerting to me. The acting, for the most part, is especially good, especially Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (though poor Mandy should wear the clothes back). What's missing in the film is a compelling story, and the usual Greenaway overtones of excess have made their other films so wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> Although filled with moments of insight, and the occasional taboo, "8 1/2 Women" is very cut and glued to be considered art, very mild to considered 'funny', and simply too boring to considered useful. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
