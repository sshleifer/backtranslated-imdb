"Do not bother watching this movie" would be better advice if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. This was a big disappointment considering the big cast, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was nothing, certainly nothing as described in the VHS box, of course. There was simply no suspense, little excitement and lots of bland places, most of them trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so confused. This was not a good role for Monroe, though I did not need to see this character to know she could act. "Some Like It Hot" alone was good enough for me. But that role did not fit into her and it's no wonder that it was not one of her most popular films. <br /> <br /> It is also a bad movie to have wasted talent from actors like Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It is not fun and entertainment is the name of the game.
