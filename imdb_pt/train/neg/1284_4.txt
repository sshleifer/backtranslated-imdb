This film was a long accumulation without climax. People who refer to sword fighting in the end how great should be out of their minds or have none. Often this movie has gone weak. I'm not saying soft movies are bad. But no matter how much you like sugar, it should not have space in a T-bone steak. This movie should be about revenge for crimes committed against a culture, but ended up being a little bar fight. And there was only one of them who really knew what a sword was; The character of Tim Roth (and yes, he plays well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero" not knowing how to use a sword, and the way he "won" was a shame. As a drama, this movie had its periods, but the best performance has to be the nature of Scotland. This is a breath of lack of being termed "soap" in my book.
