When I discovered that there was a movie that had my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went through the roof! But I had a hard fall after watching this lame movie and I still have the bruise. First of all the character that Jeremy Irons (an actor I still admire even after this disappointment) plays was just awful. He treated his family as trash, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not get close to or sympathize with any of the characters and I'm not prude, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary or could have been attenuated. The characters of Wynona and Antonio could have developed much more and their novel could have been much more in love. And what about the character of Meryl and her "mystical powers"? Why did not they come in on that? This movie had many dead ends and the result is that this is a really bad movie and there was a lot of talent wasted here.
