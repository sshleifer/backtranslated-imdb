If I had not read his name on the cover of the DVD, I would never suspect that this rather old-fashioned, old-fashioned musical was done by a man so intimately associated with French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from that, I wonder if in the 50's and 60's the New Wave authors would have hated this kind of movie - it's so ... so ... unreal. And it seems to have little to do with so many of your previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing - just a very amazing thing. <br /> <br /> What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise that some of the critics gave to this film - especially when there are many better French musicals out there. The songs in this movie simply were not particularly interesting and all the characters seemed so soft and stereotyped. If I needed to see another rich person who cared about how hard it is to be rich or get a good price on a designer outfit, I would vomit. <br /> <br /> The result is that, like American musicals, not every French musical is gold. This film is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (CHERBOURG GUARDS or "Huit Femmes" and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I see no reason to recommend it as anything other than a boring weirdness.
