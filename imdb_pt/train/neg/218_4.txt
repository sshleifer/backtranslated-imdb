*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story looks good, and if you've read the novel, you're probably expecting a deep, intense movie that offers some insight into some interesting and under-explored human relationships. <BR> It's true, the script tries to do this, the director tries to do this, but the main cast fails miserably. Maria's performance is so dry she has no feeling, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems nervous because of the camera. Her only really felt scene is near the end, where she is abandoned by her girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and, worse yet, she does not look anything natural. Maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed to be obvious, but she had and her character received some credibility. And to make things worse, we have no idea about her: where she comes from, why she became involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We only get a few pieces of their parents and their relationship seems to be "there": it has a content and an end, but no beginning. Like her partner Maria, she has only one scene that is really touching, the scene in which she casts Maria's character, Kiki. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this movie (besides the owner, great acting there) who can prove some acting talent. He has the attitude of his character and fits into it. Only once or twice does he seem to hesitate (the scene in his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it was not necessary). <br /> <br /> I love the story, Tudor Chirila is right there. , the landlady really acts and Puya offers her pair of lines with style, but this does not save the movie. Too bad, the whole scenario had enormous potential and Romanian cinematography could have used a film on this subject. <br /> <br /> Strange as it may seem, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the bottom feeling no (well, Maria's spoken interlude is a good attempt in this regard) Maria's lesbian relationship and Ioana. I'm sorry for wasting money on a ticket, I'd rather have watched from the comfort of my room.
