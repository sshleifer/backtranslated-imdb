I am astonished that I really sat down and watched it. I love independent films, horror movies and the whole zombie thing in general. But when you add ninga, you've crossed a line that should never be crossed. I hope the people in this movie had a lot of fun, so at least it was not a total waste. You would never know it by watching it though. Script? You're kidding. Acting I think even the trees were pretending. Cinematography? Well, there must have been a camera there. Period. I do not think there was any real planning involved in making this movie. A total waste of time that I will not prolong commenting more.
