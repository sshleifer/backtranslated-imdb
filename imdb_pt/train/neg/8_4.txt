6/10 Acting, not good, but a good performance. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Director, make some stupid decisions for this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, the story does not make sense and has a huge amount of flaws. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Overall rating for this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it could be great. The characters are so exaggerated that they can be in real life and some very unexplained things happen "in history," not in a good way. Because of the style of this movie, you get bored after 30 minutes (many special effects: slow movements and camera shake and fast forward). It is always good that the movie uses music to make the story quiet, but there are many tracks in this. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and songs
