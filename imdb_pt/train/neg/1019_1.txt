Honestly, before watching this movie, I heard many people say that this movie was a disgrace. I did not believe it, since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took on roles in this film and watched on their own. Apparently they were right. I was very disappointed and thinking all the time during the movie - why the hell did I watch this movie? <br /> <br /> Of course I was not expecting much from Justin, since he does not really belong to the movie / theater. the business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop wondering why the hell they agreed to join Edison. To be honest, their roles are a bit stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, you may think that if the players are bad, then I should pay more attention to the story. It's really the story is the core of a movie, but you ... trust me ... this is not a movie you want to give credit for your story. Imagine this, a smart journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned how to become a "real" journalist for his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was backed up by an agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they hit the system with a happy ending story. <br /> <br /> Eh, I could not even go through with this. Just remembering the movie is already making me sick. My personal advice, do not watch it! Please save your money and time for another movie.
