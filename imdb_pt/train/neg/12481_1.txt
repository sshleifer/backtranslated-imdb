This story of swords and witchcraft from an astonishingly brutal and insensitive "hero" defeating an evil king is useless in almost every detail. The acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles. The malicious joy with which the director shows the hero staining the blood is absolutely disgusting; nor is he redeemed by any justice to his cause, since he is as bad as the people he is fighting. The Z-movie edition is plentiful, including a scene in which a character "dies" of a sword blow that he has obviously completely lost! <br /> <br /> The film clearly bets on the charms of the female protagonists, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who parade naked throughout the film. As a 20-something man, I will not pretend that the female flesh on the screen does not appeal to me. But the treatment of his characters is so demeaning and the sex scenes so casual and joyous that I could not even appreciate this aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> The funniest movies of that era are at least somewhat redeemed. by a light-hearted, ironic feeling (the sequel is better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take himself completely seriously as a heroic fantasy. No way! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 out of ****.
