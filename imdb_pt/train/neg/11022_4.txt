On his way, Mister Foe (originally, and more appropriately, entitled Hallam Foe, I can not see approaching his title as "mister"), is a tribute to the good performance. Both Jamie Bell and Hallam, a physically attractive voyeur / creep, and Sophia Myles, like Kate, their perverse partner in the sex-fantasy novel, are compelling. The problem comes when you try to connect your roles to anything that happens in real life. A young man who spies the intimate details of people's lives, as Hallam does, would be deservedly beaten. And a woman in Kate's situation would be repelled and scared-she would probably call the police. <br /> <br /> These things are not, however, what happens in the movie. Hallam's poor mother died and her father married a woman with whom he was having an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets him know. She has sex with him. Kate is a kind of maid who puts Hallam into a dishwashing service and plays sex games. She looks like his biological mother. Everything ends happily with Hallam "solving" his "problems". <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, Virginia Woolf's brilliantly rendered piece and movie, Who's Afraid, had a similar optimistic ending, with characters becoming wiser. and better after separating each other. The problem is that it does not always work that way, especially when no one cares. In Virginia Woolf, the end is plausible because of the intensity of emotional revelation. In Mister Foe, emotional revelation never really happens.
