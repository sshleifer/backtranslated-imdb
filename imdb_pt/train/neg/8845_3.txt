I watched this knowing almost nothing about it, other than the brief description I read here. After watching it, I was going to say that the director is promising but it seems a bit amateurish, so I looked at the other things he did to see if this was his first or second movie but no, he did House in Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He kind of missed the mark on both movies and was the same with this one. <br /> <br /> The story was horrible too, could anyone just fall in love with a girl because she is beautiful but has a child's mind? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I liked quite near the end, but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible.
