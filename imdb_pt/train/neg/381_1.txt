This film is traditional Bollywood cuisine as much as the power of the star, sentimentalism and love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this movie was the absurd notion of manufacturers about the surrogate mother. A prostitute who conceives a child with someone after having sex with the man (of the family who desires a child) is not a surrogate mother. Nor is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I've seen Indian movies and television shows that did 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue smarter. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely implausible. I realize that most Bollywood movies are not to be plausible, but they do not pretend to be. This movie wants us to get involved with the characters, but this can not be done with such a ridiculous and planned conflict. I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan.
