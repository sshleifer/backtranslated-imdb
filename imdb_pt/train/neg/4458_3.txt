Most of the French films I've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action, but okay. I found them interesting, well photographed and with intriguing actors. (However, at one point I wondered if Gerald Depardieu was in all the French films ever made!) It looked like this.) <br /> <br /> This film has the same interesting look and has a good opening. But then it became conversation, conversation and more talk ... which is good for a drama, but not for a murder mystery. After a while, I almost fell asleep watching it. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes presented in a room. So, if you like pieces, you should like this ... but I want a bit more of a murder story.
