I started to melt so I'm going to make that review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There's this astronaut, and he climbs on a spaceship with two other guys, you know? Except something happens that exposes you to the radiation, and then when they come back ... well, no matter what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut started to melt! No, do not just burn, but STRAIGHT! Like an ice cream cone in July! Well, OK, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Either way, it gets all red and sticky, and the fact that it's melting really makes you crazy. I think he also took a look at the "man who melts" manual because he suddenly knows that to prevent it from totally melting, he has to eat human flesh, so he begins to separate people. <br /> <br /> Other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What is important is that he will chew on next, and what will remain of them? How long will it take for it to simply melt into nothing? Why was this movie made in the first place? Where did they get the money? WHEN will you fall asleep while watching? <br /> <br /> I almost melt, but I still have enough time to tell you that this movie is terribly annoying, even if the idea is cool and gentle. of gross. The makeup is cool, but everything else is ... SPLAT
