This thing is really awful. There are no characters with weight, they are all floating in the BG. Motion Capture is a great toy, but this movie demonstrates that you really need people who know animations to make an animated film. THE MACHINE CAN NOT DO WELL BY YOU. If you see this as a bizarre movie, you will have fun finding continuity errors ... IN A 3D MOVIE !!! It's funny to see the princess dress move like something with different physiques. You need 3D animators and animators, not data inputs that know 3D programs. Notice the joints, like the elbows, as they have lost volume and deformed. The person who did the character's drawing (a very good one) suffered with certainty when he saw them move, "it can not be said that they come to life."
