This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad script, all bad. Comparing it to two other films of the same genre and roughly the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seem more robust both in the story and in the direction, and it's still Albert Pyun who directed those two too! <br /> <br /> The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special breed of robots (cyborgs) lives with human blood and there is history ... Cyborgs need to get many humans to fill the "prophecy" and humans need someone to stop them. A girl together with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of cyborgs was appointed by fate to save mankind. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director tries some of Hong Kong's stylish fight scenes with the participants. flying high and jumping away. The film fails miserably in this attempt. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie with the only reason most people will get a new movie "worst of all". And for fans of the genre, I recommend "Cyborg" as I think it's a very underrated movie with a very high entertainment factor. And if you can not stand Van Damme then check out "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 1/10.
