- A film crew is filming a horror film in an allegedly cursed old house where, over the years, seven people have died mysteriously. One of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in your movie. It is grounded that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using. But when the book is read, the graveyard out there suddenly comes to life. Now the cast and crew are facing real danger. <br /> <br /> - The IMDb lists a 90 minute run time. In the first 60 minutes, nothing happens. A lot of time is spent on the movie within a movie. Should we be scared of the horror movie they're filming? We already know that their movie is not "real". These scares simply do not work. <br /> <br /> There are very few things to enjoy about the House of Seven Bodies. The acting is atrocious. Most of these "actors" would have difficulty playing a game in elementary school. The score is terrible. It is reminiscent of a 1970s television series and offers no atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, plus a few moments at the end of the movie, there is nothing to talk about. Character logic is almost non-existent. Even in a movie, you expect the characters to behave in a certain way. Here, I do not think I remember a scene where a character has not chosen the most illogical path available to them. And finally, there are those first 60 minutes of the movie that I already mentioned. Can you say annoying? <br /> <br /> - I did not evaluate The House of Seven Corpses because of cases where the movie (probably by accident) actually works. My two favorites are the beginning and the end. The opening title sequence features the deaths of the previous seven owners and may be the highlight of the film. And the final scenes on the massive staircase when the zombie threatens the film crew are a bit effective (which is an endorsement). Overall, these moments are not enough to make this a good movie.
