Tom Wolfe's satirical and brilliantly observed life novel among New York snobbery takes on a glossy look here but is not yet well served. The film suffers not only from the miscasting of all men, Tom Hanks, as an indifferent Yuppie, Kewpie-doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative Southern belle and Bruce Willis (?!) As the darling of the New York literati. The most serious miscasting was in the director's chair. Robert Altman may have given life to these unpleasant characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all his visual sophistication, never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience. The resulting film looks good but seems blah regarding its dehumanizing theme in favor of status. Honestly, if a satire does not irritate the viewer, what is the purpose?
