... Or, more precisely, so bad that you will have the time of your life giggling when you watch! James Sbardellati's "Deathstalker," 1983, is certainly one of the most terrible productions that the subgenre Sword & Sorcery has brought, but it's a lot of fun. The acting is terrible, the plot is sheer crap, and the effects and photography could not be more amateurish. But it's the bad acting, the extravagant effects and the many mistakes that make this movie so hilarious. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> The Death Stalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely strong and skilled warrior. One day a good witch forces him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and a chalice, to free the country from its brutal ruler, the evil king and sorcerer Munkar. Getting the sword is very easy, but the amulet and the chalice are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately, the evil king organized a tournament in which the most skilled warriors of the country fight each other to death. The winner is then to take the place of the king. Of course the king does not want anyone to take his place and therefore he planned to kill the winner (instead of simply not organizing the tournament in the first place). The Death Stalker is not only to get the three powers of creation, but also to save the beautiful daughter of the good old king (Barbi Benton) from the clutches of the evil Munkar. Fortunately he does not get bored on his way to the tournament as he is allowed to corcorate the beautiful warrior woman Kaira (Lana Clarkson) meanwhile ... <br /> <br /> The film has great, incredibly stupid scenes and funny. Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> Deathstalker behead a bad guy with his sword. The head that falls, however, is not the head of this face. The falling head has a red goatee, while the beheaded face of the Death Stalker had dark, beardless hair. <br /> <br /> When the character of the warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) is introduced, she is seen for the first time in a black cloak, hiding her face and body. Oghris (Richard Brooker), travel companion of the Death Stalker, fights with her, and during the sword fight, her cloak (under which she is, of course, shirtless) opens, exposing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see from Lana Clarkson, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The last Deathstalker warrior has to fight in the tournament, it's a giant guy with a man's body and the head of a pig. <br /> <br /> Mal Munkar has a small ugly creature stuck in a chest. He feeds that little creature, eyeballs and human fingers. <br /> <br /> There are many other unintentional funny, hilarious and great scenes. The acting is terrible but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are beautiful, and although I have described this movie as "unintentionally funny," I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how bad the movie is. There is a fair amount of blood and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly horrible movie, but I still recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives!
