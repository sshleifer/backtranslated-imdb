What is it? is a hodgepodge of recurring bizarre motives (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas and openly racist music, among others), free from any kind of narrative or plot or character development. The whole thing struck me as a "freak show," and I'm not just referring to the unusual casting decisions. You have the feeling of a bad trip with acid, far beyond any level of drug use that anyone can attribute to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I can compare to is Eraserhead (my second least favorite movie ever), which was by far more depressing intent, but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time. It's one thing to sneak a peek into the inner workings of someone else's mind-even the chemically altered consciousness of another person-but it's quite another to simply throw strange visuals at me out of strangeness.
