Ugh, what can I say besides, ugh. I rented this movie because it was labeled as a continuation of the original Vampires. This movie could not have been a lick. Not only is the plot missing, but the acting is atrocious. Combined with some obvious holes, this movie is very difficult to watch. Many times I questioned my own sanity in continuing to watch the movie long after the plot had jumped the shark. Here is a sample of the licking aspects ... SPOILERS *** Professional Slayer insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night. He wakes up with a woman crying, sitting less than a meter away from him in the middle of nowhere. He will immediately comfort her without questioning his sudden appearance. She goes from crying to seducing him, and he lets happen with obvious results ... One of the main characters is Zoe, she was bitten by a vampire, but as long as she takes those "experimental experiments" . pills "she arrived in Mexico City, she is fine even though her body temperature is below room temperature ... Guard outside the monastery where the hero is staying the night is killed by vampires, hero leaves it the next day.He then returns a day later just to be amazed that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left ... <br /> <br /> ... avoid this movie.
