I usually enter this site before going to the movies, because I like to see what other people think of the movie. I read many reviews that said "thriller is not a horror movie". This led me to try this movie. I really should have trouble with these 'thriller / horror' statements, as it was neither! I almost went and asked for my money back, and if many of the reviewers enjoyed this rubbish ... well, you should be easily satisfied! At the end of the movie, the people behind me said out loud "what a waste of time" and I turned to them and replied "I could not have summed it up better". I kept waiting for something to happen ... but that did not happen. There was the potential for many good scares (or emotions, if you want), but nothing happened. Williams acted very well, but I felt he was changed by a poor script that did not work out. Save your money people, this is a turkey that will be presenting in a DVD 'bargain box' DVD store near you in the very predictable future!
