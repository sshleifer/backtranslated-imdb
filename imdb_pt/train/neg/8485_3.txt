From the terrible scenes of death to the weapons that shoot without making noise for a character named Fiend. It's all tiring, slow, unimaginative. It was good to see the guy with the cloak and the hunchback on the prowl. Visually it was frightening and probably occupied the public at the time, but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude even for such a movie. I just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were picnicking in the office. And then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned. Perhaps the best clue has been to look for a spot of water in the pocket of someone's pants.
