This is like the sixth movie. The movie is really bad. It does not offer anything in the death department. One-liners are bad and are something that should not be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes out as a happy child throughout the film. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes it worth it. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the 6th, but still one of the worst movies in the series. My Rating 2/10
