SPOILERS TOTALLY !!!! <br /> <br /> I had read the book "1st to die" and wanted to see if the movie followed the book, so I watched it. Most of the time this happened. There were a few minor differences (location of the last violent scene, for example), but not many, and for most of the film, remained true to the book more than most movies. <br /> <br /> This may have been a mistake. - although the film was perfectly released - with Pollen and Bellows especially - I was not so impressed with the book. Or let me take it back. I started very impressed, gradually became more disillusioned and in the end I was completely dissatisfied and felt almost cheated. No difference from the movie. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no "reward" in the book or in the movie. Rarely did I read who did the thriller that created a disappointment with the final resolution and I expected the film to vary a little. <br /> <br /> The whole - he did it, NO, she did it. No, they did so much) was not interesting, not fascinating and more confusing, boring and depressing, then anything else. Add to that, that the love of Lindsay's life dies in the end (after her illness disappears and she cries in her grave) ... and then cuts to where she's thinking of suicide ... then suddenly she's in a fight for his life with the REAL villain who was cleared after being arrested ... but it turns out he and his wife were together ... HELLO! This whole thing has now become "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old thriller. I felt cheated, ripped off by the book and watching the movie (I must admit that this caught my eye very well - the acting was very good for a TV movie) was hoping that it would not follow the book that ended up doing. <br /> I still think the film is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book (or maybe it's just because I knew what would happen) But I have to say how The story unraveled was not well made.
