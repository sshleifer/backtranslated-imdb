Soooo, Arnie is really a good guy, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and disobedience of orders, he is sent to jail (or some kind of field work). He escapes, but after a while he gets caught up again. This time, ends up in a bizarre reality show in which he must run for a while from a lot of tough guys with different themes and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know he's harder than the toughest guys. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, to be a fan of Arnie and all. However, "The Running Man" contains many flaws that really bother me. For example. The reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked public is shown a brief summary of the incident, complete with 5-10 different camera angles. That means the military helicopter Arnie flew in was equipped with nearly ten cameras filming crew members, one of them - inside - the eye of one of the crew members Arnie knocked over. <br /> <br /> There are other flaws as well, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a time, then kind of creates a set of stupidity and unrealism in which it drowns. <br /> <br /> The acting can not really be said to be anything better than sub-par, with Arnie in the lead role, doing an average Arnie performance. The rest of the cast gets away without being especially good or bad. <br /> <br /> Special effects are good, without being impressive. Sort by:
