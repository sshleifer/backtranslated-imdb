This is by far the worst movie I can already remember watching. Everything was unbelievably clich√©d and retarded. The acting was awful, too. The camera job was not bad, but it still could not be redeemed. The writer / director of this film must suffer from down syndrome if he believes that this film would help his career. I want the hour and a half of my life back that I lost watching this crap. I'd rather watch a video of the growing grass than that. I can not believe that IMDb is making me write 10 lines to post this, but I feel like this movie is so bad that I should continue to warn others about it. The reason I came to the film is that my girlfriend asked the local library to think that it was Kris Kristoferson's film that ended up being titled "Disappearances". I do not know who it was to blame for this garbage ending up on my DVD player, but I feel like someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / writer of this film hopes that I recognize him on the street.
