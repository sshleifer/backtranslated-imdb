Seriously. This is one of the most stupid family gigs ever. <br /> <br /> Portion - A family without a mother and 3 "parents" raise 3 girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters - Neak Danny freak, Joey caricature, Jesse obsessed hair, spoiled Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, right? <br /> <br /> So I do not think anyone should watch this show. I just laughed briefly at the show's run, and I think instead of lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, a torture far worse than anything else. 1.5 / 10 or: D
