When the movie started the first 4 minutes looked like a travel diary from California, I wanted to know if I got the tapes mixed. Then I breathed a sigh of relief upon seeing Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about his behavior, so she hires him as a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could live without the animal, the role of robot or aspects of incest. There's a good sex scene between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> My notes: D +
