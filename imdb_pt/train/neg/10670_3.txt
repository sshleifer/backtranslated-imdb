Simple characters you do not know and will never mind. Dialogue inducing insensities in places. No twists (they think they have one, but if you do not figure it out after about 40mins you're not very smart). Many well-known actors in roles and performances that, fortunately for all involved, will be forgotten as soon as the final credits are released. <br /> <br /> I do not care about "slow" movies, but they have to go somewhere. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The plot was not what made this film a direct film for the DVD, which is just a very convenient excuse to try to create some fake controversy. <br /> <br /> The rankings of 37 (!) ten (10), written, should be from people involved with the production.
