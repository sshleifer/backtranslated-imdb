Seriously - avoid this movie at any cost. I only saw it on my first "preview" and although I paid non-refundable money for it, I left the cinema after a mere 15 minutes. Which already includes 2 minutes of discussion between my friends whether or not to leave. First time I left a movie. And I went through some pretty bad ones. <br /> <br /> It is one of those movies that is dubbed (and evil) even though it is shown in its original language. It is based on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. About the military ("What do we do when we get to the combat zone?" - "You get out of the car and die"; in fact, it's a lot funnier to read here how it was delivered in the movie), about drugs (A guy eats some "space biscuits", behaves really silly and misses his marriage, or has to live with him while he is high - everything badly written and acted), about women in the army ("Why do we only receive trumpets?" arms! "That's the way it is, that's how it's going to stay") ... Argh. Okay, you may actually find this genuinely funny, but in that case you scared me seriously. <br /> <br /> In addition, I've seen one He was a very good actress in the kind of porn movies that you get on European TV late at night. So he had some crappy jokes (badly delivered), plus poor acting, lack of rhythm, badly dubbed and edited? not at any level used as a measurement for movies. <br /> <br /> I would be even bold to point out and say that this movie proves that there are people who can be much less funny zan zee German. And that's saying something if you like stereotypes. (What I do not do, it's cool to play with them, in case someone thinks I'm not good enough.) <br /> <br /> Instead of going to see this movie, do something useful. Try teaching crochet shrimp, paint your toenails in a really annoying color, dismantle your bike, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, convert to a different religion and come back - actually go and listen "Last Christmas "by Wham! in endless repetition. Anything, but I do not watch this horrible movie.
