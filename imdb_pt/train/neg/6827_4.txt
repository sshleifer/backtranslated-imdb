The dumb is so dumb, in this supposedly obscure black comedy. Essentially, what begins as Chris Klein trying to keep a low profile, ends up turning into an uninspired version of "The Three Amigos", just without any laugh. For black comedy to work, it must be scandalous, what "Play Dead" is not. For black comedy to work, it can not be malicious, which is "Play Dead". What "Play Dead" really is, it's a city full of crazy jobs. Fred Dunst, however, does a fairly fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character in "A Simple Plan," while Jake Busey does a fairly fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
