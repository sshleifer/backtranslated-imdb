Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, his role required no. She did not say much and went pale throughout the movie. Luise's character was a slave, then donated to marry the character of Paul Muni (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asians but were very convincing in their roles. I hope Paul Muni has received an Oscar for his performance, because that's what Luise must have received her Oscar for. She must have been an innovative actress, one of the first to act on the method. This seems like something Hollywood often does. Al Pacino played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance lackluster everywhere, and when she died, she did not change her expression in previous scenes. She remained the same throughout the film; she just changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant performance was so subtle, I suppose I did not see her.
