Finally, I thought someone would do justice to H.G. Wells's classic, not the other version defined at the wrong time or place, but firmly based on the book. Well, it definitely follows the book very closely, and that's the only advantage of this mess. <br /> <br /> That's 180 minutes (yes, 3 hours), the book is only 150 pages long. If Timothy Hines had the nerve to come here and say "if you can do better ..." I'd say "yes I could" and I've never used a video camera or any kind or theater school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid good money to take that crap to the U.K., do not make the same mistake as me.
