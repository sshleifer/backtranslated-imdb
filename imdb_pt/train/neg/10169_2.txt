It's 1978, and yes, obviously, there are many black players on the teams too! The fans will be annoyed and surely the 75,000 seats will be full, but less happy that there are so many black players on the field! This made for the Super Bowl TV movie is watchable. Not much else, but it's really amazing the cast of talented actors who make an appearance (for the time), probably most notably Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, anything Selleck brings to the screen is quickly outdone by "actors" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It's a silly story about betting on super bowl. PJ Jackson is accused of "New York" (read the mafia) for ensuring that the game ends in his favor, in this case a $ 10,000,000 bet. PJ is innocent enough, and seems to have a loose grip by buying some people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, the unsuspecting Lainie, takes over. For a time, the mystery of the murders is not known for certain, but it is clearly revealed in the final murder that Lainie is the new antagonist. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, but it's watchable. The acting is decent and the filming is fine. At least there was not any typical silly car chase from the 70's (they have their place just not here). Just keep an open mind about past stereotypes and the cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 2.5)
