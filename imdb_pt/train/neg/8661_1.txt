the film seems as if the director was forced to make this film by some gang of terrorists. in fact, it should be called the dinosaur crap. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good about this movie .. even the actors are not worth a penny. Do not waste your time watching this movie. the director must be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie. I mean, is not he ashamed to look at people's faces after they've seen your movie? the dinocroc seems to have been made in power point and quite a bit of cut and paste. and it's the same old story. man plays god creates some creature. he escapes and is happy eating people. and finally a beautiful girl and a guy with a sleeveless shirt have to come and kill her. bla bla .. you will discover the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
