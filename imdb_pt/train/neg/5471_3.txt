Typical Troma-trash, this obscene 1980s movie is considered one of the "highlights" of Lloyd Kaufman's notorious production studio, alongside "The Toxic Avenger" released a year earlier. "The Toxic Avenger" is far superior if you ask me, but this demented splatter film is nonetheless bearable as well; Just make sure you leave your full brain power at the door. Events happen in Tromaville, a small town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and they certainly are not lying. The safety precautions at the local nuclear power plant are below standard, to say the least (even Homer Simpson has never been so indifferent) and toxic waste seeps into nearby high school. The first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd, who begins to extract green material from all of his body cavities, but it is believed that his death was an accident because he had no less than two microwave ovens in his house! Oh, mankind! Shortly afterwards, however, nuclear leaks also affect the school's weeding and the thing really begins to get confused. After smoking a party-based, the cutest couple in school produces a giant worm that sets in the basement and feeds on teenage scum. "Class of Nuke 'in High" is a horror film production from the bottom up, with dialogues so stupid that hurt the ears and effects of makeup that give a new meaning to the word without meaning. If you enjoy watching faces melting, being crushed or split in half, this is definitely a must-see! Unlike the previously mentioned "The Toxic Avenger," this film suffers from a couple of really monotonous and exaggerated moments where nothing really significant happens, like when Chrissy and Warren try to figure out what's wrong with their hormones. The raw humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger" and the acting performances are unforgivably amateur. Proceed only if you are an avid fanatic for Troma.
