1 of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can not believe you just wasted 2 hours of your life as you see the role of credits. I honestly think I could make a better Vampire movie ... and I know nothing. The only thing that does not just suck (more than a Vampire) is Jason Scott Lee ... his character is at least a bit cool, has some mystery, and kicks a little.
