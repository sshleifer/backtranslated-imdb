Because "cruel" would be the only word to describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you really start? In a bit of b * tchiness, I'll start with the horrible performance of just about everyone in this movie. Scratch it. It hardly belongs to that sentence. I can not think of even a character who was portrayed well. Although, in all fairness, it would be almost impossible to portray these zero-dimension characters in a successful way. Still, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I purposely do not include - I'm pretending she does not exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was horrible. He tried to mirror the brightness that was the first, but failed in many ways. Virtually every part of him was useless - although he admits (unwillingly) that the plot twist was very good, it's a surprise. And the ending was at least a little funny. But this movie is there with the worst I've ever seen. Do not watch. Just do not do it. There is absolutely no value in watching it. None. It only takes pleasure from the first.
