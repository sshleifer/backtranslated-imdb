First, let us all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, not even decent, sometimes simply lousy. However, in this piece of @ *! ^ Named SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole sank. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnam veteran named Jack Kelly, known as Soldier (which should be as hard as a leather bracelet, and then some, you can believe when he pushes a nail polish across the feet of two men and attaches them to the floor), receives the news that his family was killed and his sister kidnapped. So he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. It had some potential, but still too thin to begin with. <br /> <br /> Now the acting. Being myself an actor, I am qualified to say that this was one of the worst actors in art history !!!!! Lamas is, well, himself. Assholes who play Rejected Clampets / Liberation must be thrown and shot for their so-called performances that are insulting to actors everywhere, especially the talented ones who never get their big shot! <br /> <br /> Finally, the action. The shooting is so good at BEST, and the fight is deplorable. I've seen more realistic fights at the Renaissance Festival (and those looking fake)! <br /> <br /> Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS COCA PART AT ALL COSTS! IF IT WAS THE ONLY MOVIE IN EXISTENCE, YOU STILL WANT TO AVOID! For the sake of your brain cell count, DO NOT watch this thing!
