A teenager who seems to have everything commits suicide. This leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking lots of questions ... and blaming themselves. <br /> <br /> Good idea, badly treated. For starters, this was done before 1988 - especially in TV movies and After School Specials. Besides some profanity and dialogues (hence the PG-13 rating) this did not add anything new. The result is predictable and Reeve's attempts at acting were really painful to watch. He is good now, but not in 1988. Besides that his character was dressed as a goofy and always looked so dirty it was difficult to amass sympathy. <br /> <br /> That besides the movie is boring. I saw all the scenes coming and every "surprise" was telegraphed. I basically could not wait for this to end. <br /> <br /> I have a vague recollection of seeing him in a theater in 1988 and hating him (he bombed BADLY). It still looks bad almost 20 years later. The subject is worth being treated, but has been done better (with better performance) in countless other films. "Ordinary people" comes to mind. You can skip this one.
