Here is another blasphemous story in Europe in which they explode the religion of their country. (These atheistic filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see a brutal detonation of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I'm not Catholic). <br /> <br /> This really won an Oscar for foreign film. This is probably because history has made Catholics and religious beliefs in general seem extremely weak. One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else. He is portrayed as nothing but an idiot. No wonder the secular-dominated Academy has loved this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is an idiot who pretends to play a guy who renounces his religion in order to marry one of the four daughters of the story. The daughters take turns enticing the student of the "seminary" (which states that he studied for six years, but that is agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous is this movie ?? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a shame and another excellent example of the secular-progressive fanaticism of the film world, all over the world (not just Hollywood).
