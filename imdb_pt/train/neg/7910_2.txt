I saw most of "My Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC Film Festival in New York and had to leave the theater due to feelings of nausea popping up inside me. I've seen Bollywood movies, and I've seen satires of Bollywood movies. This movie could not decide which one it wanted to be, so it turned out to be a joke about itself. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been copied generously from films like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and what a sloppy and lazy job at it. How can Bollywood be discouraged from its determination to stick to overused and well-trodden scripts? Is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real and fascinating stories that certainly exist and transpire in the land of a billion people? The super smart auto driver, the cow on the street, free scenes from foreign locations, senseless scenes from the streets of Mumbai, they are all there. All possible clich√©s about India were faithfully included. So sickly predictable. ugh !!! Acting performances are weak across the board, except for Neha Dubey who is talented and handsome. One has to wonder why she would choose such a project.
