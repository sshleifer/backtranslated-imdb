Filmfour will have to do a lot better than this little movie if they get the right kind of reputation. <br /> <br /> This film is set in Glasgow (although only a couple of minor characters have something approaching a Scottish accent). The premise, about people whose lives are going nowhere, they all meet in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs, COULD has created a cult movie, very funny, insightful and insightful. Instead, we have a bunch of self-obsessed saddos and a plot that was made for the parties that I'm surprised has not been banned. X and Y are friends. X is sleeping with Z. Y also sleeps with Z. Oh, you find out. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it looked like something a group of 16 year olds would have written for a GCSE theater project. The female character was completely superfluous-just written as a symbolic female in the hope that women would be persuaded to see her. <br /> <br /> If you are the type of kid who laughs at beer ads and can usually be found wandering in packs screaming on Saturday nights in elusive city centers then you will love this movie and find it "a right laff". All others, run, do not stray from this sorry mismatch. <br /> <br /> And a question, when the group left the seaside town "boring" (Saltcoats, incidentally, although they changed the name in the film), to return to Glasgow, WHY did they do it through of the Forton motorway services in LANCASTER which is in England?
