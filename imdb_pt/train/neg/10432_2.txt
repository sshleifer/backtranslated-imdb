Horrible end - and I can not believe Moore spent a year inventing it. Smacks by L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard said in three weeks. This was really disappointing enough for me to play my records for the first 3.5 years. Now, the first 1.5 hours were full of action, though absurd on the premise, and then deteriorated into a slow and painful dissolution of the series. Unbelievable how slow and prolonged that last hour was. Should we think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in materialism, I would reread Daniel Quinn's Ismael. It is absurd to think that 38 thousand people would give up everything for a "new beginning". Absurd to launch a Kara that disappeared and a Baltar and a Six reappearing. Absurd to play on mitochondrial eve. Just absurd
