Well, I could not even really enjoy this movie because of its cult values. It is an action movie from the movie B, from the director of "Commando", who is however very idiotic and silly to consider it a good movie B with enough entertainment value. The film of the 90s, but above all, the film should remember an action movie of the 80s, when this type of movie B was on the rise all the time. These films have always been exaggerated and have never paid much attention to their history or acting. It was all about blowing things up, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. This movie has all these ingredients, but even then I really did not enjoy watching this movie as much as I like watching similar movies. Hard to say why really since history and acting and such are as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre film of the same era. <br /> <br /> It's probably because the movie is often being distant. very silly. All these kinds of movies have their silly moments, but this movie is full of it. The fighting, Dolph Lundgren running shirtless, the characters, the story. Everything is not very good because it is often too bad for words. The story sometimes is not even trying to make a bit of sense and even what is the main line of the movie plot in general? Its story is everywhere and seems to be written only to create a movie with fighting sequences, armed struggles and such. And those sequences are not very good to actually see. The moments are very short and quite disappointing to actually see, from the man who brought us "Commando". <br /> <br /> It is above all a Dolph Lundgren, in which he begins to play the action hero's great star, who kicks apparently apparently with relative ease, knows how to deal with guns and other guns, and of course, also receives the girl, played by Tia Carrere. This all also brings us one of the worst editing sequences in the action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequences I've seen in any movie. Both are very lame to words and just very poorly put together. <br /> <br /> None of the characters actually work. The good ones are cops, but they never seem to behave like one. They simply kill without having to take responsibility for anyone and are not too keen on making any arrests or telling anyone about their findings. Not even when they find out that a big Japanese crime syndicate is trying to take to the streets of Los Angeles and a brewery is working as a cover for a drug factory and large-scale drug smuggling. And also think about that for a moment, what is Brandon Lee's overall goal in the movie? The film could have been done easily without him and the girl too. <br /> <br /> Too stupid, lame and simplistic and not fun enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
