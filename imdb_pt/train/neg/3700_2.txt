because that's the only way you will not think that this movie is a total waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait" (which at least is worth seeing) is a bad excuse for a romantic comedy. It's another vehicle to give Rock some time in movies for a weak comedy that does not play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes are usually from the body of an old man, fat, rich and dead, but they are shown coming from Rock himself. As he insults blacks and whites, the chemistry is wrong. The film is not funny, poorly filmed acting is weak at best. Go rent "Heaven Can Wait" and a live Rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game.
