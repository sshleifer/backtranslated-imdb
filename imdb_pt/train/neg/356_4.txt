The form of the film is that of a shocking suspense. There are surprises, twists, twists and turns. Sometimes this is really a "tip of the seat" movie. But it disappoints and disappoints severely. <br /> <br /> The villain of the play is not believable; your character does not hold together. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but I will only say that the character we encountered at the beginning simply could not be the one we see at the end. <br /> <br /> The second major disappointment of the film is that - it finally becomes little more than a horror movie. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the films "Friday the 13th". Not that all movies need to be always tasteful, but this movie is slippery from time to time. <br /> <br /> Although the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, he also does not live up to his usual pattern, and often just seems to be walking the steps.
