This movie is one of the reasons why the IMDB should allow a vote of 0/10. The acting is horrible, even what some here praised, the character of Carpathia! The script looks like it was written in a hurry. In one scene, the black preacher who was left behind, when asked by Buck what "dan7" meant in computer graphics, said: "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER 24." He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers missed that slip. Perhaps the worst part is that the eschatological position of the film is biblically unfounded. While many Christians embraced the film's interpretation of the end-time events, such an interpretation, in my view, is flawed. To understand these flaws, read Jim McKeever's "Christians Will Go By The Tribulation," and George E. Ladd's "The Blessed Hope, A Bible Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture."
