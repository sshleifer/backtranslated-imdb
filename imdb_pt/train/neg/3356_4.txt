Shirley Jackson's novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is an atmospheric tale of terror, which transmits supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well defined, and the chills are well staged. A masterpiece haunts. <br /> <br /> The 1963 chiller The Haunting is next to the book, but it also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and so the book's terror and the shivers run even better on the screen. Black and white photography only adds to the shiver of the film. Great! <br /> <br /> And then Jan de Bont did it. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting hit theaters - if you could call it a remake. Why they had to make a remake of the 1963 film is a mystery in itself, but at the moment, let's look at the movie itself. <br /> <br /> It starts on average, as most horror movies do. The setting used for Hill House is beautiful, and strangely mysterious, and for a few minutes, it looks like the film will really be a fair tale. And then, the first scare comes: a strand of loose carnation cuts off a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is hilarious, and truth be told, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> From then on, the film simply goes down. The acting seems to become a bit of wood as the film continues, with Owen Wilson's character being particularly annoying (so it's a relief when he's beheaded by the barrel). <br /> <br /> Special effects pretty much make this movie, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly extravagant and look very old-fashioned. Examples of this are many, so I will not bother listing them. <br /> <br /> So, after all, I, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend you look at the original cooler, or, alternatively, buy Shirley Jackson's novel. But please stay away from it. And, if you decide to watch it, watch it on TV (since many channels love to show this movie, not the original) or rent it cheap, but, please, do not buy it, whatever you do. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final evaluation: 4/10
