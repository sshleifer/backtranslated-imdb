There's a reason why it went straight to the video - the story is shocking, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a despicable way - sex in churches, and other scenes that border on bad taste (such as the scene in the laundry room) contaminate that movie. Judge Reinhold as the horn is fine - but the film itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well made. But it's a good movie for trivia contests - because few people saw it.
