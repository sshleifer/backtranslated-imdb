It was to convince the world that it did not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that is probably remembered by many people. It's from The Usual Suspects, of course, about Kaiser Gold ... I mean, Sose ... <br /> <br /> I got another one like this: -The stupidest trick a director ever did was try to convince an audience that he really had a plot - <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the saddest movies I've seen in a long time. It starts very well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very clever premise. But unfortunately, the only way this movie is going is a self-destruct course. And he does it, not by a single blow, but with small cuts on his wrist. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the comments here that surprise you with the fact that they have found a way to explain this donut. With enough booze in my brain, I would probably be able to explain the very existence of humanity on a very plausible level. I saw and read about a dozen totally different ways that people explained the story. And they range from a totally defined story in someone's head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to throw away his enemies through chess games. <br /> <br /> And that's all very cool. But at the same time, it is painful that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And, in any case, it's a rip-off from a number of films and books like Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle, and we're not dealing with kind loans here is a blatant robbery. <br /> <br /> What ends up going wrong here in this movie is that the plot turns like a speed drunk. <br /> <br /> If this movie were a roller coaster, you would have been shocked at the attraction next to it shortly after taking off There are so many twists in this movie that will never be solved, that if it were a cocktail, you would need a lifetime supply of buckets to work the nausea after drinking Nothing is explained and when you finally understand the direction you think <br /> <br /> I think this story was not going anywhere on paper and Ritchy must have thought it was amazing to make a movie anyway, being the next David Lynch or something. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or totally rape their own work (Ritchy: seek professional help). What could easily have been a jewel, instead becomes a planned piece of art, a food for pseudo-intellectuals to be debated in the Sunday afternoon debate clubs. <br /> <br /> Save your soul and stomach, avoid at all costs!
