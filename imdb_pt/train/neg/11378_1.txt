The MST3K guys should see this dog from a movie. It's basically about a dopey hack actor in Hollywood who can not do any acting gigs. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So, what does this idiot actor do? He dyes his blonde hair and starts acting like a surfer from LA in the naive hope that this will lead him to act as an actor. You'll laugh out of your head at so many funny scenes from the movie. Like when the actor's girlfriend is heartbroken and sobbing and saying phrases like, "How could you do this to me?" And why is she crying? Because he dyed blond hair and became a surfer to do theater shows. This movie does not make sense at all! The actor who played the governor in Benson is also in this and he plays a stereotyped right-wing politician with a mute and funny dialogue. This movie is going to kill you, trust me. You talking to me?!
