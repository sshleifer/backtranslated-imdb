I'm a big fan of 50's science fiction, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the film was a natural vehicle for a classic science fiction film, the director relied heavily on him to bring the film. It's clear he was working out of money, because the whole movie is full of swollen dialogues that last forever. I've never seen much time killing in a movie. There's probably less than 60 seconds of blob filming throughout the movie, and most of the rest are people involved. in many badly written and correct dialogues. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but good heavens ... how could the cast have thought someone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers?
