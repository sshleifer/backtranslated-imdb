I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and loved the film so much - even "unmystied" - that I decided to watch the entire series of "Deathstalker" movies. I bought I and II and settled down to laugh. <br /> <br /> Nothing about "Deathstalker I" was funny on any level and when the credits rolled I was embarrassed and sorry for buying! Very ugly and naked. I think either "DS 3" was a much cleaner production or the MST3K actually edited a lot because I expected something similar, ie, stupid, carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99, it seemed like a waste of money. I did not even open "DS 2" because I'm going to return it tomorrow. Now I'll probably throw away this DVD because I can not return it and no one wants it - including myself! So, really, do not bother with that. Even nudity (much, incidentally) is uninspiring and disgusting.
