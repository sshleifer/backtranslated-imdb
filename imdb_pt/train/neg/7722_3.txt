Extremely poor action movie starring the ever-wood Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee stuck in a sidekick role that never seems to gel. The action is at best average, a bit of nudity flung and yes Aunt Carrera uses a double body! The set-up is the usual renegade police officer forced to break into a new partner in a big case, manufacturers at least try to give the formula a twist making Lundgren the policeman with Eastern values ​​and Lee the Although zero character development is almost comical, the oriental warrior costume of Lundgrens for the great confrontation has to be seen to be believed. The action sequences are by the numbers and Lee (who would continue to make the excellent The Crow) is never given the scope to show any particular brilliance of the martial arts. But given his illustrious kinship, he must have been under a lot of pressure and was much better served, not having to live up to his father, assuming a very different role in The Crow, which showed that a single actor he may have become were it not for his tragic and premature death. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a hardcore Lundgren fan or a fan of 1980s action movies (think Cobra etc.), avoid. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
