I was curious to watch this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to any kind of views or opinions. It does not matter to me if Jesus existed in the way it is written in the Bible. Whether Mary was a virgin or not, or all other similar pagan coincidences. What matters to me is the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What made me angry is when someone takes a sentence, presents it as a fact, but without showing the context in which it was written. For example, they showed the following sentence in this film: "Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me" Jesus (Lukas 19:27) What they did not do telling you is the context. Jesus told a story about an evil king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! After quoting the wrong Bible they present us screaming hateful people (pseudo-Christians). Most viewers do not check the information presented, so they begin to think that Jesus = hate = is not good for me or anyone else. This is pure people of manipulation. Please use your brain. Do not take everything as a fact they say in this movie. We have destroyed our very foundation, our civilization, if we begin to dismantle Jesus in this way and the message he has brought to us. You saw the branch you're sitting on.
