If this movie had a budget of 20 million, I'd like to know where the money went. A monkey could have CGI effects better than what was wasted for 3 hours on this awful piece of junk, though I must admit that the machines and the Martians would have looked very, very cool in an original game station game, and the first PC games from the mid-1990s, if a game had already been made. What puzzles me is where the money went? Pendragon's movies could have made a great movie with good old-fashioned models and computer-controlled cameras at LA Lucas around 1975-83, and actors that really look like what they're doing (or spoiling in this case) for about even 20 million. This is possibly the worst movie ever made! I would rather go through a 24 hour replay of Ishtar than watch this movie again. I hated it completely! I regressed. I say this is the worst movie we've ever done because, unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, these movies are so bad that you have a special place in your heart for them, you love them. There is no love for this movie and nowhere in my DVD library for it. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I'm betting that money for the movie was spent on drinking and other addictions to the cast and crew. Shame on you Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
