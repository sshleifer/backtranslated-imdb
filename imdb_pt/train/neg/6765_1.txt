* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a brilliant critique of media obsession with violence. But this statement ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as cruel and inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid fascination of the media. Instead, he lends them justification. The film portrays almost all the victims as someone who deserved to be hurt. Involved in vicious stereotypes, Stone portrays the victims as unpleasant caricatures - idiot idiots, immigrants spoken in English, lazy fat people. The only person who owns the homicidal parakeets is also a stereotype. Of course they make friends with the old American Indian who uses hallucinogens - why are they fashionable, man? Let's make him an admirable character. Fat people, Chinese clerks, and country boys are not cool, so let's make it look like they deserve to die. Instead of cheering, to hate that they are corrupted by their crimes, their fury makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are sexy and the surreal and cool visuals will attract more impressionable people. Justice is ridiculed. Police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and sullen compared to the GQ killers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film, but in the "reality" of the film. There are no nuances or subtleties in the film - just exaggerated visuals and performances. The film does not say anything new or specific about the obsession with violence. Proof that the film flaws in your message is in real real world reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for the murders they committed. The film's "message" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results. The smart message is far from visible.
