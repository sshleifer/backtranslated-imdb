At the end of the film, I felt it was very technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy carries out ransom at sea. I liked to see that the engines have fire extinguishers. I think I should have realized this before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is strange and unrealistic. The acting was very good, since they are more experienced professionals, but if you will extend so much of what would probably happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comic, etc. Everything was taken very seriously. At least the film had Felix Ungar as pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The film was filled with familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit in the drama, but that undermines the quality of a movie when a serious subject is turned into a cartoon. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My implication with movies about air travel is that everyone just moves casually. They walk around with drinks, putting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, as if they were in a building or something, and acting as if the turbulence just did not exist. Also, I know it's a disaster movie, but the suspense does not have to include a 30 second failure after hitting something. Anyway, the talented actors and actresses keep this script weak from being turned into a movie that was canned after their first showing. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to see a psychotic person being adorned ... :)
