Reconstruction of the 1950s (London) Soho and the people on the rise. Based on a cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. Neither more nor less. Give it $ 15 million and it will make a $ 15 million pop video. Here he forgets that two minutes with people who can not really act are one thing - but two hours? What was he thinking? Besides who's the audience? Who cares about a book that has been well remembered in the past? The usual London story of the chancer taking advantage of their chance. <br /> <br /> What could really drag this movie further down? Oh, I know, third-rate music that sounds like it's made locally. David Bowie chronicles the title of the movie several times and this is the highlight. The soundtrack album is clay pigeon material. <br /> <br /> But there is one good thing. Good recreation of the Soho period. Shame they could not think of anything to put in front of him.
