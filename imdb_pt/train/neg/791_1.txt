Imagine the scene when a group of writers sit around a table and say, "Let a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) on the street and ask if he is black, then go away" . The other writers laugh hysterically, until someone suggests they repeat it in every episode. More laughter Now, if you think the premise is funny, and the program contains many of those kinds of situations, you'll enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more fun like watching dry paint. Those who have written brilliant reports of this program must go out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny. Another example of humor in the show, a girl tries to stop paying at the grocery store trying to hypnotize the cashier. Marginally funny for the first time, but why repeat more and more at different shows with different boxes? I could give other examples, but these can only be treated as spoilers, spreading why this comedy is not funny at all.
