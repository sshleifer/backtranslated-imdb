This movie is very annoying. There are stretches of bare meat thrown around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake, but they fail. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin - she does a masterful job dealing with it. character, but Day-Lewis traces most of his lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. The inconsistencies between domestic / marriage problems and political crises are poorly matched. Attitudes of character change without explanation everywhere. Badly disjointed.
