What happened to Keaton is what I want to know. <br /> <br /> Actually I did not, I crawled away, gasping, thinking she owed half the brokers in Vegas, or maybe not, maybe she just brainwashed. , blackmailed and bored to death. Rich enough to adopt a third world country, she somehow had to star in another baba full of cliches, based on the same character franchise she has been doing since 'Father of the Bride' ('91). You think she's going head to head with Mr.Bean. <br /> <br /> So the husband (Dax) is dismissed by the boss's son, his mother (Keaton leaves his father after the classic row, and falls with his own show of dog in tow, oh those little rascals The husband has cold feet for diaper work, my wife's watch is running and hey, let's shoot a space cadet as the second guest of the house, for a long time, all in one day, because this is so funny and original. <br /> <br /> Wife fills up and leaves, mom leaves dad for space cadet and the couple makes in time to close the credits, 86 very long minutes later. <br /> <br /> Now if you have to have a cadet space, he can not be dishonest too, he can not schematize some excuse for his stay, and if the mother leaves the father, she can not get into a cab dressed as a pumpkin just because some screenwriter agonized over how to liven up the thing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the gag in which they invite you only to pa she has her canine entourage in the cab has to be banned now. And you only have an unpleasant two-dimensional boss to denigrate. Another killer movie would be the screenplay of the movie that the space cadet is toiling, supposedly dumber than the current, again, you leave nausea. Liv Tyler does not look happy here, her voice was strange at times, made me wonder if they later had their redub, and she's smart, she took care of great roles and we forgive her for Jersey Girl , this was prone to disasters, could happen to anyone. Dax Shepard was watchable and this is generous considering the material. Personally, it is the director, the writers and especially the producers that I would love to see tar'n'feathered before being sent to Guantanamo as toys for the prisoners, and that's me maintaining that 'life' .
