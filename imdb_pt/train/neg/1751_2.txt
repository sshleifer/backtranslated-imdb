Assisted in Hulu (lots of commercials!) So broke the rhythm but even so, it was like watching a really bad comrade movie from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I would protest against the depiction of all males as venal and all women as shrews. They cheated for Western sales videos and used many western models so the males could play them. I usually really like Indian movies, but this was a big disappointment, especially for a modern Indian movie. The story does not take place in India (uncle still refers to when Mac will return to India), but I can not figure out where it should be going.
