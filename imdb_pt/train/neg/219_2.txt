It could have been a good movie if you had explored something more interesting than just the surface of a lesbian relationship, if that was the meaning of the movie ... it is quite predictable not to mention that the two girls look like the Russian tATu group. ..coincidence? I think not. There is nothing original in this movie to support you, so they had to use something that is already famous. You know the recipe. The other actors ... well, I do not know what their role is. Most of them are well-known people in Romania and I must mention that some of them are not even actors (eg Michiela Radulescu) .SO to summarize: "tatty girl girl" + desperate / advertising needing "actors" + a nonexistent plot + the occasion to use bad language to shock = to hate ... too bad ... the idea was good, though ... and I am seriously preventing myself from commenting on the title ...
