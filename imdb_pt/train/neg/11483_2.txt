I was totally excited to see this movie. I was waiting a year for it to be cleaned here in New Zealand. I should not have gotten so excited because it was so disappointing and it's definitely Clark's worst movie. There is so much wrong with this movie. First of all, some of the performances are great, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with curly brown hair (I can not remember her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable. especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity that he turns his scenes into a parody virtually. The script seemed to have been written by a first-year film student. No, sorry, a high school student ... someone who has never seen a movie before. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaninglessness of the existence of these children? It certainly did not stop him from getting into a damn good pervert. I'm not prude, but I did not need to see teen breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I think he'll never get over it.
