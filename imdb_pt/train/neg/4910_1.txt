The word "1st" in the title has a more sinister meaning to the viewers of this film than to the victims of the crime. At least they do not have to stick around and watch this endless movie come to its end. <br /> <br /> 1st should refer to: 1st draft of a script; 1ยบ leva used in each performance in the final film; 1st edition in post-production; etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not too bad, it's just that everything about the movie comes out as worse than the third rate, from the goofy script, to the wooden performances. And while suffering with this movie, at the 2 o'clock mark you want to be expelled from your misery. With 160 minutes in length, it is clear that it should have been edited for less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Going into details about the lame script and acting serves few purposes. Even in the equally awful Lake Placid, at least the performances of Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda built from an extremely weak script were subtle enough to make you laugh at the movie. In 1st to Die, the person ends up regretting only the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the suicide preparation of the female protagonist. <br /> <br /> The issue is so bad that it is never presented. for one of the main characters, which I think (it was never said) is a DA She only appears in a scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously, the scene in which it is presented to the viewer was left on the editor's floor. And no one noticed that a character appearing out of nowhere was an unusual movie maneuver. <br /> <br /> In a word, do not waste your time on this one. My wife and I wish we did not. But at least we created our own amusements commenting on various places in the movie as if it were the Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
