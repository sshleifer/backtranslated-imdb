I wanted to vote zero or less. I loved the review. It's the worst movie ever made and "unbearable" is the perfect word for it, unless there's something worse than Roget ever thought of. I'm also lost in thinking of something negative enough to accurately describe Bo Derek. The best that can be said of her is that she is consistent.
