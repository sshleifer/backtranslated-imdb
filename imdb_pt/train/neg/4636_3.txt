The "Confidential" part was intended to rely on the popular appeal of the sinister magazine of the same name, while the issue of labor extortion was linked to the headlines of the day's investigations. However, despite the cast of B-level A films and some good screenplay ideas, the film drags on for about 73 minutes. It is a cheap production all the way. What is needed to compensate for the low production values ​​is some imagination, especially from the uninspired director Sidney Salkow. Some daylight shots, for example, would have helped ease the succession of dark studio sets. An elegant helmsman like Anthony Mann could have done something with the thick ear stuff, but Salkow considers it just another payday exercise. It's a shame that the typical low-key style of Brian Keith does not work here, looking just wood and lethargic, while cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. is overly drunk. Clearly, Salkow is not the director of an actor. But, you have to hand him over to that little Beverly Garland number who treats his role with vehemence and dedication. Too bad she was not in charge. My advice is to ignore you, unless you're in ridiculous bar-girls who do nothing but knock down whiskeys in typical 1950s fashion.
