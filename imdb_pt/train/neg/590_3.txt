I was sadly disappointed by this movie due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to bring the films to a very weak attempt of horror. The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it was not able to excite, really scare me or shock me - there was a part in the whole movie that I thought was horrible, but even if I did not rescue it. I started to like Kate's character until the end of the movie, she seemed to soften and become a bit more realistic in the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really needed for this movie and I think the director / writer was thrilled with the myriad of characters used for no purpose, if he had left the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on Kate's part, it might have worked - Jeremy's acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable observing the evil in the chemistry of the screen - or the lack thereof. What a shame. Disappointing.
