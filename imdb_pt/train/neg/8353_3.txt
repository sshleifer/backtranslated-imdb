Beaudray Demerille (a weak Peter Fonda, who also directed), an elderly player, beats young teenager Wanda "Nevada" (beautiful but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together, the unlikely pair (of course) embarks on a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is the story and there really is no need to look for a deeper meaning in it. It just is not there. The performance is very weak too, which was a big surprise, given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this movie, take a look at the beautiful scenery and some good looks of a young Brooke Shields. Her character, however, is so annoying (especially in the beginning) and stupid that she never gets to be sexy or attractive. Too bad, but given the story, I doubt if anything else could be made of it. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this movie. He must have even told his father (Henry Fonda) in a (useless) turnout in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, this was their only movie together. Henry could not be in EASY RIDER, for example? 3/10
