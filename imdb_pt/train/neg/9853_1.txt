I think most people want to believe that extraordinary things exist and this movie shows no restraint in trying to exploit it to the fullest. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are cutting edge, but from a scientific point of view this just does not work. Flying bladder full of hydrogen? They would need to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there is the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just do not try to pass this on as fact. Some people will always misunderstand. In short, the movie is fun, but I always find myself saying "oh brother, what a load of ...". If you want a FAKE documentary, watch This Is Spinal Tap. Or, at a minimum, turn off the sound.
