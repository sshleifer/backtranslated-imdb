Anyone who saw the original would have to leave and destroy this terrible remake. Alex Baldwin trying to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word-for-word remake simply does not work. Although Baldwin did an admirable job, this is a failure from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never try to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw said enough. McQueen looked dangerous, threatening and believable as Doc, the movie had thrill and suspense, Baldwin and company did it in a comedy, I laughed the first and only time I saw this miserable movie. And that terrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen, who is one of today's most exciting and believable actors! Did the makeup guys get this for Michael, what were they thinking? If you want to see the production of movies the way you were under the direction of Sam Peckinpah, get the original!
