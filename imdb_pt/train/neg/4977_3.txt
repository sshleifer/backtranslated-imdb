This is a retelling of the Beowulf story, made for television and somewhat unnecessary for the Sci-Fi Channel, especially after the recent 2005 film "Beowulf and Grendel." This film does not really enter into the story of Beowulf, but leads us only through his battle against the voracious beast known as Grendel, for it leaves a kingdom in utter fear and tumult while the mighty viking warrior, Beowulf is called upon to deliver them from fury of the monster. If this is done successfully, the king will no longer have to sacrifice his children to keep him under control. After a few unsuccessful attempts, the creature is dead, but it is an angry and vengeful mother who soon attacks, leaving Beowulf to lend again her mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat her. "Grendel" seems to have been filmed on a tiny budget and the CG effects are terrible. Like I said, this movie is absolutely unnecessary.
