Two days after seeing this, I'm still in agony for seeing it. It's so bad, you have to wonder how anyone could write this trick, much less allow it to be released to the general public. Stilted acting, a protagonist who seems to be sleepwalking, and Alison Eastwood being embarrassed. The action is indicative of making low budget movies, which means it is painfully bad. The plot? Well, if you were 6, you could have written this movie. Simplistic, idealistic and simply lame.
