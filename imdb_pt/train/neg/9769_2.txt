I read this Thornton Wilder piece last year in the eighth grade. I was also forced to go through this poor translation on the screen. Let me tell you, it's not a fantastic move, it's easily overcome, but the man deserves a much better chance. The performance was really lacking, the setting - honest to God - looked as if it had been drawn on cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it could not get worse, the quality of the sound is terrible ... there is this numbing buzz whenever an actor speaks ... and I also could not help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, is nonexistent. The actors seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It's in black and white, which would be nice, but it brings the breeze even more. Anyway, I think if you're serious about watching this movie, which I really do not recommend, then do not point your hopes up. The game, however robust, is probably better.
