Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this right now, and I think this movie is terrible. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "They're doing all this for a man !?" <br /> <br /> I think these women have no intensity, they have no idea of ​​the struggle between tragedy and identity, and it is hardly worth fighting for these men. During the dance scene, where Zhang Zi Yi conquers them, men seem more stupid than admirers. <br /> <br /> The Japanese people have much more intensity than the Chinese people, and to be geisha is the Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue is so little mysterious, so American. If a European had done this with Eastern Europeans, they would have done a much better job. <br /> <br /> I have to add: it seems that most people who liked the movie are American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. All written for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think the Chinese actresses are lovely, but I can not say they are good performances in this movie. Yes, the cinematography is great, but in fact I can not see how it is possible to see that these characters are complex and deep. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be amazing to see that.
