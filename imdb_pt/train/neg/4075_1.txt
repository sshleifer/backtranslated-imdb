I am a horror / blood movie freak and this movie was so bad, I felt ashamed for not just the "actors" but also the director and the poor bastard of a producer who really put his money into this mess. <br /> From the title, you'd expect a big carnage, a bit of plot and at least some direction or dialogue. Instead, you get what appears to be an episode of Three Stooges a little more violent and sexual. At least I laugh at the Three Stooges. While watching this crap, I turned on another TV and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I kept watching Stern. Watching this "movie" I realize I could produce a movie with three monkeys, two DV cameras, $ 50 in cash and a broken PC. This movie is my inspiration to get into movies without a budget. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned ... there is much nothing here, but lots of talk and very little action. That makes "KaZaam" look like a Meryl Streep movie. <br /> <br /> I am sure that Germany has not banned this because of sex or violence. Other countries need to pay attention.
