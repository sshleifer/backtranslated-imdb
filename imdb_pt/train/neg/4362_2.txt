A group of human-looking aliens who go to Earth to eat collision land on a planet of prehistoric beasts instead, where they all eat physcedelic mushrooms and slows down the act. Quilted with footage of "Planet of the Dinosuars" and horrible jokes this is definitely one to miss. The acting is atrocious too, and meanwhile it's not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what movie can it be?) This is still pretty disgusting. The 90 minute long seems like an eternity and you're probably cursing life, so do yourself a great favor and just go ahead, skip this fucking movie, there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers try to resell this shit like an MST3K style making fun of the movie they did a decade earlier, and that works to some degree, but it's still not watchable, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a very ugly voice. /> <br /> My category: D- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: Joke comment, 17 Behind the scenes of the featurette; 7 minutes for black featurette; Jessica Mills reporting; Gallery of stills; and original trailer
