This film is about a family trying to come to terms with the death of the mother / wife, moving to Genova, Italy. <br /> <br /> The plot of "Genova" looks promising, but unfortunately it is empty and unfocused. The film consists of only a collection of scenes that depict the family's everyday life, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are redundant and tiresome, failing to engage viewers emotionally. The ending is very disappointing as it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored with "Genova". The only good thing about the movie is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. "Genova" can serve as an extended touring advertisement for the city, but not as a movie to be enjoyed.
