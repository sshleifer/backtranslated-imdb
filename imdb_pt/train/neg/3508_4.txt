Despite the overwhelming cult that followed this sad "documentary," I must admit that I cordially hated the film that hit our party as a work of exploitation far more distressing than informative. That said, after seeing the magnificent stage musical taken out, one can appreciate what the film could have been in safer hands. We suspect that many of us who have actively suffered through the film may have had extravagant pleasures, and their most vicious fans have been destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that many of us - or those we know - are just a two steps from the deplorable situation of the two portrayed crazy women who live and contribute to misery, they seem unable to control or escape. <br /> <br /> The film leaves the viewer wondering desperately how anyone could have slid into this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, offers no clues or explanations, just a horror show not rescued by humor or insight <br /> <br /> This overwhelming leveling of the soul of the film makes the realization of the stage version (which should be filmed for the cable) even more remarkable. The second act is faithful in almost every detail for the film under discussion, but strangely putting the sad situation of the detainees in music raises the human tragedy to art. Most importantly, this act is preceded by a beautiful Act I, in which we find women before their decent and mutually enabled madness, and clues are offered as to how their isolated purgatory arose. In short, everything that the FILM is missing. <br /> <br /> To the credit of filmmakers (or their successors), the excellent release of Criterion DVD includes bonus material and bonuses that partially recapture the main movie - behind the film. photographs of scenes, interviews, and commentaries - filling in some of the blanks that the original edition consciously decided to omit in its quest for unadulterated horror and depression. They can not make the amateur movie satisfactory, but they can at least make it a bit more understandable. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it's just the remarkable stage piece inspired and designed by writer Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie, who elevates the original GRAY GARDENS rating above a single ( generous) star.
