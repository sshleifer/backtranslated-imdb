This wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with it, it is only due to rage or drugs anti-rage it The local cop thinks John is responsible for several horrible crimes. "The Bat People" by Jerry Jameson is a horrible movie. The script is very annoying and there is no blood or nudity. So boring you will scratch your head in total disbelief after going through it. Even the drawing of a bat-man creature by a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and not memorable. Avoid this stench like the plague. of 10.
