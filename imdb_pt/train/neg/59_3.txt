The protocol is an implausible film whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy waitress who gets famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes halfway through the movie and Goldie's charm does not save this movie. Unless you are a fan of Goldie Hawn, do not go out of your way to see this movie.
