This movie is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi point to the fact that it is a good-natured gangster movie. <br /> <br /> However, the introduction of the ridiculous feminine leadership begins a series of ridiculous twists that hide the artificial end. The film moves between comedy (description used freely) and surreal drama with some adult scenes out of context. The main woman (the title Angel) is misinterpreted and the actress is not helped by the script that requires some unbelievable, extreme character to be portrayed. James Belushi is the only one who takes good care of his part, but is also disappointed by the poor script. One to avoid.
