Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: Mainly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /> <br /> Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin <Revision: <br /> To review this movie and get a good knowledge, I have to start at the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn left in 79, Lucius Fulci decided to do an indirect sequel and call him Zombie 2. This movie is the only one we know as Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! Okay so, after the movie (called Zombie 2 in Italy) left and made a lot of money, the Italians decided, damn it. Let's do some more zombie movies! These things are sweeping the mass! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused yet? The story about this is really just a repeat of stories we've seen in many American zombie movies we've seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Let's see ... the government is experimenting with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister is released to the general population and shebang! We have a lot of zombies yearning for human flesh. A group of people starts to run away from the zombies and ends up in an abandoned old hotel. They have to fight the zombies to survive. <br /> <br /> There were many problems during the filming of this film. First, Lucius Fulci, Italy's beloved blood godfather, was ill. So he could not really finish this movie the way he wanted it. The film was given to two smaller directors, Bruno Mattei (Inferno dos Mortos Vivos) and Claudio Fragasso (Zumbi 4). They did their best to spice up a movie that was not so good. You see that Fulci himself did not really have his heart and soul in this movie. He was disenchanted with it. He gave the film to the producers and basically said, "Whatever the hell you want with this!" And God loves them, they did. <br /> <br /> And that's why the ladies and gentlemen have such a bad zombie movie with the great Fulci credited as their "director." The main problem in my opinion is that it is just such a useless hole! There is no substance in all this! After the first few minutes that some terrorists steal toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the movie is just a bunch of soulless characters with no zombie-like personality. Now, in some cases, this can be fun, if # 1 the zombie gets dressed up and the zombie action is really good and fun, and # 2 there's a lot of guts and guts involved. <br /> <br /> Here we have neither! Well, there are some inspired moments there, like when some eagles are infected by gas and start attacking people. It was cool. There is also a scene involving a flying zombie head (which, by the way, defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the abandoned hotel pool and chewing on a poor girl's legs. But beyond that ... the rest of the movie just fits. <br /> <br /> Infinity in endless scenes that do not jack to move the already non-existent plot. That was my main complaint with this movie. The sets seem unfinished and the art direction is practically nonexistent. I hate it when everything seems so unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this really was even below that! It's closer to a z-level movie if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Does the zombie make peace? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the movie was filmed in the Philippines), so you have a lot of Asian zombies. But that's not a big problem since the movie was filmed on the Philippine Islands. It's the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died in the same clothes for some reason. And what goes through zombies here is a lot of black makeup (more like blemishes) on their faces. One or two zombies had a slightly more complex makeup, but it was not good enough to impress yet. It's just a bunch of goo inutilly splashed on the faces of the actors. So it's not only this slowly paced movie, but the zombies look like crap. These must be dead people! Anyhows, for those who expect the usual coolness in a Fulci movie do not come waiting around here because this is mostly someone else's movie. And those two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) did not really put heart and soul into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD, you'll see that when Fragaso is asked about his memories and his feelings in this movie, he does not even take it seriously. You may say that he is ashamed of this and on many occasions he says that "he only had one job to do and they did it". And that my friends, is the last nail in this movie. There is no love, and there is no heart to make this movie. So you have a half zombie half a dumb and lousy movie. <br /> <br /> Just to complete or people who want to have or watch all the zombie movies ever made. Everyone else does not even bother!
