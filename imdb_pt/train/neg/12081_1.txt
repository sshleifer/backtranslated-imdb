note to George Litman, and others: The riff of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 is "I do not think so, * breeder *". <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is "Why were you looking at your 'like'?", simply by the complete absurdity. that, and "Right, no!" Above all, I would say that we must give credit to the crew of the MST3K for trying to ridicule this TV movie. you really can not have much fun with the dialogue; Bill S was a good playwright. on the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would reject it. a high school theater club could do better. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that you buy a book and read 'Hamlet'.
