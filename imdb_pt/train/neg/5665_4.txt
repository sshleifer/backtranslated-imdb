This intentionally bizarre adaptation of Borges' tale is typical of Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, undone by the atrocious performance of half the cast. The film is definitely in the surreal tradition of the Mexican period of Bunuel and sometimes looks like the version of a poor man in Lars Von Trier's Elements of Crime. Cox's apparent preference for unique takes, jumps, and ambient sound recording works against the effectiveness of the film. It's worth looking at, but ultimately disappointing.
