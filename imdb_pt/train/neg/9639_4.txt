Occasionally, a new entry of foreign films is served. That is your great attraction. They take out of life and serve raw. American films seldom dare to touch the forbidden affairs of society. Many delays and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty Dollar determines your selections. Something that invites European directors. In addition, audiences around the world remain hungry for "different" movies, especially those that offer a tasty bite of mankind's miserable and suffering body. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences crave for beauty, poetry and the primitive taste of life. That's what the movie "Left of the Father" offers to curious audiences. A family trapped in the belief that the unity of the family derives from the unity of its obedience to tradition. However, when the patriarch of a family forgets its members are human beings of flesh and blood, full of rampant dreams, rampant and dark passions, then the two are moved in movements against themselves. Selton Mello plays Andr√©, a son who seeks to control his inner passions with his father's stagnant philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana, a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family's waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the older brother. The film offers a lot, but it takes an extremely awful time to say it. ***
