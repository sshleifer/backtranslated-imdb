Yes, in 35 years of filming, I finally saw the stench that surpasses all the other hideous movies I've seen. Beating 'Good Will Hunting' Baise Moi 'and' Flirt 'in complete horror. This is a pretentious blige of the first order ... not even going into pretentious sewage. The effects are cheap, and worse - nonsense. <br /> <br /> The script seems to have been written by a first-year film student who does not go out much, but wants to look full of foreboding! The acting is simply indescribably bad - Tilda Swinton closes a career full of empty wood with a performance that moves neurotically between natural and laughable "intensity". Apparently some idiot over there allowed the director of that movie to make another ... be warned
