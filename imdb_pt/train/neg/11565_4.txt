So far, after week two of "The Lone of Beauty", I'm a bit disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances are good, as long as it's just drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how people can feel that this FACTIONAL DRAMA is a "factual" coverage of the Thatcher years - it's okay as a drama, but I feel that the award-winning book is still much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with "Things can only get better" ending with 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! with that promise of a government that is full of sleaze.
