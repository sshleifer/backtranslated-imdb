Too bad, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director could not put it together. There's a lot of action, lots of promise, but it all goes out of style. The director did not do his job. Promising action is weak. So much seems invented in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV credits as 1996) is simply not worth the time to watch it. Another director would have done a better job.
