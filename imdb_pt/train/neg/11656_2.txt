Scary movie 2 was a big disappointment. Simply referencing films, such as Mission Impossible 2, does not lead to comedy. The film opens well enough with a rap scene of funny white people and a great use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The film falls from there unfortunately. The acting is horrible. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The film seems cut together and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longer jokes in this movie, involving joints and a Tom Cruise movie, were not funny to anyone in my theater. The film, fortunately, reaches the 83rd minute in a shockingly bland ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even try to end with humor) I do not know what else to say except that it's a hasty, sloppy sequel made to make the Miramax a little more money on the backs of dumb teens. Overall a very poorly made movie.
