I have to confess that I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can not compete with the 1995 version. The reason I watched was that I was not totally happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain. Wentworth, and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the captain than I had imagined when I read the book. And so was he. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this is the only redeeming quality of the film. The rest is as austere as possible. Miss Elliot would NEVER run the streets of Bath that way. It was not in his character and it was not made by a lady of those times. Anne Elliot's book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms, but this was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 important quotations from the book, they are at totally inadequate times, warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book. they will be absent or completely altered. <br /> <br /> And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it seems that everything is rushed. Very little care was taken to introduce the characters, show their dispositions and motives. Important scenes have been omitted. How could they have massacred the final scenes in this way? A disaster ! And from far away he was not as well photographed as the other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, then do not waste your time on this.
