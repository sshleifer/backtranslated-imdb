well, the writing was very sloppy, the direction was sloppy, and the editing got worse (at least I hope it was the edition). the performance was not bad, but it was not good either. virtually none of the characters were sympathetic. at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential. It was a great idea, but another good idea wasted. It could have finished 3 different places, but continued to go to a generally predictable Hollywood final. and what was not predictable was so bad that it did not matter. the end was not worth watching at all. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. the film seemed rushed as well. the movie was simply not worth seeing, and if I had paid for it I would have been very angry. maybe I was more disappointed because I expected a very good movie and had a bad movie. the movie was not horribly bad, but I would not recommend it. I gave it 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea a lot and I did as a character (justin I believe, super smart). and also had some very cheap ways of covering the holes in the plot. It was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap tape, it was not pretty. Anyway, if you see, wait for the theater or $ 1.50 video, unless you like all the movies you see, then I think you'll like this movie.
