Recently, I watched the first Guinea Pig movie, The Devil's Experiment, and I must admit that I'm disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie is invariably included in any list of the most "nasty" movies and maybe I was expecting more because of the hype. The truth is, I do not appreciate it. If I were watching believing that the opening text was true ("I found this tape ..."), I might have been a little disturbed, thinking it was real. Even without the benefit of knowing that it is not real, I think I would have discovered that it really was not. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, the girl's reactions to what is being done to her are simply not what they should be. She should be screaming like a banshee in pain. The fact that it is not meant obviously is not real. I would not want to see if it was real, but if she were more convincing in her acting, the movie would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then there are the notorious scenes: nothing has affected me. in everything up to the scalpel in hand. The hot oil, the larvae, and the guts simply did not bother me. I am not saying that I am "hard"; But I could not suspend my disbelief, partly because of the girl's inaction. The scalpel made me shudder a little, but the hammer in my hand only made the hand look rubbery. And the final scene with the eye was again a little shaken, but nothing more. I did not want to look away and did not even feel nauseous. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the movie is in its twenties, or maybe I'm just tired. The truth is that I did not find this movie disturbing. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of thing you'd expect to see in a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise to undress characters. , history etc. and just leaving the torture, it works on some levels. Like a disturbing movie, it did not work for me at least. I watched guinea pig with my wife, who is from the movie "It's just a movie" and she wondered what the fuss was about. We begin to discuss why I watch these films and my reasons are many, but include the desire to be affected by a movie. She said she did not think any movie could be so convincing as to upset her and challenged me to do just that. I played for her the scene of Irreversible fire extinguisher and she was in fact disturbed. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I have a point, other than that we were both more disturbed by a scene in a non-horror. film genre than any movie so far that it purports to upset.
