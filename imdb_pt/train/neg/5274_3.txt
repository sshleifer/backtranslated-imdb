If you like movies about scary cities, hotels, homes, states (ala the Eagles "Hotel California"), etc. which have people who are "just passing through," read virtually any Stephen King novel. If you like the "Disappearance" scenario, start by reading King's "Desperation", but also check "The Shining", "Salem's Lot" and "Needful Things". <br /> <br /> The crow's motive, the desert, the family driving in despair to flee or avoid possession is tired. Why did not they make the movie "Despair"? Maybe they approached King and he refused? Must be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin seem happy to meet each other, and both have used it well over the years, but they are still TV and direct-caliber DVD actors.
