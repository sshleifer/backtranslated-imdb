This sounded like a really interesting synopsis movie. Nazis, occult, government conspiracies. I was expecting a low-budget Nazi version of DaVinci's code or the boys from Brazil or even shockwaves. Instead, you get something quite different, more psychological, something more like David Lynch. That was really a plus. But the way the story is told is just awful. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the cast. The character of Andrienne Barbeau begins the movement being a bit shy and scared. She just does not do it well, even at her age, though she certainly has tried. The actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was an overdone film, or at least it acted like that, rather than being simply eccentric. The only thing I found to be very good was the daughter, Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Another great part is the rhythm. It starts very slowly. Then, slowly, you may be tempted to turn it off. But then it gets attractive for a time when you get to the daughter's suicide and the consequences. But soon after, everything becomes a messy mess. Part of it was purposely, but much of it was just unnecessarily confusing, monotonous, and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem, is that it simply is not a nice movie to watch. It's slow, bland, none of the characters are nice. Excessive use of images and sets. Some movies you see characters are tortured. In this, it is the viewer who does. It has some scary moments, most notably scary Nazi paintings and credits, but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiring.
