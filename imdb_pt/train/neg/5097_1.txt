Unlike most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. <br /> <br /> It starts to look interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes up until the last episode. In the end, I still did not understand what the alien attacks were (maybe I missed something, who knows?), And realized that I had watched 26 episodes consisting mostly of self-hatred of the characters, selfishness and self-pity. In fact, it alternates between alien / robot fights and those dark and depressing scenes in which one or more characters can only say or shout "I hate you" 10 to 12 times in a row. /> <br /> I can not really see Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (Nor can I see any of the other characters learning or growing as well). I wanted to kick them and tell them to have a bloody life during the first few episodes, and the feeling has not changed during the latter. Shinji really has the kind of desperate helplessness that makes people angry rather than charitable, and Asuka is so disconcerting that I wanted to smash the TV screen every time she showed up. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything, and they say that many times. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of anime and manga, and never before have I hated one so much. I read that the series creator / writer wrote this while suffering from depression, and I can believe it; it made me depressed to watch. Is this the goal of this series? I'm honestly asking. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and angry? And if you suffer from depression, why not just write a book or a biography about it instead of mixing it with aliens and wicks? This plot of alien war, as far as I know, leads to absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> Finally, since I'm really fascinated by how many people claim to love this dead-end quilt, I can not help but wonder how many of them really feel good, and how many say they do it because they said is.
