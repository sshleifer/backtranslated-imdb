First off - there is absolutely no flirting going on in this movie - with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Your first test of resistance is to go through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. That would not be so bad - hell, I like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but without a context to put it, is repellent. Then you go through torture and chaos. Then we find Donna and the movie turns into something different - not better - just different: a photo of the heartless road. There are useless attempts at comedy thanks to group appearances - widely written and widely interpreted by bands like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and some prostitutes and drag queens as well). They all deserve better. The photograph is purposely misleading, so if you have a motion sickness (or any kind of disease) - this movie is not for you. Come to think of it, I'm not sure who this movie is - except gay and bisexual S & M fans who like badly written, badly filmed indie movies about themselves.
