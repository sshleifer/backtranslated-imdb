At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the popcorn as high as possible to stifle the inferior dialogue. This is not absolutely a girl's movie. Any guy that you like, is one that we ladies can be sure to stay away from. Stupid story, mediocre dialogue and a cheap-looking movie. I've seen many, many movies, but this is the new winner in the bad category. If you happen to see, the only thing you'll expect is the ending. So you can finally get out of the theater as fast as you can.
