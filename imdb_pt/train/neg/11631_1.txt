Today, I wrote this review with anger from Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood produced films based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. This has changed our perception of safety. This has changed our understanding of the evil of man and of mankind. The most important and devastating, this has changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I can not emphasize how much I am repelled, disillusioned, and angry at the careless and glaring ignorance of Hollywood in search of lucrative profits. of death and destruction. This film and those who are are doomed to cause controversy amidst word-of-mouth between viewers and critics; most certainly to be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood sank into a new downtown. Even lower than the lower bastards who perpetrated the most barbarous acts of savagery and ruthless cruelty. Behind all this is Uwe Boll. I'm really mad about this movie. How dare they disrespect the memories of the families of the lost? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those prisoners in the towers condemned on that fateful day of infamy?!?! How dare you try to satirize and at the same time seize a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and tired post-911 world?!?!?! How dare they? <br /> <br /> For those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally terrible farce, I say this with a heavy heart with all my might: Remember. Think again that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sensible and moral person. Think again that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a shame and dishonor for the lives lost that day. Think back to that day of the clamor of the families of loved ones. Think back to that day of the lives lost in these two plans. Think about the new carnage you caused after the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think. Remember. Respect the memories of the lives lost in 911 by not seeing this movie at all.
