Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - dead drunk) and leaves like Myra (Raquel Welch). She then decides to destroy masculine masculinity (or something similar) and goes on teaching film history in an acting college run by lascivious John Huston (do not ask) and separates a happy young couple (young, handsome, handsome Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett - yes Farrah Fawcett). <br /> <br /> They picked up a great Gore Vidal novel that was not applicable and of course tried to film it. They also hired an English guy with a decidedly anti-American attitude and hired a group of actors with questionable "talent" (Welch, Reed) and old embarrassed pros (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), all played together and .... SURPRISE !!! An absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The film received an X rating on its release (it was downgraded to an R), mainly because of a really tasteless scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in which Welch tries have sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The film is very scattered ... scenes jump around and people say and do things that do not make sense. It's not good, but I was never bored. Acting varies wildly ... Reed is horrible ... very sad. Huston chews the scene again and again and again to a nauseating extreme. Welch is not really bad like Myra, but his lines do not make sense, so you never know what to do with it. West is hardly in the movie (a blessing) and it's really kind of sickening to hear a woman in her late 80s making sex jokes. Roger Herren (what happened to ...) was very young, handsome and not bad like Rusty. Fawcett's fine. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find things to say about it ... you just watch in disbelief. A must see movie - believe it !!!!
