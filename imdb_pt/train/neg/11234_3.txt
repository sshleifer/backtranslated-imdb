This movie is bad for stealing on Friday the 13th. The movie is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around a campground training camp. He kills people because the camp's training camp is on land that was owned by his father, and when police came to force their father's land they accidentally killed his mother (another F13th took off). The intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victims. Then we are introduced to a family that is going to camp in the same forest, soon after they arrive they join an old stranger who likes to talk about his son. Later we learned that his son is Bernie and that he locked him in the backseat of his caravan after having it broken from a mental institute. He sets Bernie down after the family so they can pick up their stuff and then chase after. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended only for those who like Slashers of the B 80's class.
