If you made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book, do not give up on the series. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May this year, and I'm almost finished with book 10. I dare say that the film is a piece of crap that does not make the show or smell of justice. While "Left Behind: The Movie" just vaguely follows the story of "Left Behind" (the book), the characters are nowhere near accurate. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford never acts his feelings for Hattie (he is about to be informed about the disappearance); Buck Williams is a writer of blonde hair magazines, not a TV reporter; Chloe is in Stanford, and many of the details of Rayford's book wonder if she "survived"; Buck and Chloe are not meeting until much later, at a meeting in New York, organized by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never "in the book", but only in Rayford's flashback thoughts; the roads are so full of debris after the rapture that Rayford and Hattie have to go back to the suburbs ... etc, etc, etc ... And this is only the first film; they are about to release the third. Please, even if you do not like the movies, give the book series a try.
