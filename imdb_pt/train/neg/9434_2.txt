Banned as a 'Video Nasty' in the UK, Unhinged has naturally gained a lot of notoriety. However, the most shocking thing I found about the movie was its amateurishness in every department. The bloodshed I could bear: terrible acting, poor quality editing, terrible direction, lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to pick up. <br /> <br /> Three girls on their way to a music festival hit a ravine during a storm. They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The lady of the house, an old lady and her maiden daughter, welcome the girls, allowing them to stay for a few days to recover. However, someone does not want the girls to leave! One by one, they are victims of an invisible burglar. Taking a long time to go and presenting some of the worst performances ever in a horror movie (and this takes some doing), Unhinged is a truly horrible movie. The music is a total mess (it looks like a three-year-old has been released on a synthesizer) and as such complements the film perfectly. Just some bloody scenes to the end and a bit of free nudity except Unhinged, to get the lowest score possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a terror expert (and, alas, I am), you will want to see this to mark the Video Nasty checklist. But be warned, it's very, very bad.
