Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully filmed film, there is no doubt about it. And the acting is generally excellent, at least in terms of how she portrays the characters as they are scripted. <br /> <br /> However, so many small and big details are just _wrong_ that bothers me too much to be able to fully enjoy. A small detail that typifies the type of lack of sensitivity is a scene (this does not spoil anything), where Mameha plays a bell that is hanging on the door of the house where Sayuri lives, on a snowy winter day. The bell she's playing is a fuurin, or wind tingle - that just hangs outside the houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes had no doorbells - they just opened the door and announced. (You may think this is a trivial detail, but I would say that to a movie about America where a Christmas wreath hangs at the door in July and no one thinks of any of this.) And do not even get me started on the hairstyles altogether wrong given to maiko and geisha, which is vaguely pan-asian / chinese / kung-fu-ish, and nothing like real thing. I think that this rather arrogant attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really appears in the attitudes and portraits of people and situations as well. <br /> <br /> So, I suppose the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of geisha and maiko in Kyoto (which is what "Miyako" is), so I suppose the more you will like of this. I honestly think this movie could have been so much better ... as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan".
