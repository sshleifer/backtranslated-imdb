When I took this movie from my work, along with three other similar films .. I then watched with very low expectations. Now this movie is not bad by itself. You get what you pay for. It's a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. It's definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it's not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In short, this is the kind of movie you would see very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take some time or you would see on a Sunday afternoon at a local television station that is trying to take some time . Despite the bad performances, clich√©s and sub-cameras. I did not have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend it never appeared on my DVD player. The story has been made many times in many movies. This is no different, no better, no worse. <br /> <br /> Just your normal movie.
