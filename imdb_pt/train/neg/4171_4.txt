I spent this title 15 or 20 times while I was at Blockbuster, looking for something decent to watch. All I can say is that they were all half the decent movies the night I chose to rent it. <br /> <br /> I'll give credit for better leaps and ravines than "Dracula 3000", but in reality this is pretty easy to say, since this one did not have Caper Van Dien on it. The other things that were lacking in swords were: an interesting cast, an interesting story, a good dialogue and originality, but I suppose you can not have it all. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The sloppy crew of vampire hunters (one of whom was a vampire ... goes figure) flew from colony of mining to colony of mining trying to wipe out all the vampires he could find. The crew is made up of: the arrogant captain (who dies early), his first-ever, inexperienced vampire hunter, the aforementioned vampire hunter (not a typo), an aspiring cowboy, and a really REALLY butch Asian command, tough guy "female ... almost sounds like the cast of" The Real World "from MTV. After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a multitude of leeches (and, as it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of the human anatomy), his first companion assumes ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates .. blah, blah, blah ... I could go on, but like I said it's the same plot used in about a hundred other 'movies' of the genre. <br /> <br /> The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is beyond me. The vampire hunter vampire (still not a typo) was very hot, but of course if you are waiting for her to expose more than just your cleavage, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can not say it was the worst movie I've ever seen, since I rented 'Starship Troopers 2', but hopefully this movie will show up on the Sci-Fi Channel.
