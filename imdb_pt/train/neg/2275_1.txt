A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a live breathing mask as a clue. Due to the dubious advantage of an English soundtrack, we endured, as usual, the soulless performance of Tom Cruise, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but generally we are given some character below him to keep our interest. Her empty postures deny any erotic energy that might have been between her character and Cruz or Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is an exercise in acting that involves the use of masks to free the actor to enrich their presentation of verbal and bodily character. language means. Cruise's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor. See the original Amenabar Open Your Eyes 1997!
