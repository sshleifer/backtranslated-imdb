I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors and the director, although Robert Altman is a success or a failure. In this case, it was a great lack. Altman's attempt to create suspense fell on his keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like "Dead Again," I do not think he could contribute to such a turkey, and hopefully that will not ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen on the path of most of the Oscar winners. In a downward spiral that includes acting in movies about money to eat like this. Duvall was once a great actor in great films, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercies", but "The Great Santini". This movie was really a big waste of time. I give 2 out of 10.
