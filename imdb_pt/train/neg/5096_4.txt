Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) serves as messenger for troubled UBC TV (which is the United Broadcasting Corporation); he is not going anywhere at work, offering ridiculous designs like "The Abraham Lincoln Doctor's Dog" for studio executives - because Lincoln, physicians and dogs are popular. Programming director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Russell's proposals but has no idea how to choose a successful TV show. His secretary Heather North (as Jennifer Scott), who plays the duo as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimp who does not like Russell when he wants to watch TV. It turns out that the monkey watches all the popular shows and can easily choose the hits. Russell discovers the talent of the chimpanzee and uses it to advance in his career. It's understandable that things get hairy for Russell and the cast! <br /> <br /> Raffles, the chimpanzee (treated by Frank Lamping), performs well; Raffles seems bored and / or distracted during some scenes, when the chimpanzee should seem interested; these could have been corrected with re-takes or editing. A slight satirical advantage is present - imagine a monkey choosing TV shows! And, it's a monkey that gets a beer during the commercials (drinking in a Disney movie)! A look through the cast will reveal several entertaining TV actors to recognize and try to put on. You could make a drinking game, in honor of Raffles beer drinker, guessing the actors and where you've seen them before. Here's a start - Hey, is not this "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Down the hatch! <br /> <br /> The Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
