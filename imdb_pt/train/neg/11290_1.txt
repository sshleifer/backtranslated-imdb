By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I heard that the movie originally should have been titled "The Treasure" but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" in order to take advantage of the emotion created by "Jaws". I think the sharks were in a scene from that movie; the fact that they were included in this "thriller" should sell tickets. Did not work. Whenever something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew to each other with a certain brand of beer that has just been introduced at the time the movie was made. Wow, do you think beer could have been a sponsor? Could they have made this more obvious? The only time someone should break the beer is if they go through it. That is enough for the celebration.
