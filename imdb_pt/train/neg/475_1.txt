One of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching. I saw this movie in my American History class and the purpose was to see an incitement in the life of a farmer in the West during the late 1800s. What we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered, human birth, branding. Oh, and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself was not so bad, but the countless fluids that came out took most of the people in my class to the bathroom. The story itself was OK. The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move west to be a guardian of this cowboy's home. They live a life of hardship and it is a pretty accurate view of life in the West in the late nineteenth century. But if you have a choice, do not watch this movie.
