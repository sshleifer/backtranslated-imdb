First of all, let me say that this is not the movie for people who want to watch something lively and joyful for the holidays. This movie is cold, brutal and simply depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a moody mother who is depressed at Christmas because her husband has lost his job, is losing his house, can not buy Christmas presents for the children, etc. You have the idea, good things for the holidays. Then comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon, the Christmas angel, who in his dark hat and especially long leaves more like a pedophile who hangs around children every day watching them. What better way to inculcate the Christmas spirit in Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again? Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a refuge for Nazi refugees in the mud. The film puts everything so thick that you do not mind the happy ending because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. I'm sure this movie wanted to be something like Capra, but it left out the joy and the feeling about what a holiday movie should be.
