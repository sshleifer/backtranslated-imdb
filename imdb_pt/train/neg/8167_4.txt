The Forest is not just your daily standard of cannibal slasher / backwoods, it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well. The story is about two couples entering the forest at a campground. A cave, cannibal loggers and the ghosts of his deceased wife and two children soon terrify them. There is something you do not see all slasher. Director Don Jones gets an "A" effort, although the film itself falls on all levels, acting is simply average, except for Jeanette Kelly, who plays the woodcutter's dead wife (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent). /> <br /> The film opens with some beautiful photos of a couple walking through a valley and a forest. They realize too late that someone is chasing them. Both are shipped at a typical slasher fare. Our killer uses a faithful hunting knife throughout the film except during a flashback when he implements a hacksaw, fork, and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife's lover. <br /> <br /> The Forest has a good story, but the movie just does not work along with it I found it very annoying with the acting just bad. 4/10
