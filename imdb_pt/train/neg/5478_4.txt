With nothing better to do, I decided to take a look at the "Aztec Rex" (as it was being advertised) to hell. The silly story could have been better if the effects of the dinosaur were convincing. They really looked like animatics (those rough designs that later artists use to finish the CGI effects, adding more details, smoother moves, etc.). Absolutely horrible dinosaurs, which is the only reason you would probably want to go through it The only redeeming factor was the lovely Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl. She kept my interest; if only the budget had been raised and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. At least the cast and crew made a free trip to Hawaii where the movie was filmed.
