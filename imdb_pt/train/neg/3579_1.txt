Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago, a friend and I decided that he defined absolute zero in the scale of the movie. There was nothing about the movie that could have been made worse than it was. To this day we still rate movies, even the very bad ones, by how much better than "The Lonely Lady" they are. <br /> <br /> Long ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the scripts. among other things, "Last Summer" and "Diary of a Mad Housewife," and she said she was asked to write a screenplay for Harold Robbins' book "The Lonely Lady." She said she sent a treatment and was rejected because she did not think she understood the difficulties of a Hollywood screenwriter. She then said, "I think they got someone to write it." The interview was filmed before the movie was released. She died in 1981, and I bet the first thing she did upon her arrival in heaven was to personally thank God for saving her from involvement in the outcome.
