Since I hate reading long rehearsals hoping to find a point and being disappointed, I will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible. Absolutely terrible. And no, surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I might agree with him, since he gave the film the rating it deserved, but was painfully reprimanded by reading what he said. I am very ashamed to be taking the same side of someone who commented that the film "definitely lacks beautiful women". Let me be the first to say, "Wow, that was definitely a serious and in-depth review there.My mind can barely comprehend the philosophical reflections on this movie." Seriously, the lack of "pretty women" should not be considered essential for a movie. If you are desperate enough for "beautiful women" you should really watch other types of movies, not necessarily falling into the category of science fiction.
