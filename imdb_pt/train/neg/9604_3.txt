The first thing I noticed in this movie is the unnecessary amount of nudity. It is not lush nudity or anything, but so much that was not necessary. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing that her families tell ghost stories that her ancestor who resembles her was a werewolf, and believes that her destiny is destined to be the same. Which I actually found very interesting. The original werewolf man was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal released the real werewolf man you should never see for an extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone who is not really an interesting werewolf. Unfortunately this is not the movie I was looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we know she's not a werewolf from the start, so there's no emotion or twist, they also try to make the movie look like this really happened scenario. They fail there also by adding one or two parts of the film referring to it being a reality. At first I was excited to read the description of the movie. But gradually I realized that it was a disguise so they could expose the main characters' breasts as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel is a decent actor who plays a great psychotic role, or a very bad actor playing a role as psychotic. Since the Danniele character has no brain and is just a madman running around insane and snarling and breaking like a wolf, it takes little skill to play. She has moments when her performance is interrupted for a frightening moment, but is quickly ruined by the weak camera work and light. The idea is great but terribly run throughout the movie. 3/10
