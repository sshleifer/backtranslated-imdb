Let me first say that I love stories from the Western and Civil War. I also consider John Ford an excellent director. I also have the same high feelings for the acting ability of John Wayne and William Holden. <br /> <br /> I do not remember if I saw this movie when it was first released in 1959. Last night was the first time I've seen it since According to my rating 4, it can be said that I do not I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to try to tell you some of your shortcomings. John Lee Mahin, who wrote the script for Harold Sinclair's novel, was a very talented writer and wrote many excellent screenplays. This script is poorly written and poorly researched. They mention the awful conditions at Andersonville Prison. At the time of the film, Andersonville was not in operation. They also use rifles that were not used at the time. <br /> <br /> John Ford has been directing films for more than 40 years and has won four Oscars. He must have been sick during the making of the present. His usual style was missing. It might have been a movie in the south and east and not in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He usually had a company of players he wore throughout most of his movie, and most of them were missing this time. This time, only minor cowboy stars, Hoot Gibson and Ken Curtiss, have roles and, of course, Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other known faces except the 3 stars. (see below) Stock company Mr. Fords made most of his films the classics they were; Unfortunately it was missing here. <br /> <br /> Now we get to the main stars John Wayne and William Holden. The duke must have been sick as well, he seemed out of place here. This type of paper usually fits perfectly into your style, it was just suitable here. Wiliam Holden did his best, but nowhere was as good as he used to be. There had to be an actress in this kind of movie. Here in her first major role (second film) is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person, but not really an actress, she is still having roles on television. Let me be kind and say that she has had a long career, more based on her appearance than on her talent. Also in the caas, Ms. Towers' servant is Tennis Star Althea Gibson. I'm glad she's joined the sneakers. <br /> <br /> The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films. some military-type songs, supposedly made by the cavalry in march, are not good at all. The action scenes were good, but they reach the end of the movie. Ratings (1/4) Rating (1)
