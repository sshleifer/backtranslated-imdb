And that's the only reason I own this DVD. Now I did not see the first Nemesis movie, but I checked his and I's information here by saying: What? Because? Because in the first movie, Alex was a man. But again, the first one was set in the future, so maybe this Alex is new and the scientist has just done Alex this time. Who knows, at least it was not covered in the movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Here's a brief summary of the plot: Alex, still a baby then (or how you want, as it was, is, in the future) escapes with his mother using a special time ship and ends up in Africa of the 80's. There mother is dead and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe. Then the tribe is killed by a cyborg of the future and Alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg. Come on then. It looks familiar, does not it? Terminator is not the only movie being ripped here, Predator also wins its fair share and I think Vincent Price's first Fly movie gets special nomination to give a base solid to build your cyborg head. <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Okay, the movie was pretty small, but it had bad special effects for a mid-'90s movie. It would be good for an 80's movie as usual. The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is barely interested. Nemesis 2 is not the most horrible piece of cinema I've ever had (?) Watch, but it comes quite close. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about acting, because let's be honest here: did anyone expect Oscar-worthy performances here? Ah well ... at least I found Sue Price so hot in this Amazon warrior style. <br /> <br /> A "real" movie rating: 2/10 There are not many professionals about the overall quality. And despite the very basic plot, the movie makes very little sense. <br /> <br /> An evaluation of the camping movie: 4/10 I had occasional laughter from the sheer evil of the movie, so it has little merit in it.
