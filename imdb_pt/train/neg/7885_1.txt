I believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the cinema. When I want a sermon, I go to church, but I do not want one from a movie. I do not care about some supernatural themes, (after all, religion is as supernatural as you can get!), But this movie had a lot of preaching in it that I was really irritated. The landlady reminded me of witches who seen in other films. The bad guy looked like he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a foolish ending: the hero entered the meeting and yelled at all those old men, and that broke the spell. If life were that simple. I think when movies are so stupid, they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! PREACHING HERE!
