This horror movie is really weak ... that is, if this is the correct movie I'm commenting on. Nothing really terrible happens when a family adopts a beautiful German Shepard puppy. I had a German Shepard and it is a very good dog. I did not get the idea to get one from this movie, but from the comedy "K-9". That's another story all together though. This movie does not really have much horror, since the most horrifying scene is at the end and it seems really tacky. Also, we see a guy almost putting his hand on a lawn mower. That's about it. The father suspects something though, as his family seems to be getting rather strange, somewhere he finds out if you hold a mirror to them while they are asleep, you can see if they are possessed. All in all a horror movie really weak even by the television standards ... TV movies that work out there like "This House Possessed" is very good and there is another haunted house movie about a woman and these strange creatures that It is also quite good. This one is really quite boring.
