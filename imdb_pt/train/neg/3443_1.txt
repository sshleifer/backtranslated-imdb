I watched this movie last night and expected the best after watching all the cool trailers. Even the DVD cover looked good. As soon as I started watching it I was thinking like the others "oh my God what is this". moments that were a bit scary, but then the mood was ruined by stupid music. There was rock and opera during what are supposed to be thriller scenes. That even ruined this for me and I was shaking my head thinking I drug lost money again on a rental and was fooled by the cover art. Nothing against the music itself was just in the wrong parts of the movie. Anyone edited the movie has no idea of what they are doing. The cover showed lightning, which implies that they were caught in a storm at sea. That would have been more interesting, but it did not. The acting was not the worst I have ever seen, considering they are all unknown and this is obvious from their first movie. Another reason I was disappointed was the plot did not make sense. At first 2 men saw all the teenagers get into a boat, so at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed and the others were her imaginary friends or they were ghosts, I'm not sure why it was very poorly portrayed. WhyteFox who wrote a comment here states that this is a true story. He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area in which this movie was filmed. There was no mention in this movie about being a true story. I've never experienced anything like that in person, but I'm not saying it's impossible. I think if anyone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like amateur student horror movies you may like this.
