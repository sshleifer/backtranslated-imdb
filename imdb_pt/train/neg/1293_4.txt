I'm probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this movie. Thought visually stunning as all of Ang Lee's work (each frame seems worthy of an impression), I was very disappointed with the film's unrelated rhythm. It really was too long. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the Missouri Civil War era, and it's about a young man (Roedel) who joins the ferocious forces of the Bushwackers, a kind of renegade sympathizers of the Confederacy who lead geurilla kind of fight with Jayhawkers, his Union counterparts. He and his closest friend, Jack Bull Chiles, played by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after Chile's father is shot at close range and his house burned, presumably by Jayhawkers . The story follows the adventures of Roedel and Chiles and their interactions with other war victims, including the former Bushwhacker slave (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright) and a war widow played by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point, it turned into some other subframe and left things underdeveloped. For example, the agitation between the group of Roedel caused by the ex-slave Holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding property and protocol, and later discarded until later in the film. A young villain / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much anguish and violence against him, but we never know why. Some of the characters never seem to appear; I think it's because the movie involves many of them as well as taking in large amounts of history. <br /> <br /> The historical detail was excellent. I loved looking at the accommodation, furniture, clothes, etc., and found that the main actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, although they stumbled a bit in the dialogue. Unless you really like the story or you're a big Ang Lee fan, take a look at that.
