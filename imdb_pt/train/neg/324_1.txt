Worst mistake of my life. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie at Target for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey, it's Sandler that I can get some cheap laughs." I was wrong, completely wrong. In the middle of the movie, all three of my friends were asleep and I was still suffering. Worst plot, worst screenplay, worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to hit my head against a wall for an hour, so I'd stop, and you know why? Because it felt so good. After tapping my head, I stuck that damn film in the microwave and watched it burn ... and that sounded better than anything else I've ever done. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness and Kill Bill just to get over this crap. I HATE YOU SANDLER TO REALLY PASS THAT AND RUIN A FULL DAY OF MY LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
