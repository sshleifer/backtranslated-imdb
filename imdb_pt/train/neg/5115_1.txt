This had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm 64 and I'm a football fan. I was expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes, I began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie (particularly acting) could have gone into a theater. About halfway through, I whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained the facts behind the movie. Although I was a bit offended (and I could see how some might get VERY offended if they were not Christians) when they were nailed to a movie theater, it was not a big deal. It was, however, very important to be subjected to such predictability and unreal behavior and, above all, the quality of the performance. It is a movie suitable for a church walk, but to be screened in a church auditorium and not in a theater. I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I watch a movie? No. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not!!!
