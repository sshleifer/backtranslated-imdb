When this was released, I thought this was one of the most profane films of all time. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and some other filmmakers like him, there have been worse mainline films in terms of language than this ... but this is a brutal attack to the ears. Hey, I can take that a lot, but this was ridiculous. In the first six minutes, I heard a half-dozen use of the Lord's name in vain, in addition to a countless number of words. I wonder how many people left the theater watching it in 1990? I could not have been the only one. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that some of the actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this movie, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the pious "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and Generals." Lang's role here is exactly the opposite: perhaps the worst person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite at the end of the film. These are just a few of the adjectives used - even some liberal critics - to describe this story, which is painted even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the best known critics, all extreme Libs, praised the film. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as were almost all the paying public. It is unbelievable that anyone can praise filth and rubbish like this. <br /> <br /> Trust me: there are no good and friendly characters throughout this movie. This is an evil and sick film: one of the worst of the "modern era". That is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, teenage prostitutes, non-stop - two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and simply bad people. No thank you.
