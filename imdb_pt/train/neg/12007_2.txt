It's amazing to see how Nikhil Advani manages to lure people into the theater until launch day. I mean ..... look at the cast here, the promotion is superb, good enough songs and the trailers are fine. This makes it a full house on the first day but it is only when people will see the movie that they realize that there is no way their money can be repaid. Full house on the first day, the movie comes out the following week. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by 'Love Actually' is what they say, could not cope well with the whole cast. They tried to put in big stars but ended up not being able to bring even an average performance by either. The stories are empty and cheesy so the audience can not connect with any of them. It is a big disappointment for all those who like big stars or for that matter Nikhil Advani after their great success of 'Kal Ho Na Ho'.
