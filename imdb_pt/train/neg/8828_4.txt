Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) goes out with his local fishing friends from Jindabyne, Australia, for a weekend of rest, recreation and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers that the body of an Aboriginal woman is floating face down in the river, things seem to have run for the worse. The biggest fall of the weekend is the common sense of men. They do not leave the ravine and end the weekend fishing with great catch. Then they go out and report the body. <br /> <br /> The city and the life of men quickly become a mess. The local media fills them and accusations of aboriginal prejudice are drawn from local natives. Stewart's wife, Claire (Laura Linney, EMILY ROSE'S EXORCISM) feels the deeper meanings than her husband and her friends did, but she has to fight it through her own mental illness. <br /> <br /> Amid all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle, smeared on a morgue slab. His murder and subsequent eviction in the water symbolize what lay beneath the city of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and marginalized. <br /> <br /> The only other people who seem to understand part of what is happening are two small children: the son of Stewart and Claire, who is being led by a half-blooded Australian whose mother was also killed a few years earlier. The girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to leave her mother in the best way possible, and the discovery of a new body seems? strangely enough? a method to accomplish this (again, the underlying current of Jindabyne is presumed). <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne town feel what lies beneath its surface, but none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around (the symbolism here is seen when it is said that a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming contains the old town of Jindabyne underneath its surface). None, that is, until Claire forces them. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting if it's a bit too complicated. There are many story lines that need to be explored and this is not done; lots of loose wires. The acting was good, but the filming was terrible. Unstable cameras, grainy or dark outlets, and only widespread negligence have hampered overall production. <br /> <br /> I like symbolic movies, being NORTHFORK one of my all-time favorites in this regard. But Jindabyne needed to bounce her head over the murky water so she could see her own problems, which simply did not happen.
