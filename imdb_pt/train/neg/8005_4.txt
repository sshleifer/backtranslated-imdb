Gwoemul (The Host) - Due to pollution in the Han River, a mutant beast goes into fury. The newest member of the Park family is snatched by the beast, and it is up to the rest of his family to find it, before it becomes the beast's last meal. <br /> <br /> First, I love movies of monsters: mutated bears, huge alligators, Komodo dragons packs, the whole lot. Creature features are my favorite type of horror movie. So, I really wanted to like The Host, but it was not meant to be. <br /> <br /> There were three major problems with it: <br /> <br /> The first can be seen with a quick look at the IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Many cursed genres. It took itself too seriously to be a comedy, yet it was too light-hearted to have a real message (though it seemed to be trying to make some kind of statement: Anti-pollution, anti-Americanism, or anti-government). The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mix with all other styles. <br /> <br /> Second, after the monster's initial attack, nothing happens during most of the movie. The central family wanders looking for one of their own, while the governments of Korea and America apparently do nothing. And that's it, they just wander, occasionally hitting each other, presumably for some comic relief. This lack of action has caused my attention to wander and apparently did the same to the director, while the plot plots are not resolved (a mysterious plague invented by evil Americans is completely forgotten and never solved). And finally, the film is awkwardly political. He paints Americans as being stupid and bad, but gives us no American character in more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American vs. Wise Korean moment. With a Korean morgue assistant asking his chief, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the Han River. The American coroner almost gives a maniacal laugh as he orders the assistant to continue. Besides being racist, it's a lazy movie and there's no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the monster is good, sort of a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the motion effects are pretty cool, and the monster's initial chase through the park is a lot of fun. There are also some cool pictures in the movie. Some of them remind me, strangely, of the way Firefly was filmed (cameras shuddering, out of focus, etc.). There is also a cool scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he saved are sitting in the family home. mobile food stall. It is night and snow is falling, the street lamp is giving a cool light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was very disappointed with this movie. I was looking forward to a decent creature movie and instead got a pseudo-politics, horror comedy. Looking at the comments in IMDb, I can not help thinking that if this had been a US production, it would have been foreseen. Just because it's a foreign movie does not mean it's good. There have been some great films outside of Korea in recent years (The Trilogy of Revenge and the Brotherhood, for example), but that's certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> For the first time I am in favor of a remake. Tighten the direction, improve the script and this may have been a great movie. As it is, it's not worth a few hours of anyone's time.
