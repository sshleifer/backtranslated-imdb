Absolute garbage, fight scenes worse than a 20-year-old Van Damme movie or an American ninja, etc. <br /> <br /> Truly hideous acting, no skill in sight throughout the film is like a cast of Wooden sculptures. Watch how this movie is really bad, it may have been acceptable in the '80s, but this is a 2006 film, I do not have much love for this movie since it was not born in the movies. The 80s. <br /> <br /> If you like real fighting movies, take a look at Tony Jaa in Ong Bak and the Protector, these are appropriate martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> give a laugh and see this today you can see the unintended mood of how dark it is.
