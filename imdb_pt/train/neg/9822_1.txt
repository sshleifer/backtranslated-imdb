There were moments during the movie that I wish I had been beaten to death. The only reason I supported the whole movie was because I could not believe how bad it really was and thought it should get better. This was really a horror movie. I was horrified that I missed what seemed like 4 hours of my life that I will never return. The other two hours I spent mourning the loss. Please recommend this movie to anyone you want to torture and tell them the suspense will kill them.
