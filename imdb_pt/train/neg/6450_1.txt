Well, this movie is incredibly horrible. I felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. That were sometimes delivered with slight sarcasm, which led me to believe that they were not taking this movie seriously, nor could anyone watching this nasty and insane slasher. While watching this "Unknown Creature," I could not help thinking that there was not much budget or a competent writer in the crew. But if you are watching this for a laugh, you will be happy, the film is shameless of mocking yourself because I can not see how anyone could look at this and be proud to bomb straight to DVD clich√© wants to be thriller of Action / horror movie fightfest to light.
