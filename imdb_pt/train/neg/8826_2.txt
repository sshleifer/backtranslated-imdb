This (extremely) low budget movie is compared to the great classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" as it is labeled as a Flick Slasher. First, let me say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than that (that was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half the movie). "Christmas Evil" attempts to become psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes crazy (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is angry with people who do not understand the true meaning of Christmas and at work he does not support how fabricated toys are made with so much lack of quality and love. Dressed like Santa Claus, he finally goes on a kill. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the actual need for special effects. No tension, no emotions, no blood, no cast. By one exception, Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing Tom Hanks as one of the guards of the classic "The Green Mile." He must still be kicking himself these days to take the role. He really is the only one who can really act, his supporting role is better than the main one. (which is also not that bad, but if you're overshadowed by a small supporting character, you're not great either). And this strange ending? You need to see it to believe it. "Christmas Evil" is absolutely annoying, nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading. This is not a slasher. You want to see a true Christmas slasher, check out all the greater time: "Silent Night, Mortal Night".
