How wonderful. Yet another movie about America by someone who has visited here probably half a dozen times, one day at a time, and believes himself to be an "expert" in the country. Sheesh I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and make a film about Germany as the "land of the Nazis" or something. Wim IL boy, you should meet with Lars von Trier and make the ULTIMATE movie about Americans. Of course we all know that it takes a pretentious left side "we are the European" world to make a "real" movie about America. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. For a continent that has started not just one but two world wars, Europe certainly has many opinions about the wrong US "foreign policy." <br /> <br /> Q. Do not worry, Wim IL boy, there are many UC-Berkeley Americans who will love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who think George W. Bush is worse than Hitler, and that a painting of a can of soup is "sheer genius" !!
