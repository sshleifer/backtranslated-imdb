A lost train. A wrong phone number. An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision? Most people do not think about what they have absorbed in their own thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" tells the story of interrelationships and the cause and effect of the worldly as it pertains to a group of normal Parisian people. It has all the components of what goes through the contemporary theater, with all the cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned. <br /> <br /> There is a traitorous husband, an illegal immigrant, a sloppy classic, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou serves as the previous protagonist (in the sense that she is on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the movie) and normal girl who just can not find the right pace in her life. <br /> <She learns at the beginning of the day with a stranger on a train what her horoscope has for her. What happens to her throughout the day is told through various characters. Does the forecast come true? The concept is good, but the narrative is fragile. Connections from one event to the next are weak. There is a better 15-second narrative of the Liberty Mutual insurance commercial, where one person sees a good deed and moves it to another than two-hour Happenstance. <br /> <br /> If you like Audrey Tautou, then you certainly can sacrifice time for this movie, but you will end up dissatisfied and wondering what could be the same plot if you were treated by a better producer and director.
