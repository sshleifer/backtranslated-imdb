I just finished a marathon in this series, and it became agonizing to see how it progressed. From the fiction of the historical elements, to O'Herlihy's terrible accent in later episodes, the spectacle simply sinks as it advances. If you are looking for a generalized production of low quality WW2 fluff, then I could recommend the first season, but avoid anything after that degenerates into being a step in a novel, with worse and worse stories and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> The old black and white film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the name Colditz attached to it, and even this is not what one might expect.
