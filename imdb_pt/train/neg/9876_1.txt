I went to know nothing about this movie and left in half an hour knowing all about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm usually a good person, but if someone told me they liked this movie, I'd probably never talk to them again. Anyone who likes this is more likely to have an extremely dry and hermit personality. I'll also include that they think they are very smart as well as the self-centered fart bags that make the voices for the movie. I know everyone has different kinds of humor, some people may not even like mine, but that's okay; I do not think this covers any range of humor though. This movie is as flat and monotonous as Wes Anderson's mind. Come in and get ready to leave; You better get your money back too.
