Like all cult TV shows, there are a bunch of people who love The Twilight Zone so much that they rate practically every episode as if it were the greatest shows of all time. While several of them are indeed marvelous classics, the truth is that for every great episode, there were several who were mediocre and at least one who stank. However, as stubborn Trekkies, these Zone lovers insist that they are all gold. In fact, this was what initially led me to review some individual episodes of a series of cults instead of the movies I normally watch. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the worst episode of all time, nor is it between episodes. much worse, is poor by any reasonable standard.
