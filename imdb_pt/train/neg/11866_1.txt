First in this movie, according to the slick said he won "best film" at the "Worldfest" film festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. <br /> <br /> I would not call it the worst movie ever, but it sure sucks, it's as terrible as the other Aussie B, "Body Melt," but at least that movie did not seem to have been shot in an OI video. <br /> <br /> My guess is the filmmakers, I watched a lot of Troma movies and bad movies, thinking that they too could break for the deal by releasing this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love really low quality movies, just the fact that some of the characters used fake American accents, almost as if that could give them more chance to sell it in the states or something like. Really disappointing ending too, the showdown could have been a lot more exciting, and some good fight scenes. You can completely see that the filmmakers are trying to copy "Bad Taste" with the whole, the car explosion, the rocket launcher and an infinite amount of people being shot, but the end has no superior humor, or style as "bad "I like". <br /> <br /> If you enjoy watching really bad movies, or are interested in making movies without a budget, watch it, otherwise stay away.
