Basically, a team of husband and wife dentist and their three daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the performance is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot. The husband's dentist leaves his wife behind the scenes of an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then comes back to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the film deals with his anguish about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear of confronting his wife so he does not have to "do something about it" . "I'm not going to tell you the ending, but let me just say that the movie is not going anywhere and the ending is like a deafening moan." The character's motives are missing: why is she cheating on him? good-looking, good father. "The movie does not say," Who is she doing it with? "Do not expect any answers about it either. Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief) are completely wasted by this blistering absurdity that does not know whether it wants to be American Beauty or a family film. Avoid this.
