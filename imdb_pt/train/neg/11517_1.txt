I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been rude about it (to say the least) ... but it was terrible. Really terrible. Mal acted, a senseless script, cack handed direction ... Watching this movie was like watching a car accident, you want to look away, but you keep looking. >> <br /> because you want to see how it's going to get messy. Well, the car is shipwrecked and there are no survivors. On the plus side, the cinematography was good, it made me want to go on vacation, even if only to cleanse myself of that badness.
