This movie has several major flaws. The first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! This unfortunately makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the observer certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she was wasting precious time from his short life. This means that the film can not captivate your audience, instead it encourages the audience to increase disdain for the film and all that is associated with it! In short, it really is very very very very very very very very bad! Do yourself a favor and chew a big rubber shoe, you'll find it much more interesting and enjoyable than watching the Terminator Woman.
