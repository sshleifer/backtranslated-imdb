Would anyone really watch this movie if it did not contain children running naked? From a cinematic point of view, it's probably one of the worst movies I've encountered absolutely terrible. Some pervert woke up one day and thought about making a movie with little girls and calling it art, putting them on the field and there is no need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they did not appear to live anywhere or have parents because p * nn movies do not need anything like it. I'd like to comment on the rest of the film, but I did not score spoilers, so I'll just say avoid, avoid avoiding and find an appropriate movie to watch
