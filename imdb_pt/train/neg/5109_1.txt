"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is more of a "feel-good", so-called "heart warming," and out-of-market ratings show ABC had time to ride. <br /> <br /> understand the problems that these families go through. That's why I'm so sorry. But do not you think that putting four wide-screen plasma televisions, three flat-panel desktops, a pool occupying half a yard, and cabinets full of expensive designer clothes is an excessive BIT for any family? Of course, these families have gone through a lot. Of course, they deserve better things than before. <br /> <br /> But honestly, the things that Ty Pennington and his staff put into these homes are enough to suit an entire neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really pisses me off about this show is how Ty and his team always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family, or the condition of the family. Telling a person in a wheelchair that he is "so strong" or "very brave" really gets old after a while. That may sound rude, but believe me; watch this show, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> All in all, this show is overrated. If you want to watch, go ahead. This comment is just a warning to what you would be watching.
