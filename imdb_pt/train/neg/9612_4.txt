By the end, thugs have the advantage - always -, which puts in question the competence of the good guys. A couple of innocent conspirators accused of crime are irritating. Some unnecessary dialogue in which several dull legal issues are debated. This is just an old, mediocre western, so what's this nonsense about trying to keep things "realistic"? Cagney's atypical presence in a western is one of the few - if not the only - fun things about the movie. Somewhere in the middle is a ridiculously timed marriage proposal; like, "Where's the kid hiding ?! Where is he ?! ... Oh, and by the way, are you going to marry me?"
