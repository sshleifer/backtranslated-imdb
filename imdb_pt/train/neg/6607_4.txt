It's not as bad as some are doing, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original, as they clearly were not going to the same effect. In addition to some mediocre action scenes, the rest of the film is flawed. Character development was poor and story development was pointless, with many loopholes and missing information I would not know if I had not read the back of the DVD. The worst part of the film was the supporting roles of Nisha Kothari and especially this new guy named Prashant Raj. Nisha is simply annoying from the moment her lips open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where the hell is he and why the hell was he in the movie studio for anything other than serving drinks? His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, delivery of dialogue and firm expression in every scene, be it action, comedy or even a scene where someone just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least her expressions changed, which is more than I can tell from her companion mistake. overall, it is worth to see Aag, of the RGV, by the solid performance of Amitabh, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
