This is a really stupid movie in the typical 80's genre: action comedy. Conceptually it resembles Rush Hour, but it lacks action, laughter, and chemistry among the main characters in that movie. Let me know that I like Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just can not act. He is horrible when he tries to act hard - he can barely keep that trademark smile on his face as he says his short sentences that by the way are not very funny. And seeing him run (even then) is not a pleasant sight. Also, I have the feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - does not give a politically correct impression of the Japanese. Do not even tell me about the story. I give 2 out of 10.
