I bought this video in Walmart's $ 1 box. I think I paid too much !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long series of films of 3rd category for small studios (in this case, Monogram - those who made most of the Bowry Boys films). While the misery of most of these films does not approach the level of horror their latest films have achieved (Ed Wood's "classics" like Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space), they are bad movies and should be avoided by everyone. but the toughest fans. <br /> <br /> I'm an old movie addict, so I tried it. Also, some of these smaller movies were actually very good - just not this one. <br /> <br /> Lugosi is, what's more, a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum. he invents of young brides. They never really explained why they had to be brides or why they should be women or even what illness their wife had - so you can see that the plot was never really discussed. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a really annoying reporter (a Lois Lane type without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all those apparent murders where the bodies have been STEALED! Then she follows a few leads to Lugosi's door. Lugosi's house is complete with his crazed wife, a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's children (a hunchbacked sexual demon and a dwarf). Of course, this courageous reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film - apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! Eventually, maniacs die all - mostly because of their own hands and all is well. In conclusion, the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to get married. And, of course, the reporter's dumb cameraman faints when that happens. If you have not noticed, there is a lot of fainting in this movie. Or, maybe because it was such a slow and heavy movie, they ended up falling asleep!
