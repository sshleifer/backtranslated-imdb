Being trained in Cinema, I would like to think that I have seen several films, some good and some bad, but I would say that 'Summer rain' is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! I chose the film in the hope that it would be a great British classic like 'Secrets and Lies' or 'Lockstock', but oh, no, that was so bad that my apartment mates and I ended up laughing and shrinking with ridiculous acting and (I remembered a bad school production of 'theater in education'). The main characters Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the beginning. 'Michelle' the main character who lives with his two friends has the kind of guy who would never tire of slapping and Gary was so wet (he kept crying every 5 minutes) that at the end of the movie I did not really did not give a damn about any of them. All I could think of was "I paid Â£ 3 for this pile." I never wrote a comment before, but after watching this movie, it encouraged me to warn people about this disastrous production. So, please, avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.
