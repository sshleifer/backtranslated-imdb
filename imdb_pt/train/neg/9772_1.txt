Only many incidents of violence. <br /> <br /> The film goes from one scene to another, and in almost all violence erupts. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not the one who's shocked by violence. and for me a movie without a fight has something missing. But please, not one after another. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "Here we go again." There is some resemblance of a story between scenes of violence, but two-thirds of the film I had completely turned off, and could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the best that filmmakers can do, they must find something else to do with their miserable lives, such as making shoes or delivering mail.
