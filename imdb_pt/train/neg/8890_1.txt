For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe what these people did for a perfectly good piece. <br /> <br /> "Let's start with the good bit, shall we?" - Alan Rickman is fine, although some of his dialogues may have been broadcast with more excitement. The rest of the actors needed to get everything together. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why are not you still dead, Romeo? The actor, though not only completely wooden and impassive, could not read his lines with all the enthusiasm. He was completely out of focus, had difficulty looking at Juliet in the face, and absolutely embarrassed with the lines he was given. Whoever the cast deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost acceptable, but she does not give depth to the character and seems to be completely out of tune with the play. Mercutio was incredibly scary and completely out of character throughout his dialogue. Benvolio was insensitive and ruthlessly agitated with his lines. <br /> <br /> I was forced to endure this production of Romeo and Juliet. The performance was blistering and the costumes were nothing short of a distraction. I have seen kindergarten puppets with more effort placed on them. I just wish I could give this movie a rating of zero.
