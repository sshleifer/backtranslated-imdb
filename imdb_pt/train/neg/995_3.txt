Rosario Dawson stars as a girl who is raped and then begins to fall into darkness until she has a chance to take revenge. While it's clear why Dawson took the role, it's a chance to show off her acting skills and make a small independent film, decidedly non-Hollywood, it's also clear that in addition to dazzling good looks, Dawson seems out of place on paper . Forgive me, I just could not find it. This is not a mistake, it's how I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes, I know she's on the screen, but although I've spent most of the two hours looking at her, she left no impression on me, which is always the case. I blame the script so, as long as it's not the end, not a lot of things that happened on the screen seemed to make any real sense. People seemed to have more posture than real and what happens does not seem to fit. Forgive me for being vague, but nothing in this movie, besides the ending (which I would love to talk about, but I can not spoil it), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me What can I say, this may click with you, maybe not, for me it's time I did not get back. Only for fans of Rosario Dawson, although be warned that there are several real reasons why this is NC17. (E Rosario - please, you're a better actress, choose better scripts)
