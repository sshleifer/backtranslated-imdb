I was looking forward to seeing Amanda Peet in another good role after recently renting "The Whole Nine Yards" - easily worth the rent, by the way - but that was not it. I remembered that the trailer for "Whipped" was a little funny and that the plot about three newcomers in New York, twenty-one years old, all in love and manipulated by the charming Ms. Peet, was worth it. feather. So I convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me. This review is my penance. <br /> <br /> In the first act, we have the three prisoners of lead, counting their achievements in a restaurant. What should have been funny, or at least counted, is quite pathetic. Was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we should get out of this? <br /> <br /> [And while I do not care about movies that are blissfully vulgar, I kept wondering why no one in the restaurant turned when the prisoners spoke out loud about sexual and eschatological details. Do they do this every week in the same restaurant? You'd think someone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: two other guests notice a scene. But that's just a setup for a joke. Everyone else in the restaurant are deaf. <br /> <br /> The second act has the three stallions all in love with Mia and then develop a brain rot, not asking each other what is really going on between the four. . And I kept asking myself, how do stallions continue to act like they were, what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stay with them for more than one date? Does it start with brain rot? I kept waiting for Eric's character, the married friend, to become something more than just the boring punching bag in this act. Your role is to clearly dispense advice on being married. But why do they bother to talk to him when they do not talk to each other? What about his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third act solves the plot that exists, but by this time I was looking at my watch. My friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and I had to agree. The scene that explained everything was adequate and managed to explain all the questions and mysterious dialogues throughout the film, but we were just checking them out in a list. ("Oh, okay, that's why Brad had to happen and Jonathan says that and ...") What a laugh we made of the stupidity of the plot than anything funny. Even the outtakes during the credits were not very funny. Ultimately, I was left with nothing but the urge to warn people away from this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
