This completely bland, meaningless, mindless, stupid movie is not the ultimate proof that the world can forget Danny Boyle and his films "Trainspotting": "The Beach" has taken care of it. What this low-budget quirkiness does is to merely secure its place among those who have started off very well, but have completely lost themselves in drugs, drunkenness, ego, self-delusion, maladministration, or whatever has led to the death of the director. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some Jenna G - a rapper, probably) meet by chance and spontaneously begin to sing with fervor more like lunatic asylum seekers than a potential hit-making. duo - that they become. A friend of theirs - an even greater illiterate loser - becomes his manager breaking a shop window and stealing a video camera by which he films them in "action," and then shows the tape to some music people who really show an interest in it rubbish . Now, I know the UK in recent years has put incredible rubbish, but this is ridiculous; the song makes Oasis look like The Beatles. During the studio recordings, the duo - Strumpet - changes the lyrics on every outlets and Ecclestone says quite arrogantly to the guys in the music industry to pick it up or leave it, and very absurdly they accept it. Not only is music total and absolute, but its "artists" are antisocial; these newcomers should be giving orders. It's so dumb. It's just awful. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is bland and does not get anywhere, and this story of rags for bitches is meaningless and makes no sense. It often seems improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of crap is so bad that it's embarrassing to watch. I Q. Ecclestone also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this absurdity. Whoever financed this one-thousand-pound joke must leave the movie business before selling their own panties at the corners of the streets.
