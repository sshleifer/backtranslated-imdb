This is the first time I see a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be the last one. I could not understand why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face at the camera, or to say, "I'm going to take a shower." <br /> <br /> Plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses it. In between, the staff spoiled everything. The final scenes are totally unbelievable. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars behind a guy but do not do your homework to solve a trivial puzzle? <br /> <br /> There is not much acting, there is not much plot or plot, and the shooting is done in MTV style. Do not waste your money on this. <br /> <br />
