* Spoiler warning * First of all, I rated this film 2 out of 10. The idea is good, but there are many stupid mistakes in the film, unable to turn the psychological drama that could have been. First of all, she never fights alone. After a very strange initial doubt of his mother (which is not credible when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the film), the rape victim is not alone. <br /> <br /> She is also incredibly naive, always falling into the strange traps of the crew. <br /> <br /> Her friends are unbelievably unpleasant. <br /> <br /> What I find most unbelievable is that Ethan can not control the team when he changes his mind. Ethan is very much the Crew leader (hey, they even say that) and people seem to think the other guy is an idiot, but when Ethan changes his mind he just can not convince even a single person in the Team. that he is right and that his ex-friend is wrong. Everyone simply hates him ... because ?? The movie has no explanation. How did he become the leader? <br /> <br /> One funny note is that my girlfriend thought I was watching Beverly Hills when she came. Two actors from the same hit TV series ... an inexpensive way to get viewers?
