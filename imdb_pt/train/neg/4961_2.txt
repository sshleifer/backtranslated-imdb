And that's all it is. This thing is slow. Actors have ability, they simply do not seem motivated to make the effort. The plot is not so great and is hampered by the slowness above all this. The accents, when they exist, are British. Many of these guys are supposed to be Danes. OK, OK, the accents are not that important. But language is. I do not think they used words like "yes" and "okay" in Beowulf's day. And that supposedly cool weapon your king gave you? Has he reloaded this thing yet? Has he seen this? Or was Beowulf so bad? Well, his goal was to at least match the computer graphics used in the generation of monsters. Those were pretty out too. Bad special effects. Bright spot? Only one I can think of. Marina Sirtis has remained well over the years.
