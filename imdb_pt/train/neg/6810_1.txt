To be honest, I did not really like the "Executive Decision" - which was obvious the model - a lot, but compared to that crap, it looks like a work of art. <br /> <br /> Not only that. people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult to all other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who builds the stage did not even see an aircraft from afar. It's so ridiculous that in a 747 only three people are on board, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The movie is full of illogical (for example: use sleeping gas, so do not use it, then use it anyway), which finally dropped my rating to the bottom. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun by rearranging the sock drawer or by drilling a hole in your knee and filling it with milk.
