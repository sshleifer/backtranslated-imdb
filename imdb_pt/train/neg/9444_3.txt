There's just one thing I'm going to say about the cat in the hat ... like a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie sucks ... I lost count of how many terrible jokes in the movie that did not just suck but were not t exactly proper kid. Oh, and the way the cat in the hat spoke was annoying ... as for the plot I completely forgot. Who cares about this sucks. I do not know why Mike Myers joined, but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin without the talking and this was very successful - but then what was boring. I do not see it, it belongs to background 100 .............................. the jokes are so ungainly it's funny
