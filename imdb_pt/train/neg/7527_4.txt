There are so many stupid moments in 'Tower of Death' / 'Game of Death 2' that you really wonder if it's a parody. Sometimes it felt like I was watching a continuation of Kung Pow instead of a Bruce Lee movie. To be honest, this movie is all about 'Game of Death'. If anything, it's more of a sequel / remake of 'Enter the Dragon', incorporating many elements of this film - particularly the actual footage. The character of Bruce Lee Billy Lo (apparently) investigates the sudden death of his friend and finds a piece of film that was with the man's daughter. When the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and it is up to his restless brother to avenge the deaths of both men. <br /> <br /> Tong Long stars as brother Bobby Lo and does not really have the kind of charisma to bring the movie. Your fighting skills are very good however. Bruce Lee obviously appears thanks to (no more) deleted images simply to make money from the legacy. Saying that, overall, the footage is actually edited - better than in Game of Death, but that does not stop the movie from being a mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so the fights are actually a lot of fun (I dare say hallucinating) and make the movie at least watchable. But there are so many foolish elements in this film that it really tests your patience. First off, there is the supposed villain who lives on his palatial property ... or is this mental institution? Seriously, the madman eats raw deer meat, drinks deer blood, carries a monkey on his shoulder and has some peacocks and lions (?!). This attempt to make him look tough and smart just makes you feel bad for him - you kind of expect someone to accompany you back to your room. <br /> <br /> Actually, this part of the middle is horrible and when the scene involves a naked prostitute and a lion's clothing arrived, I turned it off. However, I finished the movie and was happy because the fight scene at the end (much like 'God') was all the reason to watch. Although the story is an embarrassment, the action is very good and contains excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> But even the final disappoints if the premise were anything to go by. What we were told was that the "Tower of Death" was a pagoda that was upside down and underground. That sounded great, like a twist on the original Bruce Lee idea, with different fighting styles on each level. Could this be the 'Game of Death' that was originally planned? Not! The movie should have been called the "Generator Room of Death" because that's what happens with the tower. In fact, there were in fact one or two "different" styles ... there were grunts clad in foil, leopard skin henchman and idiot monk. It's as if Enter the Dragon had never been made, with the plot being a terrible imitation. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching once for the fast fight scenes, but sometimes it's so stupid that it hurts. If this was planned, then fine. Thumbs up, however, to recreate the scene from the projector room of "Enter the Dragon."
