This is a really bad movie. The plot is sentimental mush. I suppose the production values ​​are OK, decent photography, discreet steering and everything. Mark Hamill was terrible. I never cared much about him, and this movie validates that perception. No wonder he has never had any kind of career other than his "Star Wars" movies. I'll just say "Buh-bye, Mark" as he dives into well-deserved obscurity. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts stole the show altogether. She showed charm, beauty and acting in all presentations. I remember seeing her in "Texasville" recently and taking note of her beauty. It's interesting to see her ten years earlier. Anyway, unless you're interested in Miss Potts, run away from this movie screaming through the hills.
