This movie was awful, just put. It was so bad that I registered with IMDb to warn him of his dangers. <br /> <br /> I am an expert in extravagant horror movies by itself. I watched "Redneck Zombies," "Psychotic Women's House," "Slumber Party Massacre II," and many others. I know my schlock. And I know this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Three-quarters of the film is made up of frightened individuals running from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not running, they are spouting non-sequential lines, devoid of emotion or motivation. When the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls to pieces. There were so many shocking low-angle scenes; I noticed that Leif Jonker had a 3-foot-tall tripod. He used what I call "Leif Maneuver" several million times: that is, moving away from an object of interest as an amateur. Apparently, the film crew could not wake up early enough to film a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset ... and played back. With such lazy direction, you're really impressed with the bloody final scene. The only thing you can imagine is that the last five minutes were filmed before the first eighty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) bloody movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the fundamental movie. "Dead alive." If you are a schlock fan, and are looking for a challenge, give the "Darkness" a try. <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie - <br /> <br /> Vampire: It's time to die!
