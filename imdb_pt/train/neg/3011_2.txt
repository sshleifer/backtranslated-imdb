I was very excited to see this film, anticipating a visual foray into the relationship between artistic beauty and nature, containing the wisdom types of "Rivers and Tides". However, that's not what I got. Instead, I get an uninspired movie about how human industry is bad for nature. This is clearly an unorthodox statement. The photographer seems to be in conflict over the aesthetic qualities of his images and his supposed "ethical" duty to the workers who occasionally populate the images along the periphery. And frankly, the pictures were not usually so impressive. And according to this "artist", the scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> In every respect, a stupid movie. For people who would like to feel better about their environmental awareness ... but not for anyone who would like to think about the intricacies of the issues surrounding it.
