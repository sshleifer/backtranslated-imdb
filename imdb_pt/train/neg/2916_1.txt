This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot and the message are horrible. There are many mistakes in this movie that it is impossible to keep up with. I do not even understand how this movie can get any indication, let alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee portrays an angry / irrational detective that was caused by his father's disappointment. Pros: He's angry, all right. Cons: When it comes to the explaining scene, he can not convey the sadness / disappointment he has in his father. The weeping scene was too fake and it looks like he's literally tearing the tears out of the corner of his eye. <br /> <br /> 2) To connect the movie to the title, there were barking or dog sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene, which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand it's supposed to be a metaphor or what not ... but it's so dumb! 3) WHY DID THE PAU NOT BE SHOT IN THE KILLER? What the hell is wrong with this movie. When the killer started stabbing an officer, shoot him. He's already dead! What the devil? There were many opportunities that the killer could be killed, but I do not know why he was not! 4) During the scene where the girl had her foot aching. In the scene, it was very clear that the girls' left foot was bruised, so how the hell in the next scene is she putting all her weight on her left foot? And this is the actress indicated as the best new interpreter? WTF 5) The sounds in the movie are out of sync. <br /> <br /> 6) I'm guessing this movie is trying to bring awareness of brutality and violence among children in Southeast Asia, so why does the bad guy win and then the cop was joining the fight? 7) This movie is very violent without a purpose. Cops are hitting IC for a pulp, and then if they cooperate, they give marijuana and cocaine? This is the worst movie overall. I really feel like the person who wrote this movie is a sadistic and sick person. I've never seen a filthier movie in my entire life. WORST FILM EVER!
