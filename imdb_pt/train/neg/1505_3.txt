A stupid and idiotic story, a stupid story filled with cliches and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty scenarios, many fights and dead people on a massive scale. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German translated version, this German DVD release is called "Adios Companeros" and has Male Callaghan fighting Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because his gang killed his (he's the only survivor). So you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they fought and the gang split. And you have Ironhead battling everyone because he's just the biggest and greedy idiot anyway. Yes, that's it, there's no more intelligence in the plot, hehe. <br /> <br /> A small role of Klaus Kinski as Reverend Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tries to separate two men fighting, hitting them and yelling "I said love!" and in another scene he wins a competition in playing horseshoes and goes crazy for a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It is also notable that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi did the cinematography - I love this master of incompetent-thrash exploration, so it was an "aahhh" for me.
