To know how terrible The Shield is, you would have to write pages and pages, suffice to say that it is a monument to bad direction. <br /> <br /> "When Directors Go Awry" should have been the title of this production. In fact, directors should infuse their work with a sense of visual style and tell stories that propel the story forward. <br /> <br /> How is the camera constantly swaying and touching with a zoom lens a "style"? How is this driving the story? Of course there is also the absurdity "editing by random numbers". Apparently, just cut randomly. <br /> <br /> I think it's a lot of work to do a good editing. <br /> <br /> Well, it did a lot of work for most people to watch Shield that languished as one of the most exaggerated and unknown spectacles of all time.
