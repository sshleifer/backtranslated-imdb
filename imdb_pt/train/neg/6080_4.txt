"Maladolescenza" has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its children protagonists, forest and the discovery of the ruins of a castle. Yet at its core, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of teenagers. Opening with a dream sequence employing Fabrizio's not-so-subtle metaphor struggling with his menacing dog, the film details his psychological pursuit of Laura, the girl who promised him love and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The psychological complexities of the film give the merit of the film, but there is no doubt how unnecessarily explorer the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex. The look of the film depends more on its beautiful locations than on a particular cinematic skill, and there is no doubt that the film's greatest asset is the scary and augmented soundtrack to the children's choir. With its strange dreamlike quality, the film is at best interesting, but pales next to Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' of the same era. Certainly worthy of the art versus pornography debate, for, unlike many forbidden films, Pasolini's "Salo," or Larry Clark's "Ken Park," for example, the film is hardly noticeable from an artistic standpoint. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so maybe 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release. However, the shock value is the only reason why the film is memorable. <br /> <br /> The movie has its advocates. However, so does Nazism.
