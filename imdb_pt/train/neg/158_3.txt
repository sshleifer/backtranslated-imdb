Spoiler warning follows. Excellent recreation of the base in Antarctica, where the true events of the film happened. Beyond that, libelous! Scandalous! Filmed in Canada; presumably by a largely Canadian cast and crew. I got the last half of this movie recently on Global Television here in Canada. Nothing much to say other than how completely shocked I was at what is a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that the Canadian-born director Roger Spottiswoode was coerced into making the USAF the heroes of the movie, when in fact the real saviors, where a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
