A terrible movie like everyone said. What made me laugh was the appearance of Scott McNealy, giving a prize to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that pretty much defines itself by its hatred of Microsoft. They have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So they were foolish enough to think that this bad movie would add fuel to the fire? <br /> <br /> There is no public record I see of SUN involvement, but clearly the producers of this film know Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery.
