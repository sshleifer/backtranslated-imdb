SPOILERS LEVES (but that does not matter anyway). <br /> <br /> A gobblygook exercise of catastrophic proportions, not even worthy of the lines of 10, I need to put those observations on the netwaves. This is the worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first to qualify for the now defunct Mystery Science Theater treatment. Even though it took me half an hour to realize the ironic angle I wanted, it was still a very bad mess. Its only value lies in the perspective that forces us to realize that, in addition to ugly and gore masks, the genre succeeds only when the classical cinematographic notions of photography and illumination, dialogue and acting, editing and time are put to use. Here they are absent and John Carpenter is no master. Period. And no banal analysis of the easy social commentary here will change that. Strangely, Carpenter was never anything but a director of B, but at least films like 'Fog' and 'The Thing' had a fantastic atmosphere (the latter is one of my cult favorites). <br /> <br /> Abominable acting. Camera angles stuck in cement. Pace without tension. However, perhaps the most unpleasant element of the episode is the plot that obviously JC can not really be guilty of (unless the writers were Cody's friends). The initial two minutes of a girl running through a forest just to be near you. Run over by a duo would be Scully-Mulder is the first and last thing that works in the movie. But come on, a girl running through a deserted forest to nowhere in particular, desperately in need of an abortion by chance with the bumper of a pair of women's "women's rights" doctors, whose clinic is at the end of the road. corner. Oh, and I will not even know how doc takes the accident into the car and accelerates from 0 to 60 in six seconds. It works wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion. <br /> <br /> So things fall apart quickly. The empty dialogue "I just want to help you," slowness endlessly back and forth at the gate, grandiose battle tactics like hacking the phone line (in the era of cell phones?) Followed by the shooting: a born again director of clinic Ramboesque vs. Ron Perlman and high school kicked off the Easter break. Another lovely phrase: "So, what are we going to do?" of the boy who had just sat on a pile of rifles in the back of the van. No, it is not pheasant season yet. So, who needs these teenage boys? How about the good old, tried and true method of the lunatic solitaire who makes his way through the gate with his American SUV? <br /> <br /> As for the exchange of bullet scenes, the cuts here were so hard. like the staccato of a comic strip DC. All that was missing was the Wham, Bam and Whiz of the balloon titles. And all to the sound of a soundtrack worthy of an old episode of Mannix. <br /> <br /> At one point we learned that Daddy is not really Daddy, but at that point we were not made to care much. anyone else. The only source of drama in this story is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter, who is only grateful for not having twins. However, there is not a single scene, flashback or not, where they are found together. They remain mere abstractions from each other. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the doorman, each of the characters is absolutely unpleasant. Bland, hysterical, bland, macho. As perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be. None of the doctors seems to have anything medical about them. And there's that father who plays with his pregnant daughter as if he were his stressed-out boyfriend himself. He happily got his. There are two great comedic moments worthy of the MST: the spurt when Angelica's plumbing comes out and then the newborn lobster with a glue on the baby's head. Angelica's rugby belly was also cute before finally blowing up the little monster from hell. As for that audacious male abortion scene ... well, they should have retained the Miike episode and banished this one instead. <br /> <br /> In short, a baby from Rosemary's 3rd. Series meets Alien on the lawn of an M.A.S.H. episode. This stinker alone, sensitive only to today's permissive under-16 generation, will ensure, as someone has said here, that this series will not be renewed for a third season. It's a real pity, as there have been a number of brilliant productions, including really decent spoofs like Dante's Homecoming or McKee's delightfully quirky Sick Girl. Not to mention the superb images of Malone's "Fairhaired Child." <br /> <br /> Sorry John Carpenter, I believe your driving days are over. It's time to run for president.
