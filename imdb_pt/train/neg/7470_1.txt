In SÃ£o Paulo, middle-class adolescents Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel have just joined the university and, on the eve of their opening class, go to a drug and alcohol party. The next day, after classes, the date of Cristiano the night before comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl. The girl dies, panics and decides to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, frightened by Gabriel and rolls the stairs, breaking her neck. The trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage dump, but throughout the night other tragedies happen. <br /> <br /> The controversial and shameful "Cat Bed" is a pretentious crap about the alienation of youth, and it is certainly the worst Brazilian movie I have seen over many years. The shallow, tragic and shadowy story is actually a comedy of dark humor in bad taste. The script is not funny, with stupid lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative and silly footage with interviews with stupid teenagers at the beginning and end. The acting is terrible, apparently with a lot of improvisations, but without talent, and I was disappointed with the presence of the promising Caio Blat in that garbage. The camera, framing, cinematography and editing are amateur and of very low quality. The sound is horrible and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are talking about (probably an advantage, since this movie sucks). The gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sexual exploitation. My vote is a (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Cama do Gato")
