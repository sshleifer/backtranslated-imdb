Adapting parts to the movies is often a bad idea because they are two different media. Do you think it's a great idea to turn ZULU into a play? Imagine where two brave redcoats sit in a panting tent "Damn, there are thousands of them out there" Great movie and a bad play <br /> <br /> For a play to make a big movie, there are two essential items needed <1) A good cast that creates in the chemistry of the screen <br /> <br /> 2) Great dialogue <br /> <br /> In the paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good choice of cast, but not in these roles. The story revolves around a gunslinger played by Palminterri invading a house to kill a wife played by Cher, with most of the action taking place inside the house. I was unable to take these two characters seriously, although it might have been the script's fault that I could not decide if he was trying to be serious or funny. As the story is very static, it is of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and, again, because of the bizarre tone of the script, it shames more than anything else with much of the talk about sexual acts. if you want to see a great translation of a play transferred to the silver screen, give FIELFUL a longing and watch 12 ANGRY MEN
