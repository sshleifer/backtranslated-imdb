honestly, where can I get started! This was a low budget film, HORRIBLY ACTUALLY, it was so tacky that it had us all bursting into laughter from how completely retarded it was! The sword fighting scenes were not even sword fights, they were playing with some plastic swords they bought at Wal-Mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try to make it look like they were fighting !! Me and my family were in the mood for a really good action movie, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there was the movie The Sawtooth Island. I mean, it looked so good, but when we watched it at home I practically died after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the plot of the movie, the story board, the script, etc. of garbage that I do not even know because the director and producer lost time doing it !! But if you happen to come across this movie ... do not get caught !!!!!
