It was so terrible. It was not fun watching it all. Even the scene where the girl is wearing a vibrator, even if it's not fun to watch in that movie. I say again, the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if that was the only part of the movie you watched, just a girl on the couch using a vibrator. Maybe they should have just released that scene in theaters, maybe then the movie would be nice on a certain level. My advice, advance to this point, watch, rewind the movie, watch again, back off, repeat. Maybe you can have fun for 2 hours that way. This movie ranks alongside I spit on his tomb and generation Doom in the worst movies category I have ever seen.
