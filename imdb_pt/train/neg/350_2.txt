The performances of Fishbourne (who looks strangely funny in some way) and Ed Harris (short film) are remarkable, unlike Connery who does not seem to make sense in his role and ends up in the motor behavior of an 80 year old man. In fact, the script does not make sense; imagine a 60 min. happy ending-plot plus a sudden back-appendage without any argument structure in relation to the characters. It's more of an accident than a screenplay and can be good for analysis purposes in screen wrestling schools. The more you remember the details, the stronger that impression will be. Capital punishment is not an issue here, although it is a matter from the beginning; this kind of disappears without further comment. The subject matter and the environment could have been good.
