It is rare that I feel the need to write a review on this site, but this movie is very deserving because of how badly it was created, and how biased its product. <br /> <br /> I felt a distinct attempt that the part of the filmmakers showed the Palestinian family as gross and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the sadness they feel from oppression, but the film is filmed and organized in a way that we feel that the politically oppressed population is the Jewish population of Israel. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in force, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to avoid peace. <br /> <br /> I left the film feeling that the victim's mother was selfish in her mourning and completely closed due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She still did not want to see the pain of the bomber's parents, and her angry, closed-minded words brought the final meeting out of control. It is more realistic, in my opinion, to see the Israeli mentality as a root of the problem; ignored requests for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for recognition by the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land. <br /> <br /> I gave it a two because of her mother's selfish weaknesses, which would normally be admirable in a documentary; however, in light of the lack of impartiality, everything seems exploratory. Also for the bad issues, lack of background in the real case, and finally the lack of proper representation on the Palestinian side. Ultimately, it's a poor documentary and a poor movie. I acknowledge that this is partly the result of the political situation, but I am obliged to note the flaws in the direction, regardless of the painful and sad subject.
