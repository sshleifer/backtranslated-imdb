Greenaway's films are intelligent, scholarly and innovative. However, his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the era of World War I: the composition of the painting, the use of the middle of the scene, the static camera. It may be good to rub in conventional films with that style, but that's nothing new. Perhaps like that other "innovator", TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could. <br /> <br /> However, Greenaway's biggest flaw is that he can not write. His dialogue and even plot structure are mechanical and logical, but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. Where this weakness is most apparent is in his mood, which is balanced and logical, so the joke is dead before being delivered. The result is boredom: if it's not funny, it failed: Ask a comedian to justify his act if the audience does not respond. Perhaps the well-read director could learn something from Freud about humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway manipulated his actors over the years to work as clones. They speak the lines with a bored and smug air like narcissistic teenagers. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its design and lighting, is meretr√≠cio.
