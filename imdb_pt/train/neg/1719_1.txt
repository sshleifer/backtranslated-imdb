The Monster Crater Lake is easily one of the most terrible and amateur movies I have ever seen - getting first with Hands, the Hands of Fate in terms of poor acting, useless direction and production values ​​at kindergarten level. In this film, an animation dinosaur similar to the claymation / stop-motion movement wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum, CA, and begins eating at the local wheat field. At an exciting climax, the creature, described by a locale as "a giant flipper alligator," trails its heavy mass to chase after its pretended lunch, before a tractor knocks it down a few times and dies of boredom. Each character in this moovie is a complete idiot. A nonsensical sub-plot shows a hick-man entering a liquor store to buy a liter of Ripple for $ 4.75; instead of simply buying the bottle, the idiot shoots the box and another viewer, shoots a cop, is chased towards the lake, all so he can be eaten by the monster. Unhappy monster close-ups reveal that it is nothing more than a piece of styrofoam. There is a fake magician struggling with a fake British accent (to make it seem more legitimate), two tenant tenants, a few "prehistoric rock art" made out of wax chalk and an annoying background moosic. In a painful scene, the fake mage and his wife / girlfriend / dopey accomplice are able to fill the film for an extra 4 minutes by boasting about how the stars can see in the night sky, although it is clearly the time of day yet. Even in steady fast progress, this moovie hurts and hurts badly. MooCow says to call the fumigators, because this cow pie really stinks! : = 8P
