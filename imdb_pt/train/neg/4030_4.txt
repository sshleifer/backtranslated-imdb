I remember watching "Lost Missile" (actually playing a raid until my brother and several cousins ​​in whose house I was a guest at night agreed to watch with me - I was, from time to time, the Eric Cartman of the years 60-sorry, guys) and get a little embarrassed when the sustained wave of one-million-degree heat emerged as a plot device - even as a second-grader I knew that a simple missile could not carry the energy by too much heat or devastation the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> My inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a crime of self-punishment. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​of the film were very good. The acting is not bad (besides the actor's Shatnerism who played the governor's helper someone mentioned here). <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​an Easy-cooking missile from the Earth's surface through the heat of its escape ... no. How did the people of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" lose "The Lost Missile" anyway? <br /> <br /> It's a great unintentional comedy classic - see if you want something to drink beer some weekend.
