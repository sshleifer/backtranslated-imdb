Earlier today I started a discussion about why so many people complain about modern movies in which I found a curious statement: "The character's development in more recent films is not as good or interesting as it used to be." Depending on the movie (s) in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and Hollywood junk like War of the Worlds, but in the case of uninteresting attempts and uninteresting social commentary and a desperate struggle to put "art" back in the movies, are movies like Dog Days that are to blame. <br /> <br /> I usually have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how boring or meaningless I am. to find them (ranging from good and long, such as Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those I find painful to sit through an Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I close this movie in 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes longer than I should have. I was not interested in any of the characters and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the waste of society, this film easily becomes self-indulgent, banal and exploitative in a very sincere sense. It is true that I have seen many disturbing films on the same subject, but there are so many better movies about depressing and pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that actually contain characters with great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days had no more than the dislike of an eighth grade student by society, choosing to ignore any real intelligence about the way people really are and instead choosing to be a dull, horrible and hopelessly unoriginal attempt of a work of "art". This is not a characterization of the unknown or an intelligent observation about the waste of society, it is just annoying and nothing worth worrying about.
