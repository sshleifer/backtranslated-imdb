Oh ... my ... god ... this is undoubtedly the cutest movie I've ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker and the whole movie does not make sense. Couple that with mediocre direction, really weird scenes (like the one where the kid comes over the canyon and mysteriously falls down), and a totally abysmal dialogue ("Look!" "Musta peed his pants!"), And you'll have a complete failure. Not to mention the fact that the one thing Mr. Atlas looks like he could beat is a case of chocolate bars. But that's part of the movie's charm. Sit down and watch him with some friends for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's so bad!
