Anyone who has a vested interest in science fiction must start in the basics. Everyone says that STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin with, which is good, but the truth is THE FINDER and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, are far better choices than those series. SOYLENT is probably the best kept secret of science fiction. It remains one of the biggest but most overlooked films, but the impact of its setting is becoming more of a reality with each passing day. Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role, but it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are playing. <br /> <br /> It's Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small pot of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A top executive at Soylent is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case. <br /> <br /> The secret of the soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the film. SOYLENT is nice to watch, but the whole script is a joke. It's as cheap as the whole production. The screenplay and dramatics of the actors made the film, but they were completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be an idiot and no-one knows the rules, specifically the Thorn cop who likes to walk into people's apartments, flip over and steal whatever he wants. The character's interactions keep your attention on the movie, but you still realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. A nice piece if you have time, but do not expect anything else.
