I really wanted to like this movie so much more than I did. That's because I love strange comedies - especially the strange ones that surprise you completely by surprise. However, although this often caught me by surprise, these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park in which almost all social norms were violated until the only ones left to tackle were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploiting adultery, drug abuse (of almost every type - from marijuana, heroin, speed to sniffing glue), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc., the movie hit the hilarious (? ) Topic of pedophilia. The mother encouraged her to a son (who seemed to be 12 years old) sleeping with the neighbors. In fact, at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist instead of paying for dental work! Funny?! You have got to be kidding. This movie goes too far and plunges into the "black hole of comedy". What should they make fun of near tumors, cancer or rectum?
