This movie is something like a sequel to "White Zombie" since it is made by the same man (Halperin) and features zombies. Halperin, the George A. Romero of his day, can not deliver with this, however. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of the people in Cambodia, and a quest to destroy the source of his power so that the zombies can be sent for free. In addition, a loving interest for the evil man. <br /> <br /> Where this movie really stands out is in the picture. The temples and dancers of Cambodia are very nice and the zombies seem very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we really do not get to see many of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a huge role for a horror movie (although this has a valid plot reason later). <br /> I would love to see some zombies from the 1930s attack the town's homeless people, but this movie simply did not show up. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to fight against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? A good but deceptive effect like it's never in the movie ... why not recreate it with the eyes of the new actor? Overall, a movie that can be great, with a small work script, can one day be a powerful remake (especially if it's kept in the same post-war period). Heck, if they can fix "The Hills Have Eyes," then this movie has hope.
