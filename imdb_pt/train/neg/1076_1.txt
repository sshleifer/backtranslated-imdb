This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have trouble remembering his accent that he could not deliver his lines. The plot definitely was not worthy of John Grisham's name. No wonder it has never been published as a book or released in theaters. I did not even watch the whole thing. I decided I did not care who did it, so I realized there was no whodunit to worry about!
