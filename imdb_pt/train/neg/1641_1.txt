This movie is not funny. It's no fun. It does not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it lead you to have the least interest in the characters or situation. Added to that is about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory. It's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who never knew or had any kind of relationship with a real girl had sat down and written a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about how being an adult man would be like. This movie is boring, nasty and at times offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. In addition, it seems twice as long as 85 minutes.
