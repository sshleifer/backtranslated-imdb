Kill Me Later "has an interesting premise: a suicidal woman (Selma Blair) about to jump from the top of an office building protects a bank robber (Max Beesley) who promises to" kill her later. " The actual execution of this premise nevertheless falls as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion. Shoddily writers who do not present motives for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all Lack of depth of character , especially diminishes the performance of Selma Blair, whose character Shawn hesitates to be grumpy to act "cool" and finally comes across a confused idiot.This is unfortunate as in other circumstances Blair is a attractive and capable actress. To make matters worse, director Dana Lustig's insistence on using quick cuts, incongruous special effects (for example, looking for an infrared motorcycle chase involuntarily and hilarious at the end), and a hip soundtrack hoping to appeal to the short attention span of the MTV crowd. Certainly, Mrs. Lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of the direction, but in no way does her ability help overcome the inherent problems of the film and thus the film drags itself to the end. Clearly, Lustig has a distinct visual style; however, it is perhaps more suitable for music videos than for movies. The producers (Ram Bergman & Lustig) can be praised for their ability to make this film: they were able to scare $ 1.5 million to fund the movie, secure a good cast and get distribution domestic and foreign. This is no small thing for an independent movie. Still, given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.
