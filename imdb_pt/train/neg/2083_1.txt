At what point exactly does a good movie go wrong? When a movie goes from "watchable" to "where is this & ^ @ _ + #! * Switch OFF"? Thank goodness for DVDs, like this one, that can be borrowed from the library - for free! Likewise, thank goodness for the "fast forward" switch on the DVD player. I'm sorry for those people who were cheated at the box office. <br /> <br /> At one point (I forgot exactly when because now it's all just a blur), our "hero", Luke Wilson starts running through the traffic; I think he was looking for a taxi. It was at this point that I gave up, realizing that I did not care if he found his ride or was hit by a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbs out of the dumpster, hair dryer in hand, and first finds the "heroine" Uma Thurman. That scene ended with the sweeping criminal of bags hanging helplessly at the fire exit far above the Luke and One that left. This was the last time the movie was funny, and when was that scene? Ten minutes to the movie? Every time the movie tried to become "funny," it could not. Every time the movie approached "excitement," it dissipated, going in the opposite direction. When a musical score could have helped to take the life of this stupid, the soundtrack remained empty and silent. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes were not necessary and were beyond the lame; the damage to unnecessary and childish sets and props. When Uma turns into a crazy ex-girlfriend, I felt like I was watching "The 40-year-old virgin knows police fiction"; was when I realized that there was no turning back because I did not like the "40 year old Virgin" and "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson's sidekick Rainn Wilson (also seen in the sad "The Last" Mimzy) adds nothing more than insult to injury in this horrible movie. Every time Uma's rival, Anna Faris, appeared on the screen, I expected Jason, Freddy or some frightful monster to come out behind the scenes; Once you see Anna Faris in "Scary Movie," it's all you see, no matter the movie, no matter the medium. The character played by Wanda Sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in that movie.
