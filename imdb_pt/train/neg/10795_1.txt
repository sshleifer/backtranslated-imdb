Would someone tell the shaq to stick to what he's good at basketball? This movie was not even fun on a stupid level. In this film, the shaq plays a genius who lives on a stereo that is not an original genius on a stereo instead of a lamp. He should help a little boy get touched by the equally annoying franc cappra. This movie had the most fragile plot since the water world, the acting was horrible and I think anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it.
