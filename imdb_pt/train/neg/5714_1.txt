I have seen many good Korean movies, including thrillers and overtone movies with darker, but this sucks. The director seems to be a sadist, who made someone produce some crap. The movie does not have any kind of entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can not believe anyone actually made such a movie. Even if the performance is good, the plot and the impression left are terrible. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I will not see any movie from that director. No sense of making a movie and absolute disappointment at having moments of suspense. All this has shown scenes with psychopaths wasting the reels with scenes of poorly filmed scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it exciting. Very disappointing movie and I strongly recommend skipping all movies of this type.
