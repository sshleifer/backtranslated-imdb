Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third movie of the Home Alone empire. Four industrial spies acquire a computer chip from the missile guidance system and transport it through an airport inside a remote control toy car. Because of the mess of luggage, the grumpy Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) picks up the car. She gives to her neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies appear. Spies rent a house to break into every neighborhood house until they locate the car. Alone at home with the chicken pox, Alex calls 911 every time he sees a robbery in progress, but spies always manage to escape the police while Alex is accused of prancing. The spies finally turn their attention to Alex, unaware that he has set up devices to trap his entire house. Alone at Home 3 was not horrible, but probably should not have been done, you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some funny parts, but I do not like it when the characters are changed in a series of movies, see at your own risk.
