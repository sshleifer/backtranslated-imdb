A small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a solitary avenger and a group of disorganized survivors. Launched in 1993, "Darkness" gathered a kind of worship after the release. It's easy to see why - it's loaded (and I say loaded panic) with blood, and it's energy and enthusiasm, like the one found in other budget films like "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback" The truth is quite contagious. <br /> <br /> While this may be true, unfortunately it is not enough to save you. The film was filmed in a Super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, making things very difficult to see (it would have been great if it had obscured the terrible mullet of the protagonists). It is also the soundtrack, composed by Casio annoying. Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what's with these budget movies with no budget and bad Death Metal?) While one is not expecting performances worthy of Oscar, the acting is still strictly amateur hour, as the actors sometimes seem almost confused rather than frightened or threatened. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure fans of budget-conscious gorefests will love it. Everyone else, however, wished there were a little more meat in the ribs.
