Comedy worked has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall investigating eccentric farming families in Maryland who never paid their taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the farmer's daughter putting the squeeze on the not-so-disinterested tax man. Debbie certainly did her bit of lower theatrical sitcoms during this period - and this is no better or worse than the rest. The image begins brilliantly, but signals in the middle of the path, becoming frantic and bland. Randall is not a bad game for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeats chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, with a bad sound, making all the actors sound as if they were trapped in an echo chamber. ** in ****
