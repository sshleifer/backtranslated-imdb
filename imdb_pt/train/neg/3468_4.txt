A student filmmaker recruits a B-grade actress (a delightful MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror film her mother (a Kylie Minogue) tried to do 12 years ago. It's a curious choice of plot to say the least, as any Australian horror fan knows that the genre is unfortunately lacking in female directors. The movie has a curse on this because Molly had to kill some psychotic killer on the original set. But she's back because she needs exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying in the "set". Cut is an Australian attempt of the modern "slasher", but unfortunately does not bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, he ripped half of Wes Craven's 1990s filmography. A lot of the names of the movie world falling out "Scream" (except for the name Aussie - Jane Campion ... see how that's not so funny) and a lot of "is this real or is it a movie?" the "New Nightmare". The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, almost anything is bad about it. Fortunately, the film may have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl on the film crew tells the owner of the house they're filming, "Do not worry, let's treat your house as if it was ours," that he responds, "that means nothing to me, you look like you live in a dump!" Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough not to regret renting this one. "Do you have any diet coke here?" (as she walks in the movie teacher's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu?" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and "Where the hell's my agent?" (oh wait, that's what I was thinking about her.)
