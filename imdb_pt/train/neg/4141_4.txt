Well ... the movie was a fun timepiece. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths obey. Like vampires walking in the sunlight. Although there are parts that only make you enjoy the way society makes movies. A scene where a vampire is stabbed and shouts, "It hurts ... it's really stuck." So it looks like there may be missing scenes, but you get used to it after a while. And there are random sequences of dreams that really do not help in the plot. Come to think of it, nothing really made sense, but I just got a lot of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Come to think of it the fight scenes were horrible, and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly, as I write more, I like this movie more. But you know, after all, you can not expect Schindlers List, but it's a fun watch.
