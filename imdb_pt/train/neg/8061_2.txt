I can start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much. I wish he were in more movies that would show his talent. With that said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Too bad. <br /> <br /> I would have to say that I put almost all the blame on the poor script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley performed well in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well, and Eliza Dushku is currently the girl in Hollywood. I do not think any of the actors actually entered the script, and I understand why. To say that this film belongs to the horror genre is an exaggeration. He had the twists and turns you'd expect, but they just did not get you anywhere ... except for more confusion. I found the ending very anti-climatic because it simply did not seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions I had about the plot. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie a good review, but I can not. In all honesty, the only thing I think you'll find scary about this movie is that you paid for it.
