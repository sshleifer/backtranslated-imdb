Please help the economy - spend your money somewhere else! The synopsis of the film is: the first lady has her husband murdered because he was cheating on her. That's it. Undetected by anyone except Cuba and Angie, she designs and implements a vast murder conspiracy that no one knows ... and runs away completely free. <br /> <br /> Some specific points are particularly hilarious: from the president, Cuba, he deflects the murderer's bullet ... which then enters the back of the president's head. <br /> Cuba and Angie watch movie from a news camera, and they see ... a clue. They strive to protect the film by believing they are the only people who have a copy of this very public movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba talks to a member of the presidential team. The PSM says there was no conspiracy. Cuba claims that more than one person was involved. The PSM then complains that the conspiracy includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. Wow, I wonder is PSM is involved. <br /> <br /> Ms Archer, the First Lady, is a craptacular artist. Cuba can not see a painting, and she says, "You're very close ... step back ... look from a different perspective, look from my perspective." Can anyone miss this clue?
