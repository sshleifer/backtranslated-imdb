For the first 3 seasons, the Strange Parents were as tasty as a hard candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And, unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you need after seeing the latest episodes where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughter. Cosmo, who was once one of Nick's nicest characters, turned into an abusive and bland cretin that the cast of Family Guy did not even want to know. Timmy became an arrogant and selfish idiot that Bart Simpson would be happy to beat the snot out (and given Timmy's stupidity, that would take a lot of beating). And poor Wanda ... a true enchanter who became the victim of her husband and goddaughter, she is now labeled "boring" for worrying about the well-being of others. In addition, Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else, but he is never punished for it, nor learns lessons. Which sums up Butch Hartman's attitude toward children: they are crude, vulgar and not very bright. Thank God this crummy toon was canceled, along with Butch Hartman's darling, Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.
