Good Lord, whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer should not have seen this movie, he must be watching the other thing, or have never seen a movie before ... 9 of ten stars? He's saying what, this is as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind? Unintentionally, incredibly funny characters, absurd situations, it looks like it was shot in Griffith Park (which works great - MASH was filmed in Griffith Park), script of shit, almost everything that could be wrong with a whole movie rolled into one package. It should be necessary to view all possible filmmakers as an example of how a film can be terribly wrong. It reminds me of something a USC student can do for a movie class. <br /> <br /> Give this a pass, unless you use drugs and be on a high field.
