I do not think this could be done, but something came along and replaced the Open House - a low-budget horror about someone killing on the high price of the real estate market - as the worst movie I've ever seen in my short but sweet life. <br /> <br /> It was considered the best film of the most recent Montreal film festival, which leads me to believe that all other entries should consist of blank wall outlets accompanied by people who read dark poetry. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was like a little slice of Hell. She is from Austria, and tries to stumble in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet-scenes on various characters who live in a suburban area with a dark belly. There is the owner of the fat dog and his fat wife who strips for him, the lean divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child, the grimacing and annoying woman who recites the top ten lists . . The list goes on. Forever. Much like the two hours I spent in that theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters interact, but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way. I could not tell if they were good as actors because, according to the subtitles, they received lines that were the Austrian equivalent of "You're so lame!" They certainly did not have to learn many, for each one repeated his own lines at least three times in one scene. <br /> <br /> This is not the Gummo, or any of the movies mentioned above. There is no art to discover, and nothing to delve into afterwards, except whether or not you should change your "Never Go Out for a Movie" policy (what some older couples did during a random orgy scene) and whether that sounds appetizing , it's not, unless you're one of the few who do not think their parents have sex - and some middle-aged local couples to revolt.) <br /> <br /> This movie was offensive to me. Not the loose nudity, the soundtrack that induces strangeness, nor the scenes without shock involving weapons. I was offended because someone actually spent money to do this when there are writers and filmmakers capable out there looking for funding. I felt offended that someone from out of town came to see Dog Days and go out wondering if this was the best we Montrealers could find. Above all, I was offended because somehow the people involved in the festival deceived everyone believing that the emperor had a dazzling and fascinating outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat wife doing a striptease. <br /> <br />
