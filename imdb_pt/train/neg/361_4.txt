After reading the book, I loved the story. Watching the movie, I was disappointed that so many changes have been made. It is understandable that books and films are different, but they were two different stories, only the names and some stories of the book remained. Read the book and you will have a better understanding of the film. The book offers a better development of the characters. These characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them. The sites were in fact aligned with the descriptions of the book. Some characters not included. Television has produced so many excellent books and stories, this is a perfect example of this. The author's entry does not always guarantee a good movie, but it may help a few times.
