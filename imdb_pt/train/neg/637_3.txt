Good land is not a great movie by any means, it's the common way. Maybe it was different in the 1930s, but who would want to see the life of a farmer. Not very interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do a great job, but the movie dragged on for a long time. I could have told you the end of this movie in the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small farmer who does not want to be like his own father, is just like him. Both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds. The film makes a full 360 passing from one generation to another. In addition, this movie did not have good character actors or funny moments, it was just depressing about the duration of a farmer during a period of crisis.
