This whirling movie looks more like a combination of music clips on MTV than a real movie. There is no real story and as the movie continues, you wonder, "What will happen?"; but nothing happens. The story around Eric Cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. The other people seem to have nothing in common: so why put them together in a movie. With music you can make watchable the worst movie. When I open the tap and there comes water with Bach's music, then most people will enjoy looking at it, but this is not a movie. The director must learn how to write a screenplay for a movie 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a movie.
