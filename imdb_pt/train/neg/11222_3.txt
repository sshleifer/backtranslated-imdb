Cybil Richards directs another erotic masterpiece of Full Moon / Surrender Cinema. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in pretty silver clothes) is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity. However, she can not resist watching the tapes and she likes them. The sex scenes are well filmed and put on a great soundtrack (at least for this type of movie). The cast is largely horrible and mostly very average looking as well. Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between seeing the sex files, she is able to expose her chest and get in the way a little below. It also fits into a small lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves much more than that kind of fare. Here she looks quite naked, but in fact she is much more attractive in her silver costume narrating the 'drama'. Totally dirty film with Lovell and soundtrack, the only really redeeming features. Even mediocre for the exit from Surrender and clearly a new low budget for them as well.
