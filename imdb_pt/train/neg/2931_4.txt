The sitcom "The league of Gentlemen" follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village "Royston Vasey". The different scenes are linked by their common scenario. <br /> <br /> In the first series, a sketch show, the main plot deals with a new road that will be built through Royston Vasey. As a result, more foreigners visit the small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a "local" store, which is actually far from the city, do not like foreigners. Whenever a visitor enters his shop, he kills him. In my opinion, some scenes are a bit bland and not funny, for example, when the couple absorbs two engineers who want to build the new road. Edward drumming while Tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims. <br /> <br /> In addition Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. She works at the local Employment Center. Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to lose her job. So when an unemployed man gets an interview as a firefighter, she does not let him go because he is not yet ready for work. <br /> <br /> So there's Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about her "sexual conversion." <br /> <br /> In addition, the veterinarian, Mr. Chinnery, always kills animals instead of curing them. In one case, he arrives at a farm and is taken to the living room, where a dog lies in his basket. The farmer goes outside. Assuming the dog is the sick animal, Mr. Chinnery sacrifices it. A second later, the farmer opens the door, holding the sick animal "in truth." <br /> <br /> More inhabitants are husband and wife, who are visited by his nephew. friend is killed by store owners, by the way). The couple is very neat. They have, for example, towels in different colors. Each color represents a part of the body. In addition, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colors and precisely classified. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. When interpreting women, the scenes become comic. The costumes are suitable for the actors as well. Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters, such as Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The show has a great deal of black humor, typically British. The design of the scenery reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses look gray and decayed. Around the local store, there is often fog that strengthens the ominous effect. Even the village sign is grim: "Welcome to Royston Vasey. You will never leave." <br /> <br /> Although I think the actors do a great job, this kind of series is not to my liking.
