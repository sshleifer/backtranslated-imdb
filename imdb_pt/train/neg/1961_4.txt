... the children actors were annoying. Also it seems that the producers of this film were having difficulties to fill 90 minutes. Scenes of decent death, however. If it were not for the death scenes, this movie would have a very Disneyish feel. <br /> <br /> The main child protagonist did not seem as scared as she should be. If I was in the middle of the woods with some kind of ghost killer of a tooth, you can bet I would not go wandering and cycling. <br /> <br /> Overall, I saw worse (ie, wait), but it's nothing I would watch again, or recommend someone bothering him, unless you're an avid terror collector.
