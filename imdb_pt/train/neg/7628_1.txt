Black and white movie. Good photography. Credible characters. <br /> <br /> Just horrible. <br /> <br /> I missed another perfect night watching a movie that others rated as "decent" and "very good." There is a good performance here and the background scene for the plot is good (more should have been done with it), but it is too slow to grow and never develops. It's totally based on sex without much romance with a lot of unnecessary nudity. More could have been done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to watch with your family this is not the movie and if not you will have trouble sitting by it. Although this film is long, it is only 1 inch deep!
