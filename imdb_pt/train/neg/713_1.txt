Please, I can say first of all that I felt so strongly about this movie that I signed up on IMDb specifically to review it. What about my comment? This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. The synopsis of the film seemed interesting - Nazis, occultism, time travel, etc., but the plot of the film could not bring all these elements together properly. Remember the episode of South Park that featured manatins writing Family Guy using 'idea balls'? These manatees also wrote Unholy? It's how the writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but he had no idea how to tie them all together, and then make things less sense, included a travel theme in the time of Donnie Darko-esquire to the end, messing up the chronology <br /> <br /> I could say from an early age that this was a bad movie. The special effects were a very low budget for something better than straight to the DVD. The performance was not great, but in fairness I saw worse. I will praise the Nazi paintings, they were scary, but the evil Nazi butcher was just comic. <br /> <br /> I do not have a revenge against this movie or anything else, but to be honest, I'm not even into the horror genre. But this movie can not be described as a thriller or a drama. If this story had been well told, this would have been a good movie. But this has been sensational. Waaaaay more hyped.
