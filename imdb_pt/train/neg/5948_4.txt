I will not mention the plot because, despite being highly predictable, the remarkable twist in the story is given everywhere, in the movie reviews, in the plot summary here and even in the synopsis of my Netflix envelope. . I could have liked it more if I did not know that. Perhaps. This film has a deceptively good cast, most of whom acted with fairly limited material at hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. It was impossible to like William McNamara, but this was clearly projected. And there were some quick nudity scenes from Rotarian Lenore Zann. But none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me. Did any of these good actors actually read these scripts before signing?
