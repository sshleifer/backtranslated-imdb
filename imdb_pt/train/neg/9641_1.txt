If you're watching this movie, you're a fan of Fred Olen Ray, you found it on the $ 4.99 shelf at Suncoast and thought "what have I got to lose?", Or did you spin around the video store with his eyes closed and we rented the first movie that his finger touched. <br /> <br /> This movie is hysterically bad. It has everything a terrible movie needs: a script with jaw-dropping dialogues and baffling detours in the plot, crazy science involving mediums and other dimensions, continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space, actors who are not just wooden, but it seems to overflow with bewildered and gratuitous nudity (not everything is what you were asking for), and of course, a 5 'monster interpreted by what I presume to be the son of Fred Olen Ray. (as if Mickey and Judy decided to gather all the kids in the neighborhood and make a movie of monsters (hey! my dad can direct it!) yeah! my johnny's father's hardware store, and I know this ex-stripper who can act on it!) <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the credit reel - you find out why the final cut of the movie was so bad. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, Biohazard II ... the Alien Force also deserves a look, but it does not have the same nice shitty veneer it does.
