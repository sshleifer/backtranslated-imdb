I saw the movie last night here at home, but I thought it was too long before everything. Secondly, the things I saw in the movie were too out of the text to even take in what I thought would be a comedy type movie like the rest before. Things are not funny in the movie: girlfriend beating girlfriend, beating. The movie was very long - talking about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still play! Some of the things at the meeting were too much to capture - like the lady singing - I felt like I was almost watching a spiritual music show here! Come on Perry, you can do better than that!
