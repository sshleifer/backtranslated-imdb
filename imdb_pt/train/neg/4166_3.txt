Full waste of time .... This movie is not comedy, it's not drama, it's not romance ... not even teenage comedy at least !!! History ... should be a turn-over on one side ... but it's so disappointing! When the film has a turn-over at the end, I hope the turn-over makes the movie even better (exp. "Fight Club"), but it makes the movie even worse .... When I watch a teen comedy, and I do not see often, expect bad jokes and bunch of nudity ... Jokes are very bad and there is no nudity ... You have only one ... very beautiful I must admit ... girl, and that's it! And she's completely dressed up as a whole movie! Act is bad ... like soap series ... Do not waste your time! There is pornography with better story and acting! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
