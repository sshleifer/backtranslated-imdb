I admit I've seen maybe five minutes of "Jerry Springer." I do not consider myself a snob, but I really think I'm above watching what's on his show. You should try to rise above that as well. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of a social studies event that I was leading. I was told that this film really had little to do with Springer himself, but it focused on the lives of those who would appear in "Springer." Treated better, this movie may have actually been a fascinating look at just how pathetic the life of these people really is. I admit, I felt a twinge of empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). That's all she has in life. How sad that she feels she should go to Jerry's show in order to sort it out. <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry Molly Hagan appears in this. Did you notice that after that movie, she was mostly relegated to "B" roles on TV? I'll tell you about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very sincere in her acting and tries to play her roles with great empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not take a scene by himself. She simply does not have what it takes to play a leading role. Her best work will always be Angel in "Herman's Head" (a show that was not great, but her heart was in the right place) and when she invited "Seinfeld" as Sister Roberta.
