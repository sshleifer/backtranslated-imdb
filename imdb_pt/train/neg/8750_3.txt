Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring filmmaker, lives in an apartment in New York and relies on his mother to help pay the rent. He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals), who may or may not be married, but Aldolpho would love to star in his movie. When Al unexpectedly receives a financial pledge of funding for his film from a strange man named Joe, he thinks it was done. That is, until Joe takes Al on an adventure to steal a Porsche from the financial backing. Will the film be made before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? And Angelica will star in the movie? This is, in the opinion of this viewer, a horrible movie. The script is lousy, with a plot that wanders of its own accord. Beals practically growls at all his lines and Buscemi, despite being sympathetic, is indescribable. There's a fair amount of unpleasant material and unpleasant characters to boot. Finally, production figures are also very low, making the film look second-rate at all times. If you have time on your hands, it's still a good idea not to take the risk with this movie. But if you are the proverbial glutton of punishment, go ahead and watch the damn thing. Beals looks beautiful after all.
