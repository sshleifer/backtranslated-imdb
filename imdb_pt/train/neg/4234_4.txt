It's not the best movie ever made, but for what it is, it's a lot of fun. The plot is lame, but the killings are not so bad. I have to be honest, if you do not follow the bands that appear in this movie, you will not find this movie as funny as the ones that do. I met someone who saw this movie and was very disappointed because of the poor quality of the film, but you have to understand that it was done in the free time to be on tour, between playing for children and drinking with friends backstage. ..is not meant to be taken seriously. It's the ubber cheese in the best of punk and with over 100 deaths, most of which are ultra bloody, it's a fun movie to have friends to watch, drink and be merry!
