The only reason I remember this is that it was shown a week after the broadcast of Nigel Kneale's brilliant QUATERMASS. The trailers made strong emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm that made me expect him to be like Victor Caroon of THE QUERERMASS EXPERIMENT walking the streets of London. <br /> <br /> No such luck because THE RACING GAME is just a rather monotonous thriller with the trick of having a physically disabled hero trying to get to the bottom of the investigations of corrupt horse races. I suppose if you're a fan of Dick Francis, you might like it, but putting it in the context of the late '70s when THE SWEENEY had just ended and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced, there is something missing about THE RACING GAME. A trailer had one car over the other in a motorized way if it had been a trailer for THE SWEENEY, you would see Jack Regan taking a car and banging a confession out of the scum that made a mess while THE PROFESSIONALS would have just taken a car and took the terrorists inside. I think it sums up what's wrong with this series
