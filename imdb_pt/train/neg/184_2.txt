Mann photographs the Rocky Mountains of Alberta in a superb way, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect a marshal (yes, a marshal!) and enforce the law themselves, then the fighters fighting on the streets for control of the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing remotely resembles what happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mann and company seem to have confused Dawson City with Deadwood, the Canadian north of the American west. <br /> <br /> Canadian viewers are prepared for some kind of fun-filled madness with this ridiculous plot, or shaking their heads in disgust.
