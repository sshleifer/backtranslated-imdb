I was surprised when I saw this movie. I heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel. How disappointed. <br /> <br /> As any real fan of Jane Austen can appreciate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. The writers have decided to ridicule ridiculous humor that is embarrassing at best, but also spoil the feel of the period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a superficial heroine (but any "hot" American star would be questionable on paper), Toni Collette is miscast, and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look ridiculous! <br /> <br /> I really could not say a good thing about this movie. I seem to be among the few who do not rate it, but if you want my advice, watch the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me, it's much preferable to this shabby garbage.
