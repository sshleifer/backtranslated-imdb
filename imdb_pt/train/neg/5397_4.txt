I think this is one of the weakest of Kenneth Branagh Shakespearian's works. After such great efforts as Much Ado about Nothing, etc. I thought that was bad. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but my biggest complaint was that they messed up the Bardo's work and cut off part of the play to put the musical / dance sequences. <br /> <br /> You just do not do Shakespeare and then play the play. Sorry, but this is wrong. I love some Cole Porter as the next person, but do not mess with Shakespeare. Skip this one and watch "Prospero's Books" if you want to see a brilliant adaptation of Tempest's Shakespeare.
