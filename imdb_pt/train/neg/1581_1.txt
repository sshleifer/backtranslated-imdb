This was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous. It revolves around an evil lesbian that makes rich married men can have sex with her and then blackmails them for money. One of the victims is a candidate for AD, which is causing problems in her relationship with the wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, also married, and the evil lesbian seduces this wife too! Meanwhile, the lesbian's girlfriend does not like her much sleeping around. It ends in a happy ending, where everything is forgiven. Women also get nude, especially in situations that extend to reality. Bad Mau Mau.
