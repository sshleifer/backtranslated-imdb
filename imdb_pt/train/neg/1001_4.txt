I rented this on DVD and I feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so sincere about it in the DVD comments. It's not exactly a bad movie, but it's one of those movies that desperately wants to be a deep commentary on human nature without realizing that its story is practically a genre. Also, it's a bit simplistic on the subject in many ways, and the behavior of the characters usually presses belief. I'd say it's a movie from which you'd take something if you do not have a lot of movie / TV / literature / life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same horror comic anyway). Otherwise, your point was made earlier and more ingeniously. And that comes to the big problem, which is that it really does not have much cinematographic interest beyond the point. It turns out to be a relatively dull movie that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and not worth it.
