I have not seen this for over twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Art Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the hijacker. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lorenzo seemed very much at home as the villain, a natural. I guess I watched more at the time for OJ, that I had seen the Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also to see Art Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious. <BR> And yes, that changed the plots. When reading other posts, I remember it was a plot that they would kidnap a rich girl, but then that priceless stamp came out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> I was going, a seal? If this happened like a late movie, I would probably record it to see it again, but I would not be homesick about it. Not yet anyway. <br /> <br /> There are better movies from the seventies like this to check out.
