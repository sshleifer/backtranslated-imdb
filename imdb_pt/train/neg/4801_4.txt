I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison environment, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a totally heinous 80-year-old twist, and it's an effort to direct actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad guy (you guessed it). This reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror films. But the direction is a lot of wood and there is not a nightmare / fear moment there. It just goes on and on, and then (logically) it has to end. More suspense and more daring visuals and their fate as a cult classic would have been sealed.
