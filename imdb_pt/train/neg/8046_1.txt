Not? I do not think so! Well, in that case, all you have to do is stay away, away from "You want to know a secret," since it's just the nonsensical post - "Scream" that has no redeeming value. The plot is extremely ridiculous; the characters are unbearably dumb, the gore factor is insignificant and the whole thing is just boring! As you can derive from the title already, this movie is mostly inspired by "I still know what you did last summer," as events happen in a similar scenario and the motivations of the killer are equally stupid. Why would anyone want to steal trash ideas like "IKWYDLS" is a complete mystery to me, anyway. At least this movie could depend on the precious rack of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while the girls in that garbage are, in addition to being outlandish, also terribly unattractive. A year after the unresolved murder of her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, her new adulterous lover and four other simplistic college students come to Florida to spend their spring break in a fancy beach house. The killer did not make a move all year, but now he follows the peloton to Florida and begins to massacre them while leaving behind the owner's message as some kind of business card. You really do not need to be a terror expert to quickly discover which face lurks behind the indescribably ridiculous mask, and the writers' attempts to put you on the wrong track are frankly embarrassing. As the plot is so thin, most of the film is of purely irrelevant fill, including the subdivisions on the incompetent Florida police force and the mysterious FBI inspector who seems to have a personal scoring to solve. Murder inexplicably happens off-screen (do not you hate it when that happens?), There's no free T & A to enjoy and you'd better not start talking about the quality of the dialogues. Suffering like this just makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the '80s thieves is gone forever.
