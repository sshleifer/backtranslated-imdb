Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Low production values, terrible story idea, bad script, dull acting ... and I can not even think of an adequately descriptive adjective Joan River's direction is. I know there's a special place in hell for the people who financed this movie; prolly just below the level reserved for genocidal maniacs raping children. <br /> <br /> This movie is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinity) = Rabbit Test. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not even funny how bad it is.
