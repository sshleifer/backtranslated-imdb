I can not believe they managed to spend $ 17 million on this movie. Spectacularly poor performance, notorious scripts and effects you could make on your ordinary PC, unbelievable plot inventions ... a reporter who can get an inexperienced air hostess an important job at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this film is so subtle that you leave feeling like you've tried to hit your head with a full-sized crucifix. This whole movie will serve to preach to the choir and make everyone laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the creators of this film really wanted to convince people to Christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would have used the money to help people in need. Now, this may have influenced some people to actually listen to them.
