The slash flicks arrive few and now between day and night, so when I heard about Cut I had high hopes and heard good things about it. Those good things I heard were all wrong ... very wrong! This movie is bad and I mean BAD. You're just stupid. All about it. Especially the origin of the killer and how he stays alive and how he is cared for in the end. There is nothing original or excellent about this movie. Just another aspirant to slasher with those "Hip", "Self aware". Characters "Movie savvy". I'm so tired of this crap. Someone does something different because the slash genre needs new blood, literally.
