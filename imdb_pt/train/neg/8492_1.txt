If you go through the opening credits, this may be your type of movie. From the first canvas of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets in the background, she remembers a commercial of pretentious perfume. The main actress is basically a block of wood that uses her computer to reach the past, and rebuild the memories of photographs, to talk about the forgotten genius of history, Ada, who conceived the first computer language of the 1800s. > Low-budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting, or even integral to the script. <br /> <br /> Poor Tilda Swinton is lost.
