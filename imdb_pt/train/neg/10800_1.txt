What was the purpose of this film? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can not act, people do not know how to drive, and I'm Kazaam! A genius who rap? Let's go. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like that. I remember watching this just to kill time. That did not really interest me. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this movie ???" The whole story seemed stupid too. It did not make any sense. I think an unfulfilled moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen. I can not comment much more because this movie is so terrible that there is nothing worth commenting on. I "wish" that this movie would go away.
