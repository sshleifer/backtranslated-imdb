Here we have a movie that fails in virtually every possible way a movie fails. Terrible script, bad acting, amateur direction, laughable special effects ... it's just an extremely horrible movie. Not to mention the fact that when you come to an end, you realize that the whole thing does not make any sense. After spending the entire movie thinking about what the world is going through when things are finally explained, you realize that the story was built on a foundation that is ridiculously impossible. In one of those heinous sequences like "The villain explains the whole movie" we are told that our villain did something that simply can not be done and that makes absolutely no sense. Oh, and after that we see that there also seems to be some kind of jell-o monster involved. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would love to pretend this movie never happened. If for some wicked reason you are tempted to sit and watch this movie, I suggest you take this time to bang your head against the wall for 104 minutes. That would prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than going through this crap.
