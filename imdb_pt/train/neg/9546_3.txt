If you thought the original of 83 was bad, then try this modern masterpiece. How could it be worse, you ask? Well ... at least at first you had Ally Sheedy running around in a sports bra. In addition to updated graphics, modern themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley, sadly this is the same sad and tiresome story. Anyone who saw the first could see exactly where the next scene / story line was going. And for anyone who has not seen the first ... well, consider yourself lucky to have only attended once. Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again.
