This movie was weird ... I watched while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was very strange. I'm sure you should watch it loud, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not stop laughing ... maybe lsd would work. The movie is a lot of things turning into other things and dancing. It's really tacky by today's standards, but when it was released im sure it was well ... one of a kind. I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I did not think it was very interesting, and I was with mushrooms at the time. If you are having a party or something and everyone is well lit, make a lot of laughs.
