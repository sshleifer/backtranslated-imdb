I should review this for a website, and I saw this with optimism that maybe at least it would be a steal still fun and fun, and not even that good enough. <br /> <br /> 666: The Child is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (even worse than "Godsend") with scenes that rip "The Omen" without shame. similar to the way The Omen ends. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that acting, writing and history are simply banal. <br /> <br /> If these films make money, I'm sad to see where the Asylum is going. It's embarrassing.
