I was so hopeful to see an adaptation of a classic story like the Thousand and One Nights. Instead I was disappointed in a movie that failed to keep my attention from the start, even though I tried to watch it twice !! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie, but it was not much, since the actors had no sympathy. For something a little alike, Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action, comedic moments and general amusement. <br /> <br /> OK, so Son of the Dragon has many possible fans out there, but if you're looking for something to impress in terms of martial arts and plot you will not get it. If you just want the kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon, then maybe this is for you along with the 3 ninjas.
