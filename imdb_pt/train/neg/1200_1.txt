Very dull, obvious, tedious Exorcist with a Doberman with red eyes - this is the extension of the special effects in this cheap cheap. Richard Crenna is as excited as a chew toy. Much dress and music of the 70s only increase torture. You should put him to sleep almost as fast as "The Corpse Disappears," or "The Blue Hand." Practically worthless. MooCow says eaghhh that smelly dog! : = 8P
