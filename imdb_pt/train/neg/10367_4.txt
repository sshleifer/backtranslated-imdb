This movie was poorly written, poorly represented and very predictable. It was very low budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to the video. It was not even fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could go back for 1-1 / 2 hours! The colors were horrible along with the plot that has holes so large that you could drive a mac truck through them. The plot itself had the young bride doing things she absolutely was not physically able to do - what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than that. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
