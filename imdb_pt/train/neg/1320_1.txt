This film was exactly what I expected it to be when I first read the cast. I probably could have written a more exciting storyline, it's a shame they left for a Howler Monkeys package. Alberto Tomba was certainly a good skier, but he has to thank God (and us too) that he does not have to rely on his acting skills to make a living. He can not play, he can not talk, he can not even move very well on the continent without his skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl, and that's all. She was obviously not chosen for her amazing competence in dramatic roles, but probably for her beautiful legs. However, I must admit that she could be Tomba's acting teacher because he's even a worse actor than she is, and that's funny, especially considering she's not Italian. I laughed all the time watching this movie. I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it really made me laugh, loud, very loud.
