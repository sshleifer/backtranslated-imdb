What else can I say? The performance was, almost without exception, amateur. The direction and continuity were pitiful. The sceenplay was predictable until the last scene and the dialogue was boring. One of the DVD's features was labeled "Gag Reel," but that might have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things was in the director's comments about the movie. the DVD. He said with a serious face that he set out to make a film with high production values ​​and a name - and that he had succeeded. With such illusions, it's easy to understand how the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect has been the monster. The darkwolf suit was a modified monkey jumpsuit (by the 'making of' feature on the DVD) and it looked like it. The mask and claws were a little better than any costume shop. The CGI effects were painfully obvious and of a quality similar to a cheap video game.
