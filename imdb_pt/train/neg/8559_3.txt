"It's hard to describe how exciting it is to make a relationship like drama, with pornographic scenes played for example, and stir up controversy and make us more like money and stuff." - Ellen, the lost quote. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, like, no, taste, mouth and things" is like the best artistic effort, as already done. Watching how Ellen's hairy arms and how Chris was masturbating was like the pinnacle of my experience of watching movies and things like that. But before I enjoy starting how to break new US-20-something-airhead albums with my "enjoy", let me just briefly list how the highlights of the party look: 1 Chris doing the writing with his genitals. And not only that: the way the camera (so elegantly guided by Ellen and Patrick) rewards the viewer with a full-screen picture of Chris's fat stomach after he finishes non-Catholic action - that was really exciting. I can in all honesty say I've never seen such grace. Chris, you should do more of these scenes in your upcoming movies, because that's exactly what we needed as a continuation of that bright and brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95", began. A quickie and then a hairy belly, fat and white: what else can a spectator ask for? Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch Chris ejaculate (despite the fact that I'm straight) ... Such poetry in motion. Such elegance, such style. No less than total, divine inspiration went into filming this sequence - plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not get any more spiritual than that. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's thick, thick arms. The camera's unsteady close-ups, so cleverly photographed by our two cinematographers (I can not emphasize enough), Ellen and Patrick, often caused confusion about proper identification of the sex in question. There were several scenes where we would see a part of a body (a leg, an arm or a foot), but often it was a guessing game: does this part of the body belong to a man or a woman? Of course, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and whatsername, launched on purpose, because their bodies were ideal to create this gender-based confusion. Sometimes it was difficult to guess if someone was seeing a female or male leg. Patrick is very skinny and effeminate in his movements, so hairless and untouched, while Ellen and the other girl are very thin, with their thick legs and arms. Bright. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way that fits perfectly with the theme of role reversal between the sexes: so absolutely original and mind-boggling. Ellen behaves like a man, wants sex all the time, while her ex-Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellen's quest for a leftist companion. "He must love 'The Simpsons,' which is rather leftist." I'm glad the producers of this movie have decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent lefties. Ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change. The number of "tanned" she and her liberal friends can say in less than 80 minutes is really phenomenal (3,849, to be exact). They have managed to realistically transfer their real-life ineptitude onto the big screen with a minimum of effort, and I applaud them for it. <br /> <br /> 5. The close-ups of the toes. Plenty here for fetishists, which I think is a very liberal and highly commendable way of reaching sexual minorities. After all, the fetishists of shoes and feet are so little offered in modern cinema, so it's good to see that someone out there cares. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather, KLOTLMAS, offers more than meets the eye. It's not just a modest film about shallow people engaged in empty relationships as they engage in meaningless conversations. No, it's much more than that. It is on the light that guides all foolish creatures; the guiding light that dominates the futile life of several pseudo-artistic aspirants who have just dropped out of film school and plan to attack our senses with stupid nonsense that hopefully will do well at pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes, allowing them to gain exposure therefore needed some real money for a change, with which they will hire the likes of Sean Penn and George Clooney in promoting the economy of this planet and in solving ALL the political problems that this world faces. What better way to do this than by doing pornography right from the start? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen made the camera here, as is clearly indicated in the final credits, then who held the camera while the two were in front of it? They probably hired some passers-by and shoved the camera into their hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8, and check out my "TV & Cinema: 150 Worst Cases From The List of nepotism.
