This movie is so bad that it simply defies reality. Filming is at best school material, acting is pathetic and the director must be banished from film production forever anyway. So bad that it can not even be seen as comedy as something along the lines of Showgirls. The only thing this DVD had was the cover art. <br /> <br /> All I can write for those who have not had the misfortune to witness this is please do a well-deserved favor in advance and do not waste your time or your money on this piece. of trash. If you want to see a movie for the aspects of comedy, there are many more worthy in such a kingdom than this rubbish.
