The only real highlight in the movie is the crying kid's death and the reaction of the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> In all other respects, this movie is a very unpleasant crime of Jaws, Lake. Placid and Alligator, with a bit of Godzilla (1998). <br /> <br /> As is standard for a 1990s horror movie, the two non-starring women strip their clothes at least once. . The female lead does not, since she obviously has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie involves filming a really silly radical sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters. In this movie, a giant saltwater crocodile is also in the area. People are eaten. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I do not care about a bad horror movie, but I really hate a bad horror movie, which it definitely is.
