There's a good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's butt! Sorry to be so frank, but it's the truth. Too bad she did not do a nude. At least it would have made this mess bearable. We see another girl's boobs, but she's not even close to Lola. And man, Armand Assante is old or what? The man looks like crap! "Consequence" is the usual B-Movie you'd expect. History had potential. It's as if they have good ideas, but they do not know how to execute them. Cinematography is simply awful. Ugly! The direction is uninspired and the end result is a dull suspense with weak twists and destroyed actors. Lola Gaudini is as good as the fox in a cheap and mean-spirited way, but not even she saves "consequence" from being junk and not funny junk, just smelly junk.
