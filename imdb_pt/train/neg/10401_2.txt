Dear dear dear dear dear ... I! I had the strength to see through it ... But why?! <br /> <br /> The first two films were fun and really good. But this is so bad that we had trouble seeing the whole thing. This was a kind of quake for the kids. I can not believe this movie was made at all times. It looks like the props were taken out of some sort of western series (for kids) and they did what they could with that. <br /> <br /> Audience is this movie for? I can only think about 12-14 years old. If you are over 14, you will have serious problems with this film. It's not just slow, but it's very annoying. The characters are exaggerated (and not just a bit too) and so stereotypical is fun for a while ... but not enough not to make you want to toss tomatoes on the screen. You know everything that's going to happen too, because yes ... you've seen a billion times in any series of heroes on children's TV. I chose all the survivors and all the forced tremor in the second the characters were introduced. It's so bad ... so wrong ... so ... crap. <br /> <br /> But, OK, we have fun once in a while. Not just in silly holes, but in some scenes where a replay or two is worth ... or a scene that is, where two small tremors plunge into one of the obvious fires ... It really is a great scene that made us Repeat repeatedly and laugh with all my heart. It still makes me smile when I think about it. But that only happened once again, unfortunately ... and that's when the gunslinger "fod√£o" appears and exaggerates his part wonderfully ... this is a comment "They spring from the ground like a DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point we almost cried with laughter. But after that..nothing could ever get over this .. (?) .. so it's practically downhill from there. <br /> <br /> So the tops here are demonic trout and exaggerations. If someone tells you that this is a good movie ... it is a "plant", vegetable or someone very evil. This movie has to be the worst of the tremors by far. Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, it's likely to be box office success compared to this ... this ... * shivers * no ... I'll leave it at that.
