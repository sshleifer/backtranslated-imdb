The story of the movie was as simple as its morality: go find a girl, marry her, live with her happily ever after. Although the film had good times and twists, most remained on the surface of what could have been shown in a movie with the same plot. <br /> <br /> The Baptist / Mormon battle was barely touched superficially and was mocked, probably intentionally. A more interesting story would have been a mixed couple. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a film that does not need a lot of concentration, it can be seen by the whole family and it teaches your kids to be modest and conservative. values ​​(in addition to the modern tolerance material ;-)), you'll be fine with this movie. Can be displayed in a family home evening ...
