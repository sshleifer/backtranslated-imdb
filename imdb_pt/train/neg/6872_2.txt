This show had very good stories but bad dialogue. The main character was especially annoying. It's pretty obvious why this show was canceled, though, like most UPN shows, I never knew it existed until it was being reissued. <br /> <br /> Most graphics seem to have been copied from other programs. and movies, leading me to think that the producers did not have an original idea in their heads. <br /> <br /> I did not comment enough. You have to have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for a 2001 concert. The gnome was a cool character.
