boring things we got here. Your 5-minute shorts are better than that. do you know why? because there are only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long this is. <br /> <br /> The plot is kind of ... uh .. the last half hour is fine, the rest is boring and not funny = (I had my hopes, the trailer made it look funny, but the pace of this The movie is very slow and unfortunately it's not funny, it's just a boring klaymen bumping up and trying to make us laugh .. not working. Maybe next time knox. <br /> <br /> Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing, but for now it's not good.
