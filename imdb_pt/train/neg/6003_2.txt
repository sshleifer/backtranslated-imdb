Sundown - featuring the weakest and meanest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most difficult and pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane the vampire, every move and word spoken was so ridiculous that I laughed half the time and rolled mine eyes the rest. <br /> <br /> Vampires do not seem to have any special power - except for strength (sometimes), being able to turn off a lamp with their mind (once) and .. that's it, really. Ever imagined telling Dracula worriedly backing off a fight because he ran out of bullets? Me neither. Virtually any other Dracula movie would eat this for breakfast, skin their followers and use their bones like toothpicks. The main plot of the film is that a human family of four is caught in a vampire gang fight - Dracula Vs. some old old men. It could have been good B-flick fun, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this film a little seriously, and ends up ruining the rest of the movie that has not yet been ruined by mud sticks, mediocre acting and the laughable script. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's too silly to be funny. Of course, there are some fun moments, but they are few and far between.
