It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers' work may be disappointed by this, his latest endeavor. But surely any fan of Sellers will delight in all his films, simply because of the enormous talent of the man. and Dr. Fu Manchu's The Fiendish Plot is certainly no exception. Unfortunately, that would prove to be Sellers' latest film, (it was even released after his death), but it's still good to see how the man managed to keep his talent irreplaceable until his untimely death. And not only do we get a salesperson, but we do, as Sellers plays not only the title role, but also his rival, the equally bizarre Nayland Smith, the detective in the hunt for 168-year-old Fu. The story is equally weird as we follow Fu's outrageous antics to make his old challenger elixir and also Nayland and his group of associates trying to stop him. Like any of the larger Sellers films, the film comes with impeccably guaranteed performance from him, as well as many of his well-known colleagues - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a movie. few. It's also cool to see Pink Panther's brave Burt Kwouk (Cato) enjoying a cameo with Sellers - despite playing the same but still legal role. The story is really ridiculous, as are many of the characters involved, which classifies this as a movie heavily influenced by Goon. And although it never reaches the heights of Goon's comedy, there are many funny jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The film failed commercially in its initial release due to worldwide mourning after Sellers' death (the film was released less than 3 weeks later) and there is always that sad thought lurking in the back of his mind to see it as that. latest movie. It's far from a great movie - it's often slow, ridiculous too, and sometimes the jokes are simply not there - but nonetheless it's enjoyable - even if just for another Peter Sellers maximum rate performance.
