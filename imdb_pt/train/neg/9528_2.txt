There is a lot of talk about torture these days. That's all this movie is. It's about a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. From then on, it's a just-for-kicks attack on him. I do not know at what point you do something about it. There is a wife and child somewhere; He has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there must have been times when he might have acted. The movie seems to be somebody's joke. I suppose in the wake of the Manson murders, we had a bit of fixation on the tastes of those two. However, why would anyone make such a movie? What appeals do you have, except for sadism? The conclusion is totally unsatisfactory, but this could have been remedied with an evident reversal in history. Oh well. Another hour and a half of my life.
