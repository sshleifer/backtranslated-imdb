I do not think any player in Hollywood history has lasted as long as David Niven has given most of the weak films he had to carry for his incredible charm. He could act, win an Oscar for it, but most of the material he made was as light as a two-layered tissue. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a good example. It's a musical and, for the most part, you remember Vera-Ellen's dance. You will remember that they are in the costume of Scot while the film takes place in Edinburgh during the festival. But if you can remember a single song from her, you should have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is light. Vera-Ellen is the American protagonist in a musical that is apparently being tested in Edinburgh. It starts in the chorus and runs late one day. She gets a ride from the driver of a millionaire king. Everyone now assumes that she is the main squeeze of the millionaire. Doors open like never before. <br /> <br /> The millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by error. Cesar Romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical. <br /> <br /> After all, Happy Go Lovely is a light and harmless fluff that David Niven did so much and got so tired.
