Okay, I remember watching the first one and the kid sucked. After watching it, I just laughed and said to myself, "Oh boy, just one more low-budget B movie. I'll never see a part 2 for this one." Then, about 1 1/2 years later, came part two. He sucked even more. But, I just laughed again and said, "There's no way I can see a part 3 this time." Then about half a year later, part 3 left. I was stupid enough to rent and boy, I just popped in after watching. God, I've never realized how much movies can suck these days. Just save $ 7.50 and do not rent the whole series. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
