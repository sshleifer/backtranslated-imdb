I saw this movie last month in a free preview and I left. It was very awful. In the process of trying hard, they acted and made a horrible movie. I was disappointed, as I felt that all the actors had made respectable choices in the past, so this could not be that far - but, I was wrong. I was hoping they would do a search at the end of the movie so I could tell them not to release this movie. I was drawn to the free preview aspect, but it turned out to be a waste of my time - and I usually enjoy it very easily. He tried to be innovative and creative with the images, ideas and footage, but because they put together so many ideas at once, he failed. I'm not usually picky about movies and I usually do not feel the need to show my opinions about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to watch them. I registered on IMDb just to tell you all
