When I caught a glimpse of the title I thought we'll have another anal slasher, but in fact I found "7eventy 5ive" a bit passable, and almost a setback of 80s after a tediously slow mid-section it takes momentum to half-hour final leading to the scandalously tacky climax and even ending with the end. He will not win prizes for originality because it is as systematic as you can get and steals your thunder in the form of thrills (local cheap scares), location (secluded mansion) and motivation of other movies. The glittering direction is by-the-book and the material is rather banal with poorly done red herring within its elaborate plot and fragile script. At times it was laughable, but I still amused myself mainly because of its brutal and dire acts of violent violence against some annoyingly unpleasant college students by a psychotic assassin with a battle ax. The performances were not bad in the form of a young brave cast, however, the characters they were portraying were not particularly attractive. An ever-present Rutger Hauer appears in a short supporting role as a gray-haired detective. A slickly made, but a superficial and forgettable addition to the fold.
