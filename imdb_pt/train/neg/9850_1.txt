I felt brain dead, I'll tell you. This is the worst movie I ever bought. (in my ignorance, I thought this was the Peter Jackson movie of the same name). The performances are so terrible that they are laughable. The special effects have not stood the test of time and look terrible. The script promotes this type of TV movie, look at the type of acting in the middle distance. The cast seems to have taken lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they look at each other and they do. Also, I was never confused with a movie until I sat down to watch it. It's a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration settles in a few minutes. Avoid like a plague.
