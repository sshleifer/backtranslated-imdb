I had high hopes for this movie, despite having a bad review in the newspaper. I was extremely tolerant and sat throughout the movie. I felt very sick in the end. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not at all a bit prude or particularly sensitive to unflavored cinema - I really enjoyed "All You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex" by Woody Allen. 'and' Funny Games' by Michael Hanneke - I found the directors obsession with this ten-year-old girl who wants to drink the milk of women totally nauseating. And when the movie reached its climax in an orgy where the boy drinks both his mother's milk and the woman he has coveted throughout the film, I almost vomited with disgust at the total perversion and sentimentality that does not get me wrong , I like the vast majority of European cinema, as well as films made independently, so this film should have pleased me enormously. Avoid this movie at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of history as a bad movie lesson.
