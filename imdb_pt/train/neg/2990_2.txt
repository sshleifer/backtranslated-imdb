Ohhh dude! Now that's what I'm talking about! In regards to bad / flamboyant horror films, this movie was really of its own kind. A real gem! <br /> <br /> First, the film was not originally in English. Okay, because the voice dubbing was really exceptional! Here's my favorite dialogue excerpt (and there's a lot more where it came from)? "I'm feeling a little better, I'm thirsty, FOR YOUR BLOOD!" <br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here is a summary of the interaction between the military and scientists? <br /> <br /> Scene 1? Scientist: "You can not do this? It's going to be a disaster!" - Military officer: "This is just science fiction" (he then goes on to cause a complete disaster, as the scientist predicted). <br /> <br /> Scene 2 ?? Scientist: "If you do, many people will die !!!" - Military officer: "you do not know what you're talking about." (he does this and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Do not do this? It's going to kill everyone!" - Military officer: "This is absurd" (he then starts killing everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (you get the idea). <br /> <br /> If that were not enough? There were some scenes that really stood out as instant classics! In one scene, the military has literally 10 guys aiming guns at two unarmed men. The leader shouts, "Go get them!" and all 10 guys in the army, one at a time, drop their weapons and fight the two opponents! Instant Classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. No attention to detail was left out! This movie still had a 80's keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood! <br /> <br /> And trust me? I realize that this review may contain some spoilers, but there are so many surprises in this epic that I just scratched the surface. A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade! A true movie watching experience! A masterpiece! Wow!!
