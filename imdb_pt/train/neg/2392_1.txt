We actually watched it twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we had lost something ... no, what is missing has been lost since the beginning of pre-production. In fact, I went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and found that what I found funny and exciting in the past is now a garbage pile disconnected and confusing. <br /> So the initial problem with the movie was deciding to do it, and the rest of the train disaster progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - it is not a blessed thing. Some beautiful outdoor photographs are butchered by the random placement of the camera in internal photos. All the actors seem at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson seems positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too unconscious to realize how awful her performance really is. Dialogue is a long and unshakable shudder. Scenes make no sense from the second to the second, and the connections between them are non-existent. And yet, the film stumbles blindly, convinced that it is saying something profound. <br /> <br /> This is too bad even to be funny; is simply excruciating. Gus Van Zant made other good movies that I recommend you to see, and I'm glad he survived (and seems to have learned) with this mess.
