What an empty and lackluster version of the classic novel. I wish people would stop messing with the classics when they clearly have no idea of ​​the actual intent or point of the original. This version is no different. I felt that the version of Ralph Fiennes is much worse, since the cast of Juliette brioche as Kathy has to be the worst pitch decision EVER ... anyway, back to this version. The goal is to make history relevant to a contemporary setting and a musical style. It happens in both, but art is nit. The view from the disposable to a rainy day, maybe ... The direction was average and the issue abysmal. Worse than old Quincy. Deepak Verma does a great turn as Hindley and is, in fact, one of the wasted talents of Britains. Heath's part was played with a lot of charm and conviction and I think the cast is the strongest point of this project. Although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had. Of course he was a contract director and did not instill the project with the passion he deserved.
