That the reviewers liked this movie surprised me. The plot is a mess. The characters are made of wood. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging them all. No one has any quality of rescue or point of interest. This is not a bold job. It is not imaginative. It's not ironic. It's not smart. There is nothing direct about this tedious job. That's lack of theatrical release is no surprise. That "This Network" goes on the air decreases the location. I would definitely recommend turning over a reprise of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even good information if you found this mess on late night television. If you find it on television during the day, take a long walk. Even if you walk in the smoke, you will feel better for not having suffered with this mess. Life is short. This movie is over.
