...... in a horror movie that is. All right, first let's start with Kate. His main goals include having sex with George Clooney, with good looks and last but not least, fucking everyone. I have to love her. She had about 3 surprisingly good chances to end this sicko but ..... instead she ran. I mean she did not want to bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late. I mean, the guy tried to rape her. I can not get into those movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean, who would honestly have some sympathy for a guy who ends up with everyone she meets one night. The movie kept happening. And as a result, it lost all its credibility.
