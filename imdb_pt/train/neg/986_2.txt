This movie had a rating of 8.1 for IMDB, so I expected a lot more from it. It gets funny and kind with an energy that seems spontaneous. But before the movie is in the middle, it starts to drag on and everything becomes predictable. The office characters were delicious in the first third of the movie, but we know them very well; they become caricatures, not real people. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, just told here with slightly different circumstances. The point is that I could endure another predictable love story if only the dialogue were not so obsolete! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse would be if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with the Office of Dead Letters. I hope this movie ends up in the Dead Movie Office soon.
