Director Kevin Connor and aspiring action / romantic hero Doug McClure join this ghost story in Japan. They have moderated success together in the 1970s, with the likes of 'The Land That Time Forgot' (1975) 'In the Nucleus of the Earth' (1976), etc. Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative though, the results are declined and derived in the most kitschy manner. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a prologue in the 19th century with a samurai husband killing his wife and his lover before committing suicide. An advance to the present introduces the couple Ted & Laura, visiting Japan and moving to the house where the tragedy occurred. <br /> <br /> No surprise as to what happens next, with the spirits of the dead beginning. to take on the newcomers with family friend Alex (McClure) taking on the role of wife's lover. <br /> <br /> Everything snores awkwardly along with the elegance and grace of an elephant, to an inevitable (but surprisingly pessimistic) conclusion. The main points of interest are two weak beheadings ('The Omen' has much to be answered by promoting this as a standard horror piece), and the scenes of making love to the character Susan George, bulging eyes and extremely eccentric. The first is a long 'Do not Look Now' inspired piece with her husband, complete with piano music; the second, a much shorter (probably at her insistence) clash with McClure, both looking very uncomfortable. Anyway, each cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show their fantastic knockers so that everything is not lost. <br /> <br /> In general I can not decide if 'The House where Evil dwells' is garbage, or fun in a masochistic way. If you are not of the genre, there is nothing here, but for the horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the strange smile of rye and recognition of the effort. BEST SCENE - In any other movie, the big, black mechanical crabs that climb trees and mutter Japanese, would have stolen the show. They are eclipsed by the scene of the legendary family meal, where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup. Upon seeing this apparition, she asks what kind of soup is (!!!!), be informed about meat and vegetables, before uttering the immortal line "Ugh - there is a horrible face in my soup." If that was not enough, the answer is "Come on, eat your soup for Daddy." Laurel and Hardy rest in pieces.
