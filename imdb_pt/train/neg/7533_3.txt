The film had some nice aspects. Maybe many for my taste. It was as if the writer / director was desperately trying to make us feel the internal conflict of all his characters. Not once, sometimes ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is the work of television, not cinema. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed the performance of Sascha Horler as the pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt as if Justine Clarke's performance was pale. His reactions to things were forced, as if the director was trying to vocalize the themes of the film through the expressions of its protagonist. I also can not believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci in an unbelievable presence. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the choice of pop music over whole strings. This is a lazy device, especially where pop music comes from no diegetic place for the movie and / or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly serious. <br /> <br /> That said, there is a vivid quality about the film that evokes the Australian warmth and local attitude with originality. It creates an atmosphere of heat and sun. Especially with the use of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and artisanal charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious because the dialogue seems so overwhelmed. "Who knows if there's a god? Like a guy sitting there in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever the line. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments was the return of his cricket friend with a bouquet of flowers to declare to his wife, "I'm quitting smoking." <br /> <br /> A commercial anti-smoking? A TAC ad with some tasteful animation? I had to leave the cinema at the 50-minute mark - it was too much.
