At first glance, this movie has everything a psychopath wants: a vampire story with a restraint under 18 years, full of hyper-violence, drugs, sex, including fanatics and even gay necrophiles. police officer! But then, this movie is a succession of bad stories (so thin), bad performances - with a ridiculous English accent making you believe you're watching a bad Monty Python - bad music (80's hard rock), filming is horrible, the end is a real shame ... In addition, the sex scenes are ridiculous, the blood is not very impressive. And these vampires reflect in a mirror, and they do not even fear the light of day! You are very disappointed, unless you see it as a "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlust will one day reach 100, because that's its true place. <br /> <br /> I'd say it can still be fun to watch if you have enough friends and beer. <br /> 3/10
