Another of the many forgotten films released by Poverty Row in the 1930s, revived by the magic of the DVD. Starring Stock Universal player Lionel Atwill (often supporting actor in several Frankenstein movies) as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket. One kills the victims (brokers involved in a fraud) and asks witnesses for the exact time, while the other is deaf and proved "innocent" because he could not have spoken with witnesses. <br /> <br /> Of course, where it collapses is if it were a congenital deafness, would not both be deaf? Oh well. <br /> <br /> Atwill does a good job here, pretending to be deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no one else here really can be worth it.
