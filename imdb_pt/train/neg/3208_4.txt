This movie was a big disappointment to me. I've been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and I was a loyal follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. Not only did they cut half the plot, but they altered the information. The claim that Lucifer is Hope's father is not true. He has corrupted his father, but he himself is not his father. The voices also do not match with the characters, and once you hear the voice of a loved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I can not even remember everything about this movie that was wrong. The bottom line is that if you love Lady Death, do not watch this movie. Just did not do the comics justice!
