I must admit that I started laughing when I saw a reviewer compare this with the LotR. Well, yes, if you rule out the dwarves, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the great battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the elegant direction and everything. That leaves you with the walk. And man, this movie does it! If Mr. Piano did it his way, it would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the hinterland of Wisconsin, but every forty minutes or so these annoying Martians appear for a few seconds to stop him before he goes to another ride. You have never seen so much floor in a movie. If that really had a budget of $ 20 million, most of it must have been used by Mr Piano because he had to go through many pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there is no money for decent effects, a decent video camera or appropriate actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people who enjoy doing long walks in period costumes. Even in fast-forward, this is a long walk. As for science fiction material, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film: they only hinder the walk, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr. Piano charges to walk with the dogs?
