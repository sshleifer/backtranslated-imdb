There was not a single redeeming factor in this film. The girlfriend and I love action movies. Especially fight scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer was awesome), but this movie was not fun. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of "angry" conversations and facial expressions. The main hero is a troubled character who saw the battle and therefore is forced to appear seriously constipated at all times. The army interrupted their bowel movements upon perfecting their fighting technique. The music is not good either. They fight for the rap and hip-hop style of the streets because these guys are bad guys. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise for low budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is classic B style. The actors deliver their lines as if they were reading from tip cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left lit in some rotten Hollywood alley. The film is called "Honor", but there was no honor in making this film. It was simply a waste of money, and spending wisely is something I consider honorable. <br /> <br /> Go see Felon instead. The fight scenes and situations are more real.
