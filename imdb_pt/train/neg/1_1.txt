Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so lavish of talents, it's truly disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialogue is unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself and is not funny. The film moves in the rhythm of a snail, is photographed in a reckless way and is unbearably boring. It also connects to all the clich√©s in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what? <br /> <br /> Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for each review. When a movie is useless, it does not take ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
