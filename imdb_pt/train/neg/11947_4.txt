An interesting change from the first. there was more mystery in this film than the first. Even when you end up wondering what happened who was the killer. There are some good parts in the movie, the first part starts slowly and then in the last half the pace increases. The whole movie is nice. The story is 22 years after the events that occurred in the first film, Norman Bates is out of an asylum and back to Bates's motel, but when a woman appears claiming to be his real mother, things start to go wrong. Perkins plays an old Norman again and the scene at the end was excellent, he shook that shovel with force.
