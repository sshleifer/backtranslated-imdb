Steve Carpenter can not do horror movies. First of all, the cast was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was the hot-haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This movie has no blood (usually a key ingredient for a horror movie), no action, no acting and no suspense (also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he is so dry and simple in that it is sad. There were some parts that should be funny (continuing the teen horror / comedy movies) and no one laughed in the audience. I thought this movie was rated R, and I did not pay attention and realized that it was changed to PG-13. Anyway, watch this movie if you like it I still know what you did last summer. This is the only kind of person who would find this movie remotely scary. And seriously, this is for you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like the Saw Massacre.
