This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have looked at him mainly for a morbid curiosity since I loved the novel, and I wish I had not. I hung up after a little less than an hour, although I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I want to have. He disregards the romance a lot and changes all sorts of factors. Unless the movie could redeem itself in the last 50 minutes (which would be impossible), I would not recommend it. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. I do not think, as many people say, that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily unfilmable, but this specific interpretation could have been made without. I almost would like to see it one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice.
