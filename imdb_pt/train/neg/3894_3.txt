The Incredible Melting Man plays as an extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nudity. I know this movie is a bit stinky, but I found it impossible not to like it. <br /> <br /> The acting and the script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30-year movie with a budget of $ 50 - the title character takes a long time to actually melt, but when it does it's fairly impressive; we also have an inventive death scene involving electrocution. Music is also noteworthy, it is madness - a mixture of cheese blunders. <br /> <br /> Remarkable Highlights: <br /> <br /> Marvel at the slow-moving nurse who jumps across a glass panel for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> * Surprise yourself with a day in the life of a severed head. <br /> * Beware of the psychotic cannibal fusion humanoid. Called Steve. <br /> * Be surprised when our hero takes a break from hunting the melted lunatic to take a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This movie is only 70 years old so I hate it. It's tacky and useless, but I thought it was a lot of fun. You could have done worse.
