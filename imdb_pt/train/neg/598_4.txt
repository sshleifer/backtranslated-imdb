Please be warned: this movie, despite being a really bad story, was one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen ... NEVER. Just remember that before you sit on the couch to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> So, it officially starts with a party. Just your average party, but there's a guy there. He's very good at Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Memorize your face; will help later. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Kate will meet George Clooney (did not I say the plot was bad?) and then pick up the tube. This is underground London in the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. So the schedule says the next and last train will arrive in 7 minutes. Now Kate, stupid girl that she is, decides she can take a nap in the remaining 7 minutes. Normally, she misses the train and is locked in the London subway. Alone. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie is still there. Blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body that I will not mention are cut, cut and eventually amputated from the body. <br /> <br /> In short, it is a typical horror; beautiful but thick maiden in afflicted women and strange, sick psycho. Or, as may be the case, Creep. <br /> <br /> I'd say go if you're in Saw, Hostel or the Chainsaw Massacre, but for the rest of us, yell with satisfaction. Horror needs a lot of thanks.
