An average quality of movies on TV, a story entirely of religious fanatics (Ron Perlman, who does good "I'm not only the president of 'Psychos R Us', I'm also a customer") who gets control of a biochemical virus (think of the virus in the movie "The Rock"). Too bad for him that he too gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and government agents trying to stop him (led by the impressively physically entertaining Wolf Larson, backed by Fred Dryer) along with the standard "in the wrong place at the wrong time "brave woman (the always bland Erika Eleniak) and" lived like a coward, but died as a hero at the last minute "male (Brandon Karrer). It has the background background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic (wife and son killed in a police raid some years ago). <br /> <br /> Basically a decent rainy day movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite phrase, spoken by Ron Perlman after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in Erika Eleniak's cleavage: "A woman and her mystery." <br /> <br /> Worth a rental.
