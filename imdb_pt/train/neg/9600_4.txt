Very strange but occasionally elegant exploration film, with no real history but benefiting from its sweeping leading actress and a handful of pleasant and macabre makeup effects. Daniella is a beautiful girl in her twenties, carrying the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her to believe that she is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who claimed to be a werewolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a nightly meeting and is taken to a hospital. She escapes again, however, and randomly devours more men as she runs to police detectives, doctors and relatives. It's all very beautiful to see and hear too (really great soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity become annoying quickly. Luckily, the protagonist Annik Borel rarely wears clothes and fills the flat moments dancing naked around a campfire. The movie is too long, too weird and forgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and unexpectedly, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his film was based on real facts. Okay, right...
