Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please, please, never let him drive again. Timing, rhythm, editing: all hopelessly wrong. <br /> <br /> Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, get off the set <br /> <br />) can not do anything to save this amateur movie like Alice <br /> < > Evans, and the kind of production patterns you'd expect from children's shows produced on British TV. <br /> <br /> Biggest mystery: music. A score so inept, inappropriate and ill-adapted to the tone of the film that seriously questionable if it is a case of sabotage. Add a seemingly unengineered acoustic blast from a single microphone, and a director who only remembers to intermittently add the audible action off the screen, and we have the which should be in the highest proportion of money for the result of recent years.
