Although slightly more polished technically than the previous film in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weaker getaway in both a less thrilling plot and a protagonist who simply does not have the charisma of Ray Milland. <br /> <br /> That said, several actors and characters remain in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. Also John Barrymore is present, appearing throughout the film in a variety of strange disguises. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's another endless night for BD as he and his teammates chase after trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. The clues are stupid, but supporting actors often make them fun.
