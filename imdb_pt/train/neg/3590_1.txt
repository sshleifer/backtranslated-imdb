How low can anyone sink while trying to recapture an old glory? ST: HF will be happy to show you. <br /> <br /> If you're used to seeing what made a good Star Trek show, DO NOT watch it. <br /> <br /> -podge, the portraits of the actors of their weak characters, and most of all, the design work is downright doggy. <br /> <br /> How to watch strong captains, do not look here! Like the strong stance of the Federation? Forget it here! The Starfleet is mocked by lieutenants using SPIKES in their hair. <br /> <br /> While a seemingly mentally weak captain shuffles and two minutes after the opening credits, Ensign Spikey is trying to arrange a meeting with an engineer. It just degrades from there. No, no uniforms match, for God's sake. They are either too small or too large, collars to the chest, and TNG Seasons One and Two uniforms mixed with the season three and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the missing originals in this production up the steps! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve a bit each season. Okay, I'll take that back. Who uses CG that inexperienced? The designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it, it will offend your sense of Star Trek, like mine. Not even setbacks to previous shows can save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> I cried openly when I saw this, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost broke. How bad.
