I got a copy of this movie thinking it was the 1964 movie with 'Zombie Bloodbath' as ​​one of its alternative titles. Perversely, this movie actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other is very bad! This movie is very bad too; obviously you can not get into a movie called 'Zombie Bloodbath' and expect to see a masterpiece, and in fact it lives up to the title with the amount of blood on display ... but everything looks very old and tired, which is not helped by the atrocious atrocity and stupid plot. It's just your average nuclear spill that causes people to turn into zombies etc etc. The film begins with a sequence that sees people melt away and almost lets you know what's coming; low quality zombie junk. There's a lot of blood in the movie, and it's a good job, otherwise the movie would have been very annoying. Zombie Bloodbath looks very cheap too, and was clearly created by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seemed to be Romero's Day of the Dead, although it could be almost anything that had zombies and blood. It all comes down to a typically predictable and useless ending and overall I can not say I was impressed by it!
