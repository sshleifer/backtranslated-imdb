Yes I saw the gross cuts. The unedited sex scenes. The terrible cut scenes. Almost on par with the movie 'The Need' for a horrible performance. This movie is as bad as the bad movies. The bad script, the bad interpretation, the bad effects, the bad places, the bad scenes, everything bad. The best 'actors' in the movie were the colored dancers they hired for the vampire extras! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, the 'foppish actor', as someone put it, makes a matchstick look talented here. His incredible ability to drive a car badly, when he is obviously being shaken by people on the hood (check the reflection in the windshield), his inability to turn left, which is class. Oh and do not forget the sex scene. plus the remarkable use of a toy gun that the guys could not even bother disguising as a real weapon. The other actors on the screen could barely deliver their speeches. It was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that was not there! <br /> <br /> The 'special effects' were soooo good to such an extent that the guys who did this got their real names off the credits! <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh at a party, rent this movie ... then again, there are many good comedies that are funny and fun. Do not give money to people who do not deserve it.
