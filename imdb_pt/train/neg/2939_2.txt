As others have said, "No, Luciano" is a more appropriate title or a response to the title of the film. For entertainment, the great opera singer should stay singing ..... not that he is a terrible actor. It's just that this movie stinks. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were good - a good family movie, so to speak - but after that it's nothing more than a boring novel. Appropriately interpreting a singer, Pavarotti, as "Giorgio Fini", loses his voice a few times and the doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer then falls in love with the doctor, the doctor slowly falls in love with the singer, the two argue all the time and so on. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a nice guy. It is Harrold who spoils things and after seeing her here, it does not surprise me that she has not become a star. <br /> <br /> There are good landscapes in the movie to enjoy, good pictures of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I was bored and did not remember much about the second half of it.
