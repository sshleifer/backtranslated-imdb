Why do all Lifetime movies have such anemic titles? "Unexpected love" - ​​ooh, how provocative !! "That I know" would have been better. The movie is nothing special. Real people do not really talk like these characters and the situations are really banal. The heterosexual woman who "turned" lesbian seemed more temper tantrum than the lesbian character. If you want to watch two hot women kissing in a very discreet manner, you may like this. Although it looks like it was written by someone who does not really go out of the world to observe people. Why am I wasting my time writing about it?
