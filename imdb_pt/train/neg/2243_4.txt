It does not even deserve a review, except as a warning to potential visitors. It's a rather generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio during the filming of a WWII drama. There is no fear involved, no suspense, no surprises. A shocking moment that seems a bit silly to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and monotonous, although there are some really interesting issues from time to time. The story never comes together, and the movies are really just a total failure. 4/10
