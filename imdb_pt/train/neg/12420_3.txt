There simply is not enough here. There are some funny points, but not enough. I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I was hoping this would be a hidden gem. WAS NOT. It was a hidden shit. <br /> <br /> The whole time I was watching I was thinking, "Gee, I could do better than that and I'm an idiot." Do not believe the few good comments. I was sucked in by them. At no point did I laugh out loud. Maybe this was funny or groundbreaking in 1987, but man, it completely fell out today. This movie was promising, it simply did not deliver. Maybe if they rewrote a few more times. I can not blame the actors. They were not the best, but they simply did not have much to work with. This movie failed because of the wrinkled writing. SORRY disappointed.
