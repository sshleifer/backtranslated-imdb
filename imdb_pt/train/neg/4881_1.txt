This is the dullest piece of shit I've ever missed an hour of my life. All I can say is thank God it was only an hour. More than half of this "movie" is filming of the original "Criminally Insane". At the very least, I was able to see the highlights of this rare exploration classic, because for some reason that defies reality, my video store has only "Criminally Insane II" (as it happened, "Crazy Fat Ethel II"). But the rest of this movie is one of the worst home-video and backyard movies you'll ever see. Why does my rental company have this and not the original? Why do things like this end up in video stores? Why do people rent and do not immediately burn the copy once they have seen their horror? Why God why? <br /> <br /> Unless you enjoy seeing annoying fruits eating a whole bar of chocolate in a painfully slow scene, or the fruit being hung on the banister of the stairs in an even slower scene, or a character being stabbed laterally (do not ask) several times in the back, or monologues that kill brain cells about giving poisoned tea to the wife and then complain that the whole conversation made the tea itself cold, or the mentally retarded eating fly soup, or simply wants to see Ethel Fat Fat Dance with a Bloody Knife in a Garden: Do not watch this movie. Repeat: DO NOT watch this movie. Do not rent this movie. If possible, do not go through a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie setting. You can still be saved, but now it's too late for me. . .
