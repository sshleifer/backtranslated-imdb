"Kids Like These" could have been a decent movie, given the subject. But instead, it became a TV movie of the week below average, without much for him. The performance is obsolete, the plot predictable and the direction non-existent. For a better film on the same subject, try the excellent "Le Huiti√®me Jour," a film that really cares about people with Down syndrome. In "Kids Like These" they are only used as an excuse for tearful sentimentality. Very shocking. 1/10
