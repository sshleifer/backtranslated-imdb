This is one of the worst sl slashers I've ever seen in my life. The end is something you have to see to believe. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing seated on the stairs with the mother watching her father come down the chimney while wearing a Santa Claus outfit. He puts the gifts under the tree, eats the cookies and milk, and then goes back to the chimney. Phillip goes to bed, but Harry descends only to find his father dressed in a Santa Claus outfit sexually pleased for his mother. Then Harry climbs the stairs, crushes a snow globe, takes a piece of glass and cuts himself. <br /> <br /> So you move on to the present. You see Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps in a Santa Claus outfit and watches small children through a pair of binoculars. He has two books. One book for good boys and one book for bad boys. He writes everything they do in these books. The guy's an idiot. He also works at the Jolly Dream toy factory. His brother Phillip has a family and two children and lives in a beautiful house. <br /> <br /> When Harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits, he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to some children. . So he travels to a church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and places presents under the tree. The children pick it up, but go back to bed. So Harry goes to the bedroom and kills his father and leaves. <br /> <br /> As he walks toward a house, a bunch of boys see him and run to him. Parents are nervous and try to get their children to come back to them so they do not get hurt. How do they know that Harry is the killer? Of course, you have to be wary because you never know who you are. Harry gives gifts to the children and his father picks up an exchange blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry runs away, the town lights up and follows him to kill him. They do not even know he's the killer. When Harry arrives at his brother's house, his brother and he talk and Phillip strangles him. He only loses consciousness. Phillip carries Harry back to his van. When Harry wakes up, he pulls off. <br /> <br /> The ending is something I could not believe. Once again, you will have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that bothered me was the black Santa Claus. That's right, the man in Santa suit they saw was a white man. So why did they bring a black man? <br /> <br /> Skip this and see Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa's Slay. You will get your money's worth seeing these two movies. They're better than this pile of rubbish! I give this movie a star of 10. I wish I could give it 0 stars because that's what this movie deserves.
