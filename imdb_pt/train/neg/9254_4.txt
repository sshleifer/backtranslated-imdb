Resnais, wow! The genius that brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colors. The opening of the voice-over with old and embellished titles was a nice touch. Then the camera aperture opens (like the old tool holders) in a black and white poster. The camera backs up (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly bright colors of an elegant table set for a tea party. That's all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the song begins. A rather banal and forgettable, with a little convincing chorus of 3 girls chattering with some absurdity that has no relevance to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame the subtitles). These characters come out the door and are replaced by more people who break an even more forgettable song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first sensible dialogue 15 minutes from the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resnais intended, starting with such a huge and musical waste of time. cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to fling skittles on the screen and leave the scene. I put up with it. <br /> <br /> It did not get much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We do not even see their faces half the time (as Resnais seems very intent on showing the expensive scenario to worry about the real people in front of the camera). People fly in and out of the stage like moths around a lamp, and we, the public, can not concentrate on any particular person or plot. It's like you pick up every episode of Brady Bunch and put it in a two-hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me watching while I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at the camera techniques, lighting and landscapes that were all, I admit, excellent. But is that enough to hold your attention for two hours? I do not. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to watch the ending. Oh, who am I kidding? I have more important things to do. I'm sure you will too. Skip this.
