One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting was terrible for both children and adults. Most of the characters did not show small or insufficient emotion. The lighting was terrible, and there were many problems with the time of day that the movie was filmed. (At the river scene where they just destroyed the boat, there are 4 shots, the sheriff and father at night on their boat, Jillian and Molly at night swimming, the rest of the children during the day * when it is expected at night * at the river bank, and the doctor, Beatrice and Simonton at night, but not at night, getting off the boat. of the sheriff, Cappy (though, there is a character slide when the pulse detector * Whatever it is when people die, it whistles * shows Cappy died, it still moves while still can Can be heard a beep, and while the extra nurse checks his wrist manually, he shows the wrist again, and then he finally dies.) I think it will not be perfect, since it's an independent movie, but it could still be better. , even for children. You can also watch something bo m such as The Lion King or Toy Story if you will see anything you remember.
