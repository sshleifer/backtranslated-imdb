This movie is undoubtedly the worst horror movie I have ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen things like that, like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can tell by my username, this really stands out. Sometimes there is nothing more fun than a badly made horror movie. As for this movie, the opening scene in which a woman is fried in a tanning booth seems to have no influence on the film, especially since the film does not tell her that the event happened two years before the rest of the film. Performance is non-existent, and most camera outlets are shrunken female areas wrapped in elastane. The cop was the most monotonous actor I've ever seen. The best / worst part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. A giant security pin?! What were they thinking? Who's the killer? A disgruntled employee "Huggies"? I would have to give this movie a total of zero, but I would not dare to watch it
