So I finally saw the movie "My Left Foot" last night, after years of my mother telling me how incredible it was ... Day-Lewis's central performance is in fact remarkable and surprising, but anyone with minimal exposure to other work should expect nothing less. The fatal error of judgment in my eyes was that by becoming obsessed with proving the normality of this man; the film chose to show him as a complete and utter idiot. On the one hand, I can see that this is a logical correlation; mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable, and disability should not obscure it. I just wanted unbiased viewers not to forgive so much for aberrant behavior and to assume circumstances automatically forgive him. They do not. Acting is normal, and so yes, people with disabilities act - but they do not because they are disabled; they do it because they are being irrational. A physical disability does not give you the right to squeal in public just because someone you love turns you down. <br /> <br /> There are certain things that it is unwise to do if you are disabled or capable-bodied. Giving anyone tacit permission to start a football match right in your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them. (Admittedly, I saved a penalty from the school's attacker with my face, but I already belonged by then.) It was not by acceptance.) To participate in a bar fight is another. Disappointment with the fact that your father only gives you companionship after you have proven yourself capable of leaping metaphorically through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far. All these things are stupid, and suffering through them as a way of demonstrating their bravery does not make them less reckless. <br /> <br /> So, yes; just because you have overcome obstacles to achieve great things does not make you less of an idiot ... Being a good person takes priority; The definition of an inspiring example for people with disabilities should appear on the list.
