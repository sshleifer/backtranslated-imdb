David Lynch's crude and rudimentary view of South Park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing cliches about suburban middle-class families. The father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular hole, from which the most horrible guttural noises are uttered, the son and the mother are permanently horrified and incoherent creatures, to whom terror is a way of life. A number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedies (ie, in the air, aspects of Wild at Heart), and I do not really like comedy in general. . However, there were some scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh out loud. There are some clever bits of animated cinematography - where Lynch transmits broad levels of reaction in his characters through a syntactic arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions (which never really vary in Dumbland). <br /> <br /> I believe Lynch was really trying to give her audience a direct, if disturbing, and upbeat comedy here. Curiously, he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low-frontal humor (that is, most of Will Farrell's films), while adding elements of cruel social criticism, classic violence, and crude humor. Although the mix does not work very well here, it's nothing, if not Lynchian. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing by Lynch fans.
