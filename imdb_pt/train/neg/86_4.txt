Like Southern Baptist, it hurts me to have to give a below-average rating for an openly Christian movie. Certainly there are not so many that I want to discourage filmmakers of a genre that is under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that "Love's Abiding Joy" is a typically low-budget, understated, and consciously Christian movie. The plot is predictable, the performance mediocre (I'm being kind) and the edition atrocious. Like a TV movie, it may have been a little above average, but as a film, it leaves a lot to be desired. Keep trying guys. You have to have a movie about real Christians inside you somewhere. May I suggest that you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C.S. Lewis for some inspiration?
