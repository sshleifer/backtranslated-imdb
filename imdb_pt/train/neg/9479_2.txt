This movie looked like it was going to be better than it ended up being. The cinematography is good, the acting seemed solid, the dialogue was not very hard ... but then, about twenty minutes, there is this long scene with a doctor you know is actually a patient in the asylum pretending to be a doctor - and it goes south from there. <br /> <br /> In addition, the demon is similar to the stupidest Hellspawn ever since the Godzilla thing in Curse of the Demon. There are also some strange demon worshipers who wear masks that look like teenagers exploding from the start of Logan's Run. In the end, cinematography failed to save this movie. Despite some pretty solid performances from the actors, the story just is not going anywhere. I think "Hellbored" would have been a better title for that.
