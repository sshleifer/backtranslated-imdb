THHE2 is fun because you laugh a lot and shrink and probably say "oh sh * t!" and "take your face off the damn hole you're idiot" or things like that, but I do not know if it's really worth seeing it - I got really angry all the time with those horrible military characters who do not seem to know the first thing about combat. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, blood and a bigger count than the first, but I'm still debating whether this cancels my feelings throughout the film about how ridiculous it is (and not a good ridicule like Dead Alive or Feast). My time would have been better spent watching Aja's remake for the 5th time. <br /> <br /> So, give yourself a few laughs, or go with some blood, but do not expect to leave satisfied.
