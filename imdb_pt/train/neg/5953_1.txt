How the fuck was on TV for so long? It's terrible. It makes me want to shoot somebody. It's so fake that it's actually worse than a 1940 science fiction movie. I'd rather have a stroke than watch this absurd. I remember watching it when it first came out. I thought, hey, this could be interesting, so I figured out how absolutely, insane and absurdly stupid this really was. It was so bad that I actually grabbed my pocketknife and stuck my hand on the table. <br /> <br /> Please people, stop watching this and all the other reality shows, they are the junk that is blocking the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create.
