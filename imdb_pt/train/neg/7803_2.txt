"The Secretary" is one of those "bickering" clich√©s that someone is likely to watch on a Sunday afternoon, when there is virtually nothing left. While the plot (a demented woman gets jealous of everyone who happens in the office and decides to do what she can to stop them) may be unique, I have recognized countless twists, probably taken from other TV movies I had been submitted for the same reason. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I was not savage about the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many TV movies as a "mother" or some kind of "victim" of abuse or abuse, one must imagine the kind of life she takes. In this, she has the joy of playing a mother AND a victim of psychopathic secretary Sheila Kelly, who was not a good choice as a villain. While Sheila Kelly has made some good career moves (Singles, Breaking In, and I Think, Law and Order), she is also plagued by a number of TV movie roles, and this only adds to that. As for the others, I have no clear recollection of them, so that should say something. <br /> <br /> This will be played on the Lifetime network (I think that's where I've seen it), but do not mind watching, unless you're very bored with the words. Not that this makes you more exciting ...
