The movie was awful. The theater was dead with silence because everyone was ashamed to be there watching this garbage. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and had him run a screenplay with dialogues written by a five-year-old child. Martial arts are "okay," but when put next to the Jackie Chan movies and "The Matrix" you'd better see one of them.
