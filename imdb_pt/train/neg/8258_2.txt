I was fortunate enough to read the book before seeing the movie. It was a teenage epic, a dream from the past summers, a great potential indie film or big budget drama. Somehow he got into the hands of a hack, who clearly took notes watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without actually learning anything. The script loses the book's flesh in favor of forced emotional notes and low-brow jokes. I'm sorry for the actors, since the characters in the book were rich and textured, but cut to embarrassing caricatures in the movie. Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity, as is Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that remains of the story unfolds like a bad one after the special school. Poor people = GOOD, rich people = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although it is almost worth seeing the southern California beach where Gary Sinise parks his trailer, which must pass through a bay in Delaware. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but an embarrassing change for the first time director, Mills Goodloe.
