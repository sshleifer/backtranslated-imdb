This is a weak sequel: they lack the interest and light touch of the magnificent "Man Called Horse" in almost every respect, and when compared to each other, they hardly seem to be the same genre. <br /> <br /> The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different Indian ceremonies, but it seems too difficult to bottle the first one's magic. In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost their homelands, modern life has invaded paradise and they are living in misery and poverty. Maybe this is the point: the first movie took us to a place where we would like to be, a simpler time. This takes us to broken Indians in a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and savior who denies the idea of ​​the movie. The beauty of the first lies in the fact that the white man We learn and discover that true civilization is in values ​​and not in Western materialism. In the second movie that's all, but it's missing and so we end up with a weak movie. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment.
