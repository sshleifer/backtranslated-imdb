This movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that have been put together by the most shameless lunatics who have ever worked on a TV movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this film that accurately portrays Sen. McCarthy. It's just a horrible hoax, and I'm surprised that someone associated with that production got another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote this rubbish did this to attack a man who was vindicated by history and his fear that someone would dare destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist jobs, Ronald Reagan took over where McCarthy stopped and they could not stop him, so the end of the Soviet Union and its "cohorts." <br /> <br /> Never, never watch this movie if you're looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, "Treason," to better see the truth about Senator McCarthy. <br /> <br /> It will also help if you read about what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
