Special effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Terrible. No plot. No depth. Meaningless. This movie made Superman a meaningless hero, a hero with no archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here he represented only one Hulk. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a good choice, among others. <br /> <br /> That still does not solve the problem that this movie had no depth at all. I can not see how anyone can come out with anything significant of this movie when Superman was, and is, daily created to be a significant hero not only in the comic but also in the minds of people. This was a real waste of money considering how many directions this movie could have given. Just a few examples: Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism and so on. is at. He was just another stupid incarnation of Hackman. <br /> <br /> And Superman? Why did he stay in this movie? Nothing but another "savior" figure. <br /> <br /> Wait until you get to the dollar theater, if you can see it.
