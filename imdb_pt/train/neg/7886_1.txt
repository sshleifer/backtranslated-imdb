I have nothing against religious films. Religious people need something to watch on a Saturday night I guess. But what really bothers me is when the write-up on the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. Turning religious propaganda as entertainment is not legal, bro. <br /> <br /> And even if I were a religious person, I would have to agree with most of the other posters here, this movie was a mess. Misdirected, misinterpreted, poorly edited, and the attempt of a soundtrack was hilarious. The false accents were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes and continuity was out the window. The only reason we went through this wasted time was that it was too late to watch another movie. I should have gone to bed. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no redeeming quality for this movie, unless you're a religious type who will immediately endorse anything that preaches your beliefs to unbelievers, even if it's a pile of crap. . If you are not, avoid this at all costs. Do not be fooled by the box description.
