I just can not believe the number of people comparing this favorably with the first movie. Moved me to leave this review! This is just an obvious attempt to profit from the success of the first film. The dialogue is shocking and nothing so authentic or compelling as the original movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the picture of the French police laughable and the characterization of Doyle a mile away from the first film. How many drug bosses do you think go to the docks in person to see a shipment come in? The ease with which Doyle finds his face is just pathetic. Like all the French police were just drinking coffee until Doyle showed up in the United States and did some real police work. What a joke. Try to go to a foreign city and dig up the biggest crime on the spot with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A truly terrible sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
