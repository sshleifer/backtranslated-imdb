Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move to a small Indiana town with a secret. They are sleepwalkers, feline-like creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of blood and special effects; besides signs of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is excellent as the mother. Others who appear are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King appeared as the janitor of the cemetery.
