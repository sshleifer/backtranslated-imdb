while watching this movie I got sick. I've grown up with Pippi and each time was a real pleasure. when my wife came to Sweden, she was looking at the old men and gave a good laugh. but this American version must be renamed and never be shown again. it is terrible from beginning to end. how they manage to do it is so bad. Well, I think someone blames the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Pippi. can this movie ever again be seen and never be sent on a broadcast. Burn the movie and save the children. If you want to look at Pippi, then look at the original movie and have a good laugh. We love PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin you'll never stand up to be Pippi .. Oh yes .. when you read the explanation "spoilers", spoiling "a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and pleasure of the movie. "Well, I think the director defends this ... you're looking at this movie at your own risk ... it's really a waste of time ...
