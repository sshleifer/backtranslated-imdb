Daddy's girls Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West get great news from local couriers, not knowing they're being chased by the thief Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, father David Miles receives a message (from the young Robert Harron) that demands that Dad leave home; So when the girls come back, can they be ?? alone at home. As the vulnerable pair lie down during the night, the "Great Ball of the Black and Tans" begins; and, a dark-skinned drinker indicates additional danger to D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his best roles in the Biograph, stealing the movie from "The Girls and Daddy." Ironically, director Griffith appears as one of the black-eyed extras of the "Black and Tans" ball. "Biograph Girls" Lawrence and West are suggestive of "Griffith Girls" and Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and are overly affectionate in bed! The racist tone is deplorable, since the story of a redeemed thief in saving his potential victims from a greater danger is intriguing. The Girls and the Dad (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
