I'm really surprised at the amount of good ratings that this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary got. Now I respect the opinion and the faith of the subject, I myself am not, in this state, a believer in the taught Christian doctrine. However, anti-Christian propaganda is a slightly different matter. <br /> <br /> This movie has valid points, but they are very few and are represented in a very biased context. I'm not recommending against seeing this. In fact, I think everyone should see and decide for themselves, believing it or not. And this is one more chance than the director gives to Christian teachings. Instead of an inquisitive approach on the subject, it seems a personal revenge on the Christian school that affected his childhood. He also misrepresents Christians most of the time as incredibly naive or fundamentalist without moderation in the middle. The director uses scenes from the Passion of Christ films without permission, organizes an interview with the director of his ex-school and presents almost uniquely anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually met the director to be the most realistic person and I think his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were subsequently consulted or even said prior to the interview the purpose of the investigation. With that said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity. But the way in which all this thought is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and terribly biased.
