I was really horrified by this mysterious movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And a musical track so creepy. Really promising! In fact, after ten minutes you really begin to sweat and feel uncomfortable because you start to fear the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a real nightmare, and what's worse, everything comes out. For an hour and a half I've been trying to fight off complete boredom and fall asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly horrifying image - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence and most of all: your wallet, since the idea of ​​spending precious money on a movie ticket for this inexpensive amateur homevideo is the greatest horror of all.
