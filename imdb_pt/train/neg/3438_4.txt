The Haunted Boat is sold as 'The Fog' and 'Open Water'. In many ways, this is necessary. There are scares and strange people to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> However, the ability to perform is bad at best. Showing clear signs that this is just a bunch of friends making a horror movie. That in all credit they make the best of their ability. When you accept the low budget, it becomes very difficult for special effects, with ghosts looking very much like men with rubber masks. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the movie are scary and strange. But he suffers from the use of many twists and turns in a short span of time that just leaves you bored and confused. In terms of keeping you awake, the movie does it very well. Ignoring the irrelevant twist every 5 seconds near the end, you really want to know what's going on. And they are willing to wait 1h 35 minutes for the climax. <br /> <br /> This is not a Ghost Ship, but it will definitely do it for a night in front of the TV.
