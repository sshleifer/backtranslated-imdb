When I was younger, I liked this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This show is sentimental, poorly written and rarely funny. The three protagonists were all good actors and funny men (Saget's stand-up was much better than the stuff this show brought, just as Coulier was better, and Stamos was a better-than-average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted to leave the show because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The show ended up being canceled when many of the actors demanded more money. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that drive me crazy about the program: 1. Effect phrases - How often a person can put tiring effect phrases like "rude", " do you have a face "," nerdbomber "," cut "and" have pity "in a 24-hour period? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Writing-obsolete and clichéd as an oreo cookie. There is a good writing cliché and a bad writing cliché. Full House had a bad cliché writing. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco, said Enough. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic things - Too many memories. <br /> <br /> 6. Trendy Kids - The girls had the latest shopping trends and you could see posters of fashionable artists they would like to meet. <br /> <br /> Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved, as I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was so sweet, I could not take it after a while.
