This is just a response to yahoo that says this movie is more realistic than the classic, genre that defines MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, brainiac, large whites (and other species of shark, bull, black tip, oceanic white tip, tiger) are known for populating areas where easy tusks are found. Humans do not usually come to this menu, but the film shark has been repeatedly pointed out as exhibiting abnormal behavior. It's not like it never happened. The chances of a killer whale destroying almost a whole city, isolating a human enemy, sinking several dozen North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned "enemy", are close enough to the water for this . to come, they are so thin they are laughable. Much like this shit from a Jaws knock-off. Laughable. It is also known that large white sharks often chew boats, protective underwater cages, and people on rafts and surfboards, as they appear to be seals underneath. A shark the size of Bruce (if you do not know, look up) would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca (Hey! That's the name of the robbery we're discussing!), How it would weigh over 6,000 pounds. I could go on, but I do not have to. Jaws is amazing (better performance, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca sucks (BLATANT rip-off from Jaws, bad writing, abominable effects, the most ridiculous plot on that side of an Olson Twins movie). You do not need a master's degree from Columbia University to see this. Watch better movies.
