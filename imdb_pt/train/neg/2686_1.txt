First of all, I'm not American or the Middle East. Secondly, I have no religion. The closest thing to a religion I have are sports and movies. Henceforth, I think it would be better to provide a neutral opinion and free of prejudice. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are an absolute disgrace. This terrible event should be used to commemorate all the innocent people who were murdered by "some" barbaric and uncivilized imbeciles. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films were pretentious attempts to score various political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Segment of Ken Loach. Of course, we all get sad because this guy has had a difficult life in his country, but what does this have to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Two mistakes do not make a right?! Whatever! This film should have a subtitle for those who find it difficult to hear a partially incoherent Chilean-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The most disturbing is the segment of Youssef Chahine. It's obvious he has problems with logic. He justified the killings because - America is a democracy and because some Americans voted for politicians in power, then all Americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this guy serious? Some Americans do not even vote! Some Americans do not even know where the Middle East is; some do not even know what religion is practiced there; and most do not know the real political issues that are thrown behind the scenes. ### Mr Chahine, the reason we have all these problems in the world is because there are many people with their kind of logic. The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from all over the world. Firefighters, rescue workers, office workers, passengers and murdered flight passengers have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we are not allowed to continue our lives because "some" people feel that everyone has to choose a side or a religion. We are seen as a fair game for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its own victims bombed. Another filmmaker using this event to boost their own political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people always think of me, me and me. Sometimes it's about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) The segment of Idrissa Ouedraogo is a joke and another political pointer. They obviously want money from the international community, highlighting their poverty. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> This movie denigrates the memory of the victims of "September 11, 2001". <br /> <br /> The best thing for this is the GARBAGE CHANNEL.
