The satire of Monika Mitchell's showbiz has some laughter and some premeditated violence. I would not say soggy blood; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is an actor who has a peculiar adaptable presence on screen, but he has a terrible history of being chosen for the parts he seeks. There is always a nephew of a producer or a seemingly trivial reason for not getting the role he seeks. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition ... Max becomes obsessed with those thoughts. A rewarding career is just a swing, push and shoot. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh cameos. Well, that's show business ... or is it?
