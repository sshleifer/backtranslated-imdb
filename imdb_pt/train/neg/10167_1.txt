This TV movie shows that bad movies exist. The only reason I saw this was that it was covered in a KTMA MST3K. It's the Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football is played at all and we see the backstage look basically nothing. With the many stars in this movie, it did not matter. I really do not know why I watched it.
