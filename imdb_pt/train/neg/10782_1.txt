the only scenes that made me laugh where those with Christopher Walken (the crazy movie director) the rest of the movie was boring. In the first hour, nothing really happens. Jokes that are not supposed to be funny and zeta. jones douglas is really exaggerated.julia roberts does a routine work of the ugly ex duck (yes, right!) to the girl next door (where did I see this before?) who gets the guy.for short.I really did not care what would happen to the main characters. If cusack actually fell out of the building in a suicide attempt, the film might have been more interesting to watch.
