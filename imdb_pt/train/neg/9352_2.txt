You can often say that a movie did not go as it should by the heavy use of a narrator. This film presents this device everywhere. Richard Jobson not entirely content to write directly and even finance part of this movie adds his credits by reading excerpts from his own semi-autobiographical writing that, combined with a beautiful edition, manages to cover up what is a depressing story he must be confusing. for genuine home of art. Kevin McKidd does well. Everyone else is fine. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints mean that all scenes are filmed in daylight, although most are obviously done at night, but if you know serious alcoholics, they mostly work during the day. A touch of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie is a waitress who does not age a single day in the 20 odd years between her appearances - a more radical version of the problem that McKidd has going from 18 to 30 without changing anymore than your clothes. Bless.
