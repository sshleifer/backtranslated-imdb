I credit writer and director William Gove for finding someone to fund this ill-conceived "thriller." A good argument for not wasting money signing HBO, let alone buying DVDs based on art covers and synopses. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco do not add anything meaningful to their résumés, although the art direction is not so bad. The dialogue will leave you making a face of admiration for your presumption; This is telling stories at their worst. No tension, no suspense, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothing. Some attractive and often nude women pepper the boredom, but this is definitely a better movie seen as a trailer. I'm sorry for the guy who clarified this thing. Good for late night, zoned view only. You have been warned.
