I was expecting the film based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on Beowulf's epic but told from the perspective of the monster. Whatever you think of Gardner's book, a film based on Beowulf's epic should not be called Grendel when he says nothing more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the CG monster is shown as nothing more than a Modified Predator. <br /> <br /> In addition, writers should also be punished for spoiling both the original story and contributing to the growing ignorance of the mass-market audience in the US. <br /> <br /> Typical Hollywood to get this so wrong. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.
