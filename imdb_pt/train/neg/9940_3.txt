Against the background of the rehearsal and recording of "Sympathy for the Devil" on the classic Beggar's Banquet album by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones ?? Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones? beyond Marianne Faithful, does Godard reveal other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements? the Black Power through the Black Panthers, feminism, communism, fascism - intertwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided into chapters: "The Stones Rolling"; Outside Black Novel ";" Sight and Sound "," All About Eve "," The Heart of the West "," Inside Black Syntax "; and, "Under the Stones the Beach." "Sympathy for the Devil" is another pretentious and boring mess of Jean-Luc Godard, the director uneven, the narrative and filming are terrible, but fortunately I love the Stones and "Sympathy for the Devil" and it's good to see them early in their careers, otherwise this documentary would be unbearable. the vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sympathy for the Devil"
