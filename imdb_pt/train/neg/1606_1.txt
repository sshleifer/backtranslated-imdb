In this film, Chavez's supporters (Venezuelans and non-Venezuelans) lie about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say the conflict began because of Chávez's announcement that sacked many of PDVSA's top workers for political reasons. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about more than 96 TV shows. interruptions transmitted by Chávez for only 3 days in "NATIONAL CHAIN" (a kind of confiscation of private TV signals). Each one is about 20 minutes long. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything about the provocation announcement made by General Lucas Jeon Rincon Romero, inspector general of the military, who is a traditional supporter of Chavez. . Even now, despite his announcement, he is the Minister of Interior and Justice. After Chavez returned, he assumed the charge of Minister of Defense (equal to the Secretary of Defense of the USA). They did not say anything about Chávez's orders to shoot at the peaceful concentration of people calling for elections. They did not say anything about the people in that concentration who were killed by Chavez supporters (civilians and military forces). They present some facts in a wrong order, They did not say anything about Venezuelan civil society that is claiming elections to solve the crisis and Chavez's actions to avoid the elections. <br /> <br /> <br /> That's why I tell you .... This movie is just a bunch of lies or a big lie.
