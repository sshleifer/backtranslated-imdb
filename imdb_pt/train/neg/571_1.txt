I just rented it because I loved the first movie. However, calling it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick so you can rent it. He is indeed an executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the production of this movie (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) A tragic plot, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter all the time. It's not even comically bad. <br /> <br /> What we end up doing is a tedious, unfocused movie with a terrible script and an indefinitely bad act and clich√©. It just smells of low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid like bubonic plague.
