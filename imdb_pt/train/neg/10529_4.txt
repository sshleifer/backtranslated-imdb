(Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing musical from the point of view of character development, in my opinion, from this much-publicized Rodgers and Hammerstein play. There are some good songs and a decent comic portrait, sometimes from the King of Siam by Yul Brynner - but the film does not do a good job at presenting the situation and the settings. I can only blame the script and possibly a bit of acting because we do not fully understand the situations of the character. I know it may be a bit too much to ask for a musical for the enjoyment of music and dance, but even that part did not stand out much for me. The basic plot is about an English woman coming to Zion to teach children about high-level European things. We find out later that the King is really the greatest student. There is a forbidden romance between the king's younger wife, played by Rita Moreno (a Latin as an Arab - come on!) And an ex-lover who causes some complications, but nothing really mesmerizing added though. Deborah Kerr, as the main female character Annie - is fine, but not so convincing. The king learns a few things because of his presence and then the movie disappears as it does. This is really a tiny story with some music and dancing but not such a good experience for a viewer.
