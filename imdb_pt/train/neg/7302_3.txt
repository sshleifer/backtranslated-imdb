The first five minutes of this movie showed potential. After that, it went straight from something possibly decent to some kind of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I could not stop thinking about Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for the simple fact of learning how not to make a movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that it makes someone stop and wonder if all the cast and crew have stopped caring at some point. What strikes me most about this movie is that it grossed $ 22 million at the box office and cost only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to the Lion Gate for being able to take that one.
