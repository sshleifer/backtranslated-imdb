the movie sucked, it was not funny, it was not exciting. they tried to make it so bad it would be good but failed. and to think that it's cool to like this movie, alongside the hype, are the only reasons why this movie is a success ... <br /> <br /> the fact that at the moment 50% voted 10 out of 10 for this movie seems to be very worrying to me, or the movie going public is going crazy or this vote is not realistic, which can have several causes, and should be addressed. anyway it's a less than average movie that flourished by word of mouth. Your success can only be described as a marvel of marketing.
