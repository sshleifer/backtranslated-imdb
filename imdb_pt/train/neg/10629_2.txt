The only reason I did not get it is that Sibrel shows that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a movie. It is a technically suitable film. <br /> <br /> That said, this is a film based on lies and distortions that are easily denied. Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to stifle the space program, rather than actual facts. And Sibrel's "irrefutable proof" that landings have been falsified is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching this, but if you do, check out google video for free. Do not let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity.
