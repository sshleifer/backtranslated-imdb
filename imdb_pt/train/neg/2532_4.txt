The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman etc. like Kings of B's. Because the staff at Crown International was so important, they were not elevated to the status they deserve. A movie like THE VAN may now seem like a disposable piece of Drive-in esoteric, but it was a considerable success when it was released (not to mention subsequent re-releases as a double feature with other Crown successes). <br /> <br /> VAN was a perfect example of Crown's successful strategy of taking advantage of moviegoers at the time of a movie release. Here it was sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and the brief fashion "Custom Van". As others have noted, it is ironic that the song "hit" in the movie refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the film itself. I had a Selectman town where I was at the time even declaring these vans to be "dimples of sin on wheels!" A perfect ad line to the movie! <br /> <br /> There's the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, low eyebrow muscles and hijinks (including a backing of Danny DeVito). In many ways, this is not much different from the old 1960s Beach Party movies, but now tempered with nudity and drug use. Obviously made on a tight budget and with a limited schedule, the film accompanies pleasantly enough with a jovial charm that offsets some, by today's standards, visions of non-computer related women. <br /> <br /> The classic touch is a toaster for Bobby's den of sin on wheels. Yes, a toaster! Hey, you gotta have something hot for those snacks! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
