Even if you could get over the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every Significant Moment of the Sixties (okay, so Katie did not join the Manson Family, and no one died in Altamont), this movie was still incredibly awful. I get the impression that the "writers" just locked themselves in a room and watched "Forrest Gump," "The Wonder Years," and the Oliver Stone movies of the 1960s repeatedly and called it research. A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "Turning Head". Was he right.
