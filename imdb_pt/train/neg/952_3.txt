Happy Go Lovely is a waste of time and talent from everyone, including the public. The lightness of the old mistaken identity and the plot lines of the false scandal is eminently forgivable. Very few people watched these films for their plots. But generally, they had some interesting smaller characters involved in subplots - not here. They usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking music and dancing to take their breath away. Not happy Go Lovely. And Vera-Ellen as the female lead interpreted the whole movie as a second banana desperately searching for a star to interpret it - and instead she was summoned to load the film and could not do it. The Scottish place was wasted. Typically, automatically ubiquitous Scottish droll whimsy is absent. The photograph was pedestrian. The musical numbers were pedestrian. Cesar Romero does his usual professional performance, swallowing the scene, since no one else was doing his part, in the type of producer role often rehearsed by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is very well, and no one could make David Niven as David Niven. At the end of the day, if you love Niven like me, that's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip.
