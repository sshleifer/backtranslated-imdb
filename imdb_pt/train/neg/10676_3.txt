Camera work - Why the camera work in this movie is so hectic? This is boring and disturbing. Editing - Flashes of still images were very short. Many of the other scenes were very short too. It just blinks. Sound - the background music was too loud and vociferous. One should not have to go back and repeat to get what was said. No one checks these things and makes them do it again? Please reduce the volume of background music in the future. The adjustment of the sound levels relative to the work of the editor, Julia Wong? The plot had many loose ends. The basic plot had potential. I think the film needed more work. Was he rushed? Maybe they ran out of money. Like many movies, it started out great, but ended up running out in the end. I really do not understand this, you know you have the storyboard before it goes into production, so why are not all the loose ends solved in the storyboard? <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so critical.
