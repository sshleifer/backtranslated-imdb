Another made for garbage TV piece! This is an insult to a war movie (I use the word film in its loosest form possible!) I thought the career of Telly Savalas had hit the bottom of the pit when he made the voice in that video in Birmingham that is shown in Tarrant on TV on a regular semi basis, but then I forgot he was involved in it! I tried to push it into my subconscious memory, but the cable TV brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me !! <br /> <br /> I like the part (laughs sarcastically!) in the film claiming to be a Liverpool scene in the 1940s, but it is blatantly a photo of Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties. Also the steam train with which the Command is training shows the JZ logo (Jugoslavia Zeleznice, or Yugoslavian State Railways) next to the locomotive clearly, although the manufacturers have tried to stop them. Why not just shoot in the UK, if that's where most of the film is? <br /> <br /> Cheap junk and a waste of celluloid!
