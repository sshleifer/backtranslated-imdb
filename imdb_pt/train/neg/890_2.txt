I saw this regurgitated stack of vignettes tonight at a preview and I was overwhelmed by how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First, the film practically exhibited its blind spots. Are not there gay blacks or gay New Yorkers in love? Or who, for example, knows white people who are involved in love? I know it's not Crash's love of anvil inclusivity, but you can not pretend to have a cinematic remake without these fairly common members of society. Also, you know that the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserved that crippled Oscar, so where is everyone? <br /> <br /> Possibly worse than bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were offensive chapters (remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with young women in wheelchairs? I did too) . This movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst. Bad acting, poor writing, misdirection - all encompassing all possible genres that pertain to wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes out of fancy restaurants. <br /> <br /> But, thank God, they finally got the powerful Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson together for the Jumper meeting. And, side note, Uma avoided a bullet; Ethan Hawke looks devastated. This, of course, is one thing in terms of appearance, but it added an incredibly frightening vibe of its terrifying scene before the poor and adorable Maggie Q. <br /> <br /> I had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene to the end of the film questionnaire, but it has to be the part of Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby for lack of taste, which saddens me because I really like these two actors. I do not consider myself easily offended, but all I could do was scoff and look around in disgust like someone's 50-year-old aunt. <br /> <br /> A second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is the deaf portrait of Shia LaBeouf's tone about what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie. I do not want to say the opposite, I mean against. Contra is the only explanation. I now realize that the opening sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight. ENLARGE. Please bear this in mind when your brain starts to leak its ear shortly after the opening credits, which seems to be a nod to the first New York Real World. This movie is embarrassing, strangely dated, inarticulate, ineffective, pretentious and, in the end, completely divorced from any real New York idea. <br /> <br /> (The extra star is for the sequel to Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach, as it is actually very sweet, but it's just a bright spot on what seems like hours of useless and masturbatory torment.)
