**** Do not read this comment if you want the shocking conclusion of "The Crater Lake Monster" to be a total surprise **** A claymation plesiosaurus is born in the depths of Crater Lake to cause damage to a group of local rednecks, not to mention its fast forward button. To call "The Crater Lake Monster" by amateur is to exaggerate the obvious. If you are not a fan of low budget movies, you probably would not be looking for it here. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that when there is no monstrous action going on, it really sucks and is not going anywhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, in that it is totally invented in the way it sets up the main action sequences. Nothing is too strange for "The Crater Lake Monster". He explains his dinosaur by having a meteor collide with Lake Crater, "overheating" the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently rested on the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could accept that the egg could have stayed there for so long and remained discovered and viable, would the "overheating" of the water at such a high temperature would not cause most of the lake to evaporate? In addition to a symbolic fog in one or two scenes, we see no evidence that the water is hot, other than a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The script is obviously filled in in some sequences, and will do anything to bring the characters closer to the lake so they can be threatened by clay dino. A couple who just go through problems in the car try and while their car is being serviced, they decide to rent a boat and leave on Crater Lake. Hmmmm ... do you think those strangers in the story could be there for them to meet the monstrosity of our title? In a sequence that is simply bizarre, a drunk steals a liquor store and decides to kill the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of drink. A car chase follows, and you do not know it ... they end up right on the lake. Snack time for Cratey! Yes, it's not hard to figure out, and you're so far ahead of the script that it's annoying when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold. <br /> <br /> The lack of shame of all this is captivating, and I really want to like "The Crater Lake Monster." I just can not do it. There is not enough here to continue, and this is more of a movie to put on during a party because you could talk about it and it would not matter. <br /> <br /> The film has a short list of things to follow, the most important being the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms: a shadow puppet, a large head that is drawn by water and an insert of fully realized claymation that really looks very good. There are also a couple of adorable hicks, and they carry most of the intentional humor in the movie. A pessimistic ending puts us in mourning for the death of the monster AND one of our beloved hunters, so all the good in this movie is dead by the end of it. Why was I so affected by this conclusion? Was the sad song played on the final credits? Or was I just crying inwardly by the time I spend watching movies like that?
