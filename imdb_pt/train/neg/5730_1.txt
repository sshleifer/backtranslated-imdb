Where to start really? The horrendous acting? The meaningless plot? The Effects of Bargain Basement? Completely disgusting characters? The hectic issue? The Casio keyboard score inducer of headache ??? The embarrassingly racist remarks ("Beware, Charlie!", "Backwards, Jackie Chan !!" The constant misogyny) I am a fan of lifelong terror, and I have no problem with the current "torture" I think I suffered more pain by watching this than the characters died in it! If you like girls being forced to eat the fried penis, very poor soft core pornography and lines of thinking like "I'll find that b **** and staple it c *** closed !!" are smart, LIVE FEED is for you. As for me, I feel the need to go wash my eyes with oven cleaner to avoid seeing this movie again!
