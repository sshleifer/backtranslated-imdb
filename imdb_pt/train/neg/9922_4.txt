Growing up, Joe Strummer was one of my heroes, but even I got cold because of this movie. For better or worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a "Behind The Music" documentary. Instead, it's a biographical art film, packed with interviews, performance footage, home movies and, mostly, nonsensical animation sketches taken from "Animal Farm." The film is coherent, but lasts for about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The shape of the bonfire, when touching the thought, is really very annoying in the execution. First, without titles, it is difficult to know who is half of those interviewed. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack licking the hosannas about the man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and his opinions do not add anything to his story. <br /> <br /> This picture is best when Strummer, through recorded interviews and conversations, touches on the facets of his life that most people did not know. about: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. For me, those were the most moving because they showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a normal human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life that we all must face. <br /> <There have been better and clearer documentaries on Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and the MTV documentary narrated by Kurt Loder from the early 1990s come to mind.) Joe Strummer: The future is not written down just for the fans.
