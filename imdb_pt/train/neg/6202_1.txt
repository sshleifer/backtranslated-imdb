I watched the whole movie to the disgraceful end even though I felt so angry at what I saw. I felt the director was screaming for attention, and the only way to do that was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I lived in the UK I come to love this country, but this film portrays young Brits in the worst imaginable way. There is nothing to be said, but avoid it, it will leave you angry and sick. The people involved should be ashamed.
