I just do not see how a Concorde-New Horizons movie directed by Jim Wynorski and with the talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet can be bad. It just confuses the mind, does not it? <br /> <br /> Well, let's not fool ourselves into it. "Munchie Strikes Back" is indeed a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet who has existed for many centuries. For reasons not fully explained by the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The mother's problem (at least her main problem) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks ... for the not so small amount of $ 20,000. Oh, she can not make the money because she just got fired. OK ... JUST is the key word in that sentence. What...? Was she planning to pay with a single payment? Maybe it was a good idea to have spent the last few years saving up for it ... do you think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magical powers similar to what a genius would possess ... but there is not a limit to the number of wishes you can make! Munchie takes the boy a lot of extravagant things for a night, but then the boy asks him to be sent back to the mall where Munchie was "borrowing." The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game through cheating. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Unfortunately, those dumb parents who watch the game do not find anything strange. Hmm. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would like to close this because it has already drained enough of my life force as it is. You'll be really touched by the scene in which Leslie-Anne Down, playing the mother, kicks a dog that's barking at her. Her heart will melt her charm when she realizes that dollar bills fall in the front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer. The "Munchie Strikes Back" credits promised another film titled, "Munchie Hangs Ten." So far, the audience that watched the movie has been stolen from what would certainly have been a cinematic tour de force. Heh 1/10
