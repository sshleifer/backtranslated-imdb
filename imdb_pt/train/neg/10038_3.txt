The movie has no style, I mean original style. everything seems copied including action, first appearances in the film, songs, delivery of dialogues, etc. etc. Yes, there the goof-ups were original, as in the beginning a car is shown with UP number **** and a few seconds later begins to fall a hill with the number MH ****. That was one of the many nonsense of the movie :) Anything good in the movie? yes, for Kareena fans, if there is any, Kareena in bikini. For akshay fans, their dialogues and action stunts. That's it. just it. So watch out for yourself and do not blame the director or the actors. Director is already insane and actors, I feel sorry for them.
