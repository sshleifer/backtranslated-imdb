The ever-reliable Leonard Maltin says that this is a "lovely novel" and that Sanders is "superb." Maltin must have confused this movie with something else. Sanders is sarcastic and fun and superb, as always? you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery, "Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy that they have to be carried by three," but dull, wooden and dated describe this film more accurately. The plot itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a gentle jewelry thief, Fran√ßois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes chief of police, but can hardly resist the attraction of fine jewelry, is fun enough but has the same kind of historical treatment hidden Hollywood movie that spoiled. epics of the period as * Marie Antoinette *, and certainly the deplorable * Forever Amber * (who screams for a classic remake). Although, in his defense, Sanders tries to add some depth to his character, it's all for nothing. I am a cheeky fan of Douglas Sirk, but that is 1946, and it is one of Sirk's first American efforts, missing many of the characteristic touches that would define his flowery pots and full of boobs. Sirk is just wetting his feet here, and has made several memorable films over the next ten years, until he reaches gold with * Magnificent Obsession *, and hit his stride, bombarding us with such estrogen festivals * All That Heaven Alls * Written in the Wind * and * Imitation of Life *. But * Scandal in Paris * is it hardly your best job? a relatively low budget case with ineffective cheese and costume sets.
