Oh, those Italians! Assuming films about aristocrats with strange fetishes, castles drowned in gothic atmosphere, and relatives trying to get an inheritance are inherently interesting to everyone! If you've ever seen such a movie, basically you've seen them all (the MST3K's "Favorite Screaming Skull" also fits in the mold) ... and "Evelyn's Night Out of the Tomb" is stereotyped, by-numbers, and dull like hell. Even the delicious Erika Blanc is wasted here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
