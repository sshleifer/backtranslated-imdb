We brought this movie as a joke to a friend, and it could have been our worst joke to be played. The film is only watchable, and the acting is terrible. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. The plot is shameful and at some points we were so bored that we were wondering what the hell was going on. He tries to be awful in some places, but it's just laughable. <br /> <br /> Just terrible
