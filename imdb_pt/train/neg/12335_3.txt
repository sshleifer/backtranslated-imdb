Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors I'm always keen to see despite criticism. I've always found Mrs. Ryan a charming and captivating actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" largely because Firstly, Meg Ryan does not play a sympathetic character, she interprets a weeping weeping cry that begins to irritate her nerves right after the credits and does not give up until several days later. That said, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less sympathetic. So, even though you usually like these two actors, I recommend you give them a pass in that movie.
