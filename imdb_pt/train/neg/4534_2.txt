The book on which this film is based has seriously changed my life. But to say that this movie was a disappointment is a euphemism. The acting, direction, cinematography and plot were all horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I've told countless people about the book, but now I'm going to tell everyone that they definitely should not see the movie! I did not expect the plot to go exactly with the book, but they left out many key components of the book. The film tried, but failed, to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only lowered the central theme of the prophecy. While putting me in the position of those who had not read the book, I saw Celestine Prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy B.S. I am completely disappointed with Redfield by the way this movie ended.
