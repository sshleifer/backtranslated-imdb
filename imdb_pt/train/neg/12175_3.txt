Why review good movies when you can review "Trancers II?" <br /> <br /> Ooh, this movie is sooooo lame. I can just imagine the cast and crew driving around Los Angeles with a camcorder, throwing extras at the monster silly makeup of poor Tim Thomerson. The families of the stars actually appear to play, probably because the Full Moon could not pay for "real" extras. Lame effects, lame sets, and a script so complicated it would take eras to untie all nodes - this should be classic Trancers! <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... that rules. Note that this is the same thing I say about "Trancers IV". I say this because it's true. What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat crush zombies, then busted out with jokes like, "Do not worry ladies, they're biodegradable"? Well, a lot of things could be better, but anyway this is still good. <br /> <br /> My only significant reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks at articulation. She is a bad opponent for Helen Hunt's character - both are young pieces of eye candy, and would have been more effective if they really contrasted a little more. Well, you can not have it all. At least the wonderful plot device of the "second long watch" is back in place, and we have more than Hap Ashby, the least convincing athlete in movie history (oh, wait a minute - he has a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in "Creator"). <br /> <br /> I have not seen this lately, but it seems like I remember that Martine Beswick ran away twice during the final battle. Hooray for bad continuity! Just one of the many highlights in this fine film.
