Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> British director J. Lee Thompson has made some great films, notably 'Ice Cold in Alex' and 'Cape Fear', but 'Country Dance' is one of his most curious offerings. The story takes place among the upper classes of rural Scotland and details the strange triangular relationship between Sir Charles Ferguson, an eccentric aristocratic landowner, his sister Hilary and Hilary's estranged husband, Douglas, who is expecting a reconciliation with her. We learned that during his career as an army officer, Charles was considered "low morale". This seems to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; Throughout the film, he shows an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world, and his main sources of emotional support appear to be Hilary and her bottle of whiskey. The film ends with his commitment to a whimsical upper-class asylum. Peter O'Toole was, when he was at his best performance, as in "Lawrence of Arabia," one of the leading British actors, but the quality of his work was very uneven, and "Country Dance" it was not one of his best films. He improvises frantically, turning Charles into a caricature of the innate aristocrat, as if he were auditioning for a role in Monty Python's "Top Class of the Year" sketch. Susannah York as Hilary and Michael Craig as Douglas are better, but there is a really exceptional acting performance in the film. There is also little in terms of coherent plot, beyond the tale of Charles's inexorable decline. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the film, however, is neither the acting nor the plot, but the movie. Theme that does not dare speak your name. There are hesitant signs of an incestuous relationship between Charles and Hilary, or at least an incestuous attraction for her, and that her antipathy toward Douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. Unfortunately, even in the sixties and early seventies (the date of the film is given as 1969 or 1970), there was a limit to what the British Board of Film Censors was willing to allow, and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme. was definitely off limits. (The American title for the film was 'Love Fraternal', but that was not used in Britain, was it very suggestive for the taste of the BBFC?) These tips, therefore, are never developed and we can never see what motivates Charles or which caused its moral collapse, resulting in a hollow film with a hole in the center. 4/10
