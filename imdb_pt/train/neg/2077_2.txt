I needed an excuse to leave the house while the paint dried-I left the film after an hour to come back and watched the paint dry. <br /> <br /> I do not remember ever having been in a movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not for the cast and just continued "going and going" badly - come on! Uma Thurman doing these things? Pretty lame special effects. These were older characters and actors making superficial lives in their twenties - just a kind of annoying and wrong feeling. <br /> <br /> This review is based only in the first hour - may have improved. I just had to get home and see if the paint dried in a darker shade than when it continued.
