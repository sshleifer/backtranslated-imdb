What a terrible movie. Rotten tomatoes had a good rating for that as well. do not be fooled by the positive reviews; It was not scary. It was not funny. It was not smart. It will not even catch your attention. I only lost 2 hours of my life watching this little party. the computer-generated monster was interesting to see the first two times. after about 15 minutes no longer had fun. the dialogue was terrible, it must be a translation thing. Another negative that stood out were the idiot Americans. 3 were portrayed and all of them lacked character, intelligence and judgment. Now I'm going to write some lines to fill this out, since we have to have 10. The staff at the store should have slapped me for bringing that title to the bar.
