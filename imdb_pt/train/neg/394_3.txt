I'm fond of movies that fill up the subject gaps in world cinema. So after watching the trailer for "Water Lilies," I expected to enjoy this movie because I thought I'd stumbled upon something unique: a movie that honestly portrays teenage lesbian love - a kind of female version of "Beautiful Thing." <br /> <br /> The main characters are 15-year-old French girls. Marie is thin, reticent and pretty in a sloppy way; Floriane is extroverted, athletic and beautiful; and Anne is loyal, plump and behaviorally immature. The erotic interplay between Marie and Floriane is always boiling in this film, if not on the surface, just below it. <br /> <br /> "Water Lilies", however, is not about the rise of lesbian love over two teenagers; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, boredom, adolescents working with opposing goals and - in at least two instances - mechanical sex without joy. It also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers spoil their own creations when they become too manipulative. In the extra features of the DVD "Lord of the Flies," director Peter Brook says, "French cynicism begins with the stimulation of sex," which means that the French consider their children as angels , while considering adolescents and adults with widespread cynicism. Part of the fall of this film is filmmaker Celine Sciamma who swallowed a powerful dose of this cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where is the joy?" I wondered as I watched this movie. Yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphally erotic in a new and affirmative way. These positive aspects are missing in this film; there is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this movie wants to be a pungent celebration of first love. But Sciamma is very impressed with her own cynicism and intelligence and spoils the film. First, what's the point of showing only the chubby nude girl? I know there is an established tradition of tasteful teenage nudity in European cinema, as evidenced by such films as "The Slingshot, The Rascal, The Devil, Probably, The Little Thief, Murmur of the Heart, Friends, Beau Pere," and "Europe , Europe "; but this example is a small authorial intrusion - "See, audience, I can make a movie where I show only the nudity of the unattractive person." Neither nudity nor evenly distributed nudity would be an honest path. <br /> <br /> There's a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie are dancing. What follows next is not just Floriane cynically manipulating Marie; is the filmmaker Sciamma cynically manipulating her audience. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the greatest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty happens when Floriane warns Marie that she is about to ask for something that "is not normal." Marie understandably asks, "Who cares to be normal?" So Sciamma plays false with her audience and with the impetus of the film, because Floriane's request is a false, derivative and substitute question - not the sincere and sincere question of the film, Marie's character and the viewers who invested her time deserve. Here are also two moments that falsely hit the spectator's nerves: 1) Since when do the French - of all people - bathe in bathing suits and a tortoise? 2) What adolescent - of any nationality - would bite an apple core that was thrown in the trash to get a taste of the beloved's mouth? <br /> <br /> The top three actresses are promising, and if they find the best vehicles for their talents, they can become excellent actors. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) could become a protagonist, or a bomb, or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has an unmistakable intensity and magnetism. In the future, she could interpret everything from an emotionally disabled librarian to a mysterious sensual seductress, to a reluctant politician in meteoric rise. <br /> <br /> In short, "Water Lilies" was very disappointing. Will an honest filmmaker make an authentic movie about two young girls in love! No - not necessarily because of this middle-aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have some quality they can see and identify. And yes, fill a gap in the subject in the world cinema.
