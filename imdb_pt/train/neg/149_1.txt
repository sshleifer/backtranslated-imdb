Well, you know the rest! This has to be the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when she took on this role. <br /> <br /> The lead role is played by (for me) a complete stranger and I imagine it disappeared back into obscurity shortly after this turkey. Bruce Lee led the charge of martial arts in the early 1970s and since then the fight scenes have to be based on martial arts or at least brutal if they use street fighting techniques. This movie uses quick cuts to show the martial arts, however even this can not disguise the fact that you do not know how to punch. An 8-year-old boy would dismount her in this scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the only mystery at issue here is how this did not earn the golden raspberry for its year.
