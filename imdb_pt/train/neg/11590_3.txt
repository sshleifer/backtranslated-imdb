It's getting worse, the series is in serious decline. The first two sequences were acceptable, and from then on we saw a series of really terrible films. Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy, but the rest of the cast can not act. The story is that Alice, having survived the previous episode of the Nightmare series, meets Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams starting again. This time the insulting killer is attacking the sleeping mind of Alice's fetus. Its intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only person who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own child? Check out the top three, miss the next three and see the last.
