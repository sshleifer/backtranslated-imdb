I do not know who to blame, the timid writers or the clueless director. It seemed to be one of those movies that paid so much to the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there was not enough left over to actually make a movie. This could have been a lot of fun, but there was a veil of shyness, even cowardice, that hung over each scene. Since receiving a R note, why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene filmed with a 70-year-old woman and not with Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen dream of potentially hot relationships WITH THE WORST AND BEAUTIFUL SEXY ACTIVITIES IN THE WORLD? If they were just looking for laughs, why not climb Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta? This was so predictable that I was surprised to find out that the director was not five years old. What a waste, not just for the viewers, but also for the actors.
