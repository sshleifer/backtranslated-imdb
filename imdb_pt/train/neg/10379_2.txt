The film begins in 1840 in Japan in which a man cuts his wife and his lover to death and commits suicide. It's a bloody and very bloody sequence. So jump to today ... well 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and their small, boring son move to Japan for their husband's work. They rent a house and - surprise! surprise - it turns out it's the house where the murders happened! The three dead people are out there like ghosts (the makeup is hysterically bad) and make life a living hell for the family. <br /> <br /> It looks OK - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody and final opening and NOTHING happens in the middle. There is a giant crab attack that is just noisy! They look so fake - I swear I saw the ropes pulling one of them - and they're grumbling !!!!! There is a meaningless sexual sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show George's body), another about 40 minutes later (but that was necessary for the plot) and a silly exorcism to the end. The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> As for acting - Albert was just as well as her husband and McClure was very good as a friend of the family. But George - as always - is fantastic in a bad movie. She gives this film a much needed lift - but it can not save it. I'm giving her a 2 for herself and the bloody opening and closing. That aside, this is a very annoying movie.
