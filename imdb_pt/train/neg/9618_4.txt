I have to say, although this movie has been stereotyped everywhere, with a plot stolen from movies like Friday the 13th / I know what you did last summer, this movie was not so bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most of the horror movies that Hollywood released recently. The deaths, though sometimes somewhat imaginative, were mostly just that, original. The cast was mediocre, which is expected of low budget features, but much better than that much larger studio that the Artisan / Lions Gate has offered. My only real complaint that was not due to the budget of the movie, which must have been small, was the artificial end "twist". I'm sorry, but that's what put this movie in the bad category for me. The ending was simply stupid and followed. Before that, I was a bit bored, but really enjoying it. 4/10
