With a tendency to repeat himself, Wenders has been a constant disappointment since he reached the pinnacle with 'Paris Texas'. <br /> <br /> The "land of plenty" is no exception. Taking into account the fact that I anticipated a mediocre movie, even before entering, Wenders' ambitions always seem to get the better of him. That's why his films are heavy and bombastic. <br /> <br /> I was not sure if I was watching a comedy that mocks Central America or some thriller. The outcome of Diehl's character is totally predictable. The insistence of layered Wender many scenes with a rock music is also intensely annoying. He was masking the holes in his script and direction as he animated the scenes. <br /> <br /> I am sure many people will find this film important and resonant, but honestly, this clumsy and didactic effort speaks only of bad direction. <br /> <br /> Interesting that Wenders professed that by doing 'Paris Texas', he had a great deal of help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, that was the best of Wenders and he should understand now that he needs a good screenwriter. His films from the last 15 years + were a total mess.
