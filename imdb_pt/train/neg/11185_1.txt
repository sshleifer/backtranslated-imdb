Yes, MTV really has a way of marketing Daria. What started out as an intelligent teen angst - "comment on all that sucks and make the viewer feel better about your teenage life" sitcom has now turned into a "how you should deal with your problems" -charade. I used to watch Daria all the time and I loved it. Now, sitting here after watching the so-called movie, I can only imagine what the sense of it all was. Daria tells us how to live life in college? Excuse me? did not make the point Daria made every episode what you like to do is ok as long as it's ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the world sad sick think about it? This whole thing reminded me of the scene in "Reality Bites", the movie channel shows the documentation for the first time.
