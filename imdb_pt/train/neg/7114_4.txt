With regard to cinematography, this film was very good for the mid 50's. There were some times that the lighting was very hot, but the shots were usually on the frame and were in focus. The acting was above average for a low budget stinker, but the direction was horrible. Several scenes were dragged for a long time in an attempt to suspense and the effects were nonexistent. The skull attack in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut, and any attempt to bring the skull to life was obvious with blows and ropes. I also could not help thinking that the budget did not allow them to furnish the house, so they kept making references to the agents and that all things stored should be coming soon. Honestly ... it would have been more fun if it was a worse movie. It was not bad enough to be a "good-bad" movie, but it was not good enough to be "good" either. Take the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
