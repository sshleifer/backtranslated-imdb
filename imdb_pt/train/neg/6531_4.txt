First, I'd like to say that the user's comments alone left me with tears in my eyes laughing. One comment that SF bad movies become good comedies is correct. The MST3000 made it live that way. <br /> <br /> If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the fevered dream of a 10-year-old comic book reader from 1959, you will have the chance to deal with this sucker. All elements are there: pseudoscience, occasionally logical, more often hilarious and childlike. The adolescent boy's attitude toward sex, with the "gigolo" captain (good call, guys!) Making eyes for the chubby "scientist" with hair so red is a wonder that does not turn on the fire alarms. The ridiculous conception of Mars as a planet so strange that everything shines red, but an alien monster has a mouse face, and the alien has an eye that rotates like a child's toy. The comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!) Who seems never to have finished eighth grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his lightning gun. And, of course, the mere fact that alien = dangerously evil. If these people had known T.T., they would have roasted it in two seconds! "OW", indeed! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I rated this movie low. Still, it's never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - just to make everything sound more ridiculous), and you have to admit, in your kid's core, it makes you jump a few times. <br /> <br /> Ok, so do not admit it. I think you were never 10.
