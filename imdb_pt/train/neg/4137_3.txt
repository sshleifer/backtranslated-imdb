I have a high tolerance level for crap, so I was looking forward to it. It did not disappoint. Apparently based on the classic Carmilla of Sheridan Le Fanu, it follows a father and a daughter hunting a vampire who, fortunately, is traveling with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or the General, as he likes to be called here) running about random zombies. Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak? The dead are coming back to life, but no one seems to care too much. We have construction worker zombies, zombies from soldiers and even St.Trinian high school zombies. Apparently Santa is looking for his daughter who has been transformed into a vampire. Oh, wait, there are no vampires, the girl is in a madhouse and Carmilla is your nurse, or is she? The zombies are back and Santa Claus is crazy. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies, but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like some simulated coffins to get the juice flow. When are we going to see vampires fighting zombies? Is she a vampire or is she crazy? Or both? Is Carmilla a sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here come the zombies from St.Trinian. Chainsaw Time !! More lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires. I think the zombies won or not? Plot? Who needs a plot when you have lesbian vampires and high school zombies? And coil language?
