HeidiJean really saw this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Dizzy, bland and completely unimaginative and heart. I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought Carly Pope could play the lead in this movie! The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely dull performance. Baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing. Probably her involvement was the only reason this project was enlightened to begin with. Maybe I'm waiting too long for a Lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas, but I was thinking about it with a different director and a reformist JJ with an actress who could at least provoke sympathy. .
