I've seen all the episodes of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such success that is Gray's Anatomy. So I kept watching. I'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, chemistry, and, most importantly, the drama of its predecessor, Gray's Anatomy. Relations seem to be planned and action is like this. The writing lacks the intelligence and comedy clues seen in GA. There is shows that a formulaic but does not feel stereotyped and artificial, unfortunately PP is not so. I loved the presence of Kate Walsh in GA. I'm afraid the life of Kate Walsh in LA just is not interesting.
