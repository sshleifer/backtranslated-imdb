This movie should be in line for the most annoying movie in years. Not even Woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom. <br /> <br /> The murder in this movie is supposed to be the point of interest in this movie, but it is not, nothing is of interest. The cast is not for evil, but the script is simply awful, I just sat in absolute amazement during this movie, wondering how on earth anyone can find this movie entertaining. <br /> <br /> The producers of this movie were very clever . They did a boring movie, but hid well with the names of good actors and actresses in their cast. People will go to blockbuster and will probably watch this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe, this should be good and rent this movie (they are in a horrible time). <br /> <br /> If you like to be robbed, rent this movie, some people really liked this movie, but I like to watch a movie with meaning.
