First of all, this plot is very exaggerated - girl wants to do it, everybody loves her, snob girl intervenes, everything seems lost, girl pulls completely, everybody loves her again, etc. Play the right thing, an attractive man rushing to heroin, plus problems with single parents and it is so predictable that you can practically recite along with it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate how they continue to disassociate classical music. They send the message that everyone involved in classical music is tense, snobbish and mind-boggling - in fact, I do not exactly remember the quote, but I remember that at one point in the movie, Holly says, "Why? they have to be so tense ... so classic? "It's really insulting how to label classical music that way. <br /> <br /> Third, I've examined it dozens of times, but the only reason I can think of doing this movie is to promote Britney Spears. There is simply no point at all. <br /> <br /> And, oh yeah, while the actress who played Holly (I'm not sure if it was really her singing or not) had a reasonably good voice, It was not as amazing as they were making out to be - especially when she was singing. She was backing up all the time. 1/10 stars.
