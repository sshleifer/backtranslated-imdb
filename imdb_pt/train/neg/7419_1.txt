This movie was horrible and an insult to the viewer. Stupid script, bad cast, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the usual Hollywood tradition, the US government is portrayed as always evil. The foolish fellows of Hollywood communism, most of whom are as stupid as a box of stones, love to catch the only lunatic of Eugene McCarthy and imagine him as the leader of a vast movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a marginal character who was exploiting a legitimate concern with the Soviet communists for political gain. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and the US brought all those Nazis out of evil. Like Werner Von Braun, without which we would not have any space program. He really loved being American and became a great asset to the country. <br /> <br /> And yet the irony is that fools in Hollywood, an uneducated people living a fantasy existence, still believe that government ought to manage EVERYTHING and give us everything we want. And yet, this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this.
