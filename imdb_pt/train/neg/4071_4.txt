A young man kills a young woman for no reason. The man's brother is arrested on charges that he was an accomplice but soon escapes. On the run, the seemingly innocent man kidnaps three victims and then ties his girlfriend to the plot. If that is not bad enough, the situation quickly spirals downward. <br /> <br /> This movie had some good and many bad aspects. Its strongest aspect was the actress Emily Haack. Leaving aside the fact that she is naked in a fair amount of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character. I see no reason why she can not accept this experience and somehow turn it into a career in some way. I was convinced that she was a ruthless person. <br /> <br /> In addition, the producers of this film were very bold and did not give punches. Graphic nudity (male and female), coprophagia and extreme anal violence are not avoided. I like my horror movies to push the boundaries a bit, and this one completely ignored them, jumping happily to Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they got what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the negatives. First, and most notably, this film has a very low budget and the quality of the film shows this. I can excuse this - the plot was decent, the acting was good and in some scenes the low quality movie really made the movie more disturbing (a more realistic feeling). So, I will not berate them for having low quality equipment. What I will reprimand them is the use of bad choices in the photos. For no reason I can check (besides plumping the film), there are a lot of pictures of a graveyard. I really do not know why, and I frankly started to doze off at this point because it was so long and meaningless. <br /> <br /> I also have problem with the title. The idea here was to fool people into thinking that this movie had some connection to the classic "I Spit on Your Grave". Now there's a line that seems to imply that the main character is the woman's daughter in this other movie. And the themes are very vaguely the same (a woman taking revenge on men). But there is no firm connection and the reason this title was chosen was for the video store's customer to think they were getting a sequel. That was deceitful and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last big complaint is that this plot does not make real sense. Not even a little. A woman is killed at first for no reason. A fugitive from prison finds time to kidnap people to torture them for no reason (why did they hurt his girlfriend?). The same man goes from good to evil without explanation. Likewise, the protagonist (Haack) turns from a normal person to someone who is overly cruel and sadistic, for no reason, and against people who most of the times were only marginally bad for her (a neighbor offering drugs for sex is wrong , but by no means is it worth being tortured by. <br /> <br /> Do not let that title fool you, or the claims that the film is incredibly shocking. <br /> <br /> Yes, some scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of If you see this in the NetFlix or NetFlix, keep browsing, or rent it, and we can sit and chat for hours.You've been warned.
