The premise is incredible and some of the actors, notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this movie is almost impossible to be seen. The song sounds as if it came from some kind of online site without copyright and lyrics as if it had been written with an open rhyming dictionary on its lap. Most of the singing is out of tune. I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put the song under it ... The dialogue is really stupid and banal. The movie works best when you're actually talking about the real estate industry, but alas, it often gets lost in ridiculous sub-plots. I found myself checking my watch after the first twenty minutes and after 40 asking 'when is it going to end'.
