Maybe it's the dubbing, or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying, moaning or otherwise, but I thought Europa '51 was one of the most exhausted (and therefore annoying) movies I've ever seen. The film begins promisingly familiar, as the mother Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled and spoiled son (Sandro Franchina). While mom and dad (uncomfortable, Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests at dinner, the young man tries to kill himself, initiating a series of events that make Bergman spend some time giving compassion to the poor and needy. Driven by the editor of the communist newspaper Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time with the oppressed than with her husband, who soon leaves her in a madhouse for her problems. Bergman plays the role of saint to the full, echoing his 1948 role as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming for the best effect. Unfortunately, the script points to its point of view with subtlety, while Andrea and Mama take turns to declaim Marxist and Christian platitudes. In the final scene drenched with tears, I had more than filling these tiresome characters. A real step down for Rossellini when he turned away from neorealism and embraced even more the mystical and mystical themes of the 1950's San Francisco Flowers.
