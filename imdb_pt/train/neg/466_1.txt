How could I better express my feelings about this movie: ghastly? a headache? lack of coherent writing? pure stupidity Try all of the above for this scam. And that's just for the direction. <br /> <br /> History? Well, I think there's a story. Two idiot blondes look for jobs after dropping a plane on a golf course. They are mistaken for a "world-renounced murderer" (sarcasm) and are "hired" by two "gangsters." One thinks to "take it" means an encounter and the other receives the smaller actor with whom dreams. And, of course, the turtle reserve for the frog turtle, which they build with the casino gains. <br /> <br /> Does it seem like all this can be funny? Guess again. They try to make it funny, but it is not. Filming sequences are not well done. I've seen better footage in Hong Kong movies. The visuals are average for a movie from the late 80's. But the problem is it's a 2007 movie. It's not worth my time to watch it again. It still does not surpass Danny Glover's "Out" movie of the early 1980s as the worst movie ever, but again, the film is of its own kind. "F"
