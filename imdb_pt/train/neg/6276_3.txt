THE BROKEN is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. It is not a slasher or filled with blood. Plenty of broken glass and mirrors in this nervous thriller from France and writer / director Sean Ellis. A successful radiologist, Gina McVay (Lena Headly), goes through a strange world while her life seems to get out of control. While attending his father's birthday party (Richard Jenkins), the guests are stunned when a mirror falls to the ground for no obvious reason. Things get really weird when she witnesses a woman who is the very image of driving down a London street in a car identical to hers. Gina runs away to her doppelganger's apartment and finds a picture of herself with her father. She leaves and is involved in a collision. So, mysteriously, her boyfriend is not the same; Being exact family and friends is not easy for her to trust. Is Ginny out of her head? Is she in a parallel world? Your nightmares become more horrible ... is it broken? <br /> <br /> Kudos if you can figure this out ... it will not be easy. The issue could not be more tight. Lighting is questionable. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
