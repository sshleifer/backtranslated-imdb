I've never considered myself a "student" when it comes to watching movies, I see them, form an opinion and that's it. But Unhinged changed all that. This film is undoubtedly the most inept attempt to make films I have ever seen. Any kid who likes to graduate from college thinking he'll be the next Spielberg or Tarantino needs to get this movie with a manual titled "How Not to Make a Movie." Not only is there no story to be told, as the filmmakers were not competent enough to make a movie worth watching. It's been a while since I've seen it, but all I can say is watch the photos of overhead tracking in the opening scenes. They are never ending! It's almost like having your teeth ripped out, but it's not so much fun.
