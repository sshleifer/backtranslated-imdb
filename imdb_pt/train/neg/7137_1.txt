The cars in this movie are amazing. The acting in this movie is horrible. The plot and the directional scenes do not make much sense and are equally bad. If you get really bothered with movies where someone changes and suddenly gets ridiculously faster, get out of trouble and money. Good movie for racing fans? Well, there is a part in which they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally car driver. If you can not tell the difference, go watch, you will have a blast. This really boils down to this, there are really really good cars in this movie, they are taken awfully and are completely unrealistic. The acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot. If you want to see hot girls, call mtv or vh1. I'm disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie. If the class of cars were to match that of the movie, they should be running with rusty bikes.
