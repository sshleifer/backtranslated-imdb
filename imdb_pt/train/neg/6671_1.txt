I felt that this movie started well. The performance was perfect and I felt the plight of all the characters, even if the real family unit was not completely revealed. We never had enough information about the father to really feel his pain for all his involvement or the increase of his animosity with Tobe. I mean, in one scene you see him admiring her through tension and in another scene he almost takes her head off. Another problem with the movie was just unraveled and it lost all focus until the end, and I was begging for it to end soon. Any film with such a long and painful ending should never have an automatic rating of 7 or above just for acting. We are looking at the quality of the whole experience of the film. In the case of this movie the ending is so bad that I seriously contemplated just leaving the theater. This movie pulled me then just spit on me.
