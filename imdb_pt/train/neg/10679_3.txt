I did not expect a movie as good as "In The Line of Fire" or an episode of "24", but it looked like this movie was made for TV and did a mediocre job at best. The (good) cast could not disguise the fact that the plot was very predictable and the actors had to fight (they really try their best, I think) through their poor script lines, giving their characters a bit annoying any extras. When I watched the movie, I had the feeling that I saw most of it in other (better) movies. In it you had car chases, big shootings, romance, twists, etc etc; This movie has none. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking on the phone about the character of Cuba, you know who is behind all this and all the tips you are giving (" near the president, see from my perspective .. ") sounds silly. <br /> <br /> If it were up to me (and maybe it's a good thing it is not) I'll rewrite the storyline as follows: <br /> <br /> The first lady orders her husband's murder because she's tired to write checks to Cuba all the time.
