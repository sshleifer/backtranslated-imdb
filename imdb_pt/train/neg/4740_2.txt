I'm so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny ... And I thought "Mulan" was unbelievable! As low as my expectations with Disney become, I never imagined they would do something so stereotyped and so out of fashion. There is no respect here for any true Chinese culture, just the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that they tried to make Wendy into a normal adolescent ... But, fortunately, most normal teenage people - especially Asian teenagers - are much less obsessed with such superficial aspects of life. And from the cultural point of view, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are involved in popularity and fashion, but they are very rare. And even those who are still are quite decent scholars. Another stereotype, perhaps, but quite true. Because that's how Chinese parents work. This is how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted authenticity, they would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family. <br /> <br /> This only increases my frustration with American films. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague and nature-oriented phrases that sound wise. We do not walk smiling enigmatically all the time, and not everyone knows some form of martial arts. We are PEOPLE, and I would appreciate it if someone wrote an Asian part that did not portray us as a sad caricature.
