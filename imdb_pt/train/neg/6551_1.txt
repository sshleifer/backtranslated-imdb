A bad study. Bad acting, bad music, bad script, bad editing, bad direction and bad idea. Schlock pieces are not cheesier or unintentionally funnier than this ... thing. At the end of the "movie," you wonder why they bothered you in the first place. Poor Malcolm McDowell, was he short on cash or something? Still thinking about seeing this? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you have not died laughing in the first thirty minutes, by the time you will see the cyborg city called "Cytown", you will. Avoid it, my amateur movie friends. Avoid.
