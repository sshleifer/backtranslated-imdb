I sat in this turkey because I had not seen it before and because the premise seemed to have potential. It was slightly amusing until the aftermath of the hurricane. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to knock windows out of the house, but the trees in the background are perfectly standing and no leaf moves! In fact, as the characters move out of the house, the sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops. At that point, whatever credibility the filmmakers had developed, it evaporated faster than the highly localized rainfall in their film. What a shame that all hurricanes are not like this would certainly help our owners' insurance rates here in the State of Florida.
