For the small minority seen here praising this movie GET SERIOUS. I know it's down to people's personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than one pair of brain cells can certainly see that this is total crap. So bad that it does not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume that those who say how great this is are friends of someone involved in the film and are trying to give a boost to their career. Poor in every way, not with people saying otherwise. Plot is a weak rewrite of the previous entries, script is the same way. Attempts to hide the lack of originality using a girl (WOW!) Do not disguise the lack of ideas of the filmmakers, and unfortunately there is a complete lack of scares. Absolutely no redeeming quality, total idiot. I gave this pair of chancellors a mark simply because they had the nous to get someone to fund that crap. They must have tried harder at this than actually making the movie. Shame.
