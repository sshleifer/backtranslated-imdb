Wow! This is one of those movies that you think you've reviewed before, but you did not. I mean, you did not care about that, but somehow it came to your mind. <br /> <br /> To be honest and brief; This is one of the worst, boring and stupid slashers ever made. I can not say anything good about this crap because there are no decent sequences that could be said to be made by professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The death scenes are horrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot is somehow good, given that it copied "Popcorn" from 1991. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this is not such a bad movie that it's good. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried to do his best, but it was not enough.
