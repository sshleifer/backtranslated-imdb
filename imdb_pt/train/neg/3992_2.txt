Director Spike Lee is famous for making films targeting racism. In many films, like "Do the Right Thing," most whites are all brutal racist. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism being once again the whole issue. <br /> <br /> What Lee does, however, is once again demonstrate his fanaticism against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards that exist in the world of cinema. If Lee or anyone else produced that kind of prejudice against another group, he would be defamed, but Christians? Hey, it's "open season" on them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, a reverend in this movie, shoots his son and then puts the smoking gun on top of his bible. They zoom in to another close just in case you have lost. Hey, guys, here's another Bible reader and see what he's like! Lee does this sort of thing in almost every movie he does. <br /> <br /> He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations. Who could argue with portraying racism as a bad thing? However, Lee perpetuates this film as he does in his other films. His obvious bitterness toward whites does not help the situation. This only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: start "doing the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, "get over it." <br /> <br /> This is very bad because the subject could have made an intriguing movie if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.
