It's quite surreal what these flies can do ... eh well ... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen in it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must tell you that I love animated films. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is just a list of flaws: <br /> <br /> 1) I quoted the slogan. It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I did not see any, at least not something special that I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) The "flies" in this movie do not look like real flies. At least they could make them black. But cyano flies seriously? With giant heads and fine torsos? <br /> <br /> 3) The story. I think it was written for 6 year olds. I could say that in two sentences it is too simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "They are American files after all!" Give me some time off.
