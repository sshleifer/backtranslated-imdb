When I saw that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, score! I admit, I was eager to see the movie. And I must say that the first fifteen minutes were somewhat nostalgic. Then it was all downhill. I did not expect it to be a politically correct civil rights eviction. They picked up all the possible controversial topics and threw them into a stupid story. I was shocked that Noah was involved in anything of the kind, especially his role. No one with a fully functioning brain would accept all this crap about the Vietnam War. If anyone really wants to know what communism was like, sit down and read a book about it. And not the one who praises or is against it, only the hard and cold facts. <br /> <br /> I just watched some scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was all that interested me. . Everything else about this movie pissed me off.
