First of all, what is good about the movie? Some pretty actress? the exotic background? the fact that the actors do not laugh while they act (I would have if I were in their situation)? I do not know. The plot is simple: a Catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his younger brother, a prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...). I'm afraid there's nothing here to learn or think about serial killers, art, or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of "profiler" (the series) with surrogate actors and unbelievable coincidences (the uncle is the policeman who, the girl who lives in the house of another victim can have a baby with the priest, etc. ., etc).
