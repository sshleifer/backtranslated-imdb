I can hardly believe I watched it again last night after more than 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time ago, I watched 6 Fu movies in a row ... Boris Karloff, and all 5 Chris Lees. The last two Lees, both directed (and I use that word loosely) by Jess Franco, were abominable. At the time, I skipped this one, remembering that, in a way, it was even worse. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched. Never. Do you know what is worse than an abominable movie? A very well done piece of S ***. And that's what FIENDISH PLOT is. It's a very beautiful film. GREAT production design, scenery, costumes, music, photography, editing, especially good cast, some decent acting ... <br /> <br /> ... and absolutely, positively, one of the WORST SCRIPTS in film history! ! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so misleading ... one can confuse this with a decent movie. And then they start to sing "Happy Birthday to Fu" ... and goes down. Having Burt Kwouk (of whom his master says, "His face - is familiar") accidentally pour Fu's elixir to put out a fire, resulting in his condemnation of torture, burial and cutting of one of his ears, was the similar to how funny they had. It was as if someone decided they wanted to make an "exaggerated" movie - so ridiculous that it would be funny. RIDICULOUS, it's ... FUNNY ... IT IS NOT. It's sad, because it became clear in the first few minutes that someone did MANY searches on the Fu Manchu series to get both "right". With a different script - be it a really FUNNY or a SERIOUS dead, they could have - could - have - have a classic in their hands. A movie that could have made us forget the horror of these atrocities of Jess Franco ... instead of making one want to unearth them as masterpieces in comparison. <br /> <br /> There was a period in the late 70's when a lot of classic characters from the 1930s were revived in films that were universally horrible. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lonely Patrolman, Charlie Chan and even Doc Savage. Not sure, this may be the worst of the lot. It took a lot of self-control not to move forward in whole parts, especially in scenes that contained Sid Caesar (the FBI chief who was also Al Capone's cousin - do you understand what I mean?). It's not just that the movie's ideas are not funny ... they generally do not make any sense. Like when "audition" cops to represent the king and the queen, and we end up seeing people "hearing" dance routines like singing, dancing and riding a unicycle. How many drugs did the writers of this thing have to do to make it meaningful to them? <br /> <br /> As I said, a shame ... and a real waste of all this talent, including that of Peter Sellers (who played Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (who was in a Chris movie Lee Fu in his time), Helen Mirren (the police woman who falls shockingly in love with the villain and almost steals the last half hour of the movie!). I begin to wonder if someone will NEVER make a "fit" movie of Fu Manchu, or will fans have to settle for Karloff being almost the ONLY one?
