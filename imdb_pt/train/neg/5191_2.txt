Ahh, the tedious t.v. shows and riders who were beaten together in the 70's to make equally darn t.v. movies! Some examples would be Riding With Death, Stranded in Space (confused and uninteresting), San Francisco International (terribly monotonous and incredibly confusing), and that turgid piece of Quinn Martin's glamor. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Hawaii (although you do not know him from outside), he is apparently a failed pilot for a spy show. The real problem is that you do not like most of the characters, including the main character Diamond Head, who seemed half asleep throughout the movie; his boss "Aunt Mary", who had a really strange delivery of his lines and white hair like the tan that seemed to have been stamped; Diamnd Head's girlfriend / colleague (I can not even remember her name) is a thin, wooden woman with a way of talking that is neither sexy nor interesting; and the corner helper Zulu (again, I can not remember the name of his character) that was not bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the entire production was Ian McShane, who was a bad guy, but still proved his acting skills. Despite the makeup work that this so-called "chameleon" used to disguise, it was just laughable. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that led him to dress as a South American dictator cum General American. Do not even care. The plot simply was not interesting enough to hold his attention for up to ten minutes at a time, let alone the hour and a half or so on. Just call this - Hawaii Five No!
