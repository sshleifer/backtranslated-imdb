I like bad movies. I like to rent bad movies with my friends and use them for the duration of them. So there are abominable movies like this. Redline is not just a bad movie, but a telltale sign that perhaps the American film industry should please, for the viewer's sake, at least review the scripts before funding a movie. <br /> <br /> If a stereotype took a crap movie, that movie would generate that. The plot is unbearable, and the whole performance is laughable. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have perhaps the worst screen chemistry I've seen in a long time, and even individually they should be cut off from humanity and beaten with a sack of oranges until they switch professions to street traders. thing that they can legitimately qualify for). Moreover, as Angus Macfadyen was convinced to make this film is so far beyond me that I can not even think of an analogy. I'm a loyal fan of him, but that made me question him. <br /> <br /> In short. Several people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you're a bigger person than I am), so much that it turns into violence (I think). The film is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, as it is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue that does not fit for human ears. This movie is essentially a great car commercial for the first half, and an indecipherable action movie for the rest, should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find a positive aspect for this movie, and I think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits roll. <br /> <br /> Nadia Bjorlin, if you were singing these two songs in this movie, then you are a hack, and I hope old age scares you. <br /> <br /> Q. If you rent this movie looking for a ridiculous experience, listen to the lyrics of Nadia Bjorlin's incredible songs.
