It was 1974 and starred Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> All that tells you what to expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film, Slovik had retired, gotten a good woman, and did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik may have been an innocent naive, or he may have just tried to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Whoever Slovik was or was not for the story to decide, but this was a film that dealt with the discussion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting, and the movie took No respect to the military that were in Vietnam in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's face it, it was about the Vietnam War, not about World War II), the EoES was as propaganda as Gung Ho was in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik stated his position, simple and simple. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a nervous clinical condition, and trust me, if I had done military duty, it would not have been a problem for me or just let my nerves go and fail in my tasks and get a demotion or put on KP's duty or latrine duty without any problem <br /> <br /> If we believed in the teleflick, Slovik did not have that option, no doubt because of his criminal history. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer. I learned that the films of this decade or decade, when dealing with military service or service, will have the same posture over and over again. <br /> <br /> 1940 and 1950, serve your country. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The 1960s and 1970s, he mocked his country. <br /> <br /> This is the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed predictably Hollywood to me. He refused to serve and only when he was being tied to run does he show emotion. Such an emotional explosion could have easily worked to his advantage in his statement of his nervous condition but obviously the film wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sad . <br /> <br /> I'm not Catholic, but I thought the recitation of Hail Mary by Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end with the Lord's Prayer was funny as it seemed they were trying to see who could say that faster. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this movie could be seen without realizing it was meant for Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope it's worth for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example.
