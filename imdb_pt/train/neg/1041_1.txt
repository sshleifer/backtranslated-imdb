How many more of these fake "slice of life" movies need to be made? Hopefully not too much. <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is a very conscious attempt by director Peter Solett to attract the attention of Hollywood. Nothing wrong with that in general. What's wrong with this particular movie is that it ignores the public and accumulates all the clich√©s from the supposedly "daring" production book of independent Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be "real", so the left shakes the audience. camera "documentary style", except that no documentary filmmaker would shake the camera on purpose ... <br /> <br /> It is "bold" so let's not waste time illuminating the film. <br /> <br /> It's "hip", so let's make kids use profanity like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> And so on, and so on. All that's left is a very conscious attempt to impress Hollywood that will not impress anyone outside the "rarefied" indie crowd who seems to still be acclaimed in every bad movie.
