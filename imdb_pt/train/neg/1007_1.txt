I found it very difficult to see this after the initial 5 minutes of the movie. I managed to stretch 45-50 minutes before turning it off with disgust and watch Monster House (which, by the way, is a lot of fun). <br /> <br /> The story has huge holes. The plot is extremely stated and dull, the acting is horrible, especially from Justin Timberlake, who must stick to what he is good at (looking like an idiot and singing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he was made to dance to the sound of rock for no apparent reason in the middle of the movie, after he and Timberlake met. The Freeman and Timberlake characters seem to have some sort of parent-child relationship or something, which is simply not obvious except for the fact that; although Freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for Timberlake's somewhat stupid, stupid character, he never less strives to help him discover a completely ridiculous cover-up. <br /> <br /> An incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the plot, which is simply absurd and out of any proportion. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time.
