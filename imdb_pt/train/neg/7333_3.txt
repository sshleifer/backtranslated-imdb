I liked the feel of the first few minutes, but 20 minutes later I was applying the fast forward button. Many photos of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) walking from room to room, in the hallways, through the doors and down the street, and so many photos of him looking pensive and confused. It gave me the impression that the story had originally been a short one (20-30 minutes), and then stretched into a trait like a love job between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they co-wrote the screenplay). It might have been more fun if one of the characters had something to say that I had not heard of many other films before, or if the ending was not - disappointingly - what I had anticipated three minutes into. film (atypical for an independent studio movie / minor). At least his heart was in the right place-it was not his formidable standard of Hollywood manipulation.
