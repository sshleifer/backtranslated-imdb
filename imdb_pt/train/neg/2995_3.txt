Only on one very rare occasion does an episode of the x files fail to generate any excitement or the episode contains something that is totally tedious to watch. A detective and his ex-partner die in unexplained circumstances. The deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths happened. Mulder has created a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has returned reincarnated as the little girl and is demanding revenge. Now for the bizarre part. no connection at all and it just seems like a random person chosen as reincarnation. I think this was a little lazy writing by writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x file history!
