If movies like Ghoulies pluck Gremlins, then Hobgoblins plunges into the new level of garbage theft as Ghoulies. These badly animated puzzles have some sort of scheme for performing fantasies (which basically involve the sexual dreams of grotesque characters - oh joy), but what this has to do with anything is a guess, except let the director satisfy his perverse attraction to literature erotic . They show this in the eighth circle of Hell, we suspect. There is no real plot - just "goblins - kill!" and mild attempts at humor and a slight attempt to arouse the audience.
