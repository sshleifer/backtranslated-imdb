I used to love this movie as a kid, but seeing it again 20 years later actually sucks. Up The Academy could be ahead of its time in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Films like Caddyshack and Stripes are much better today than this steamy dogpile. No T & A There are no big jokes except for the one-liners we've all heard a million times so far. <br /> <br /> I recently bought the DVD in the hope that it would be the jewel I remembered it to be. Well, I was out! The soundtrack had only 2 to 3 widely recognized hits (not the big collection that others have mentioned) and the frequent narrations were terrible. The only thing that was interesting to me was to predict what the character was talking about before they were spoken. Yes, I watched this movie at the time! <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm writing this review is to give my two cents about why this movie should be forgotten, I'm sorry to say. :(
