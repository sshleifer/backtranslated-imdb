Wow ... pure glow. <br /> <br /> Turning a thriller / suspense / horror into a comedy. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I never laughed so much into a horror movie before ... a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed - or not written in depth or too deep. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a horror movie absolutely written with stupid dialogue, messy plot, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and poor overall development, then this is the one to watch. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay focused on the classic "food processor" scene and the totally inept scenes of the police investigation. /> <br /> This is a remarkable new bass in the performance of the screen and writing and sitting for any duration causes you to be stupid, daring or bold.
