Ok, so I found out about this movie and I watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether I should watch it or not. Before I even watched the movie I was emotionally strange about it. I was so unsure if I was going to watch this and be disturbed for a long time. So I choose to take a chance and watched and here's what I thought: the beginning started well for me. It seemed to be going in a decent direction. I ended the rape scene and could not understand why people were so upset or bored with the movie. Do not get me wrong, the rape scene was so sad and scary, but it did not really bother me in one dramatic spot. Then, when the middle came, I understood the boring things that were happening. There was like 5 minutes of photos of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing! it's one thing to have a chance where a person is showing some kind of emotion, but this movie does not have it. He had about 3 of these nonsensical scenes where you see the main Maya character sort of get out of control but did not show the right making me want to move fast. So when she got involved in the hardcore party, it was not so boring, but still a bit boring. Oh, and as a note, Rosario Dawson still did a great job. Okay, moving on, finally, after an hour of worthlessness in the middle, revenge comes to Maya's attention. This is where it got disturbing. I did not feel bad for him or anything, he got what he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I felt completely behind him. I can not really tell you whether or not you should watch this movie because it's so ... I do not know, I can not find a word to summarize. But if you choose to watch it, do not be dissatisfied.
