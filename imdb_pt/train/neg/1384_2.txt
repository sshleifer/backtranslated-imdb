Jet Li is one of the best melee fighters in the world. He is over 20 years old and he puts others in the genre to shame. While it is large in Asia, it is almost unknown here in the US. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is supposed to be an escape movie for him, but fails horribly. First of all, it is dubbed. Although it may have value camping (the dubbing is not even close and it is flat), it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer. Second, the director of this film, Daniel Lee, does a horrible job. He cuts scenes so fast, sometimes you do not know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and shakes. Fans see Jet Li's films for fantastic martial arts. However, the director edits the scenes so fast you do not even know who's who in half the time! Other times, a scene hangs (Li is starting to make a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the bad guys arm their guns, two seconds later, both Li and love interest are already under the car!) Other scenes are so unlikely , that they go through the point of being completely ridiculous (killer CD roms? just give it Throwing Stars !!!!). Li, you need a director who is less prone to hacking machine guns and more to creating a cinematic mise-a-scene. The added rap / techno music goes all the way to intrusive. The plot has possibilities, but they are all wasted by caricature characters who take whatever credibility this film strives for. And we really must believe that love interest would not recognize Simon, because he has a half mask? Would not the hair, the lower jaw or the voice give it? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or your classic Shaolin Temple. This disjointed mess is a complete waste of time ..... 2/10
