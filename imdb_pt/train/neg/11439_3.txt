It was obvious that this movie was designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience, which I've watched and enjoyed most of. However, this was a very annoying attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who became annoying as hell in herself). Her acting was exaggerated and it seemed she was anxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This movie may have been more, since there was adequate budget for scenarios, actors and a decent plot. My wife and I agreed that this was 'Muck' in the end, since the movie ended in a painful and embarrassing success! Better luck next time, I hope Miss Graham clings to the kind of movies she belongs to as hell.
