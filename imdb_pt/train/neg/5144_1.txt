The orange shade for everything was just disgusting. Oh yeah, the main character lives in a ghetto that's all orange in color with orange people. Meanwhile, to escape mentally from this overwhelming body poverty, she plays a full immersion video game (which sucks, since no rule is clear and no logic follows gameplay). She apparently earns an income by playing the game, but she is revealed not to be an employee of the gaming company. Many non-speaking pauses later the story creeps slowly. It uses an orange computer interface with an operating interface that is visually annoying and I can only suspect a future version of Microsoft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I, the viewer, ask basically why is she wasting her precious time on some idiotic game when she barely has the necessities of life? Oh yeah, playing games is fun, but what's the point when you're almost starving? While she is disorienting her life by playing a filthy total immersion game, even more orange, her dog runs away (probably looking for an owner who pays at least one moment of attention to him and feeds him regularly) or is stolen from the woman (while she is ignoring his terrible orange reality). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile she becomes obsessed by some game that her game team has lost all the uninteresting movie. To yawn. So she wants to be the best of the best, go get Ash Catchem (you have to be bored at all). Golly, this main character is also a human drug and has no redeeming qualities beyond her physical beauty (which she could trade in some way to escape her overwhelming poverty). <br /> <br /> So she reaches the "Real" level and at least is not a horrible drug and she is sent to kill an ex-colleague in comatose state mentally living on the "Real" level. Finally, the annoying, dirty orange movie is no longer a tedious task to watch, but it has the potential to say something like "the main character is trapped in imaginary, computer-generated poverty and she's in the real world now." Maybe she makes the murder and lives in the real world now? Well, she kills the guy and he disappears into a digital effect. Wow!! Thank you dumb director. You suck, you suck, director. <br /> <br /> Here the director had a chance to redeem himself a little by burying this filthy, stupid movie with a philosophical touch. The director could have said, "THE REAL WORLD is there, and if you live in it and contribute to improve it, it will not be a land of poverty tinted orange." A clever way to make this shocking movie an agonizingly slow lesson on basic civic pride (for 1% of viewers who have not found something really fun to watch right now or are movie masochists). <br /> <br /> No, director. The director had to ruin all of this by throwing some digital effect and ruining all chances of ransom for this horrible movie that was a waste of money, a waste of time and a waste of the viewer's confidence. <br /> After that, it ends. Good trip. I hope the director chokes on that. I'm putting this HACK on my "avoid all costs" list for any other movies that your name is attached to.
