... because that was just awful. The Dalmatians were funny, even if they were stereotyped, but this is nothing more than childish joke. The same plot, except with the story drawn from it; the most intelligent and horribly most annoying macaw in the world; Tim McInnerny proving that he really can not do comedy (Everone remembers Percy in Blackadder, but that was his highest point - it's all downhill since); direction so bad that if a group of college students did that, you'd throw it in the trash and ask you to do it again - this time, properly. Ieuan Grufford should return to Hornblower, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu must hide for several years. <br /> <br /> Maybe I can be too hard; after all I could not sit through the movie. Gets 1/10; just because I can not give 0.
