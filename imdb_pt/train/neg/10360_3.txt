I was excited when I saw the ads in this movie because I recently read the book and I really liked it. The film, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for major disappointments, as is often the case when stories are translated into films. The characters do not seem to fit very well with the book. The steering was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was happening. The dialogue did not adequately explain what was happening. It just seemed like a slap and it ran. After all, I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you did not read the book, it could be all right. At the very least, this can lead you to read the book, which you will probably like more. <br /> <br />
