This movie was an absolute torture. First of all, it's a whopping 4+ hours in length! It is true that Kargil's war may have had several points that were captured and fought, but each of these battles did not need to be shown. So maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial movie as advertised. Of course it does not look like it, since enough information was not given and there were some flaws. The battle sequences were so poorly executed. I'm terribly disappointed with the man who did well-done sequences at Border. Each battle was exactly the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This can be a spoiler.) The whole army marches up, five or more soldiers curse five thousand times each (they also use the same spit every time), one of the main actors is shot, someone yells for a stretcher, the actor says, "No, do not get a stretcher. It will take 6 men from the battalion," and then an actor dies. This same thing happens repeatedly. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the movie is too big for its own good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters was well developed. The actresses had the tiniest roles. They are all dressed up and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were crying in synchronization. It was so comical. They moved their hands and heads at exactly the same time and then bit their duped together. <br /> <br /> The list goes on and on. I know I'm still forgetting something. Anyway, I think I hit the movie enough for you to understand the picture.
