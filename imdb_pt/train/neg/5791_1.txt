As a native film teacher, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst native content movies I've ever seen. I'd rather get a root canal than see this movie again. The use of stereotypes, non-creative attempts to use snippets of stories from traditional coyotes and bad camera work were only compounded by the uninspiring story line and poor script. The writer and director have shown the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying native people and communities. If this person is native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and the internalized racism and weak sense of humor they have developed. If this person is not a native, he must seriously reexamine his white privilege and ask himself if he is exhibiting unintentional, unintentional racism, or if he is intentionally ignorant. My only hope is that the native actors in this movie have had fun and at least have been paid for their efforts. If you want to see good native films, then check out: Christmas in the clouds, dance me outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, smoke signals ... to name just a few.
