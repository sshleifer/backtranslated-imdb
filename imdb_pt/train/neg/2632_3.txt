It saddens me to rate a movie with many of my favorite actors, places and genres, namely, Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC and political thriller, but 'The Sentinel' actually reaches a low point. It's as if they had a great idea up front, signed the right cast and had some great photos of the city and then took a vacation letting the rest crew improvise the rest. And I wish I could blame Basinger's other bland performance (not only do I feel she's one of Hollywood's worst actors, but I'm still steaming over a decade after she was the only one, and definitely just a bad actor in film, to win an actor Oscar for 'LA Confidential'.) But it was not the only problem. Sutherland, who I love as Jack Bauer at 24, again plays Jack. I miss the old days of 'A Time to Kill' or 'A Few Good Men'. Douglas certainly had a hiatus from acting and phoned this on. Synopsis: Someone, some traitor to the Secret Service, wants the dead president and Douglas is being (at random) framed. Will someone believe him? In fact, there is no spoiler here: as soon as they created the subframe in half, it's over before you know it. And why does anyone want the president to die? Will this be revealed in the sequence? Many holes, many doors open and never closed and very predictable 'The Sentinel' is. If you watch only one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who is familiar with these types of movies or even seen an episode of "Law and Order" that you will see in the first few frames. It was terrible? Not really, the cinematography was good, and although Sutherland played Jack again, he still managed.
