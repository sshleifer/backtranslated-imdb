The producers made a big mistake in climbing Mark Lester, who could not act or sing, in the lead role. In addition to his very bad acting, all of Lester's chants had to be dubbed by a girl. I do not know why they cast it, since there would have been so many boys who could have played the role infinitely better and made their own singing too. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, who should have been only 16. The current version of the West End is much better than the film in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly much cuter than Jack Wild. It was clearly political to attribute to this outdated musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968.
