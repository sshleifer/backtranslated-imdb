I still have to read Shirley Jackson's novel, something I wanted to do some time ago. I'm sure it has to be more scary than this movie. I remember jumping once when I watched it the other day, though I do not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great and I watched this on DVD, but I'm sure that in the movies it must have been an incredible sight. After the first special effects were done, I was waiting for a story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I figured this movie had to be based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there. but it was not. I was relegated to facing the beautiful character of Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the film, basically because there was not much else to watch. Lili Talor was such a bad character. I did not like her at all, it was about crying people. Also, the guy in this movie reminded me of the cartoon Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters. Quigon, aham Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some kind of acting. <br /> <br /> Half a quarter of the way I was dying to go see a Friday the 13th or an exaggeration Scream Queenish movie! At least there is some kind of entertainment value. If there is no story, at least they fill up with bloody deaths or attractive women. That had nothing. <br /> <br />
