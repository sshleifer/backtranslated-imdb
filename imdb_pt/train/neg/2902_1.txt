A group of passive-aggressive people having family reunion. The script makes them say and do things people would never do, at least with a grain of decency. The hero falls in love with a woman he sees as his soul mate in a bookstore on the day of the meeting, unaware that she will appear as his brother's girlfriend at the meeting. He tries to postpone his brother's statement but she, knowing that our hero is clearly in love with her, provokes him mercilessly wearing sexy clothes and behaving like a stripper, rubbing his brother in an excuse that she is showing him stretch . At one point, she really undresses and goes into a shower with him. He tries to cover his eyes. Your heart is breaking. She finds it funny, until she suddenly decides she does not want her brother and leaves the meeting. <br /> <br /> The movie really creeps. The audience coughed and moved the long way. The writing is unintelligent and unintelligible. We almost quit, but we kept thinking that something would certainly happen that would cheer things up, but nooooo. All the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills, to fool the poor idiots like me into seeing this crap. Comparing with Little Miss Sunshine ??? Wow. Shame on them, the writers, the actors, the producers and the theaters to let anything so bad get to the screen!
