This is a low budget Scream movie. "Maddy" is a new employee in an unnamed office where she meets and begins a relationship with her co-worker "Chris". During a whirlwind party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy that they belong to a "Murder Club," where they all killed someone for fun. When Maddy loses and kills someone for real, hijinks happen. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, and there are requirements for this genre and budget level (nudity, blood, maybe some star cameos a little larger than the cast), but after the credits, you you wonder why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching.
