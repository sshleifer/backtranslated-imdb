I really wanted to like this movie - the filming was filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had wonderful pictures. But even for a cartoon shot, it was a really badly made movie. The continuity and pace were just terrible. The best parts of the film are under the final credits, so (almost) it's worth keeping it to the end (although, strangely, it takes a little bit in the last half hour or so). <br /> When the best performance in a movie is from Andy Dick, you know there has to be a problem ...
