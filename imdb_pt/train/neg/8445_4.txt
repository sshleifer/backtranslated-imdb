For me, every work of art must be judged by these criteria: Form, Function and Meaning. Guernsey seems to be devoted to forms: cool and sometimes interesting photos. The long closes suggest a function that the viewer can fill by himself. Because of the lack of texts, the story becomes a test. An introverted person suggests having depth, but sometimes it happens that he has nothing to say. This movie acts as an introvert. If you did not read the synopsis, you can not see that it was suicide (and the unanswered question, Why?) That changes Anna's view of life and makes her suspicious. 'Why do not you talk to me?' asks Sebastian. Anna does not respond, she just starts looking at him a long time without saying a word. What is the purpose of this shot? What does that mean? My question is how Sebastiaans: What does this movie have to say? What is meant by this film? The answer to me: shows us a handful of people with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. Reasons behind your actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, residences, landscapes. Nice and artistic done, but meaningless, without having provision of "instructions for use". In my opinion, this movie is made for other artists, not for the average viewer.
