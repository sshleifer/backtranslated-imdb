Have you ever wondered what would happen if a pair of Beverly Hills 90210 characters were thrown into a Thai prison? If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV audience. That would be ok, but the story was poorly executed. Plot twists, poor dialogues, and unresolved issues are plentiful. This little movie has not earned the right to be as enigmatic as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and impossibly absurd plot - the moment of false tension filled up when the hotel employee discovers that the girls do not have a room there and are about to kick them out. (This moment is played improperly with the same solemnity and gravity of the moment they are caught under the sight of a weapon.) Later, the same hotel employee is found - and Bangkok is a big city, remember, I was there - and I testified against the girls, as if a couple of Mai Tais guaranteed 40 years in prison. Come on. Rent another day in paradise instead.
