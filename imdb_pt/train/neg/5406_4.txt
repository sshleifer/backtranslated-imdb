My first thoughts on this movie were, of course, bad. I was expecting horrible acting, lousy, bad entertainment, a ridiculous special effects movie. What I got was not so bad. The special effects were absolutely horrible, but I found the movie itself. quite interesting, and the script was actually very good and decent. The acting was not so bad, and overall I had fun watching this movie. It's still a very bad movie, but it's not completely useless as I thought it would be and I'm glad to know that this movie managed to impress me even when it was not so good. Overall, it's a movie that should be avoided, but for me it was not as bad as I had hoped. be.
