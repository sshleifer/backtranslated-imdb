I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. Even he could not make this movie enjoyable. The only reason I watched until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure that my students never did anything that bad ... but it took all my bowel strength to sit down. It's like watching your great-grandmother flirting with a 15-year-old boy ... painfully painful. <br /> <br /> If you took the real film, dipped it in the paint thinner, and then watch it, it would be more fun. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the S-Mart box, move away from it like a rattlesnake.
