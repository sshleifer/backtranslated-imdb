I've seen some bad movies in my life, but this one must be among the worst. Definitely the background material 100 (imo, that is). We followed two couples, the Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and the Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron). like Candy) in a car on a roadtrip to Reno. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Lonnie is not very happy with his sex life, so he betrays his wife with Candy, who is trying to have a baby. Roy, meanwhile, is not sure if his sperm is OK, so he's checking the doctor. <br /> <br /> Now, I read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend did not, and she let slip after about 20 minutes: 'oh yes, she will end up pregnant, but the husband can not have no baby '. Spot on, as this movie is sooooo predictable. As well as boring. It's boring. Meaningless. Offensive. Terrible. <br /> <br /> An example of how much this movie smells bad. The two couples leave in their big car toward Nevada, when they are stopped by two policemen, as they did not stop at a stop sign. The guys meet each other and finally bribe the two officers with a box of beer. This scene is not only useless and not important (or even relevant) to the film, it takes about 5 minutes! Just talk and talk and talk, without ever going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to throw up thinking in the end. Apparently, Roy is not having problems down there, so he's the father of the child. How many times does this happen in the movies ... try something new! Ultimately, the deceived wife forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and everyone lives happily ever after. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie is at the end, with some pictures of the Grand Canyon. Why could not they keep the camera for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> One would expect more from this cast (though Thornton really does try), but you can not blame them. Writers, what a shame! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
