National Treasury is as over-rated and exaggerated as they come. Nicholas Cage is by no means an action hero, and this movie is not "Indiana Jones". People who compared this movie to the classic Indiana Jones trilogy have fallen seriously rocker. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine what kind of target audience this movie was filming. Maybe the preteen adolescent likes it, but I find it absolutely ridiculous. I also can not imagine adults or young adults who find this great movie. Simply put: it's simply good, at best. <br /> <br /> The National Treasury is unimaginable and uninspired, borrowing what it has from "The Da Vinci Code." I would recommend waiting for the film to be released in 2006, and convey that nonsense. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​being able to steal the Declaration of Independence so easily and run all over Washington and Philadelphia. with this (while never damaging it once), while fighting the "bandits" and experiencing what is supposed to be "non-stop action" is absurd. I particularly loved the scene with the Declaration folded in its tube, in the middle of a busy street, while cars pass without damaging it. Oh brother! It reminded me of the "Brady Bunch" episode where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Except that episode of Brady Bunch was so much better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such a treasure that no one believes exists to be buried inside a secret US ruin is strange. Literally, there are thousands of "invaluable" items not discovered in this treasure. Okay, right!! Ridiculous!! Worse yet, the speed and precision with which Cage finds and discovers what "difficult" clues should be to these ancient puzzles are pre-post !!! Oh .. mankind! <br /> <br /> The performances of Cage, Voight and the other actors of "National Treasure" are as rigid, wooden and flat as they come. However, when you are working with such a bad dialogue, it is hard to blame the 100% of the actor for this. <br /> <br /> The National Treasure is an OK movie to see once. We can not recommend in addition and definitely would not buy it over the top, strange hunter hunting of a mess. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you have to see this first .......
