This could have been a very good movie if I could watch it. The handheld camera was very lively. Of the opening credits, I was worried. Many of us who watched this seemed very sick in the end. But we stayed until the end, because it was such a charming and interesting film, giving some tips for young pop culture in South Africa. The black-and-white film enhanced his artistic feel. The performance seemed very authentic. Part of the dialogue was a bit difficult to understand, but a theater full of non-South Africans seemed to find it mostly funny. If you're nauseous, you may seriously consider ignoring this movie. It is singular, but not worth the nausea.
