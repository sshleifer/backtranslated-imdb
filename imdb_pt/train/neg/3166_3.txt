I confess I have a rather uncomfortable feeling about ghosts, and while I sometimes like the genre when it comes to terror, but when it comes to comedies, they really need to be crazy to be funny. 'Over Your Dead Body' seems to take life after death a little seriously, and fails in my opinion of almost any aspect that I can think of. The story is completely unbelievable, of course, and could not convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental record. The choice of leading actresses was horrible. While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy, his character's ladies' tastes seem to need serious improvements, as Eva Longoria seems too old (sorry) for him, and Lake Bell looks unattractive (sorry again). A romantic story without sufficient reason for romance is due to failure from the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better, but they had only supporting roles. The rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat cinematography and cheap jokes borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies. Nothing really worth watching, nothing to remember.
