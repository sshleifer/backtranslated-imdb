I'm in bad movies, but this has nothing to do. Despite what the idiots have said, it's not funny. I know underground and comedy movies, but this is so annoying that the Director / Writer should be banned from NEVER directing anything beyond the local cable access EVER again! To love movies and comedies is to despise this movie. I can never get over how boring and annoying this job was. If you like this movie you are a pothead as sober has nothing here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or the beginning of John Waters. The movie begins by defining satire and I challenge anyone to show me the satire. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUN, you can say or do anything, but if it's not funny you're not satirical, you're not nervous, you're merely pathetic and this movie just is not funny. ZERO!
