Jimmy Dean could not have been more hammy or absurdly rude. Hysterical, if seen through the eyes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I classify as 10. I mean, the sight of this obese, corn-fed pig walking around Malta should be enough to send you to vomit if you do. far in the movie. This hysterical and ugly farce should be put under names like "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh". A film like this proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc. stay behind on their mortgages, or get stoned to the point of insanity. This raises the question "who was so stupid to finance such a whale?" But then, if common sense prevailed and "Final Justice" never existed, then we would not have the delicious spoof voice in "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
