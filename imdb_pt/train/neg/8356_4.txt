Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his tear line readings nullify any irony or humor in the dialogue. He exchanges sassy barbs and non-witty replicas with Brooke Shields as if he were a block of wood with reared hair; even his minor touches (such as fingering a nonexistent mustache on his gray face) reveal not a character but an insecure actor being directed by himself, an unsure filmmaker. In the Southwest, around 1950, a poor player (not above a bit of cheating) beats an orphaned Lolita teenager in a shoddy poker game; After getting hold of a treasure map that promises gold in the Grand Canyon, the two become gold prospectors. Some enchanting views and a strange but interesting appearance by Henry Fonda as a gray-haired canyon are the only compensations in the fatigued comedy-drama, with the two protagonists being followed by murderous caricatures who do not stop for nothing until they get their hands on that map . Shields is very handsome, but - although the camera loves her, beauty is brilliant - she has no presence on screen (and her low voice has no reach at all); every time she opens her mouth, the person is inclined to shrink or lower. * 1/2 of ****
