Depending entirely on your own state of mind when you watch, "Christmas Evil" can become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller or one of the most pathetic and infuriated holiday slashers ever made. I personally am tempted to opt for the latter because I did not bother to do any research and simply anticipate a tacky and unscrupulous 80s slasher with a nutcase in a Santa costume by massacring people. Wrong! The film actually deals with a guy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a toy factory and considers it his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves gifts and who deserves punishment. Did all of Harry's problems begin when he witnessed Santa? Your father in a fantasy, obviously? caress her mother's bare legs at a tenderly young age. After that, he became a social pariah, to the irritation of his younger brother, who is about to take a (holi) day. I completely understand why certain fans enjoy this rather eccentric horror movie, but does it really have to be so annoying? There are several long and seemingly endless parts of the movie, in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the lack of blood and the scandalous bloodshed, but this movie does not even benefit from a disturbing atmosphere or unexpectedly insane twists (with the notable exception of the end, I must admit). In addition, I would have taken the concept more seriously if the deranged protagonist had focused on punishing impertinent children. It does not kill and kill exclusively adults who do not behave well. How should you take seriously the controversial and original Christmas thriller when Santa does not commit a miserable child murder? That would have made "Christmas Evil" a classic, while now it's just a forgettable and deplorable piece of crap.
