Spoiler !! I love Branagh, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I loved them together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - but THIS - I can understand an actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but really - the script went on, Bonham-Carter's outfits were very chic, and the occasional "crazy" fast-paced sequel might have been an outlet for a Beatles movie, or old Rowan and Martin Laugh- Em . <br /> <br /> I never understood the point - other commentators say that the character Branagh was a dreamer. I've never felt it. He was a loser, not a very brilliant one, and he certainly was not nice. The deal with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch. Certainly not fun. Bonham-Carter's realistic attempts (as it were) as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire's "Full Monty" accent. The poetic end, with him on top of a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his plane, was too orchestrated. Was there a chorus of angels, or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Go back to the classics or something with a column and a bow for it. Give it to PBS. <br /> <br />
