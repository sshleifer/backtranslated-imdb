First of all I would like to point out that I only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching. I think it's the most annoying show on TV. There's nothing funny about any of the "jokes" and the canned laughter is unbearable. The show would work much better if it were filmed in front of a live audience. That way, laughter would show just how "bland" the show is. However, I credit the talents of the young cast. However, it pisses me off that they will look back at the program in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. The show links well with the overall irritating voices and style of the CBBC presenters. Why the youth of today needs to be shouted with so much more than me. That is all.
