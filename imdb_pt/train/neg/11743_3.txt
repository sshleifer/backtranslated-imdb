I really can not say anything bad * or * good about this thing. His characters are quite nice, he is competently produced and designed and has a professional look (except for that monstrous jumpsuit). However, you have no originality, no ideas, and nothing that you have not seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, cookie cutter, dirty movie "corporate drones in deep space versus unstoppable monster". Almost a waste of time.
