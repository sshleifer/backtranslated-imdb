This is a typical example of technically highly skilled video / commercial directors trying to make their first full-length feature film. On the one hand, the images, the camera, the lighting, the CGI and even the sound are highly polished and have a really "expensive" appearance and appearance. Even the actors show a certain amount of potential - to the point where even the best acting can not hide a bad plot. <br /> <br /> In that case, it is not a bad plot, but hardly a plot. So, 50% of the dialogue is "What the hell was that?", "What was that?" and "What the hell was that?" In neither case, any of the characters nor the public is provided with the slightest hint of a response though. In most other dialogues we have the feeling that there was never any form of dialogue book and the actors had to improvise freely for a plot that was never explained to them. The only reason why Skye Bennet's performance could be so good that her character as an autistic girl did not allow her to give her those tragically horrible lines of dialogue that the other actors had to deal with. In this way, she was able to showcase her acting talent that the rest of the cast could not even get close to. I mean, there's not an actor in the world who can make up for such a dialogue: <br /> <br /> Ben: That's real, huh? Emily: Stop that. Ben: A mass psychosis, huh? Jon: Someone has to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not for you, not for anyone. Emily: Not for you either. Ben: No, it made me shiver. But not for horror, but for the horrible attempt. At times I felt embarrassed that the actors had added this to their lives. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
