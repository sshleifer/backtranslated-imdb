Does anyone think this show really helps some people, or just annoys the people they watch? When I'm flipping through the channels and I come across this show, I kind of watch the morbid curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all together. what I do not know is whether their viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they hear what he has to say. Pat Roberson is of little importance. he is an old man who thinks in an ancient way. the fear of condemnation no longer has the same effects as before (thanks to God). Now, if anyone answers my question, I'll dodge lightning for the rest of eternity.
