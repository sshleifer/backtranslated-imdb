This is a problem I have with movies that come on television when there is nothing left to watch. Somehow, I'm sucked into really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this one was reasonably watchable. The concept of being the only ones left on Earth after a comet, and then discovering that zombies are around makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie a 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but that way it makes you laugh (too stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I think I just watched because the Star Trek guy was the leader. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and he was the only funny character anyway.
