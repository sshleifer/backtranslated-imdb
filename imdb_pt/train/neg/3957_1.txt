The original Boogeyman was a silly but fun supernatural horror movie. It was by no means a great movie, but fun in the right mood. The third part of this series, Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is simply atrocious. It consists of two things. First of all, new cheap and lifeless footage. Second, recycled bit LOADS of the first film. The new material is incredibly amateur, but not in a fun and inept way, just incredibly tedious. This footage was clearly hit quickly and effortlessly. It serves as a framing device for the endless clips of the first (and possibly second) movies. And boy, they order the clips from the previous films; sometimes reusing sequences repeatedly. The only new addition to these parts is a voice that describes, senselessly, exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of seeing this is truly mind-boggling. <br /> <br /> The return of the bogeyman is an example of the worst kind of exploitation film; the kind that exploits audiences in a highly cynical way. I want to keep this review brief and straightforward, because this movie does not deserve any more. There is nothing here of value at all. This is useless.
