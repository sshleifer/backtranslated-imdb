First of all, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> Everyone from the former Yugoslavia, who are not a Serbian extreme extremist, will agree with me. This film shows the Serbian side and only the Serbian side. No Serbian crime was represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this film was made by Serbs, so there is no neutrality. All the professionals who were interviewed are not professionals. Some guy just read a book written by some Serbian radical, the other is genocide denier etc.etc. <br /> <br /> Even the Slovenes were accused in this film. And the whole war in Slovenia lasted a few days, and only because the Slovenes were lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA failed to reach Slovenia through Croatia (after the Croatian-Serbian war began). Every Slovenian is outraged by all the charges in this film. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable Croatian will agree on one thing: independence was too soon. Perhaps all great conflicts could be avoided. However, mentioning World War II and some unrelated things was a truly pathetic attempt to justify everything. Imagine the Japanese throwing nuclear bombs in Seattle and Washington, and saying that this was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will find no evidence about the strangled YNA soldier and murdered Serbian civilians near Vukovar. But you can find the tape with the reporter stating that his allegations about Serb civilians near Vukovar were lies. All over the internet. And the director forgot to mention all the bombing of Vukovar by the YNA (now of the Serbian and Montenegrin side - and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegrins). And let's not start with the Chetnik movement. In the beginning, it was simply a movement of resistance. But the director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing and the fight against Yugoslav supporters. There are thousands of other things, but all of this can be easily verified. There are many misleading things in this movie. Only a few of the charges are true. Every Croatian is outraged by this movie. <br /> <br /> I believe I need not mention the denial of the genocide of Srebrenica, the genocide that has a lot of evidence. Imagine the film about denial of the holocaust. This movie is the same. And according to this film, the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo were bombed. Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this movie. <br /> <br /> Somehow the director forgot to mention the short occupation of small pieces of Macedonian land (FYROM) by the Serbs. <br /> <br /> Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonians have never entered the Serbian frontiers. If you are not Serbian and have really started to believe in some of the stuff in this film, know that the Serbs have some kind of propaganda that Croatians, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are actually Serbs who made up their story. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of the Serbs will say that this movie is "small" extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> And the Serbian radicals are very, very satisfied with this film (there are about 40% of Serbs who vote for radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. In this documentary called is very little truth, and my advice to all is: Please inquire before watching this movie. After that, you'll just laugh at all the pathetic accusations. Watch real and neutral documentaries on the death of Yugoslavia.
