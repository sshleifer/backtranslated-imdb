Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films of 2001. The movie tries to cross Heathers and Bring It On and fails. When I saw last January I was so disgusted with the movie that I walked and talked on my cell to my girlfriend during the last half hour of the movie. I heard that the DVD has a cut of the director, maybe I'll take a look, but this PG-13 trash film sucks and the worst kind of movie. Maybe if the movie had some T & A that would have done okay. But the jokes are thighs and the acting is horrible. Worse than a Troma movie.
