This is not a movie, it's an evangelical evangelical 111-minute sermon on the red sport of America. Another of the long and sincere messages to the converted are presumed to be then encouraged by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbors. Dialogue like "You won the grand prize when you accepted Christ" misses any possible appeal from the camp by the disturbing intensity of director / coach Alex Kendrick's blackened eyes. Then there are the "parables". <br /> <br /> Two farmers prayed for rain, but only one prepared their field to receive it. What do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question is intended to foreshadow the miraculous climax, in which Coach asks his treacherous kicker on his back: "Son, do you think God could help you kick that?" It is the kind of entertainment we could expect to receive faith-based funding ad infinitum if at least the hegemonic pursuits of the Bush Christian Evangelical Administration around the world had convinced us all to become "devotees" after their example. See the poor Giants train in the apocalyptic end, encouraging their team to cry "Who's with me!" while the devout Eagles on the other side were silently doing the Lord's work. <br /> <br /> So, do you think our terrified support kicks in to overcome the egocentric Goliaths? Well, we all know that the Zealots can not lose. Said as follows: Transfer the playing field to the deserts of the Middle East, replace Christian proselytism, and this virulent absurdity can easily be repackaged as a parable of the Taliban vs. Superpower, that devout adorers of this garbage may want to think about a minute. <br /> <br /> Luckily, they will not care, nor will they need it: as the coach tells his empty ship team before the game, the answers are right here in this book. And the Christian Right will devour it on the way to its rapture, the final victory to which they have prepared their fields.
