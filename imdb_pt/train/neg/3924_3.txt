Truly terrible movie, pretentious and endless. Director Bellocchio seems to be in love with the beautiful face and figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good and engaging film. I hate it when a sex movie presents itself as an "art film" just to become more "respectable." Frequent and occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for the existence of this film. Whether they are worth the rest of the image or not is strictly a matter of taste. (*)
