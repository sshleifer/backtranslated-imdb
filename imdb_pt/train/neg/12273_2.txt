PLANNING B has the appearance of an improvised and unedited screenplay for a movie, with the attempt to get a way out for the actors involved - a ride that should have been discarded from the start. It's just another mafia-based 'comedy' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for the participants. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the crime boss more concerned with clothes and looks than with his control business. Your personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is dumber than dirt and your ignorance should be funny. Maloni has beaten one of his debtors (who happens to be married to the scholar Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni takes Fran as his assistant to pay his late husband 's debts for being Maloni' s "puncher. Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to accomplish Maloni's tasks by choosing to carry her "scams" to Florida to hide in her brother James's house until she can figure out what to do next. This alternative to kill the three candidates is called Plan B, and Plan A to kill them! The ending is totally predictable, just as all rows in the script are assigned to the characters. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has made many films and is one of our most talented actresses and comedians, but here she screams. and it ventures and contracts its way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino is, well, the Paul Sorvino type of other mafia movies. The support cast is also allowed to play to the balcony on the wider slapstick, fashionable pratfall imaginable. What is supposed to be a comedy turns out to be just silly and exaggerated. Director Greg Yaitanes needs to return to the TV sitcoms: this fragile story was squeezed into a half-hour show that might have taken a chance. Grady Harp
