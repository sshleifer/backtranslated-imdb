The film is clearly bad. Simply awful. The string of bad Bollywood movies has no end! They should be running out of excuses to make such horrible movies (or not). <br /> <br /> The problem seems to be mainly with the directors. This movie has two good actors who have proven in the past who have the ability to deliver great performance ... but they were targeted so poorly. The poor script also did not help. <br /> <br /> This movie has many ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first big show, Ajay Devgan, meets Om Puri (whom he escaped 30 years ago and talked to him again) and all Om Puri thinks is to be careful . of your friendship with Salman !!! What a load of crap. Seriously. Not to mention the baaad soundtrack. What happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun has a total miscast of portraying a rock star. <br /> <br /> Only saving grace are the good performances in the second half. Ajay shines while his character shows his dark side. Salman is also the drug addict. <br /> <br /> Watch maybe just for the last half hour.
