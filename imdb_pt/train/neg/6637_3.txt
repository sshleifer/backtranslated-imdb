They should have named this movie ... Blonde women who needed to have their colored roots. Also the main character, geeze, the very tight sweaters. The laughs I thought the guy did a good job though. I hope we find a good 8-star Christmas movie to watch this week. The dart playing. I had to laugh at that too. We still have 3 more on the DVR to watch, maybe we're lucky. Oh yeah, I noticed the guy very quickly and got it right when he got the flowers and then went out with his cousin. I told my daughter they were on their way to the graveyard. And how stupid did the two girls follow them, spying on them? Creepy.
