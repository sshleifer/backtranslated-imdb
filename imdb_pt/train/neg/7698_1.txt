Can I give you a negative rating? Not? Well, let me say that this is the most atrocious movie I've ever tried to watch. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in various sub levels of cloudiness. I rented this movie with a friend, and after about thirty minutes hoping it would get better, we decided to "go a little bit" to see if things would get better. It never gets better. This movie about a guy being kidnapped by these two girls seems interesting, but in reality, it's just a bummer. Nothing even remotely interesting happens. If you've ever had a chance to watch this, do yourself a favor, try "PLAN NINE EXTERIOR SPACE" instead.
