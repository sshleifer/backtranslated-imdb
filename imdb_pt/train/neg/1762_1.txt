This movie seems to be a feature of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be warned that "Art Heist" adds nothing to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the film. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin keeps reappearing in movies, and frankly, does anyone wonder if he has a great agent, or do directors and producers love his unusual movie? It seems silly, complemented by the strange hairstyle he sports in most of his films. The only good movie in which he appeared, is "The Lula and the Whale", in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, her protagonist, does not do much better; there is no chemistry between Mrs. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> A movie to be seen at the risk of the viewer.
