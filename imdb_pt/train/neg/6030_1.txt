Okay, now, I know there are millions of Americans who believe in The Rapture: that moment when all people born again in Christ will be raptured to meet God and all the rest of mankind will be left on earth to perish in plagues and fire and the broken heart of psoriasis when the Antichrist confronts her with Jesus (uncharacteristically and warlike). And I know the books were best sellers. . among believers, anyway. And I mean no disrespect at all. <br /> <br /> But I have to say, they put this film in a bag and hit the Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the books are much better. Really. <br /> <br /> The plot does not need re-scripting. If you watched this movie, it is likely that you have read the book. I may be one of the only people on earth who actually saw this just from the experience of making bad moves, and I was not disappointed. Especially not by Kirk Cameron, the creepy little gremlin "Growing Pains," who grew up at that show, met Christ, and decided that the SHOW should reflect their Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career was for dogs, but now you can be happy to be spreading God's Word in such bad movies that they never make it to the big screen. Well, that's not strictly true: I think this was the only movie ever made that went to the DVD FIRST, with a coupon for a free preview of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters! I still have the voucher! How many people do you think came up? I do not know about you, but you never came to my city. Of course, I live in New York, where liberals without God sit around ripping Bible pages and using them to roll together. So you go. In fact, I bet three million people on Manhattan Island, none of them would be snatched away. <br /> <br /> Check out the companion materials on the DVD, where you will learn the scary details behind the scenes. these movies. . CAST and CREW must be of the same religious mentality. They do not come directly and say that, but listen carefully to what the filmmakers say. It's like a lot of Pod People gathered to make a movie Pod. How creep-like is this? Honestly, this stuff just preaches to converts, does not it? You can imagine someone who DOES NOT subscribe to all the apocalypse watching it, beating his forehead and saying, "HOLY HOOVER DAM! I'd better be saved SOON!" Anyway, I'm hooked. I have to see the rest of these Christian fiasco movies, especially the one with Gary Busey, which I think is TRIBULATIONS. At least Busey has an excuse to take part. He broke his head on some sidewalk when he hit his motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Hi. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. What's with all the shots of poor innocent dogs whining, their collars dragging uselessly across the floor, because their owners were called to heaven? What is up with that? We should feel bad about dogs, and if we do, what will we do with God? Is not IRK the people that there is no space in heaven for man's best friend? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is another reason why I am an agnostic. Good night and good luck.
