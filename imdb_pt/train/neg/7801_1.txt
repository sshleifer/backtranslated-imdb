I'll keep it as short as possible, because this piece of shit hardly deserves a mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst movies ever made - straight on with the other horrible zombie entry from Schnaas - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). These films are so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be filmed. Somehow I managed to (almost ...) sit down with ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so horribly inept - even when compared to another horrible Schnaas movie - that I had to move quickly after all the first 10 minutes. ZERO acting skills, inept gore, awful camera-style camcorder work, ridiculous dubbing ... it just goes on and on. I really can not find a single thing redeeming about this crap - and I can usually find something redeeming in any movie. This is really one of the worst movies ever made - You were warned ... 1/10
