ALL FOR LOVE is a romantic period drama with Captain Saint Ives, a French officer in Napoleon's army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland, where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison. There is also a plot involving a murder. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and confess that I was not much caught by the film, since I am not much fan of period dramas and the script seems a bit episodic, but I will say that this is well represented by all involved and has a good cast featuring Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. The costumes you can expect are also excellent <br /> <br /> I will be very surprised if this film does not receive any complaint after being broadcast on BBC2 at tea time. Captain Saint Ives is lying on the bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there is a scene of French prisoners bathing that includes full male nudity complete not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen. You really have to worry if the BBC scanners have some sort of clue as to what they're doing
