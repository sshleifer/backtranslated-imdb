Watching this stench is a cruel and unusual punishment at Sandler's hands. Truly a slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD at the $ 5.88 deposit at Wal Mart. But the thought that keeps ringing in my head is, "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat simply does not sink! <br /> Best Constructive Suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know that show on the SciFi channel, in which a guy and his mupp√© machines fake the most inaccessible horror movies (Mystery Science Theater). IMMEDIATELY, create a comedy program and highlight this movie. Without a good humorous parody of this train accident, I'm afraid viewers can actually start following Sandler with ice picks and chainsaws. <br /> <br />
