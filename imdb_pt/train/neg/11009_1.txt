I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie could be really cool. "Guaranteed to offend ... everyone!" said the trailer. Well ... that offended me, because this movie really sucks. It's not a comedy, because I laughed about two seconds throughout the movie. And what about all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I have no problem with who you are, but what's the point of adding so many gay scenes to a comedy movie when those scenes are not funny? I think the director is a gay man in denial, or something. <br /> <br /> So, my advice to you is: if you want to waste good money, rent a good comedy you've seen millions of times, you'll be better than watching this comedy of all bad comedy . It really sucks.
