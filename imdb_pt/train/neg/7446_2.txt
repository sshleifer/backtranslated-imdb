I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. He is the only worthwhile presence in this movie. But even so, I do not see this movie. Even though he is good as the main villain, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I did not care about the characters (except the little boy) and, in fact, I did not really care if the cross-star lovers ended up together or died. The movie did not even make me think or BELIEVE that these people cared for each other. I read a lot of "classic" novels after watching the movies and this movie made me even want to read the book. The story seems so boring. But I can go ahead and read to try and rescue the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and she was much better at it. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great novel movies like Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries like the Forsyte Saga. Take a look at them, do not bother with Lorna Doone.
