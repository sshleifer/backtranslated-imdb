I had never heard of this Adam Sandler movie until I saw it on the Blockbuster wall. Being a fan of Adam Sandler at the time, I rented. HONESTLY I could only watch about 30 minutes. of this. It was terrible. Do whatever it takes to keep it out of the hands of the public. I sincerely hope that this movie will be released soon, and I hope it stays that way!
