This has to be the most sinister and sinister holiday movie I've ever set eyes on, and that's saying something. I know that the Mexican people have some strange ideas about religion, mixing ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But Day of the Dead is not as scary as Santa. <br /> <br /> So..Santa is not a fat, fat alcoholic (take a look at those pink cheeks sometimes!). Instead, he is a skinny sociopath pedophile who lives in Paradise (or in heaven, whichever is the case) with a bunch of kids working more than those in the sweat shops of Kathy Lee Gifford. They sing so cute traditional songs from their homelands while wearing such stereotyped clothes that I was surprised that there was not a black-faced African-American boy singing 'Mammy'. This Santa Claus is a Peeping Tom pervert who watches and hears everything everyone does from the "eye in the sky". This is so he can tell who has been disobedient or legal (with emphasis on those who are impertinent, I bet). <br /> <br /> There is no Mrs. Claus, no elves (what does he need elves for when he has child labor?) and the reindeer are mechanical rope toys! This floating freak show hangs over a cloud, presumably supported by its silver coating. <br /> <br /> The enemy of Santa is ... the Devil?! What is it, Santa Claus, our Lord and Savior? Weird. Anyhoo, Satan sends one of his lackeys, a steep devil named Pitch, to try to ruin Christmas. Let me see if I get it right - are the forces of the purest evil trying to ruin a totally commercial and greedy holiday? It sounds kind of redundant, does not it? <br /> <br /> The tone is totally ineffective. He tries to convince some kids to be bad, but he's not very lucky. I was very impressed with the story of little girl Lupe, whose family is very poor. All she wants is a Christmas doll, but the parents can not afford it (they spent all the money on the cardboard they built the house from). Then Pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll. In fact, that's the only way for a poor girl to get a doll, because being holy and praying to God and holy Santa Claus does not really work. But Lupe resists the temptation and tells Pitch to stay behind her, and so is rewarded for having such a frightening doll that you know is Chucky's sister. <br /> <br /> Along the way Pitch manages to get Santa. stuck in a tree (uh-huh) from where he is rescued by Merlin! Merlin? You have got to be kidding me! Since when did mythical Druidic figures appear in Christmas tales, or do they have something to do with a Christian religion? And God does not disapprove of the magic? They would have burned Merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago, not asking him to come to the aid of one of God's Aspects (or is what I suppose Santa should be, to be against Satan). This movie is a long HUH? from start to finish, and you'll wonder if the eggnog you drank was not with thorns or something. It probably was, since this movie is like a long giant DT.
