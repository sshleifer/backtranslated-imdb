This film not only has a bad plot, a bad direction and a terrible acting, but it opens up a new meaning for racism. In this film, the "White" puppies are the sluts, the "White" boys are the wan-be gangsters, and successful (yes, again) "white" entrepreneurs are revolting with the of the bathrooms. <br /> <br /> I just wonder what would happen if I did exactly the same movie with the same story and script, only I did about Caucasians. "He dude, it's good to finally see that you stopped dating those black girls." <br /> <br /> No one seems to notice, but watch this movie again and you'll vomit on how they portrayed the new movie Zeeland "white boys." Suddenly, their whites, who are the main cause of gang aggression, prostitute themselves by a quick blow. Only Samoan girls have a heart, there is not a white girl without slutty. <br /> <br /> It angers me that they could not make this movie without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a repulsive profile. If you think I'm generalizing too much, go watch this movie and see what you do about the "white boys." Just because Samoans choose to call us "white boys" in real life does not mean it's funny. If I say hey, black boy, I'll lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. Do not waste your money. Do not be racist.
