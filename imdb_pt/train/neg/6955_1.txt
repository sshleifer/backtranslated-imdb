I can not see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be sci-fi). It's really just "let's see what operating soap happens this week" and oh, the Cylons are involved through flashbacks. The Cylon "babe" who continues to preach the other guy is pretty lame, it's pretty obvious that T & A was added to the show. Every time she shows up, I'm confused by what the WTF should be going through. And do not even try to criticize me about "story arcs." <br /> <br /> It's a novel with some CGI released. This is not science fiction beyond the original premise. <br /> <br /> This series is not all that is being worked on. If you like a modern, bold, dishonest, edgy and vague camera job, this program might be for you. Since nerds seem to be enthusiastic about this program, it is a clear indication that the opinions of the vocal nerds have been altered from Picard's TNG.
