By chance I loved the show growing, along with millions of others. So I tuned in to this movie, wondering if it's not good, it can be at least a bit dazzling and fun. <br /> <br /> WRONG! I just have to know, by the end of this, were Charlie's angels really that annoying? I do not seem to remember that as such. But this movie, as bad as movies of that kind can be, bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show. I saw everything, despite the negatives, it was not unattainable. But it was very soft, which I do not criticize the artists, especially the women who played the angels as they really resembled them. The movie was not that interesting. He tried to make each angel a "character". (An angel is quarrelsome, one is the "good girl", one is for the husband ...), all the characters have been portrayed with a main characteristic that defines them and little depth beyond the stereotypes. The excitement of the show was lacking and the dialogue was .... dialogue. This is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible. Not the worst of the TV movies. But missable.
