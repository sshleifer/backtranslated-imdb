I'm not sure how they're related, but I'm pretty sure Lost and Delirious is a remake of that movie (or the story it's based on). Plot very similar, and even some scenes and scenarios seem to be very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so check out the one instead. <br /> <br /> This moves very slowly, but being a French film from the late 60's, which is expected of the style. I said in retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school. Editing flashbacks with current scenes is a bit confusing at first, particularly because each one's audio overlaps (ie listening to flashbacks while watching the present and vice versa). In addition, the "girls" are a little old to think they are in a boarding school. Lastly, there is not much character development for you to stick to the movie.
