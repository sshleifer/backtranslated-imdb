This was a watershed in my movie watching life. I went to see it in the theater when it left. I was completely amazed at how bad it was. Films like that make you wonder who put the money and who owes a favor - a very big favor. The special effects are absolutely first grade, as any first grader could have made them. Toy rubber plugs on strings without trying to hide the strings, arrows that seem to be drawn on the film and appear to be the shape of an arrow you would find on a street sign, and a laughable plot. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to "Conquest". Every movie student should see this to know the very definition of a bad movie.
