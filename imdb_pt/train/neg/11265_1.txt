There were some low moments in my life when I was puzzled and depressed. Sitting through Rancid Aluminum was one of those. <br /> <br /> The warning signs were there. No debut (even the stars did not want to participate) and no criticism in magazines. The only reason I watched the movie was in the hope that I could get some sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was explained. The narration was stupid. I cheered at one point when the film's lead seemed to have been shot, and then, to my growing despair, it was revealed that he had not really been shot deadening my joy. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the film will be hanged for this atrocity. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, especially unintentional moods. For example, the scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason, feels the need to relieve himself manually in a bathroom cubicle while telling the person in the next cubicle to put their fingers in their ears. <br /> <br /> <br /> My words can not explain the anger I feel, so I must conclude thus. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: for sadists, spoilers and setbacks only who want to torture themselves.
