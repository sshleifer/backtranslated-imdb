Well, it's hard to add comments after reading what's already here, but I feel I have to say something. I was not exactly looking for a 'splatterfest' as someone says, or even 'blood and gore / blood'. I have a bit of respect for the victims' relatives, although I really felt that the filmaker did not do that. "They were nameless, faceless and meaningless. Just a ship for Dahmers sex pranks. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think, 'What makes a guy be a serial killer?' as well as imagine the details of Dahmer's story, of which I know very little. The people here seem to think the film did not have to cover the events of Dahmer's story. his story, what happened when he was caught, the result, etc., but it is important! You see, I assume if you're American, you'll know all of this. We do not all live in America. To tell this story about a man as he obviously was, REQUIRES that at least some of the historical and real events are counted / shown. That does not mean blood and guts, there are ways to show horrible things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to blood. Without even touching on some of the things he did (I found out more about him reading the user comments on this site!), The movie looked like a void. A moment in time with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a movie about REAL Dahmer because with his lack of direction, VERY slow pace that NEVER changes, Strange portrait of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an ending, this movie is POOR. I would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time needed to assist you. A definite 1 out of 10 (for acting!)
