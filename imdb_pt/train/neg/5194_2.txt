Do not get me wrong, I want to see legalized marijuana as much as the next. I'm going to ramble now. Writing, however, was unrealistic. A PTA mother deals with drugs, but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of a minor. Give me some time. The presumption of a very pretty Mary Louise Parkers character was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not at all pleasant. Basically, the plot lines did not work out at all. I understand your only TV land. The hypocrisy was glaring. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mother and I must believe that ... WHY ???? I just have the feeling that I was being nailed by a show smelling of weakness. It's like saying that it's okay to betray your wife, but with someone of legal age. OK it's not exactly the same thing, but I think you get it. That saving things from kids is wonderful for the campaign trail, I think, but it does not keep the water in a cable comedy about a suburban mom, like the local marijuana dealer.
