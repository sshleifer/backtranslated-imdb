Oh my, where to begin ... this movie was awful. The writing was bad, the acting was poor, the special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a horror movie, but I certainly did not get it! I thought it would be decent enough since I am not picky. I watched several bad horror movies. In fact, it's my goal to watch all horror movies, no matter how horrible they may be. At one point in the movie I made a comment about the "blood of corn syrup" and in the special features they actually admit it was Karo syrup (branded corn syrup ...) The movie had all the things necessary for a movie terror (blood, nudity, crazy killer, stupid moves), but he was missing something completely to really get well. The writer should either take some lessons or just give up!
