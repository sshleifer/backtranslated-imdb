A rich Harvard guy falls in love with a poor girl from Radcliffe much to the consternation of his strict father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> Syrupy, sugary and, most of all, story about a battle of 'classes' when the rich kid Ryan O'Neal brings home a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule. Ali MacGraw is socially abandoned with his mouth dirty, while John Marley plays his devout Catholic father, but no one in the movie is more annoying than O'Neal himself with his tearful portrait as the Harvard yuppie champion. <br /> <br /> 8 years later followed by Oliver's Story.
