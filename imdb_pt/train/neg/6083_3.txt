Two types of movies we like are (1) westerns and (2) movies 30 or 40 years ago. We should have liked a man called a sled; BUT ..... BUT ... this photo is nasty, annoying and stupid from beginning to end. As there is no one in history (good or bad) to warm up, there is no one to motivate the suspense needed to keep the viewer interested. No camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold, and no camaraderie among those who try to protect it. Sledge has a beautiful girlfriend, but there's no reason for her to drool over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with that pig no matter what. <br /> <br /> The film also suffers with an intrusion. and gawdawful musical score, and of extremely poor writing and directing by Vic Morrow. <br /> <br /> Of the last 30 older movies leased from Netflix or Video Vault, this was the bottom of the pit, the only real failure in the group.
