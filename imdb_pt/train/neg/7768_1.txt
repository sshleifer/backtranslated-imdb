This God-forsaken movie is about three millionaires who gather a lot of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, the acting is terrible, and the movie makes absolutely no sense. It's not scary at all, it's so stupid that it made me laugh, and that's why it won 1 star. The film is not violent, but it is very contemptible and focuses mainly on the breasts of women all the time. and some of the characters are very annoying and tearful. Also, the monsters in this movie are so extravagant and fake and not scary that they just make you want to throw something on the screen. Last but not least, the ending is terrible. I do not want to give up if you're strange enough to see this piece of crap. AVOID ALL THE COSTS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Unclassified (but must be R) for Nudity, Profanity and Mild Gore.
