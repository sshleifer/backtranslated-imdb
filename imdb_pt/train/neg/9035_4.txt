Born in the 1960s, I grew up watching TV "Movies of the Week" in the early 1970s and loved the scary movies that were routinely shown including "Crowhaven Farm," "Bad Ronald," "Satan's School for Girls," " Kolchak the Night Stalker ", etc., but this is simply an idiot. This is obviously the writer trying to capitalize on the terrible murders of Manson a few years earlier. The film stars Dennis Weaver from "McCloud" and "Duel" as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. The family finds some hippies who, for some reason, decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and Weaver's pacifist stance is hard to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, hit hell or something, just do not sit there and mourn over it. The acting is very meek, the story unbelievable, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini, but that's all. Ignore this if it aired on TV.
