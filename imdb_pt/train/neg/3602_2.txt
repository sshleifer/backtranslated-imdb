I am an avid fan of B-Rate horror movies and have seen my fair share of horror pictures, so I have a substantial meter to judge this movie. He easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror movies the 1980s has to offer. It's not as scary as Night of the Demons, it's not as bloody as Re-Animator and it does not have the value of there Nothing Nothing There camping. That said, this movie is worthless. Keep in mind that the art of the film is for a completely different film. The stills on the back of the DVD box are not taken from this movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (There is a lot of violence, but we've seen all of this before.) A killer kills nubile students and the occasional member of the facility by cutting throats and all the other tired methods of murder horror movies use). NUDDADE: None <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (history focuses on Francine Forbes - who wisely changed his name to Forbes Riley after this movie was made - who accepts a teaching job at a university People begin to and Forbes believes the killer is targeting her. It's his new heartthrob with a past. To be honest, it's impossible to care because the script does not reveal any character outside of Forbes. ACTING: $ (Terrible at all levels.This slasher has the feel of a high school production school because college students could make a movie better than that.Forbes presents a bit of talent as does Seminara as one of the students, but all world is of the caliber "extras" of acting.
