I realize that the US Army was demoralized in 1971, but this movie was unbelievable. It was supposed to be a training camp not the SS punishment battalion in a Sven Hassell novel. The writer must be a real enemy of the Army. The psychopathic sergeant who kept beating the crap belonged to a prison cell, and the useless black sergeant should also have been fired. These men were going abroad, the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the spoiled and unusable recruits were coming from, and an investigation would have taken place. The scene that completely blew her up was electrocution. Farrell, the alleged barracks lawyer, reportedly had the instructor on a barrel for having issued an illegal order (torturing prisoners of war in contravention of the Geneva Convention), royal assault against a conscript, sexual assault and improper conduct for an officer. Until he just walks away. After that, the discipline slows down to an insane asylum level and the film becomes unreachable. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
