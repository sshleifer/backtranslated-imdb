Wow. Simply awful. I was a fan of the original movie, and reluctantly sat through part 2, 3 was and improves. 4.5 and Freddy's Dead were very bad. But NOTHING is as bad as Freddy's Nightmares. Freddy acts as a serial Serlingesq Rod of this series anthology. <br /> <br /> I can accept how Freddy became a punchline after another, but at least in the movies the appeal of Freddy held the films, but here these were so poorly done, they looked like high school productions of one horror series The poor actors, if you really want to call themselves that, after doing this show, obviously they were exactly what they paid for. I'm pretty sure this was a stopping point for two types of actors. Those who are starting to climb the Hollywood ladder, newbies willing to take on any role that postpones the fact they have to accept the porn work they were offered last week, or experienced actors on their way up the Hollywood ladder willing to take any part of that post of having to get the porn work they offered me last week. <br /> <br /> I kind of expected Dana Plato to be the guest actress, but she was already dead when she was in production. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Nancy's line in the original Elm St, "Whatever you do, try not to sleep watching it."
