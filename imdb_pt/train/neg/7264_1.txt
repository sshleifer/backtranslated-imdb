Just another movie that explores free male frontal nudity; horrible acting, in addition, the love scenes are the sexiest I've ever seen (and this is not about me not connecting the idea of ​​two young people making love since I'm gay). <br /> <br /> Again, as in Thousand Clouds of Peace, Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes, but manages to make a two-hour film with it ... And this time, there is not even the question of racism and mercantilization in the Mexican gay community! May God, merciful, have mercy on us!
