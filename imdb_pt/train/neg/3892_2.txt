Want to watch a scary horror movie? So stay away from it. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, there is plenty of scotch. Only malt if you can manage it. <br /> <br /> If the previous comments were not enough to prevent you from seeing this movie sober, let me help. NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into Saturn's orbiting space. A very large solar explosion causes Colonel Steve West to bleed through his nose. Things come down from there, and madness begins. <br /> <br /> I really read the book's adaptation, which was published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the movie, and the book was terrible. At least some pretension is made regarding suspense, and some sort of explanation of events is taken from the author (rhyming with 'gas'). <br /> <br /> It does not mean that the film is completely without merit. Rick Baker has learned that he really should read a contract before signing a movie, and Jonathan Demme has found that he is actually more suitable for driving. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an episode of MST3K with this movie, but it is, of course, edited a bit. Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts, not even the healing power of the whiskey can save it. <br /> <br /> Please, just go see Lost Ark Hunters if you want to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I can not, with all good conscience, recommend this movie to the sober public who goes to the movies.
