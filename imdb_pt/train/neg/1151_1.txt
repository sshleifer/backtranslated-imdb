This movie was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, who is the main character, is anything but "motherly". OK, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first. Your husband dies. She then goes to visit her son and finds this loaf that is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him. Until this part, the film is well. Not great, but can be observed. The guy is charming and who can blame her? Okay, it's not too maternal to sleep with your daughter's mistress, but let's blame the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> She gets totally obsessed with the guy. I think that's the part where I started to dislike the movie. She is always eager to please him in an old-fashioned way with snacks while he is working at his son's house (I think that's the only thing she's learned to do) as if it's the only way to get attention. The guy obviously is not very interested (in fact, it seems more that he considered sleeping with her a charity activity) and instead of being insulted by it, she keeps begging him to go to bed with her and be nice to her . when he becomes very abusive. "I want to please you," she tells him desperately as he insults her very badly. <br /> <br /> What has pissed me off in this movie is the total lack of self-respect that the mother has for herself. She tells Craig something like "I'm just a misshapen piece" the first time they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to women. If it had been me, I would have bought myself a small object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and much less emotional pain ... :)
