I do not know what Margaret Atwood was thinking of letting this movie have the same name as her book. I've always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to know there was a movie going on. I am aware that the translation from book to film is not perfect, but this movie was the worst of them all. The women's names are correct and some of the stories are correct, but that's about it. I feel like I've wasted a lot of my time trying to get through this movie. This really should have been a mini-series to tell the story the way it was written. <br /> <br /> The actors of Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well chosen, although I was skeptical at first about Mary. -Louise Parker. I just wish they had a better script to work on because it really had nothing to do with the book.
