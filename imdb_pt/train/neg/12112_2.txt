I can not believe I wasted my time with this movie. I could not even call it a movie. It was so bad with nothing to recommend it. <br /> <br /> I like low budget movies and weird movies, but this movie made me bored. Bad acting and badly ruined curiosity. You have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie. I wonder what I was thinking watching until the end. I recommend this movie to anyone. How did they release it? Were there an audience that likes this kind of movie? There must be why you can find this in almost any video store. But why? <br /> <br /> Deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies then this is for you.
