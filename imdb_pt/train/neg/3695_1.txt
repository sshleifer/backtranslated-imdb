Not the best of the actors' films. The director focused on the stardom of the casting actor rather than making a good artist. It may be the hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But definitely not worth it to the neutral audience. The fight sequences are a total comedy. The dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic. The music is average. This film was the biggest failure of the actor. Despite the hype created about the film, the film failed miserably. Do not even think about watching this move, even if you want to kill time. You can watch some cartoons instead. A good movie fan can not digest this crap for two and a half hours.
