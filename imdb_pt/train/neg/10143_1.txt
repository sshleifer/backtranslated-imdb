FLYING FURY takes the robe to be Steven Seagal's worst movie I've ever seen ... So far. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible boredom with no action scenes of any interest, Seagal is not really trying this - he's fat and his voice is nicknamed one more time. <br /> <br /> The co-stars do not do better, being a rather sad load of 3 evaluators. <br /> <br /> The direction by Keusch is very poor and it is no surprise that he is also responsible for another Seagals couple (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The screenplay co-written by Seagal himself is ridiculously inept. <br /> <br /> According to The $ 12 million was spent on this boring old tosh load - If these numbers are correct, I feel a great fiscal violin, since not even close to that amount was spent. <br /> <br /> FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot remake chance. of Michael Dudikoff's movie BLACK THUNDER - that has to be better than this joke. <br /> <br /> This DOES NOT have redeeming qualities, GIVE A MISS! 1/2 * out of *****
