The Twilight Zone has reached a certain mythology about it - much like Star Trek. That's because there are many dedicated program lovers who no matter what they think each episode was a winner. They are the ones that punctuate each individual to 10 and can not objectively evaluate the spectacle. Because of this, a while ago I reviewed all of the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad ones) because the ratings and general reviews were very positive. Now, it's time to do the same for the Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Although I have scored many 10 episodes, this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad. The writing was indeed embarrassingly bad. Two people on opposite sides of a major war are seen wandering through the entire episode. After a while, it is apparent that they are the only two people left on Earth - as you learn at the conclusion really stupid and totally unconvincing. Usually, the turnaround in the end makes the episode great - this one killed him!
