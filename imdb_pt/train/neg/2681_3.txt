A very good story for a movie that, if done correctly, would be quite interesting, but where is the end of this movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, what is the point of this? <br /> <br /> The scenes go by so fast you felt that you were not part of the movie emotionally, and the feeling of being far from understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> The performances of the cast are questionable, if not believed. <br /> <br /> Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the movie? I think we have to wait for the continuation. <br /> <br />
