This photo reminds me of a photo of Kenny More from 1957 called The Criminous Brave, "while on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and when he was saved he was employed again. However this If there is any picture that shows that Madonna can not act, it is this one. <br /> <br /> I am not sure if this was a subtle copy of "The Admirable Crighton", but surely it seems like this and if this is the case then Hollywood must be running out of ideas and this is sad to provide a platform for the actors to improve their career profile and just that it fails in every nook and cranny. plot is loose and the acting is mediocre The script should have been put in the crusher before being put in place While many here canned Madoona for all his acting I think in movies like "A League of Their Own" very nice and nice and "Who's That Girl" showed a strangeness of Madonna not shown before or after. Other Madonna films are not so nice and I would like to see a Madonna Animation series with the character of "Who's That Girl". I like the music of these two films, however "Swept away" remains at the bottom of the pile here and It will continue like this. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a bomb right?
