this movie tries to be immensely intelligent, and Tarantino-style before you try it, you need sound film fundamentals. These include good sound, editing, set design etc ... <br /> <br /> lets talk about the sound in this movie. absolutely atrocious. I've never been more distracted by a soundtrack, never <br /> <br /> and before we talk about low budget, film made in Chile, etc ... let's keep in mind that the sound desent nowadays is much more feasible than it ever was. anywhere. and more information on the technique are available, so never before <br /> <br /> the sound in this movie is clearly bad. the foley in particular is out of place and inadequate throughout the hotel, the atmosphere is equally dreadful. I've heard at least four clicks during the movie, which are the result of poor sound editing. the sound inside the cars is horrible, the sound of closing car doors is horrible. The sound of the lady singing is wrong. foley is exaggerated, or simply not there, as the sound person got bored and gave up. the spaces are wrong. everything about this is wrong and yet, leaving no limitations of creativity to disrupt, at the same time the film boldly tries to be smart. for example, the aquarium sound is used in the next street scene. we hear the sound when we should not. Sound issues precede visual cuts. all the tricks of the book are used, and yet the foundations are not there <br /> <br /> editing them we have scenes using heavy cuts of heels, we have to fiddle with the timeline etc etc etc, to yawn. All these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low standard. Overall, the mix sucks, the sound sucks. and so, the movie sucks. How can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and accolades? New cinematographic wave of Chile? the best creative outlet Chile has to offer? I hope not, and I do not think so. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile's most selective and best talent avoided this movie like the plague, perhaps because of its spicy content. Likewise, the film probably received so much praise from the unwarranted critique of so-called "world cinema" enthusiasts for the same dirty reasons. they probably amuse themselves with clumsiness. Of course, film critics seldom pay attention to technical details and quality. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks. is all mouth and no pants and is never deserving of a rating of 6.8. the film has all the quality of production of a cheap Tarantino, new wave inspired byno!
