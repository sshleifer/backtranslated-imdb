Except for Brady Variety Hour, this was one of the longest TVs I've seen in a while. The video production qualities were not too bad, but the overall appearance was unmistakably early 80's. And Marie Osmond looks like she fought with the Avon Lady .. and lost a lot of time. It was a lot of eyeliner. <br /> <br /> It was kind of embarrassing to see veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid join in. Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley talk about the African Pavilion at the World Showcase that would be opening "in about a year." <br /> <br /> So far, 17 years later, it has not yet been opened. (Unless you count Disney's Animal Kingdom). After all, despite all the shortcomings, it's still an interesting visual piece in Disney's history.
