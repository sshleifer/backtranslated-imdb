As an avid fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this movie and laugh as much laughing as the AMC advertised as a comedy. I've never been more disappointed with a movie! Cary's usual charm and effortless comedy are AWOL of this whole film; He seems tense, bored and not himself. The Mississippi character is among the worst stereotypes I've ever seen - his accent is terribly exaggerated (and incorrect, according to the part of Mississippi he says he comes), and whenever he makes a sentence, it's several decibels higher than any other. another member of the cast. Miss Mississippi tried to stand out in the film as a lovable, country-bumpkin idiot, but in the end, he only manages to diminish the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscene doll than a Hollywood kitten, and although she has never been known in Hollywood for her acting ability, this movie screams that she never had this ability to begin. Ray Walston's character was sugary and finally invented. For four men on leave, it was the lowest license I ever saw. I watched this nightmare to the end, and although I do not screw this up to anyone, I'll tell you it's the most absurd you've ever seen. The film tries to arouse patriotism and a sense of debt to the men of combat, but the film totally loses that point because of its weak plot and weak cast. Sorry, Cary!
