I watched this movie on a preview of Sneak Preview and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. It's full of fart jokes and fart and is not proud of the action sequences (like the shooting in "Little Germany"). I made a short list of things I liked about the movie ... and many of which I did not agree to. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The fart jokes. 3. The poop jokes. 4. Cara was a bitch. 5. Not Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Once again making fun of Bush .. WE GET THAT IS AN IDIOT ... go ahead. 8. The guy has blond hair. 9. The lot. 10. The murder of minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the cast was just outrage and out there. <br /> <br /> Now the (few) good ones. 1. The guy uses a cat as a muffler as in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crotchy made a comeback (and a special participation from Postal's maker) 4. Uhm .. I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are a few moments "what the ef" <br /> <br /> Boll did it again. He did another low-key game in film adaptation. Lots of compliments to you, Mr. Boll. 2/10
