Now I will be the first to admit it when I say something that may be blasphemous or unfair, so I would like to apologize in advance for my complaints about how much I disliked this movie. <br /> <br /> summarizes as well. I did not like this movie. To be more specific, I did not like the concept of this movie. The cinematography was good. The weather was fine. And the performance was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the story is silly, inaccurate and misleading. It's also offensive. <br /> <br /> I am a Cree Indian room, and for some reason I am insulted personally by the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all, he's a black guy. And that's not racist observation, I swear. The thought of a white, Hispanic or even Native American swinging a katana on a roof offends everything the katana represents. The katana represents the soul of a samurai, absorbed by the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai. For the Ghost Dog to use his weapons instead of the Katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside, and where the hell did he get a Katana? It must be one of those replicas, which further insults the Samurai caste. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Ghost Dog has not shown honor. Near the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then kills a man, shooting him in the face through a tap drain. It's not just a cowardly way of killing an enemy, it's more like a ninja way; silent assassins; a group that samurais deny exists, but he hates nothing less. <br /> <br /> So he tries to kill his boss when he finds out that his boss is a villain. Do you know what a true samurai does when he discovers that his master is bad or dishonorable? He kills himself, to prove that he prefers to die, then reduces himself to the level of his doggish master. <br /> <br /> Everything about the character was a gigantic contradiction to the real code to which all samurai adhere: Bushido. So we have a great cinematography, a good atmosphere and a more dense performance, encompassing a plot and satirical premises (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of this), making it an overall poor movie , and an insult to all that an honest bushi (samurai) considers expensive. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10
