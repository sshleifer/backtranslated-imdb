This would have been a great silent film. The acting really is good, at least in a Look Ma, I'm really making a big hit! kind of way. <br /> <br /> Everything is HUGE. Each line is DEEP! Each scene is mixed with HUMAN TRAGEDY! <br /> <br /> Mostly, I felt like choking. However, like any train accident, I could not look away. This dialogue may have worked on stage, though I doubt that. On the screen, it was confusing, random, banal, and practically any other stereotypical negative adjective that you could come up with to describe a really bad drama. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy your melodrama in huge doses you may like the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. Despite all this melodrama, this certainly follows its own rhythm. <br /> <br /> This script must have sounded very different when the actors involved were reading to themselves. It simply does not work when they go around to deliver it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB does us a great disservice, sometimes when it uses its computer-controlled "weighted score". Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than 1. <br /> <br /> Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through arcs with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it's character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not * character development *. This is a plot maneuver. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or, at the very least, watch him dumb. Maybe you have fun with all the waving of the arms that the characters do. <br /> <br /> Oh, and tell the wise - to prove that this is really an artistic film, you see James Woods in all his damn "glory of looking at me, I am the figurative and the literal representation of the vulnerability of the naked man ". <br /> <br /> Do not say you were not warned.
