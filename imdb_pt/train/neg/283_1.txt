to the movies, this movie looked like one of those special after school, just a lower budget and reduce everything else. I think this was for an inspirational movie of some kind, but it did not work for me. as preachy.it has very light tones of Flash Dance, but so what? there is simply no emotion in this movie. dialogue is invented and cliché to death. of course, the whole movie looks like a bad 80's cliché. The acting was less than stellar, although this has a lot to do with what the actors received (or, in this case, not) to work with. Also, the bad choices of music, with very bad lyrics. I felt embarrassed by all the actors involved. They are all talented, but you can not tell from this movie. This is just my opinion, of course, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe the 1/10
