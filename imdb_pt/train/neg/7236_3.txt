Let's see ... I'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything, so what kind of thing can I say about the Weapon Carrier? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were - no, this will not work, since they managed to drain the whole personality of Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so vibrant, and ended up creating caricatures of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... Oh - How about the story - no. This also will not fly, since it was spitting. What was the genre anyway? It was not funny, that excludes the comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was this a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, how can I not be sure - let's call it "losers at something like that". I'm sure those behind this movie started with a vision, I mean, they must have had one to launch the studio suits, but I need help finding it. Even if I were a patient person who could forgive the sheer stupidity of the story, I could not in good conscience recommend a movie that would allow a man to enter a professional job interview with a windbreaker and messy hair, cute and stupid. Speaking of hair - should we have fun with the deliberate black roots and platinum locks used by Hershey? <br /> <br /> What am I doing? I've already lost 97 unrecoverable minutes in the actual screening of the film - I can not devote more time to this loser.
