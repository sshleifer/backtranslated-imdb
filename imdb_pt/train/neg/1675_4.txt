The plot certainly looked quite interesting. How can a brutal murder of real life be turned into a really annoying movie? Well you can watch "Wonderland" and find out. <br /> <br /> I had heard of the murders of Wonderland before this movie was released and I discovered that it is an interesting actual story of some genuinely sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is zero character development, so we never get a chance to understand why this was done or to have a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters. The pace of the steering was very tedious. All of this leads to an extraordinarily boring film. Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes 'girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes' wife was a consultant to the film, we should have had the opportunity. to get a real view of the characters.
