Oh man, I know what you're thinking: "With such a title, I can not go wrong!" Yes you can. I also loved the title, but man, I hated the stupid kid who played "Satan's little helper" I hated his mother too, and his sister / daughter, and her boyfriend - I hated all those people! Dude, it was agony to watch this sometimes! The only reason this is not 1/10 is because if you consider the low budget, they did OK. But oh man, I hated these actors, so stupid! I knew it was going to be bad, I think they saved a lot of money just by wearing Halloween masks for the killer, and the costume of Jesus in the end was also stupid. Oh the agony, I do not watch!
