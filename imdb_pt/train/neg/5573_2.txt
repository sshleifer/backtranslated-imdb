I can not understand why so many Godzilla fans find this excellent, one of Godzilla's best movies indeed. This movie is horrible and one of the few Gojira movies that I can not watch again (the other is G. vs. Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is too exaggerated to be in the Heisei series, a series that tried to turn the aging Godzilla franchise into genuine action movies, revolving around ideas that looked more like 1974 than they did in 1991. It looked ridiculous, especially with some of the subjects, for example, the scene of World War II, with Japanese soldiers. praising a dying Godzillasaurus, a sad and serious tone, picks up the exuberant former commander of the capitalist turn and his death, serious sermons in a movie that his fans denote as being played by laughter, as a joke with guilty illogical fun if it is so easily one of the dullest films I've ever seen, however, I think it's more likely that it was just a talent that the filmmakers did not have, and that was a case of a serious-face action movie that went awry. This is made worse by the fact that the special effects are terribly unmatched, from jet packs to android, to the fake sound effects emitted from everything, it's impossible to take anything seriously, and yet the movie expects you to do it, on the camera. <br /> <br /> Like almost every Godzilla movie, there is a meaningless novel, and this is no exception, although something can be said about the fact that it is especially useless since then and inexplicable. There is literally no reason for romance, it just happens and there are lives that make 360 ​​degree appointments for this. In addition, the other terrible aspect of this film is the dialogue, both Japanese and English are horrible, awkward and possibly the inspiration for Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> The Tristar DVD composes the problems, making everything look grainy, blurred, faint and just plain ugly, so does sound. I first saw the Japanese region 2 version and the differences are day and night, with the original vibrant colors and texture, the remarkable score, especially the fight scenes, are really watchable. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version), there is little to praise here, and Godzilla Vs. King Ghidorah is the case of this failure. It does not even come close to deserving the reputation and the fans. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
