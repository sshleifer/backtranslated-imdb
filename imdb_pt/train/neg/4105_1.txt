Another pity that the lowest they can go here is one of them. Otherwise, this would have an easy zero. Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, the name of Peckenpah was not in the thing I would have never imagined he did. In fact, one of the people in San Francisco I know was on the set, and it was almost sunny, he says Sam was just shocked. Shows in swords. The laughing part of the opening part of the movie is the ONLY thing in all this confusion that deserves a second look. Not even Gig Young is watchable. This is a true test of masochism. If I had been forced into the confines of a theater to see her, I would have jumped. And now I really feel guilty for having watched everything from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was too cool to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than invented as they went on. It's not just a bomb, but a bmob spelled backwards. Yikes !!!!!
