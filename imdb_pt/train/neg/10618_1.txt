The film is gravely dreadful and demeaning for rape victims. On the surface, it may be a bold film about rape, but if you dig below the surface, what you have is a not-so-positive message about rape. Aishwarya, the rape victim, is shown as a helpless victim who can not handle everything because she is a WOMAN. She needs a MAN to help her. When society jokes about it and comments to it, it does not stand up for itself. Everything is left for Anil Kapoor to do all the talk while Aishwarya does all the crying. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Kaushik) went the wrong way by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive. What would have been most effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a brave manner. The director is famous for being a chauvinist. His films are usually full of weak women, but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He needs to learn that just because the role is controversial does not mean that the character itself is strong. <br /> <br /> The most degrading scene of the film is when Aishwarya 'cleans up' after being raped. She does this to please her father, who thinks she is now dirty. While it is commendable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a harsh manner, what he does not show us is whether Ash's father was wrong for his daughter to do such a thing. So we get a confused message about rape. <br /> <br /> Comedy is also not needed in a movie about such strong subjects. What's more, the comedy is simply not funny. Ash is wooden in her role, while Anil Kapoor does nothing but scream. The song is mediocre, except for the title track, which is beautifully illustrated (the only bright spot in this movie). The role of Sonali Bendre is disappointing and pointless. Overall, what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being a lousy mishmash that will give severe indigestion to some viewers.
