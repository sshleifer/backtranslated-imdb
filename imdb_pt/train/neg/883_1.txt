The problems with this movie are many, but I will try to mention the most glaring and annoying. First of all, while the theme suggests a series of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in the movies and on TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialogue, and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally false. It finally got to a point after an hour of such mind-numbing junk that I left (something not uncommon for me in recent years). I would have imagined that the film was directed by some dropouts from some 3rd film program. but I believe that director Mira Nair (at the same time, pre-Amelia, talented) has participated in this disgusting farce, so that perhaps the management talent in the United States has fallen massively in the pit.
