This so-called "documentary" tries to say that the US faked the landing on the moon. Right year. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has really studied the case knows differently. <br /> <br /> First of all: there is definitely evidence. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought MANY pounds of moon rock - for geological studies. These have spread throughout the world to hundreds of laboratories, which have tested them. And they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not from the earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on Earth, but similar to those calculated for the moon. I.E. conspiracy theorists never study anything: they only accept the thing that fits their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another unfair claim from them is that their wind was in the hangar where they shot the landing on the moon, ie the flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so he moved. And what proves this: well, if conspiracy theorists even studied the images, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut left, IE conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, can not study a subject properly, or just they study it until they have what they have sought, that they may lie from it, and profit (that is, the so-called "documentary"). One claim says it is not possible to have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places because there are different sources of light, the studio's artificial lighting. Again, conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), so would an earthly desert at night, with no sources of light. But I doubt that Conspiracy theorists have stayed out of the basement of their grandmothers for more than how many days a Star Trek convention is held. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. So they invent all these lies to seem important - that's a fact.
