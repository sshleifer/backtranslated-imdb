I only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The film has little or no plot and seems to be only continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this movie because it starred Zoe Trilling from the second "Night of the Demons"; and I wanted to see her playing someone normal. Unfortunately, Tobe Hooper's script has barely begun and is not going anywhere, as Robert Englund dominates the film and chews the stage and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
