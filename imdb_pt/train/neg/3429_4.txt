I have a copy of the writer of this movie on soulseek. I have to say it is pathetic and simply painful to watch the two cops take action, but I watched the film as a joke and since it is a tribute to the August underground that I have seen seen in my book as an incredible movie. Your quality and all that is very bad, but it's fun and something to talk to your friends. It reminds me of troma but good things. I recommend seeing this under two conditions, if you are bored and need a good laugh, or loud, otherwise just let it be. Recommended download, for sure. and the murders are very funny. as when the zombie rips the worshipers of satan, and stabs someone in the head with him.
