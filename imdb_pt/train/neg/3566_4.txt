Now, I have not read the original tale to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I will not follow that path here. <br /> <br /> But I've learned for some time that Stephen King's films are simply not horror movies, with perhaps a few exceptions. This was not one of them. It all started well, and for the first time I will not complain about acting, although Fred Gwynne has been as always wonderful. I will also forgive the total lack of parental skills, since they were necessary to make the story from here ... But there was a consistent point that I could not help but be annoyed with. And that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least two characters participated in the activity of stupid stupidity. The moments I mean are: There's a little zombie running around the house. You suspect you're under the bed. You stay as close to the bed as possible before you blindly raise the duvet cover, exposing your entire body to any damage a cannibal of undead can inflict on you, or (b) move a little out of bed so you can peer through the fully open end of a slightly raised safety position, or at least watch the mini terror coming at you, giving you a little reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a). I feel like offering myself to the slaughter today. Bleh <br /> <br /> Fun enough movie ... Just that it's not too scary.
