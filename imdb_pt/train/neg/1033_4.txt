I grew up in Scooby Doo where you are, and I still love it. It's one of my favorite designs along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This show is good for the kids, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect like Scooby and Shaggy), the theme song is tolerable and has some cool entertainment. However, it is quite disappointing. I usually do not mind Scrappy, but when he seems to be like the main character, it gets annoying fast. Complete with the Puppy Power slogan, Scrappy is a little more annoying than usual. Also half of the gang is missing after the first year, somehow did not feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and story lines were generally fragile and uninspired, barely chasing monsters or unmasking villains. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a clue but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voices, theme song and the fact that it is good for kids. Bethany Cox
