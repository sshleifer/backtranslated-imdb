<br /> <br /> This film (not a movie - clearly recorded on a cheap cam-corder) may be one of the greatest cinematic sparks in history. Caution: Packaging advertises the film as an erotic exploration of sex addiction. The film is not an exploration of anything, and is no more erotic than looking at the warts themselves. The script is meaningless and winding, with all the elements of the plot serving as segways between supposed sex scenes. However, even the sex scenes are thighs. Except for the first, they are about three seconds long (so again, my version has been hacked) and comically exaggerated. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent movie, you do not want it. If you are looking for a sexual excitement, you do not want this. Whatever the goals, desires, or prospects of your life, you do not want to watch this movie. How they got Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Begly to act on this stinking bomb is intriguing to the extreme.
