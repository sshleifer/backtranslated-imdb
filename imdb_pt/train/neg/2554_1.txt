Honestly, I'm not joking when I say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! This film does not have a single ounce of originality in its fragile dialogue or in its blatantly plagiarized history. I can not even begin to count the number of things in this movie that are obviously stolen from "The Omen" and other movies like this. For example, the nanny "Lucy" in this movie is actually one of the devil's minions sent to guide and protect the cubs of Satan ... does this sound a lot like Mrs. Baylock to anyone else? Another thing is that the orphanage was the first to have the child burned to the ground only a few months after it was adopted, just as in "The Omen". However, fortunately, a priest survived the fire and escaped with severe burns all over the body ... yet another coincidence ?????? And above all, the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus on every wall, much like the priest in "The Omen," with pages of the Bible nailed to the walls as wallpaper. Please do not even make me start making comparisons between the end of this movie and The Omen for you because, as I said above, there are many to mention here.
