I tried restarting the movie twice. I put in three machines to see what was wrong. Has Steven Seagal's voice changed? Did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who does not even look like him? Or was the sound of the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the real voice of the actor. Although for most of the movie, it looks like the audio was recorded in a bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Goodwill if I had a copy. I rented it, but I will never do it again. I'll check out this database before renting more of his movies, all (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you were getting when you watched a Steven Seagal movie. I think it is not anymore.
