This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. A wealthy upper-class English woman plans, conspires, and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social type. There is a clever reversal of the sex role, as her activities prove her more daring and more daring than most male characters. But, of course, there is a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and that wicked lady is not left behind when she meets the right man. <br /> <br /> Weakness and credulity all other characters make the plot unconvincing to the extreme, but those who thirst for romance will leave that aside.
