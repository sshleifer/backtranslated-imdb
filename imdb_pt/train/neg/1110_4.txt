An hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in that movie and I decided it was too bad. This was shortly after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) fell on his horse from a tree to join the good guy's side. I was very confused by all the Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 trick that did not translate into anything. Obviously, the name Coppola in the credits could not do anything to ensure success here, even with more than one listing. <br /> <br /> If you get to the end of the movie, you'll probably end up asking yourself the same questions I asked. What exactly was the hook with the gloves? What's with the rodeo scenario? Who was the stranger he was supposed to play? Why did they make this movie? <br /> <br /> I could probably continue, but my energy was drained. Look, there's already a western called "The Gunfighter" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. Watching this will make you feel so good as watching this movie makes you feel bad. The one I can recommend.
