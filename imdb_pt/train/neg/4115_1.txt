"Power Play" starts interesting but descends fast. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small role. In addition to Bell, "Power Play" has no redeeming value or interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in a few days than California has in a year. The earthquake scene at the mall is so artificial and completely unbelievable. And all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders doing a play. It's awful, just awful. <br /> <br /> In short, if "Power Play" was made in the 60s or 70s, it would be considered a bad "B" class movie. The fact that "Power Play" was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there anything like a "D" class movie? If so, "Power Play" launches the mold.
