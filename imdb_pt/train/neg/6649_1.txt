OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was "Great" or even "Good" is illusory or knows the director, writer and producers and is trying to increase interest in this movie. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was horrible. I am an actress and have been working in the industry for a while now in great films and even independent and this movie bored me to tears. The reason I'm being so hard is because this movie was clearly different from "Of Mice and Men" and they should sue because it's a horrible catch in the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt ... for someone to grab a classic book and movie "Of Mice and Men" and destroy it with a new twist bothers me a lot. The actors, the accents, the dialogue and the direction were amateurs and the writing was somber. I mean, if you want to take a fresh look at an existing story, make sure it's as good or better than the original one to make the new turn justified. Did not like this movie at all.
