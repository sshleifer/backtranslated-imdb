As they may be from Joe Don Baker (as Bufford Pusser in the first sequence) to Bo Svenson (as Bufford Pusser in the second sequence). Why did they do this? Just because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser they still should. I did not change because the first sequence was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and that thing I wanted to see in the second sequence. <br /> <br /> I would have given this film 7 out of 10 and I would have given a 1 out of 10 if the story had nothing to do with Bufford Pusser's life but I did and why I had given this film a 3 out 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that anyone planning to watch this cheese I suggest not to watch the first sequel instead.
