Wow I paid Â£ 3.50 to go see this movie in the movies. I can not believe I wasted my time. The acting is at most dignified and the special effects are gross. Probably the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes that I've heard in my life. I swear that 'sweeping' god is better than that. Madonna should win and Oscar in comparison to these guys. An hour and a half of my life I want back. Honestly, people do not see it, even the kid would find this movie an insult to their intelligence. I found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who's more wood, these guys here from the real puppets. Please do not waste your time on this movie that you will regret.
