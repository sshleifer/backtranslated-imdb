One scene demonstrates very well the "Terminator Woman" mentality: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's camp. Karen runs through an armed guard, who points the gun at her, but after a few seconds throws it out and challenges her into a fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, grabs the gun and runs away! So again, when a movie is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of your family, you know you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble have a lot of fun, and the film may have been better if it had focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they separate, and the film slows down, and even with the occasional fight scene to cheer things up, lack enthusiasm. The final has Trimble fighting Qissi inside a cave and Sheperd going womano-a-womano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden in a speedboat, but the fights are interspersed in a way that breaks its flow and decreases its value. On the positive side, congratulations to the costume department for giving Karen a chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film! (* 1/2)
