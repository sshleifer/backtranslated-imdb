Vincente Minelli's films are usually worth their time; Meet me in St. Louis, The Bad and the Beautiful. I expected this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Running Cam is scene after scene of go-for-nothing fatalism. Sinatra is a sad bag, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing floozy hanging over him, living in disappointing digs as a gallon convinces him to finish his disappointing writing project. The film has a great dramatic ending in which a disappointing villain reaches Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence is meant to be full of tension, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he is so distracted by beautiful colors, he does not realize that the scene is a panting clich√© and the characters are so poorly designed and poorly developed that we do not particularly care that they are shot. (especially MacClane) But this is the only real cinematography in the project. Otherwise, we look at the constipated characters standing around bars and lounges, getting nervous at each other for two hours. Hell is other people, apparently. <br /> <br /> There is nothing happening in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after World War II is treated more skillfully in "The Best Years of Our Lives". And either of Inge's two products, "Splendor in the Grass" and "Picnic," covers the desperation of being stuck in a dead-end city with far more pungency.
