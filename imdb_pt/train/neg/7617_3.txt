It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but the Hostel is definitely a lot worse. This movie is funnier and ridiculous than scary. I laughed most of the time when I watched. Low quality effects (when you go to watch, you'll understand what I'm talking about and how low quality this is), bad actors (I hear about them for the first time), and it looks like it was filmed by an amateur cameraman a TV show than a movie). But at least I had the patience to watch it to the end. Do you like comedy? Watch. You want horror? Go watch Ju-On: The Grudge or some other good horror movie. <br /> <br /> If I'm talking about the Legend of Diablo, I do not even know if I can classify it as a horror genre. Just some low-budget crap. <br /> <br /> I would rate 3 out of 10
