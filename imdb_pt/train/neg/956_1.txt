It's amazing that this movie is on one of my hit lists after all. It is by far the # 1 worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I've never been so bored before (fortunately not for more than 1.5 hours), pre-teen attempts at humor this feature is not even close to staying but one of the corners of my mouth slightly inclined After the first very strange part, you tend to expect the other parts to be at least slightly better. You wait in vain, it just goes down from there. <br /> <br /> The film has no story worth telling and repeats this non-story three times. One can only hope that, by some miracle, all remaining copies of this film will be lost forever and Trent Harris will never again put his hands on a camera ...
