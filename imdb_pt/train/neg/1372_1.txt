I saw it on TV. I'm glad I did not go to the movies to see this or spend the rented money. The movie is totally predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner to the winding electric cables. The plot is really weak and unbelievable - the avalanche expert is hit by a 20-foot wave of avalanche of bones (using real pictures) and all he has to do is stand up and shake. The avalanche trips a million miles an hour and stops at the side of the road. <br /> <br /> Part of the avalanche stuff is awesome and shows its devastating power. But the deal between the real avalanche and the staged footage makes this movie look even more fragile. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, do not bother with this movie even in T.V.
