Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good game that portrays very different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something compelling or substantial to his role. Leigh, who plays the lead singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly relies on older sister Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the vein of Joni Mitchell. Perhaps because of her double duties as co-producer on the film, Leigh seems to have gotten into a corner: she's not credible as a singer, and even if that's intentional, there's plenty of time on the big screen. microphone. Probably waiting for a tour-de-force, Leigh is drawn by wire, edgy and uneven; however, we simply do not see any talent within that character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that pull us away from her). If Sadie had a little charisma or appeal, we could accept the concept that she gets the (small) break she does. As it is, the probability of her climbing onstage is small. Director Ulu Grosbard produces some dramatic sequences and the final set up juxtaposes Sadie's bar performance with Georgia's exhausted arena show - they both sing the same song - and it's a sadly nuanced moment ... but really, what is it? the point? * 1/2 of ****
