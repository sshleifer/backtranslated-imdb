If you want to watch a movie that is strangely filmed, strangely illuminated, weird stories of these men (and a woman) who enjoy hitting each other, if you want to enjoy a story that is none of these guys, one as a boxer and the other as a gay man, then you should watch this movie. After watching this movie, I almost felt as bruised and bruised as the director himself (of the movie). Beat the hell out of me. <br /> <br /> This is a movie where one is not to watch the plot or to great acting, this is a movie to look at with horror and admiration. Much like watching a plane crash or a train accident <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a great movie, a good movie, a B movie, or even a mediocre movie, this movie it is not . <br /> <br /> A warning to all who watch this movie, please do not eat beforehand. You may want to vomit until the end of the movie.
