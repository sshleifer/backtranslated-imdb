this movie is really bad ....... no, I mean really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. of all the movies he's done I just like to foe the state, plus he's one of the worst directors ever. What scared me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) made the script for it. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, but being involved in it makes him learn his lesson. <br /> <br /> I love the new roles of Mickey Rourke, but I can not even like him because of the terrible story and appearance of it. Do not get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he made some accusations in his time and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira Knight, I think she's a bit overrated. I just can not feel it for her in movies. <br /> <br /> All in all this movie is bad. this is ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
