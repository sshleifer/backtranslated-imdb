Why did I waste my time on this movie? There was not a single funny joke or phrase everywhere. The clowning was not at all funny. I mean really, a vacuum suction tube out of control? Why did the National Lampoon name be attached to this movie? Even the Christmas holidays were better than that (I actually thought the movie was very funny). <br /> <br /> AVOID THE BOARD!
