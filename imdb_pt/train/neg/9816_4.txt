This movie was like a bad train accident, horrible as it was, you still had to keep watching. My boyfriend and I rented and wasted two hours of our day. Now do not get me wrong, the performance is good. Only the film as a whole just infuriated us. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After that movie, I had to rent something that was a bit lighter. Jennifer Tilly is as always a very dramatic actress. Your character seems manic and not everyone there. Darryl Hannah, though touched the most, does a wonderful job at interpreting the situation she is in. More than once I found myself screaming on TV telling her to fight back or to get violent. All in all, very violent movie ... not for the faint of heart.
