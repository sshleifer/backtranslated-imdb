This was one of the worst Wrestlemania I've ever seen. He just did not stand out, really. Card wise, I thought it was going to be very good, but every match seemed to fall short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs. MVP One of the best games. Benoit charged. I did not think MVP was that good, but Benoit saved this game. <br /> <br /> Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two guys do not mix. Or maybe it's Khali and any other living person does not mix. Awful game. <br /> <br /> Melina vs. Ashley I'm not a female wrestling fan. ECW Originals Vs. New Breed I was excited about this game, until I saw it. Really, Really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge Vs. CM Punk Vs. King Booker Vs. Jeff Hardy Vs. Matt Hardy Vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB game so far. Just a big disappointment, for many people in the ring at the same time. He simply did not live. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley Vs. Umaga O.K. not extremely impressive, but not the worst at night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs. Undertaker This was perhaps the best game of the night. Very, very, very good to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I really feel like this match deserved to be the last. People make a case for Batista vs. Undertaker, but this game was so good. I'm starting to get tired of watching Cena win every game. It's getting a little old. Now, I have to say, I feel like this game is the best of the night, but I'm a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm a bit biased. Batista vs. 'Taker might have been better, but I'm biased, so ... sorry. The latter two were undoubtedly the best games of the night and almost all the rest really fell short.
