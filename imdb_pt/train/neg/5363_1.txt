I did not think this movie was worth anything bad script, bad acting except Janine Turner, no fancy, stupid plot, dumb husband and unfair divorce settings. If you've never seen this movie before or even bothered, it's not worth it. The only good thing about it was that Janine Turner did a good job. Terry's husband is a clever defense lawyer, who has won many cases and even brought guilty killers. He thinks he's so smart, but he's really just crazy. Your best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. Good girl, huh. Yes, she's a true peach, no. It is not a day at the beach either.
