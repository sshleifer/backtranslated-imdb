This was probably the worst movie of all time, seriously. I could really make myself better, it was not even configured correctly. It's as if this movie had a budget of $ 5 and came out with the change. Do not watch. I did not even get to the end of the movie, I had to turn it off. I gave it a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie, but it actually turned into a really bad comedy. Basically, a lot of girls hit a car, broke a beacon and the owner of that car went after them. The part I saw was a woman with a gun telling a load of girls to take off all the clothes, what the hell? It must be some kind of cheese porn movie too.
