Doc Savage: The Bronze Man is a horrible movie. Badly scripted, overdone and just silly. That said ... it's really a nice movie on some level. This movie begs to be seen in a group with a wide offer of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like "Santa Claus conquers the Martians" or "Yor, the hunter of the future" ... so bad it's almost good. If you have the right group of people, this movie is a blast to watch. It's exaggerated. It's fun. There's a Sousa theme. If you are looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW, I've heard rumors that some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake ...
