I remember this film, exhibited in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, during the time of one week. Although it may seem incredible, and I can not offer any explanation for this, this film was shown in a theater dedicated to ... art films and of great quality (ie, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and ... Man designed). Few people have seen this (thankfully people, no doubt) and no reference on this annoying SF movie can be found in Peter Nichols' science fiction Encyclopidie, or about the author of the original novel. Very indicative. I remember that, after all those years, a storyless, many special effects that actually seem ridiculous effects and nothing more. It appears that in some countries the execution time is 90 mm. and in another 77 min. Well, that just means a little more pain.
