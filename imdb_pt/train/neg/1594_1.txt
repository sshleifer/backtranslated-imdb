Wow. This movie bored my pants when I saw it. Bland and motionless. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash and co. can travel through time with the help of "The Forest Spirit" ('Princess Mononoke' a lot?) There, they find a dumb kid named Sam, and the "plot" begins. <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) get animated by nature, become hippies and try to free Celebi (the "Spirit") from some hunter weirdo. I do not even know what happened. Everything passed in a blur. Ash's friends were hardly there, and all the fighting scenes were boring. <br /> <br /> After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends should return to their time while they watch Sam float with Celebi (that scene was just scary.) So, after returning to his time, Ash he discovers that his new friend is actually the grandfather of his rival.And I think that's it.A very retarded, is not it? If you love your children, you do not expose them to this.
