This is one of those movies that should have been much better than it ended up being. I'm terrified of thinking what the Blockbuster-approved edition might have been like, because DVD editing on DVD was a hassle of epic proportions. Of course, you do not expect it to be "The Godfather," but one or two acting classes may have been helpful. <br /> <br /> In addition, there were many cute guys in this movie, but they were woefully under exploited. I like to see a bunch of cats squirming in their BVDs as much as the next guy, but even I have the right to wait a little longer. It was not a total loss, however; at least we have a look at Drew Fuller's (covered) spoil and a truly disturbing haircut. And there's Huntley Ritter looking even more handsome than in "Bring It On" (and acting as well). There is always a silver lining, children. You just have to look hard for that. And occasionally you need to use the pause button.
