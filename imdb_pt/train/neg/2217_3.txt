As the false Russian scientist says that two-thirds of the way to the film, "I came for science." That pretty much sums up the reason I watched this movie - anything that involves a half-man and half-hammer shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation by an aspiring and unbiased scientist. Or, as they say in business, my girlfriend's brother had the remote control and the rest is history. To say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects. That's 2005, it's not so difficult to shoot a car scene without a bluescreen background of cheese. Yes, that was charming and state of the art when Hitchcock was filming "The Birds", but in 2005 it seems only low budget. Spare me the cheap Sci-Fi try and make me the service of actually making a voluntary suspension attempt of disbelief. <br /> <br /> However, having seriously maligned the general concept of this movie, let me tell you again, as sad as it may sound, it is probably worth it. If nothing else, it's a bad sci-fi tour de force - it's worth educating for the new movie aficionado and certainly worthy of an upgrade course for those who have seen a few movies in their day. The crazy mad scientist hump with a hammer transceiver, who thinks it's a good idea to put a handful of blood in the nearby water, causes me to question not only the intelligence of mankind but also the ability of movie writers "B" to invent remotely plausible plots. <br /> <br /> This movie also fills one of my contests with long-time bad films - bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If it was not 2005, I would not worry about the fact that this movie was an insanely poor metaphor for the Cold War. I mean, you might as well have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon bird of prey inserting bleach into Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving lines in the film is when the girl without the bra insists that Charlton Heston's look-alike "wait for Tom" as he tries to lift the escape helicopter off the ground. The thing is, Tom is wasting the bad guys from the sunglasses with his endless banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov, or AK-47, in layman's terms. <br /> <br /> As the mad scientist says near the end of the film, "my goal is to evolve the human species" - suffice to say that this film contributed only to a return of humanity. The fragile Freudian references pronounced by the mad scientist in preparing the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about.
