I slept on my couch at 7:35 pm last night watching Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo but not last night). I woke up at 3 am (investing banker on the west coast), and was fascinated to see it on HBO2. I was shocked at how poor this 'movie' was. Seriously. shocked So shocked I had to write a comment about iMDB. This is really bad. the writing is boring, but the direction and editing are simply inferior to those of a freshman at a film school. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's videotaped. You see, this is shot in VIDEO, not in DIGITAL VIDEO. It sounds like a novel. The skateboard video clips have a more 'movie' feel to them, then this horror. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe the bad direction, but I honestly can not remember anything. The shots and blockages are stupid. Yes, I chose the word "stupid". not unconventional, not daring, not daring, not boring, just stupid. I know people who have reviewed this review will say, "Well, give me an example." I can not. It was 3 in the morning. but trust me, I know you will watch anyway, you will be attracted by the horrible comments. <br /> <br />
