This movie seems to have been made by someone with good ideas, but who also had never made a movie before, nor considered that a script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw John Candy and assumed, incorrectly, that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat and bland moments. And on top of that, Candy delivered some of the rougher lines I've heard so far. So, despite a potentially funny cast and story idea, we're left with an amateur and rough movie that is likely to be very stupid for the average adult, although teenagers are likely to find a few laughs. It's really a pity - it could have been so much better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy, it should have been wonderful.
