I had never heard of it before it appeared on cable. It's very typical of science fiction in the late 1950s: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is very well presented in a documentary style - which is perhaps an inexpensive way to leave a lot of exposure for the narration and an excuse to insert as much material as humanly possible. for what is unmistakably an extremely low budget endeavor! Although it is not uninteresting in itself (the angle of the apocalypse-renegade-missile was later used, with much greater ease, both for DR STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and mercifully short, the sincere approach of The subject matter results in a lot of unintentional laughter - particularly in scenes involving an imminent birth and a gang of juvenile delinquents with no concept!
