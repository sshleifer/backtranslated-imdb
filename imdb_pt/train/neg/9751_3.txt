The only reason I do not give this movie less than 3 stars is because it's not much like a movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this movie is the fact that it is extremely boring and terribly unforgivably British. The premise of this movie sounds potentially promising, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction they followed was completely uninteresting. It was more a film about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers. The actors were wooden, without emotion and indifferent. As was the case of love between the two scientists - which was anything but intriguing. I was never able to tell what the attraction was between them, since the chemistry was non-existent. I also did not understand why the main face of the luscious face decided to massacre everyone he encountered. At least now I know I should always give someone a fair hearing before cutting off their research grants, otherwise they get furious, killing unintentionally with pathetic gestures.
