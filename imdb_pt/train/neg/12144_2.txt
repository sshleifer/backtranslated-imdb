Although nothing can be compared to Vampires vs. Zombies ... in any realm of cinema I will try to judge this film. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were breathtaking. When there was an explosion on the television screen, I thought my whole house would explode, and when the automatic machine guns were fired, I thought the bombs were landing on the floor next to me. Simply dazzling my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene in which the sound of Jack Black seems to be giving the worst monologue I've ever heard, I almost killed myself, but do not worry, since he was freaking out. the film he can pass his terrible performance on "I must be tall". Seriously, he must have found himself babbling irrationally about noncongruous thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be "loud" to justify his horrible acting. Well, if you can say this to excuse terrible acts, then if you've talked to the writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you'll probably have the same answer ... seriously. With a production crew called "Shock-a-rama" I was shocked that I did not put a barrel rifle in my mouth and end my life after being heard a terribly shocking excuse for one movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, then you must be murdered <br /> <br /> Its Truly, <br /> <br /> The General
