This 2003 made for the TV movie was shown on a female channel, of course. As a man, why do I still try to watch it? I do not know, but I should have my head examined. And the director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of giving men an injustice like him. He takes away all the strength and conviction a man could have by getting several boring women to practice it. Number one is Joyce Hyser as wife. I could not wait for him to drop her. His revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing for most of the movie. The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you'd ever meet. His appearance did not guarantee that our protagonist was that monkey on her and his acting was so obvious that only a fool could make a mistake. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was very good, but slow in accepting the bitch seducing her own husband, again interpreted as a guy who is a loser, by David DeLuise. Completing our cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but frowns on for our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or should I say victim, was not that good. At first I thought he was just a bad actor, but then I believed. He never got the part of the floor and it was repetitive all over. Although, as a man, I was furious when the two women got away. Men, be careful with this channel that knocks down men and women, even with murders. LMN is the channel. Caution Note: Having seen this a second time by mistake, I am convinced of my initial thoughts. Especially in writer / director Simon Gornick. I still believe he disgraced the male species and should be whipped. Just saving grace in this movie is Tembi Locke, who does not have the chance to show off his talents with the terrible acting of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise around her. Beyond the stupid plot that only makes it worse. Below the Gornick movie and its vacant stars. Please LMN do not show this banal again.
