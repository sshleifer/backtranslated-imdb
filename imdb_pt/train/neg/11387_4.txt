Medell√≠n is a fabulous place to live, work and study. I've been there twice, and I've never heard anything about guerrilla activities, paramilitaries taking tourists as hostages or anything. There are "invisible police", but it's not * a Big Brother system. There are just enough police officers to be visible in everyday life, but they do not bother anyone without good reasons. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is an interesting documentary in which the youngsters he describes in the film essentially become characters. The directors of the film carefully carve plots between the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra, and when a "character" dies, there are genuine pathos. It is hard to imagine, however, that the three young people are all members of the Metro Block, a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> La Sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in Colombia; Of course, there are things to be cautious about petty crime, but when it is considered that theft happens in "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia does not look that different. Colombians eagerly await the chance to show the world that the country once ravaged by war is now thriving more than ever.
