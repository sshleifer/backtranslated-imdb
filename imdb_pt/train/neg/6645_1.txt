This guy has no idea of ​​the movies. Okay, it looks like he did a few theater shows of interest in his youth, and about two decent films that have had more success for political reasons because they cheated Communist censorship. All this is very good, but look carefully: he does not know his work! The scenes are unbalanced, without beginning and with a disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say on the subject, so he superlative with violence, nudity and gutter language. How is it possible to keep alive a corpse so rotten that he never understood anything about profession and cinematographic art? Why do not they let him succumb to pieces?
