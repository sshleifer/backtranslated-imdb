Seriously. I just finished my first Demonicus show and the words failed me. <br /> <br /> I remember a time when I saw the name of Charles Band in a movie and my heart was racing. He was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter. He was a bastion of hope for the little man. The guy whose movies came to the store rather than the multiplex, but they still rocked more than most of the modern junk we'd otherwise have to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> <br /> A painfully obvious Californian hiking trail bends to "the Alps" and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be "an ancient cave". I mean, they did not even try to dress the thing with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was not an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a scary demonic gladiator, as the cover says, we're presented with a guy wearing the latest Wal-Mart Halloween clothes. There is a very nice corpse, which occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle fingers, but he does not even stand until the final five minutes. Why could not he be the villain? Instead, we have fraternity boy Joe with a plastic sword. There. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is tied to these things. I love movies that are so bad they are good. Hell, I occasionally like such a bad move, it's bad. This, however, is just unwatchable. A perfect example of making a buck rather than making a quality movie.
