Devin Hamilton is probably best known as the new name in the legendary entertainment of the Full Moon. Unfortunately, his arrival at this independent studio came at a time when budget and production values ​​are at their lowest level in years. However, in his short career, Hamilton has established himself as a creative director who manages to create inventive and original stories. Now, this does not mean that your movies are good, but at least they are different from the usual in the horror genre. <br /> <br /> In his debut, "Bleed," Hamilton presents us with a creative twist on the sub-genre slasher. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who finally gets the job of her dreams. Not only that, but it seems that she also found a boyfriend in Shaun (Danny Wolske), it seems that life finally smiles at Maddy after many sad events. Even at a party with Shaun's friends, they tell her that they have created a "club" where members have to kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> Of course they're kidding, but Maddy desperately wants to fit in, that she actually kills someone. After this event, someone begins to kill the rest of the "club" members one by one. it's up to Maddy to figure out what's going on, since anyone could be the killer, including her. Maddy is a very interesting character, beautifully played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. It's a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects. The concept is so unique and Rochon's performance is so good that it's a shame that Hamilton has not developed the whole story a little better. The movie seems very slow sometimes and in general the feeling is that of a good idea wasted on a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is weird in the sense that the whole female cast is very good. , while the male cast is painfully bad. Danny Wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotyped. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appear in small appearances and are wonderful in their small roles. In addition, there is a lot of nudity (both male and female) and the cast is very handsome, so it really is an advantage. <br /> <br /> The low budget hurts the movie in the effects department, since there are very few bloody scenes and they are not really graphic (probably because they would look bad); however, considering the budget, the movie at least looks good. <br /> <br /> Hamilton's latest effort, the sexploective venture "Delta Delta Die!", is a better-crafted and more entertaining movie. While this is not as bad as other well known movies, it still has many flaws and may be interesting only to Debbie Rochon fans or independent movie fans without a budget. 4/10
