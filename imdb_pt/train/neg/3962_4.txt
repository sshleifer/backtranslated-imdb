I was really looking forward to seeing Nana after seeing Renoir's amazing debut work, Whirlpool of Fate. I had read that Nana was generally considered her best silent film, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, this seemed like a big step backwards. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem of this film. His acting is exaggerated, even for a silent film. His acting is more akin to what you'd expect in a movie since early adolescence, not the late 20s. She usually has the same face, which reminds me (sorry to say) of someone with constipation pains. It was also very difficult to believe that any man fell in love with this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about her. <br /> <br /> The film was also quite long, the camera work was uninteresting (plus a photo of a horse race) and the editing was monotonous. The story reminded me of Pabst's Pandora's Box. It's interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films. Pandora's Box simply scores on all levels where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This film is only for Renoir completists or very serious buffs of silent films.
