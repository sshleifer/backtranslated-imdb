Everyone in a short time, Disney makes one of the movies that surprises everyone. One that keeps you thinking until the end. In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie will surely turn into a ghost, kill and rape your village. It's terrible. If you want an irrational, foolish and predictable "action" movie, go ahead. I think young people can enjoy it, as they like when Good EVER wins. But I, I like movies, where is a winner who will win. This movie never lets bad guys have the edge. In the end, when the heroes are left in an "inescapable" hole, you simply KNOW that they can leave. Everything works perfect for Cage and his friends, he never has to think of a puzzle or track for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex. Watch this movie if you want to see some awesome projects, not if you want to see a good acting or a good movie. Go watch a superman movie, it would be much shorter, and the kids would like more. For example, the scene where Cage is fleeing armed gunmen and the bullets are all diverted by a railing of a fire escape. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just A LITTLE POLE) This movie shows the decadence of movies and the film industry for cheap jokes and a monotonous and unreal action that this movie offers in large quantities.
