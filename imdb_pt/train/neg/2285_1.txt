Well, it's 90 minutes of my life that I will not be back. This movie makes the teen TV show "California Dreams" look like "Almost Famous". The acting was horrible and plot unrealistic. Nor tell me about the current band at the forefront of this story, songs pitted, etc. You had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and there is enough irony in the movie. world to accept this. The guitarist is seen as a user of heroin, not that I blame him, if I were around a band so rotten with old songs and acting of wood, I would be injecting the horse too. <br /> <br /> If you get music remotely seriously, avoid this at all costs.
