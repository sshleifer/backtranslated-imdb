Do not watch this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda looking for this documentary and you will see facts and truths http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ The documentary series The Death of Yugoslavia (de five episodes) is a meticulously compiled and researched account of the widespread mass outpouring that marked the end of the former Federal Yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the 1990s. It includes a wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties, both "Yugoslav" and otherwise. The only real "improvement" that could be made for this startling achievement would be the inclusion of further developments in the Balkans since the program was made. This was indeed done in the late 1990s for a repeat performance on BBC television, but adding some even more recent events would help complete this admirable and detailed work. Maybe another whole episode can be justified? The very succinct title of this documentary has become even more appropriate for the eventual abandonment of the term "Yugoslavia" by the now-called Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a very late and formal admission of what occurred years earlier. /> non-fiction as in "Yugoslavia: The Avoidable War (1999)"
