I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago. I still can not believe what I saw. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the worst movie ever. If I listed all the flaws in the movie, this review would take me many phrases (very funny glitches, for being so bad) You have to be amazed at the ability of the commands assigned to rescue the plane. they did not even know how to move. Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and the thing I do not understand is how production wanted him to be like a hero, but he's a zero .. <br /> < of course the biggest crashes will be the landing of a 747, needing only 3 or 4 tips from a guy on the transmission to land the plane ... incredible ... just like the dead bodys who almost had no blood at all .. <br /> <br /> But I strongly recommend watching this movie, as it is very interesting to see how bad something can get
