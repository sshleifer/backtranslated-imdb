The only reason why "The Norliss Tapes" deserves ANY star is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. In addition to seeing Angie Baby in a pre-show "Police Woman", there is nothing else worth seeing here. David Norliss is called to write a book about the supernatural. One day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting that he came across something that put him in mortal danger. The whole series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently destined to be a series of flashbacks through "Norliss tapes" - a set of audio tapes recorded by the writer while investigating cases of the supernatural. <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode, a rich sculptor dies - but not before buying an old Egyptian scarab from a local occultist who assures him that the trinket will give him immortality after death. We soon discovered that the ring itself does not guarantee immortality. Instead, just reanimate the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape from his crypt so he can run around town draining beautiful girls from all his blood. <br /> <br /> Blue face, yellow eyes and growling out ARRRGHHHHHHs that you have been listening to since the last time you watched the "Scooby Doo" drawings, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) on a dark night . She escapes and, through mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get her help in solving the mystery behind the mysterious reappearance of her deceased husband on his property. <br /> <br /> So this guy is a vampire? No. There is no vampire in this story, despite what you may have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects them. As? Do not know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Because? To fulfill the second part of his offering for immortality. It turns out that the revived sculptor can only live forever if he build a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth, with a mixture of clay and human blood. Once finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as its gateway to our world. <br /> <br /> THE FINAL ANALYSIS: "The Norliss Tapes" were not collected. as a series for good reason ... it was rubbish. As you can see from my synopsis, history is an insignificant and ill-conceived mess. The acting and the dialogue do not offer better. This is not even a candidate for a "So Bad It Good" award. Sometimes evil is bad. <br /> <br /> After years of hearing rumors about the great merits of "The Norliss Tapes," I was very excited to see him on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I had not prepared myself for the fall. Having first moaned this moan two days ago, I can only take whatever applause you have heard so far from other IMDB reviewers. coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dark memories and the nostalgia of youth. Or maybe they are loyal fans of Dan Curtis. Either way, they offered you misleading reviews about "The Norliss Tapes". <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
