A typical Goth girl (Harvest of the Rainbow looking like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) sits with people she thinks have been tricked by the help of an old haunted mirror she finds in the new house she and her mother (horror) main, Karen Black, the only remotely good thing about this transvestite) buy. The acting is ridiculously poor (especially when Rainbow interacts with the mirror mentioned) and there are no scares or suspense. This film inexplicably gave rise to 3 sequences, each one a little more atrocious than the previous one. People looking for a cinematic theme with similar but far superior themes should just look for the episode of "Friday the 13th: the Series" in which a nerdy girl finds an old damn compact mirror. That packs more shivers in scarce 40 minutes than all this franchise has provided in its 4 films. <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling provides the obligatory T & A
