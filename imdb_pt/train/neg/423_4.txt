I do not know why, but after all the hype on the NPR I thought this was a new movie ..... all the best pictures were used for BBC documents and NatGeo projects that you saw, if you are interested in nature ... has been repackaged with sentimental narration and super-dramatic music for Disney to harness Earth Day - there are great times, and it's always good to hear Darth Vader ....... oops, .. ..... .... James Earl Jones speaks, but I expected an innovative film considering the new camera technology used in the production of this film ... has been sanitized for a children's audience, so one can actually see better footage for free on YouTube. ... I feel we are about something as innovative as Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this film is certainly not this
