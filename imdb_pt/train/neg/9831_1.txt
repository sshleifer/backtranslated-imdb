I tried watching this movie without actually being able to sit through it as it is supposed to have a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to a particular interpretation of the scriptures. An interpretation, in my opinion, will fool a lot of people. Besides, I'm a movie maniac and the acting in that movie was completely unacceptable. Never before have I wished for a negative rating to evaluate a movie. So if you want to be nailed incessantly by those without authority then by all means get this movie. This comment is also a warning for people who like or love scifi, because the title will also fool a lot of people. This was an unfortunate movie because the basic idea had possibilities and these possibilities were wasted. The only redeemable quality of the film is that it made me realize that the character in Time Machine probably should have shown a little more moral indignation at the strange behavior of those in their future.
