I entered the theater with the intention of spending a pleasant 90 minutes entertained, if not illuminated. I did not leave nor entertained nor illuminated. This movie can not decide what it wants to be and ends up not being much of anything. There are some funny lines and some incredibly pretentious movie references (The 400 Blows - for this character?). Although none of the characters are treated with much respect, the more than thirty gay men have the worst: all predators, fat, sad and awkward. If you're in the mood for a film about homosexual relationships, check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. You will thank me. <br /> <br />
