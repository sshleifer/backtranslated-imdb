My God, this is a bad movie. I was totally fooled by my local movie review because this is certifiable rubbish. Yes, yes, good guys wear white, bad guys wear black ... and good guys always win. Now go home, hug your kids and feel like Hollywood feels good. Blech! I can not believe this brain-dead movie was made by Wes Craven. I'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage, so he made this piece of manure. It's the kind of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could be as good or better than such a seasoned director. See, a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves his father to do something bad or he's going to hurt her father. But being the All-American girl next door, we know she'll save the day and beat the bad guys ... the end. Girl power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> Come on now, only an idiot would find it fun ... "a roller coaster," much less something new or fresh. All the "super-duper" comments you see on this site are from industry hacks who are making money from this movie, paying a favor, or selling their souls to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is gorgeous .... yes, that's it. Not a good performance, not horrible ... she's just cute. She would have to show a lot of skin to save this movie. She is not strong enough to be a good female action leader. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was at least acceptable in 28 days. But here he plays an idiot villain pretending to be smart. He gets kicked around 5'5 '' McAdams, because after all, she was a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure she owns all of them. the Tae Bo tapes. So that she is able to evict an international terrorist for rent. I would not trust him to steal a 7-11 pack of chewing gum. <br /> <br /> Look, this movie was made before, except before they did it well. Go re-rent any of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger, international terrorists, except that the characters are more friendly and believable and the bad guys are much more competent and interesting. I just do not understand how Hollywood can continue to do such crap as if they were oblivious to the appropriate models they can readily copy. No wonder the movie's revenue has dropped. <br /> <br /> Throw your $ 6 into the toilet and save 2 hours of your life and never come back. <br /> <br /> ciao, FreddyShoop
