I think Micheal Ironsides' career must be over, if he has to star in this kind of crap. Surely he could do better than waste his time on this crap. <br /> <br /> This movie could be so much better, if it had a good budget, but it would show repeatedly the whole movie. There's a scene at an outpost, it seems, it's outside the front of a train station, and I bet it was. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that gave this movie a 3, and it shows the spacecraft landing and taking off on a lake, surrounded by forests. That was well done, but the rest of the movie, forget it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene, which looks like an engineering plan, which I bet, and it does not look like a space outpost as the character says it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, has a low budget seriously, does not make sense and helps Michael Ironsides.
