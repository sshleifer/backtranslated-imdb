For your own good, it would be best to disregard any positive reviews about this movie. This movie blinks. Now, I like (at least in theory) low budget horror movies, but this makes the worst mistake a low budget movie can do: it takes itself very seriously. And, unfortunately, that's not the only problem. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the killer Beane clan of the British Ilses transposed into modern times. An interesting premise, but there are two things that are immediately disconcerting about this movie once you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1 - Why is the biggest name of the CD box Jenna Jameson? She is a sub-average woman who can not act, and she has a minor role. ANSWER: She's apparently a well-known porn star (as you undoubtedly read in other reviews), so I think this is a cameo appearance for her. She's giving the much needed "name recognition" film, it seems. His top billing is no indication of his talent, however, it is an indication of how the rest of the cast is non-talented. <br /> <br /> How can filmmakers be so stupid to think that Canada can be passed like Ireland? It does not even remotely look like Ireland. And the house the guests / victims stay in is this great Edwardian thing in a North American wooden frame. They should have ignored the whole Beane theme and developed a story that took place in NA. Also, if you're making a movie in Ireland, it's probably better to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and that was an Irish accent REALLY REALLY EVIL.) Now, that would not have been so bad if the director was not trying make the next "Night of the Living Dead," but it seems he was. What a pity. He could have had fun with it. In fact, some of the scenes were not far from being unintentionally comical as they were. Like the infamous scene of disembowelment, the woman is chained to the table naked and then cut and opened. eviscerated This is funny, you ask? Well, in the deleted scene version, the mutant killer approaches mile after mile of intestines. It's really funny after a while. And what self-respect cannibal eat bowels, anyway? Do we eat chicken and chicken intestines? No, we eat hams and ribs and thighs. Oh well. <br /> <br /> Some of the other actors who were annoying: the reluctant and frightening Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think it should be scaled like a STUD. In fact, he is a big loser and silly as his name would imply. Which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying Gillian Leigh fell for him. <br /> <br /> I checked Gillian Leigh on her IMDb link, and apparently it's important to know that she graduated from high school with honors. I can not decide if it's more fun or pathetic to know that just a few years after graduation, the honor student is doing nude soft-core porn scenes in a shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. Wonder if your ex-classmates saw this movie? If so, we hope you get the message: AVOID THIS FATE! GO TO COLLEGE !!! I could go on and on, but why? If you like blood, you will find something that rescues in this movie, but not much more.
