I saw this movie a few months ago in the city that appeared as Greendale in the movie, which is the only reason I went to see it. Another place that was there just sent me an e-mail from a repeated ad because the first one had been sold and people were turned down. His editorial comment on his front is a good summary: "Yuk." <br /> <br /> Unless you are a fan of Neil Young or live in / near "Greendale" (if the latter you know the real name), skip this movie. It's mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker. It has no perceptible plot, the music is simply OK, and much of the lyrics are unintelligible, making it impossible to follow the little bits of storyline that may exist. <br /> <br /> I do not need to put a spoiler alert because there are no surprises to give away. <br /> <br /> I'd give him a 1.5 / 10 rating, but that's just for the fun value of seeing the places turned into a movie. Not worth the $ 6. I could rent a video camera and drive around "Greendale" and make a better movie myself. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a * good * environmental message movie without plot, go rent Koyaanisqatsi.
