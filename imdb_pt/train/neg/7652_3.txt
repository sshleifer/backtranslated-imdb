In 1967, the miners find the remnants of an ancient civilization gone missing called Abkani, who believes that there are worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil passed before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the 713 Government's Paranormal Research Agency Department was led by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who conducted experiments with orphaned children. Nowadays, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just obtained an Abkani artifact in South America, and is pursued by a man with abilities. When an old friend of the foster home disappears in the middle of the night, he reveals that the demons are returning to Earth. With the support of anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his squadron, they fight against evil creatures. <br /> <br /> Despite having a good charismatic cast, led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in the Dark" never works and is a complete mess with no character development or plot. The reason can be explained by the "brilliant" interview of director Uwe Boll in the DVD Extras, where he says that "video games are the bestsellers of younger generations that are no longer led by books." In addition, your target audience would be people between twelve and twenty-five years of age. Sorry, but I think both statements are disrespectful to the younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not that kind of stupid stereotype that the director says. In addition, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Alone in the Dark" The "Awakening of Evil" ("Alone in the Dark"
