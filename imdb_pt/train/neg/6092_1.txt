Someone must have joked seriously when they made this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is an absolute impossibility that this film was made in 1993. Fashions and music dictate that this is serious at age 80. My guess is that it stayed on the shelf for a long time until some crazy distributor picked it up and threw it into an unbelieving world. <br /> <br /> There is a plot. More or less. A lonely stranger meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favorite song, he will be able to transform into whomever he wants. At this point, I feel obliged to point out that the lonely's favorite song is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is this your favorite song? Because he's an idiot. We are only a minute away from the film and the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity. It gets even more stupid. <br /> <br /> The loner is the nostril picker. I can only assume this as there are two scenes in the movie in which he is seen poking his nose. That clears the title. He decides to become a girl so he can get close to other girls. And kill them. That's more or less it. <br /> <br /> The acting is universally shocking. Every single performance in this movie sucks. Actually, I would say that acting is the standard of a pornographic movie. This is really terrible. The nostril picker appears to the public as the nostril picker. The characters in the film see him as the girl he became singing London Bridge Is Falling Down. Dude, I feel like an idiot even typing this. Anyway, it's kinda weird to see a middle-aged crazy man hanging out with girls from school. And not in a good way. There is even an extended set of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays on top. It's quite possibly the worst song ever recorded. I will not even describe it. You will know when you hear this. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes of violence, of course. And there's a Benny Hill-style chase sequence involving a transsexual. There is even an immortal dialogue, which may or may not have been taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the nostril tells a prostitute: "I have the money if you have the cut." Lovely, I'm sure you'll agree. <br /> <br /> Absolute nonsense.
