Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third round, although I'm not sure anyone cares at this point, except for rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last film, is resurrected through voodoo, and is now on the trail of several scoundrels involved in the shooting of a cop Cordell likes very much. I missed some of this low-budget quickie from the early 1990s, but it was nice to see Cordell rampaging the body count in various horrible ways. The problem is that the film in general is rather static, and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. Interest quickly dwindles, even with the great master of movie B, Robert Forster, as a doctor who wipes out his scrambled brains. Stay with the first movie in the series, which is funny, scary and exciting, all at the same time.
