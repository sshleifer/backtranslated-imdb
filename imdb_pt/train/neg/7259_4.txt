This is definitely one of the strangest movies of the '70s out there, and it's most notable for starting a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. It is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the film, especially when the somber and melancholy first half is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, who paddles in a canoe for a while, then ... leaves, never to be seen again). Although it's painfully dated now, I'm still a fun horror movie to show for kids, and anyone who likes both Bigfoot folklore and the 70's hickory culture will surely enjoy it. My favorite part: a guy gets so scared that he bounces headlong through the door (!?) And the narrator explains that he became unconscious of "shock". I'd say breaking a door with his head is more likely because he was unconscious, but whatever. <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad Americana.
