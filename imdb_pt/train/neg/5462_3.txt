This program bothers me! There's no humor in it and it's too serious to be called "fun"! It's very educational for my taste! The characters are very stereotyped and unattractive. Plots are redundant and morality is repeated only several times. Where's the fun in that? I also feel that this has been on the BBC for a long time and is very much transmitted. Does it really need to have a space on the TV every 2 or 3 months when a new show ends up with episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to start bringing back some of its older programs like Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snorkos, Moomins, Raccoons and Earl Duckula, as well as continually giving contracts to these younger shows! I thought the BBC brings back the Danger Mouse, so what's up with this?! 3/10
