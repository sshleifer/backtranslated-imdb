How do I get started? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. He has no redeemable qualities. I just watched this movie and it was a fight. He did not even get a single smile on my face. I find it hard to believe that someone would distribute this horrible movie. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at unpleasant humor. The only thing that paid off on this movie was the soundtrack, I'm sure that's the reason why I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I will finish this as I will try to forget the time I just did. Wasted with this piece of crap. I'll leave you with this warning. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, SUCK.
