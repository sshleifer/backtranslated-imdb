I am sorry that the people calling kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood! The movie is an emotionless thriller .. <br /> <br /> Get out of your ass and watch some high-class thrillers like The Usual Suspects or even The Silence of the Lambs. Technically good, but style over kamal substance does not look like a cop, there is no emotion that is dragging and boring until the end you may be saving 3 valuable hours of your life if you skip watching this movie. <br /> <br /> kamal at its best is the best in tollywood
