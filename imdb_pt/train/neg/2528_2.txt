The Van is a movie that looks good on a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van in order to seduce them. The only thing this movie does not fail to accurately portray is the fad in the US in the late '70s. It looks like it was totally made by amateurs. It's rubbish, but I loved it! I have to admit I'm a fan of the trash of the 70's! I hope this gets to the bottom of IMDB 100! <br /> <br /> 2
