for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, here's your chance, and then back to the real world. The guy who hid the gold in the first movie said Twitch, so he is transferred to another prison where the wrestling champions look shocked. Twitch plans to leave the jail in a month to get the gold to start a life with his wife. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone gets shot, and the movie turns into Hard to Kill in another prison. But the fighter's daughter gets caught up in everything, so he and contraction will find her and Twitch's wife. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the performance is below normal, it has a lot (very annoying rap music and badly edited fighting scenes. On the plus side, there is that Hispanic guy in it, who stars in all prisons / actions / thriller of all time, and he closes the door. <br /> <br /> It's not too hectic, but at least it's harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were a big fan of original, it's okay. <br /> <br /> If not, you've been warned.
