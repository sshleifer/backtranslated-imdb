This has a good and deep cast, but for a thriller you'd better hand in more than the actors and talk. The first third of this film was nothing more than conversation and conversation. Most were a bunch of women complaining about everything to each other. <br /> <br /> The first five actors listed here are women, so this proves that it's really a "girl movie" and little else. This probably plays on the Lifetime network. <br /> <br /> There was a quick murder scene and then more talk. Halfway there, they had lost me. By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years old here.
