This has to be one of the worst films ever made. Even for a biker movie, it's the bottom of the pit. The minimal storyline involves a gang of motorcyclists taking over a small town (as original!) And the city's attempts to confront them. Why do not they ask for outside help? Who knows? The fight scenes are obviously false. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it but both have little to do and both seem embarrassed to be there (understandably) This movie belongs to the trash!
