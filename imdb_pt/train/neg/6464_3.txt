Watching Marlen Brando on the screen is like seeing a master carpenter carving intricate details on a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is inane and laughable (not comical). The other big names seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters that portray a bit of humanity ... these characters have the humanity of the wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this movie is mediocre or just awful. The director shoots slow motion pictures and slow motion with impunity. Incidental music is caricatured and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was out. The venerable Brando could not divert the focus from the horrible rags that enveloped him. I heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "irreverently funny" ... it's neither. David Lynch's films are the result of perverse creativity - this film was by no means creative. And do not confuse irreverence with stupidity.
