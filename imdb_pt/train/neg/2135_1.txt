Only total junk. I'm a big fan of the Cusacks, which is the only reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see it was to replay, with full and deep quality, the exact roles of Grosse Point Blanc. Moreover, the role of films as a political satire fails miserably for being too obvious, even for the dumbest there are to serve any purpose. And charging this as satirical satire would insult even the chimpanzees. Imitation is apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as this is nothing close to Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as meeting the Spartans (see if you're an idiot) in terms of political satire, let's make it well enough and let this one disappear in the darkness it deserves.
