I used to be an avid spectator until I personally spent long hours helping to build a home for the White Family, just to be sick of seeing the house a year later. All the beautiful stone landscaping was removed, the stunning stone driveway and front fountain were removed, all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front were cut off, sprinkler system was plucked. Now it looks like a disaster area. They do not even live there anymore ... they live "in the city" and leave only for the weekend. It makes me sad to think of all the hours that the great Oklahoma people have donated to these people and to see the result. The story we all saw on TV was not quite the truth ... do not believe everything you see and hear.
