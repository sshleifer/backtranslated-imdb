I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made, when I saw the trailer on TV I knew from the second 1 that this would be a piece of dick and it would be better to avoid it, but somehow I was dragged to see this for some friends, I walked into the movies with low expectations, but I was hoping there would be some cheap laughs to keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this movie bring a shrinkage in the face, are made up mostly of people carrying blows on their faces and balls, the baby looking strange and acting like a horny gangster and the typical running jokes that we see so often in comedies of today's junk. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe, but also predictable and dull. The characters are extremely annoying and strongly stereotyped. I never want to have to see this movie again, I'd rather carry a bullet in the foot than be exposed to this piece of wood ever again. If someone I see says he likes it, I'll physically punch them in the face.
