The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical side of the movie is very good .. even the direction of it. The main problem is with foundries, which turned this film into almost another local, regular clich√©, with great lack of impact and even greater lack of printing. Beside his father's small role, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all the other actors were, unfortunately, at their best. The role of the older blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was new, but without any intensity as the lead role. therefore, the figure she represented had become light and discreet. There were moments and episodes that seemed more like an essay than a real movie. But after all it's a good point to start and make great improvements in the future.
