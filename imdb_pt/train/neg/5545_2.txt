"Zombie Uprising" proves that having the same director renovating and recycling an idea does not necessarily make a lightning strike twice. <br /> <br /> The Halperin brothers, responsible for the "White Zombie" horror classic, did this. A trivial piece of junk some years later to profit from its popularity and even from the recycled close-ups of Lugosi's eyes from that previous film. There was a legal battle with the rights owners of the movie "White Zombie," which did not want the Halperins to use the word "zombie" in this title. That word was the only thing that could help this movie because, as everyone knows, bad movies can make a lot more money simply by having the word 'Zombie' in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of doing a few years ago just makes this movie uninteresting more insulting. It seems he never directed another horror movie after this disaster. The zombies here do not seem to be real undead, but simply victims of hypnotism. <br /> <br /> Do you want to create a zombie army controlled by the mind? Be ready to break some eggs, including your own. <br /> <br /> The LAME PLOT: The man falls in love with an intriguing woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend, whom she loves, with jealousy. This leads man to a spiral of madness in which he tries to use zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to conquer a woman who is not worth spitting. <br /> <br /> This includes one of the most egregiously obvious plot developments I've ever seen. You would have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming. The acting is not good. This film makes the racially insensitive "King of the Zombies" (which appeared on the same double DVD I bought) look like an atmospheric horror masterpiece in comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic. This makes the festive zombie-cheeked alien sci-fi "Invisible Invaders" look like a serious drama. This is a great ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic that it could probably make many fans of Korean films squirm (South Korean films are known for using melodrama). Credits list the ironically named company Favorite Movies. I'm not sure which favorite movie it would be, but they're obviously an idiot. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for fans of: zombies, romance or classic movies.
