Just do not bother. I thought I'd watch a movie with great support and action. <br /> <br /> But it becomes boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the movie you have a little social drama and all the tension is lost because it slows down. In the end, it looks better but not very good. I think the director took this movie very seriously. In such a movie, even if you do not mind the plot, at least you want some legal action. I almost dozed in the middle / main part of him. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
