Since the "Rugrats" fell out of the category of good and funny cartoon series for a mediocre and really horrible fare for two-year-olds in the last three or four years, obviously the Klasky-Csupo tyrants should be out of ideas. After dumbing down all the characters, adding new ones, more stupid, replacing some voices (though I like Nancy Cartwright, she's NOT Chucky Finster!), And having no sense of continuity (eg: in a Kimi episode I watched Another day, Tommy and Chucky each have a new puppy, but in the subsequent episode, the dogs mentioned above never appear), you think the creators could kill the show for mercy. But noooo. <br /> <br /> All I'm going to say about this special is that it sucks! Although not as horrible as Kimi's episodes, everyone is even more stupid than them, including Grandpa (my God! He used to be the best character on the show, but now, he has no real purpose). The ending is unnecessarily cute, and the only thing different between this and other new episodes ('98 -'01) is that kids can interact with adults. Whoa, what fun! <br /> <br /> No star for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please DESTROY this show before it gets worse.
