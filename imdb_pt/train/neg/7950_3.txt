Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity. Unaware of the work of the director, I am well acquainted with the filmmaker he supposedly pays homage to - Ozu Yasujiro. Although not approaching Ozu in greatness, Hou did not communicate anything of the depth of emotion and concentration of Ozu in an enclosed space. One of the things he misses is Ozu's attention to the character - we're not even "introduced" by Hou to his main character (a perfect blank page). There are no average or close photos of your staff. One of the extras on the DVD offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what the Hou does not do - a good look on their faces. <br /> <br /> There was a great Spanish film by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "Nothing Ever Happens". That would be a much better title for this useless exercise. Throughout the film, we received clues about an obscure Taiwanese composer whose work we listened to on the soundtrack. But clues, like everything else, add up to nothing. Unless you're a trainspotter, this movie has nothing to recommend it.
