A pale shadow of a major musical, this film suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the point of the musical, unnecessarily "opens", and drives the impulse of the play. The show is about a group of dancers doing a test for a job at a musical B'way and examines their motivation and desire to work in this demanding and not always rewarding line of work. Attenborough offers us a new cast of aspirants, assuming they are trying to get their "big break" in show business instead of presenting the mix of characters created on stage as a working group "gypsies" live show to show along with a couple of newcomers. The film has an edge over the game and this is the opening scene, showing the original audition size and the true shrinking scale up to the 16/17 line (depending on how you tell Cassie, who is stupidly kept off the line in the movie). Anyone who can watch a local civic light opera production will have a much richer experience than seeing this ill-conceived film.
