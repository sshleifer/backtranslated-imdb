I've noticed how all the other reviews in this movie mention how "healthy" and "fun" it is. These people need to leave the house more often. I do not know why they are cursing at this insipid, tasteless, brainless piece. Pat Boone has absolutely no talent, and her ineptitude is surpassed only by her co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (another reason to outlaw the insidious practice of inflicting un-talented models on an unsuspecting audience, a unfortunately it persists to this day). A good supporting cast (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) struggles to make some sense out of it, but to no avail. I noticed that two directors shared credit, although "credit" was not the word I would use (none of them "director"). As for "healthy entertainment," there are many types of movies available without torturing your loved ones, forcing them to be aware of it. Find one of these movies and skip this one.
