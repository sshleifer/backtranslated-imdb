I do not usually comment, but there are things that need to be said. Where to begin ... <br /> <br /> The acting, on the side of Jeremy London, was horrible! I did not think he could be that bad. The plot could have been good if it had been well directed along with good solid performance from the lead actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining, but be disappointed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I have good laughs. I would not waste my time if I were you.
