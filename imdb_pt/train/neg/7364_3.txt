In 1692, Salem, a childish lie about wrapping a slave in witchcraft, causes the whole community to panic. The fantasy drama starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not muffled, though it is not a vivid representation of contagious hysteria either. Worked by three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King), the elements of the story are quite interesting (especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937), though for anyone who has read Arthur Miller's "The Crucible," melodrama in display here will not be tolerated for long. The biggest problem with the image may be in the cast: Colbert and MacMurray are a pair of ill-matched lovers harmed by the witch-hunt, MacMurray being too contemporary a presence for these environments. * 1/2 of ****
