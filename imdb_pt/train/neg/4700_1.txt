I totally hated the movie. It was so retarded. They need some acting lessons ... no, wait, that will not help because the Naked Brothers Band staff is slow. Do you know why I'm here even though I'm a hater of the Naked Brothers Band? To warn people before they watch the stupid movie so NBB does not make any money from it, then they can not do stupid amateur songs that are so retarded that any old guy could write in 10 seconds. It's not just the lyrics of retarded songs, they sing poorly. Ok, I'm kind of getting out of the movie here ... anyway, it was annoying and they acted horribly. It was not funny at all, though they tried hard to be. I think they deserve some credit for this ... well, the movie is not worth your time. Just look at your rating. The film (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone with half the brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you need to watch movies where the actors actually act, without babbling their lines in a monotonous tone. I'm in my school's drama club and some people are actually BETTER than the guys Nat and Alex. Hurry, before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poop. I do not even know why I went through the middle of the movie. I do not think it deserves to be called a movie ...
