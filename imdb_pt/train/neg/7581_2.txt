I saw this movie the other day in a movie school class, and I had not seen an Almodovar movie before, but I hoped it was good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a nonsensical movie with just a few laughs mixed in two hours of boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that may have worked in their own separate movies, but together they do not contribute to any kind of meaningful whole. <br /> <br /> Or so I thought. So the next day, my film teacher spent the whole class period explaining all the little hidden details of the movie, how the mural depicting stereotyped flamenco dancers at the bottom of the drag queen scene is some kind of comment about the lack of identity that Spain as a nation developed under fascist rule. Apparently, the whole movie is filled with little visual tricks and clever references like that. <br /> <br /> Good, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good movie - you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention, something that interests the viewer enough to really care about all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives us strange characters, but keeps them mostly in mundane situations recycled from other films, and Almodovar does not seem to use them to make any kind of argument. What is the meaning, for example, of the revelation of the Hitchcockian surprise character that occurs at the end of the film? Why is that really there? Just to surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is a funny scene that has to do with a newscast. And that's it, that's the only fun time. The rest of the film is just meaningless cinematic references and visual hints that apparently exist only to show us just how clever Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film teacher says, it takes more than self-indulgent tricks for a movie to be good.
