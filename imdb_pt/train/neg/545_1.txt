this is just the ordinary Indian junk that turns into movies, since the Indians can boast that we have the biggest movie industry but also the worst. <br /> <br /> How do other poor countries have movies with real movies? characters who challenge the visions of their respective societies and we just keep pumping junk. take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, see the brilliant films they have and we're bullshit like Kisna !! <br /> <br /> attract real people, it is no wonder that the international community in general laughs at Indian cinema.
