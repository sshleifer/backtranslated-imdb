This is a werewolf movie made very cheap. The video is dark and poorly lit. The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is a clich√© rubbish with the usual characters, like the detective who shoots werewolves with his silver weapon! [full of course with silver bullets]. The acting is as wood as the characters. FX is non-existent, many extreme close-ups of werewolves jaws and bites. the only thing that is shown is a lot of soft-core T & A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this offer, check out a recent werewolf picture: "Dog Soldiers," featuring Sean Pertwee.
