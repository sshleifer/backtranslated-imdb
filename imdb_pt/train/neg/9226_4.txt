Okay, the movie festival audience probably loved it. But the typical popcorn movie goer who put together the ten or fifteen dollars it costs to watch a movie these days probably will wonder why he or she made that choice. If it is stamped "Copolla" is automatically great, right? Wrong! It is a perfect parody of the pretensions of cinema. But it is terribly "in". I worry when filmmakers are more concerned with entertainment than with the public. It's interesting as a cinematic curiosity and has a laugh or two in it. But once you're on your way in movies and on TV, dust will increase in the film cans and in the tape boxes that hold it. Hardly or epocal or an epic!
