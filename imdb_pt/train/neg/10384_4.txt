.. THIS IS A! Very cool premise, right away. <br /> <br /> It has a great first scene, you have to give credit where credit is due. <br /> <br /> It has solid characters and a script decent enough for a ghost story. but here are the things that bothered me: whenever the ghosts appeared, what I really liked about it; how it was done, how it looked ... the only thing was the ghost relationship. Because of the way things fell in the first scene, you think their dynamics would be different. <br /> <br /> Things slowed down a little too much in the way I felt, and the crab / spider scene was just not good. BUT the end is really very good! Of course, 'The Grudge' basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurais and that's what I liked about this movie comparatively. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with a tempered style revisits this movie. <BR> Silent Rage fans would love this movie.
