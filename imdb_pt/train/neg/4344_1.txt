If you hit your head with a spade, write the script with your feet, you can get close to the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this movie that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster movies and done so much better. Those who think that "Scarface" was some kind of hero to be admired or saw "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead Presidents" and thought MMM "This is the life for me!" will like this movie. I thought about giving the film a chance, since the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved. Anyone over 4th grade, see the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.
