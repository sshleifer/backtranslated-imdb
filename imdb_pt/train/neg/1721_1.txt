A crater lake with a meteor (hence our title), awakening a Plesiosaurus, which continues to make a snack in the population's hickory (in California, this great capital of the world). <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and then there's "The Crater Lake Monster," which somehow escaped the MST3K. Featuring grating action, a decent stop-motion beast, and more, this is a terrible piece of the 1970 low budget movie / monster movie. <br /> <br /> While the film is guilty of many crimes, the biggest of them is Arnie and Mitch, two obnoxious redneckious that serve as our comic relief. They bumble around, fight to stock up "banjo music", covet women and act as pathetic excuses of humanity. The characters are so bad they must count as a crime against humanity.
