Why did any legitimate actor who read the script participate in this crap? My god is really embarrassing to watch. I can not imagine the shame these people should feel for being part of it. In addition, there is apparently some controversy over whether River Phoenix had a special participation in the film. He was not credited, but his list of roles here (IMDB) gives credit to him. BTW ... Rain is your sister to those who were already asking before. This movie is proof that no matter how many great "names" you have. The ears of the nut do not make silk bags. I love Lorraine Bracco, but that was sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someone one day can explain the reason for this kind of movie. It has no captivating, fun or even comic properties compared to anything else that is bad.
