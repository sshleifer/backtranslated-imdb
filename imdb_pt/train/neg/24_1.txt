I have to congratulate the genius who approved this. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think, you can not pick up every piece of low-cost amateur crap that has the sole intention of getting some money. <br /> <br /> Filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would have the same result, or rather. <br /> <br /> The acting, let's just say: do not go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or at least have some damn experience! The director .. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director, you just suck. Its direction is bad, the angles are messy (not in a good way), the lines seem to be being read on toilet paper and the damn music ... always appears when it should not and leaves for no apparent reason. And do not go to the writer, by the way. Making movies is not like serving in a coffeshop, it requires art and skill, things that I really doubt you have. <br /> <br /> Instead of making a shooting movie, you should have filmed this Back to Oblivion and wait until something good comes up. Or just find a job at a coffeshop. You will have less stress and save some money and a bad night for cinemagoers. <br /> <br /> Vote: 1/10 (my first)
