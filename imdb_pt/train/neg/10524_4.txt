I really wanted to see this movie in the theater. He was really exhausted. In fact, I went to see Solaris, which was actually the worst film released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), an astute 'street pharmacist, gets scared when he sees a boy take a shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be going really well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). It happened too late in the movie, so if they had not revealed it in the preview, it could have been an interesting twist. But they did, then it is not. <br /> <br /> Actually, there is not an interesting thing about this movie; everything is given in the preview. If you watched just one preview, you saw the whole movie, so you might want to think hard to fill in the blanks. Go to the site, download the preview, save $ 3.99. There is not a single surprise or twist in the whole movie, other than how terrible the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> I hope that whoever has been in charge of writing the soundtrack has been fired. Twice. Most of it would be music if the only songs allowed to be released were the duets of Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and (I can break the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as numbing as that) both had less talent and musical ability. <br /> <br /> The acting is at best poor, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at most 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) Obfuscates the rest of the cast with his acting skills.
