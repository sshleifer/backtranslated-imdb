This is the greatest insult to TMNT of all time. Fortunately, officially Venus does not exist in the TMNT canon. There will never be a female tortoise, this has taken away the tragic tale of 4 unique male mutants who will never have a family of their own, since they no longer have. The biggest mistake was crossing Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were WRONG and all acted out of character. They could have done a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this people ... it is a material worthy of shivering. the labial flap was slow and unnatural. They totally disrespected shredder. the main villain, a dragon face was mushy. the turtles looked cheesy with the things hanging on their bodies, what about the thing around raph's thigh? the carved plastrons looking silly!? If they seemed normal, they acted in character and got rid of Venus, got rid of the stupid infantile sounds of cartoons ... and writing better could have been good.
