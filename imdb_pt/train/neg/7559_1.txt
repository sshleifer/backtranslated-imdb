This has to be one of the worst fillums I have ever seen and I have seen some. He is slow, boring, amateur - not even consistent in his own simplistic reading of the plot. The actors do not act. I can not blame them - they have been given a script of such absolute banality that all they can do is march for him with a pain behind their eyes that has nothing to do with the events of evil in SummersIsle. <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in this movie that sounds true - not an honest line or a single moment when someone is moved. Nicholas Cage's character is so battered that he does not feel a little sympathy for him during all his tribulations. I have no doubt that I was seeing a suffering man up there but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.
