I liked the initial premise for this movie which is what led me to hunt it, but the problem I found quickly is that one pretty much knows what will happen in the first 20-30 minutes (the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take care of everyone). <br /> <br /> There is no real turnaround (which is good), but the final revelation also does not make much sense (as it can be plagued by uncertainty and fear of the whole movie if it is an evil id beyond the mirror?). <br /> <br /> Of course the 'beyond the mirror' scenes were chilling when they first appeared and the blonde's murder is also really scary, but in the end this seems to be a movie in search of a story or a more engaging script, piling atmosphere on the atmosphere and on the scary upper sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut, in fact, gets pretty annoying.
