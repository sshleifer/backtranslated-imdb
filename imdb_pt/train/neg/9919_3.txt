In the opening scene of "Malta Story," Mr. A. Guinness had such a striking resemblance to Noel Coward that I hoped his first words were "Certain women need to attack regularly - like gongs" or some kind of world - wearful bon Unfortunately his dialogue is almost an immortal prose and even the Master would have difficulty bringing him to life. In fact, Guinness wanders through the image as if searching for a focal point and can not find one. And therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole film. Mr. J. Hawkins also gave up early and ended up giving a performance of "Jack Hawkins" without a trace of individuality. It could have been divided into any of a dozen British war films. Many of the early 1950s suspects appear and make their schtick for very little purpose. The Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta until submission, just as it did not leave London on its knees. The courage of the Maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognized by the king and the island received the award of George Cross. worthy subject you may think of a movie, but "Malta Story" does not even qualify for the term "dignified" in its most patronizing sense. He gives the impression of being hastily patched to a deadline, perhaps before the actors lose their will to live.
