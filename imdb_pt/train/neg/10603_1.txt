I tried to watch this movie twice and both times I still could not get to the final credits. The first time I got through the first fight sequence, I lost interest. The second time I was able to force myself to digest for over an hour of bad acting, SFX limping and extremely bad direction. Pales compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Has anyone ever heard of the old fiasco of the ET Atari 2600? For those who would not let me fill you up. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest box office hits of all time ... Atari decides to launch a tie-in game on its 2600 console. To cut a long and painful story, the game failed and resulted in thousands and thousands of Atari 2600 ET games to be thrown into landfills because they could not even sell and sell them. <br /> /> What does the Universal Soldier: Does Return have to do with this story? Look at the 3.2 rating and find out for yourself. Horrible movie ... IMDb forced me to give a 1 in 10 because their rating systems do not go as low as 0 on negatives.
