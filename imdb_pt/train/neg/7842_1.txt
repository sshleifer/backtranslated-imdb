Crashed this by accident on a tv show - and could hardly believe how utterly terrible the whole experience was. In comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" was fascinating because it maintained the interest of all. But this piece of foolishness - words fail me. It was bad enough to have a kind of "story" presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread, but that mistake was aggravated by the obvious lack of captions everywhere whenever the so-called "Sioux" spoke. For the love of God, could not the filmmakers have found enough American Indians who were also actors and almost actors to present themselves as "Indians" in this tragedy instead of the impostors they actually used? I also found it very embarrassing to see Richard Harris wandering around the country at the obvious request of the director behind the camera, telling him to run and jump from useless point A to useless point B just to shoot and minutes. Absolutely terrible in every way!
