Could someone please prevent John Carpenter from continually and deliberately ruining his reputation? How low can you go? It seems that this man has lost his self-respect. <br /> <br /> This episode seems to have been made by a film student, it's not even worth starting to talk about what was bad because it was just a borefest, run by someone without talent as a filmmaker or without any motivation ... Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please retire immediately with a little self-esteem and stop spilling trash like this in a bad tradition of Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Get drunk.
