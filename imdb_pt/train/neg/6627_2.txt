What is happening with RGV? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Did he run out of creative ideas? If he has time to sit in the back seat. I went to see the film with great anticipation - of course I never once imagined that it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it was not, the promos said it all. But even so, I thought that would be a great treatment for the RGV, after all he is not the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after watching Aag. I will not talk about the plot or the story, since most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this, you can play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes of the original one and give ratings of your own! Then Veeru becomes Heero (how cheesy is that?), I think Heeru would not sound so good. Ajay Devgan is a big disaster like Heero, the comedy is tense and the dragging talk that really was effective in the Company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist. In fact, the most charming Nisha tries to be the most annoying she becomes. This peaks at the end. Raj actually is not bad compared to the others, he's a guy to watch in the future. I was very disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene in which he is drinking something from a bowl covered by a shawl, instead of inspiring fear, he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I do not have the patience to write more.
