I chose this movie to replace the sad choice of daytime television and to go with my femme fatale headquarters. Well, for the previous one, it's better than daytime television ... although I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> He has his points, but after the first 20-30 minutes, the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a feat for the TV movie that was put together with little time to do something that will hold together. In short, a terrible kind of Sci Fi channel movie. <br /> <br /> It has its points, as the future is dirty, as "Blade Runner" showed ..... of course, this is not "Blade Runner". The Captain seems to kind of feel like the actor Robert Forster, the kind of person you might want to be around. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately he ends up feeling like a bad "Andromeda," where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the clever gunners of "Aliens," the mystic is the vampire who Willow sexually intensified, and the new captain could be like Jan-Michael Vincent running on "Danger Island" in "Banana Splits"; he only wore his uniform with the epaulettes; he has very little right to it. They all rushing with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks a lot like the 'Eureka Maru' as they are fighting against a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and are divided into several different tribes or different sects evolutionary qualities ... like the Nietzcheans in "Andromeda." <br /> <br /> It may have a redeeming feature with Michael Ironside, but after a while, the person has the feeling that he accepted the role. as a joke! He probably had fun doing it, but it did not really help the movie. <br /> <br /> It's ..... "okay." Okay, the way you can watch the DVD once without turning it off; if they watch commercials, they will probably switch channels. You can watch it once .......... but a few hours later, be wondering what made them watch everything. <br /> <br /> For me, this was the femme fatale. ............ when she was fighting.
