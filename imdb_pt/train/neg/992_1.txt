This movie was disgusting. Yours should be a warning that some sly and cunning writer is trying to make a name for himself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching junk. What is rubbish? The misuse of people's time, the misuse of energy, and the waste of any kind of educational system that taught her to read and write. Talia, you're a sickly loser. Your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem. <br /> <br /> The acting and the plot did not give me any other choice but to advance in the middle of the garbage. I ended up in a scene that was unnecessary. If you want to learn how to shock people watch a Larry Clark movie. I've lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie "no more support from me". How could actors or actresses sit on a stage while these gross representations of human behavior manifest themselves from the psychopath's mind? I'm sorry for all the actors who participated in the scene. I think the devil now knows who the author of the movie is; Congratulations, you have gained his attention.
