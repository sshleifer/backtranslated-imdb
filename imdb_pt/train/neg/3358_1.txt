The hunt. A remake, of course. The original was a chilling psychological thriller that has improved over time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no character development here, just caricatures (the slut, the celebrated brain, the comrade "I'm leaving here," the very sensitive library mouse). But seeing as they were betting on the special effects being the "star", I think the characters with whom you can empathize are a minor concern. Unfortunately, the effects are laughable. Cherub loving, elastic doors, annoying dead children who can not speak clearly ... and a stupidly extravagant ending that gives you a new enema of butterflies and rainbows. I'll take my Skittles orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I've liked you since "The Cowboys". Stop this.
