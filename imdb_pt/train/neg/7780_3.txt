I could barely stop myself from napping or just turning off that shit, but I decided to stay out of it by reasoning that something would happen. This is the work of a writer / producer / director / special fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement about ecological damage while making a monster movie. That's what he wanted, anyway. What happens is that there is a lot of acting, a little offensive or simply mundane and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the waters of the river (oh, and lucky, a woman just happens to be naked in it. .. even though there have already been DISAPPEARANCES!) <br /> <br /> This is just absurd, but I suppose it is not very harmful; is not very unpleasant at least and once or twice we have a semi-interesting look at the Brazilian "culture" (which is the father walking through the city with his herd or other pieces of "Hey, this is not America ! "). But whatever the director's hope of launching Mitchum or Carradine is wasted, at best on pedestrians and, at worst, in excruciating and banal dialogue. It does not help that when we finally get a good look at the monster and the "action" happens, it is also stupidly staged and with a contemptible appeal. I usually feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of trouble finishing a particular photo - in this case it took most of the mid-'70s - but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it's called ... nah. <Br /> <br /> If you happen to have dual feature of Elvira DVD (bad print with poor transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, skip this one. Unless, of course, you are a stubborn Elvira and can not help herself to hear your exuberant comments; Personally, I'd rather have Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots from the Mystery Science Theater in this roast turkey.
