This documentary is based on loaf of bread as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example Bart Sibrel states that they must have had several sources of illumination because the shadows seem to be crossing if this were it the case that there were not two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 passed through van Allan's radiation belts that they spent 30 minutes not the 90 minutes claimed in the documentary and they received a radiation dose more equivalent to that of an X-ray . <br /> <br /> Seriously do some research learn what really happened do not let that pile of crap a documentary shape your opinion on what actually happened
