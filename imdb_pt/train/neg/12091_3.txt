Well, artyfartyrati from Cannes may have liked this movie, but not me, I'm afraid. If you like the kind of movie where the photos take so long you wonder if the actor fell asleep or if the videographer went to lunch, maybe it's for you. A large part of this is so with short journeys in the realm of displeasure. I did not find it shocking or disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a bit unpleasant and unhelpful. The only reason I did not give this star is that the acting is laudable and the film is well filmed. The plot, however, has little to recommend. A large part of the film shows only a grumpy woman teaching or listening to the piano, which may attract some people. But if you think this is harmless enough, be prepared for some excerpts of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
