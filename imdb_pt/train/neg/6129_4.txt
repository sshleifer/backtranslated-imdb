Judging by this film and THE STRONG MAN, made the same year, I would not put Harry Langdon at the top of the list of the big silent movie comedians. There simply is not enough there. Maybe he was on the way to developing his style, but sabotaged himself by taking his first big hits too seriously. Anyway, all his tricks resemble the funniest men, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and Lloyd's prodigious ingenuity. He also weakens his own personality by dressing and walking like Chaplin's character. Its hallmarks are the childish innocence, the shyness of the approach and the tendency to react to the seemingly perplexing calamity, banging the eyes or touching the pursed lips with the tip of the index finger. The comedy in Langdon's films results from the fate of several obstacles in his path, which he tries to overcome in simple or naive ways or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing stones at a tornado that approaches to drive him away, supporting a building in collapse. a two-by-four or dodging boulders, raising one leg so they roll underneath it. In this story, about the son of a cobbler who joins a foot race across the country to publicize the shoes of a rival company, he manages to win by sheer luck. There is nothing here that has not been done much better by the Big Three.
