Without reiterating what was said above about this movie, I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this film ... the cast / location and work of the great director Michael Winterbottom etc ... He had a vague shadow of ' Do not look now 'over the plot from the beginning. A stay in different environments (Italy again) to lessen the discomfort of the loss ... or maybe that's how I saw it? So I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and take a look at what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country ... and I sat there and sat there ... and guess what? nothing really happens! and I do not want to say anything !! You do not even have the chance to get into the characters because they are so dimensional and empty ... You are led to believe, by the rhythm of the movie, that something would happen to turn the whole film into your head ... older daughters with the local wasp boys, had great room to take the film in another direction, the younger daughters visions of his dead mother ended up being a fruitless and meaningless exercise, the father's attempts to be seduced by one of his students I felt ridiculous given his age. It was as if the script had made one final memory, where they decided, at the last minute, to eradicate any courage in history and try to reduce it to a minimum, with no effect. When the credits started rolling (unexpectedly), you can not help but feel stolen from your time spent sitting watching this pile of crap.
