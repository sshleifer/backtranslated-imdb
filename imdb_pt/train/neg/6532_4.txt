The film begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars had not been lost, but was only floating in space near the planet. When it is recovered, one of the crew members is sick, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told through a flashback of the surviving member. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a bunch of very silly monsters with bug eyes. Oddly enough, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the dumbest I've ever seen in the movies. In addition, in a strange attempt at realism, the production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of Mars. And the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed - it was so bad !! Despite all the cheese, the film had a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel. For lovers of the genre, it is worth seeing. For others, you may find the whole thing a bit silly - see for yourself and decide. <br /> <br /> Although by today's standards, this is not a particularly good science fiction movie compared to the movies being made. at the time, it stacks up very well. <br /> <br /> PS - When you watch the movie, pay close attention to Dr. Tremayne. He looks like Dr. Quest's picture of the cartoon "Jonny Quest"! In addition, it sounds and acts a lot like it too.
