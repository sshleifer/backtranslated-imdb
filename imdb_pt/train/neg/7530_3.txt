I found this boring, monotonous and uninteresting movie with a hurried and superficial "optimistic" ending that did not sound true to the overall story. Following these characters on a weekend of horrible events, hostile attitudes and bad news are not my idea of ​​an interesting and interesting film, and I was very tired of their "one note" theme and could not wait for it to end. in fact, I almost stopped halfway there. The whole movie seemed meaningless and wandering, and the characters were mostly depressing and unpleasant, although the acting was good. A small movie with small ambitions and small appeal - sorry, but this has not happened to me, and I love good and little movies! This just did not jell off, although I kept watching waiting and relying on it. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put him on their "Top 10 of the Year" list. I would strongly recommend watching "The House of Sand" - now there is a movie good and small!
