Why did I waste my money on this on the last day of Sundance? I want a refund ... Can I have my $ 16 back? While watching this movie, I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing happened. The only way I knew about what it should be was reading the plot, which was not really like the movie. Why did the director zoom in with the camera practice and then zoomed out? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu her fingernails for fifteen minutes? Why did the actors try to speak when they sounded like they were reading? Or was that the point? I felt as if Phantom Love had no history, and to be honest I felt that my friends had a much greater entertainment value than this movie.
