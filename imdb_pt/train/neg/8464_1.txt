I'm very tolerant of really bad horror and science fiction films - I've seen them since ages 4 or 5, so I've seen some really bad stuff, but I deal with it. I even watched a lot of SciFi Channel movies, so I know I do not expect too much - a generally promising movie that has no end to talk about. Hope springs eternal, I think - or the triumph of hope over experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a dog from the beginning and I knew it, but like a moth to the flame, I kept thinking of something, anything interesting would happen. Do not do. All the actors give a decent performance - given the script, I do not know how they all kept their faces straight. It has something to do with parasitic creatures with collagen worm that are slowly taking over the human race, one body at a time. There is an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy, giving him the appearance of humans ... do not worry, he gets what's coming to him. The people themselves do not really know where they came from, they think they could have run on a meteor that landed on the ground, but ... somehow they know about the royalty among them - the slug princess has managed to procreate with a being human who knows she's the queen worm and loves her for herself ... oh, shall I go on? Please, I beg you, do not waste 2 hours of your life seeing this ... anything would be better ... think the worst way, less pleasant, you can spend two hours ... would be better than that.
