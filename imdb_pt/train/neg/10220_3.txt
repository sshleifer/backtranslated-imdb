First of all, this movie can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with the ambush of some cavalry by the Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long and boring intermediate section, with the miscellany Candice Bergen and "Soldier Blue" traveling together to achieve the safety of an Army garrison. Ms. Bergen vomits inadequate four-letter words every time he opens his mouth and looks like he just came out of a Jack Nicholson movie of the '70s. I mean, it keeps zero interest with zero credibility. The third and last section involves the totally free slaughter of an indigenous village. This is so obviously exaggerated to rely on anti-war propaganda, that it seems simply long, scandalous and artificial. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why do not you watch the movie you're commenting instead of chirping your liberal absurdity? This is not a political site, it's to review movies. - MERK
