Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his bossy fiance, Kate (Eva Longoria), are reviewing the last-minute preparations for their reception. It's the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy, giving the buffet a scolding about their demands for food. But, horror of the horrors, the ice sculpture "angel", commissioned by Kate, arrives without wings. In a fight that followed with the sculptor, the heavy damsel "ice" falls on Kate and sends her to the beyond. Now, a year later, Henry's sister arranges for a medium to tell the young vet that Kate would like him to start dating other women and move on. However, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell), is interested in Henry himself, much to the chagrin of his catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create confusion for Ashley since she has no intention of letting another woman lay hands on Henry. Can anything be done to return Kate to heaven forever? This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst that this dedicated fan has ever seen. No, it's not the cast, as they try to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the arrogant fianc√© and Bell has an eccentric style and humor that is equally contagious. Biggs, a funny actor too, is totally lost. As for Rudd, a very talented artist (see Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless, please), he tries the hardest of all and, in fact, is the main reason to see this clunker. Its easy charm, appearance and intelligence contribute to making the film bearable. But, nothing can turn a meaningless script and terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a fan dyed romantic comedy, think hard before spending any money for that. Even free tickets to fall on your lap, remember that this movie is a near death experience for those who love love movies and laughter.
