I do not agree with much of what has been written and said about this supposed "masterpiece" of the New German Wave: 1) There are great shortcomings in the simple exposition, in the basic communication of the critical points of the plot, as relative to the abortion of Mary and the contract secret between Oswald and her husband. How many spectators understood that her husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial compensation, not to return and claim his wife until Oswald was dead? <br /> <br /> 2) The ending is highly unsatisfactory because arbitrary and accidental. The original script asked Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's will to find that her husband had, in fact, sold her marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only gives water from a tap on her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Mary is then summarily exploded, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral commitment. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder seeks to force the public on the private, the political on the staff. Contrary to what critics and "experts" claim, I do not think it works. Simply disrupting the historical news of the radio or the sound of the German rebuilding crushers on the soundtrack to the dramatic events of the film does not make these historical events an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of Mary's rise from poverty to prosperity must match the so-called postwar economic miracle of Germany. Mary is therefore destined to be a specific and reflective woman of her time and place, but in truth it is unoriginal and not specific. Women have affirmed their independence by using sex for self-advancement for a long time. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several examples of unforgivable neglect and amateurism - Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention had their effect. Unknown people speak off-screen without ever being seen; the music is awkwardly intrusive in some places; and the melodramatic posture sporadically replaces the performance. Strangely, for a film condemning a country for a deliberate collective amnesia of the holocaust, he himself never mentions it once.
