I often comment on the sheer quantity of really scary movies on the market, and unfortunately White Noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry is still capable of such an undertaking. I was surprised to see myself growing weary as the plot continued and my static-induced headache increased. I found the White Noise absurd beyond our best efforts to suspend disbelief. Even after witnessing the terrible ordeal suffered by Michael Keaton, I was not affected by his death. Even the credits I waited diligently for something - anything - of substance to connect me to the story of the characters, but such relief never came. Of course, there have been occasional bouts of heart grudges, but only because loud noises tend to do this for the dozing viewer. <br /> <br /> Although the acting was lame, Michael Keaton may have played his most studious role to this day. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning architecture in both Keaton residences. Overall, White Noise leaves one with the depressing morbid idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows, trying to trick the living into following the dead in their own graves.
