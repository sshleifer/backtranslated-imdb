If 1977's "Exorcist II: The Herege" did him no favor, it's hard to imagine what the extraordinary Richard Burton saw in this monotonous exercise of non-emotion. You've seen all this before: Burton plays a writer who discovered at a young age that he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through the power of his mind (and you thought "Carrie" had no impact on Hollywood!). Although adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" plays like recycled products, although the special effects at the end of the cathedral are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is a bit present as a doctor, but the support cast is extremely weak. Burton is hammy but tired ... not even telekinesis could save him this time. * 1/2 of ****
