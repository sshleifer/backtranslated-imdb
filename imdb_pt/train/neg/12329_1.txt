Back in my days as a porter "Private Lessons" played in the 4-plex I was working. It was a hit that sold out on Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I never got to see him, but I saw he was at the cable this past weekend, so I decided to take a chance. What I witnessed during the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch. <br /> <br /> The basic story is that a teenager wants his sexy maid (Sylvia Kristel). She also seems to have an attraction for the boy, but for more sinister reasons. So we have scenes of the boy watching her undress and she's inviting him to watch. And it goes from there. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, like the teenager, has to be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Her "frightened" reactions every time Sylvia takes a piece of clothing or when she touches it is horrible. I did not laugh once during that piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And let's not start the subplot of the maid and the driver planning to extort money from the boy. Let's just say it involves faking a death, burying a body ... I could go on and on, but it gets more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes are the worst I've ever seen. Even though Eric Brown was older than him, the fact is that he looks like a baby. It seems like he has no idea how to kiss a woman (if THAT were acting, then maybe I should rethink my criticisms of Brown) and that just came close to breaking the frontier with child pornography to be erotic. I've never been so turned off by a sex scene, even though Ms. Kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER WARNING ** I should mention the last scene. For me it's simply sick, but I remember the audience cheering as the movie froze framed and dissolving into credits. Our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the teachers. He invites her to dinner and she looks at him as if Tom Cruise had just invited her out. She nods and he walks away, smiling at the camera in triumph. GIVE ME SOME TIME! Yes, I'm sure all teachers would risk everything for a simple-looking teenager. <br /> <br /> I will never understand the appeal that this movie had in 1982. It certainly was more than nudity, because there were plenty of nude adolescent sex comedies that bombarded the box office. And to think that those same teenagers who have applauded this movie 22 years ago are now climbing corporate ladders and possibly helping to run that country. That's a scary thought.
