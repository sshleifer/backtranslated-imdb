Well, this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more "adult oriented" humor based on the first few moments, but then the movie changed to a badly done-for-Disney Channel type-type, especially a go-cart racing scene that was unbelievably long. Alana De La Garza is gorgeous, but has a really fake Italian accent. The movie looked and looked very independent and low budget. There was a very cute moment that I will call the serenade scene, but overall it was a yawn. The laughter is very few and far between. The final surprise of "Mr. Fix It" is so ridiculous that it made me crazier than anything else. It may be worth taking a look if you can get it for free or on TV, but do not waste your money buying or renting this movie.
