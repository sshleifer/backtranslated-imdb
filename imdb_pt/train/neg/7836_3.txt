The first episode set the bar pretty high, I thought. It starred William Hurt as a killer hired to kill a toy maker. We get very little information about your character or who is paying to kill, in fact the episode is notable for not having any dialogue. Returning to his modernist cover, he receives a package containing toy soldiers, which gives him a smile, but he rejects and takes care of his business. But he is on a night of hell, the soldiers are alive and are about to make the war, driving jeeps, machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters! The special effects are good for a TV show and become quite tense when he dodges around the apartment using his intelligence to survive, sometimes gaining the advantage and sometimes not. I'm not going to ruin the ending, but suffice it to say it was a smart turnaround. This gave me hope for the rest of the show, but I was in for a disappointment, the other episodes were all rubbish and I lost interest in the room. Stephen King's adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception.
