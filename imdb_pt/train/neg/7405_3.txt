I think they really let the quality of DVD production escape from them. I rented this DVD from two movie stores and the second time I finally got to play it on the third DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else have this problem? It's really hard to give the movie an unbiased review after going through such a bother to play it. For one thing, I've never seen a Finnish horror film before, so I was kind of upset that the movie was made in English. Plus, since she never made it clear what was wrong with Sarah, she ended up being retarded, so I really expected someone to throw her in the face and make all the horrible events go away.
