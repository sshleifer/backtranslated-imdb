a novel without feeling, a drama of issues without point (or drama) .... This movie is supposed to be all this and fails on each account as if it were not trying. Or as if the director / writer / writer was not really trying. Actors are capable - they need better support. <br /> <br /> An element that does not fail is the score of George Delarue. Beautiful and moving. What a shame it is attached to this movie. In a good movie, the words and movements of the actors and the music synchronize and increase the impact. This publisher turned to music without regard for dialogue and movement. The love scene is particularly irritating in this respect: an insult to the talents of the leading actors. <br /> <br /> There is another element in the movie that works: location photography. Remarkably a moment in Grand Central Station. I had guessed in advance what was going to happen; but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking. Some commentators in this picture have indicated that the assimilation of Nazi criminal scientists by the United States actually took place during those years of the MacCarthy scare. By the time the movie seems to begin to look seriously at American society, it turns into conventional romance; before any human feeling can move us, is a (predictable) escapade of 'thriller'. Just as the film insults the talents of the actors, it insults the issues it pretends to (and fails) to catch. <br /> <br /> You're warned.
