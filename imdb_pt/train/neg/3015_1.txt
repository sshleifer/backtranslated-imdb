This is a bad movie. Not one of the bad ones too. This is a bad bad. It was really painful to watch. The direction was horrible, with lots of jumps around and the green and yellow tones used throughout the film make the characters look sick. Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough girl, and I can not believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke have signed a contract for this celluloid waste. The script was terrible and the acting was like nails on the chalkboard. If you have not seen it yet, do not. You are not missing out on anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel. I've seen bad movies before and even liked them because of their flaws. This is just a waste of time.
