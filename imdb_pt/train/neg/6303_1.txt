I had high hopes for this movie. I found the premise interesting. I passed him, despite having found the acting, except Helena Bonham Carter, which is not worthy of note. I kept waiting for my time to pay, but in the end I kept wondering why they bothered to do it. Perhaps in George Orwell's version there is a message worth conveying. If this movie did anything, it inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I find it hard to believe that your story can be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the filmmaker's message is "worldly life is worth living," well, they did. I would recommend this movie to anyone; 101 minutes of my life wasted.
