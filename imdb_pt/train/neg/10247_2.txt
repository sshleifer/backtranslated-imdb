This is one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen, it's horrible. Christopher Lee is good, but he is hardly in it, the only good part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title. "End of the World" is really a bad movie, I stopped watching it near the end was so bad, only for fans of B movies who have the brains to withstand this vomit.
