Many things are clear when we watch this movie: 1) the acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are more or less like this, but the father-son conflict borders on the novel. The other two boys: an overly childlike prodigy and his stereotypical blond-but-I-am-really-sensitive-dream-boat inside; 2) The film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (represented by Tom Hanks); 4) The inclusion of the initial love ballads is a strange choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) Strange lines and side plots are not improved by terrible acting; and 5) this is a very bad movie. Expect to be disappointed - and probably disturbed.
