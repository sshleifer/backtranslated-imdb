Little insignificant and low-brain horror (haha!) Of the 80's, as there are thirteen in a dozen, it can still be considered fun if you watch it in the right mood. Special effects are gross, the atrocity and script seem to miss a few essential paragraphs! "The Brain" takes place in a typical Quiet-American city where every teenager works in the same restaurant and where the cool boy from the school releases bombs in the bathroom. It is here that a TV guru named Dr. Blake and his adorable pet brain begin their quest for mind control of the entire nation. Under the label of "independent thinkers," a gigantic cheese brain sends waves through television sets and forces the innocent public to kill! How cool is that? Now, it's up to the teenage rebel Meadowvale to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain really come from. There are obvious references to extraterrestrial life, but that's about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There is not much bloodshed, unfortunately, and the "evil" brain looks like a half-hearted puppet. The only element that is more or less interesting for horror fans is to take a look at the cast and crew that made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who did "Bloody Birthday" and "Plague." Both are much better movies and they wisely decided to give up the film industry. The most familiar face in the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale, whom horror fans will love forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity factor and she is obviously a great talent? She has exactly 3 films in her repertoire of which this is her "masterpiece." In her debut, she was credited as a "fugitive model" and in "3 men and a baby", her character is referred to as "one of Jack's girls". I really wonder how she feels about her acting career?
