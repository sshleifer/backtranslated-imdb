Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me! This film, while a great attempt to 'imitate' Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls far short of honoring them, or even of being a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. The dialogue is ripped from old L + H films and planted unrealistically, the plot is confusing with the useless characterization of the other unnecessary co-stars, Pinchot's accent was bizarre to Stan, and while Sartain did a great job with the Ollie's accent, he also tried hard to create the wonderful blend that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) musical number? Editing is unstable, acting is harsh, lines are horrible, physics is incomprehensible (although perhaps they were TRYING to give that sense of cheap scenarios?), And overall it's a terrible thing to witness. It's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made their last film when they wrote and photographed the 1950s. Do yourself a favor and see as much of the ORIGINAL films as Laurel and Hardy , and learn how things were. You know what a MAGNATE is, do not you? Stan Laurel did not respond perpetually with half-idiot jokes in every sentence. <br /> <br /> I pity anyone who thinks THIS was a decent upgrade / honor of the boys. Where was the classic theme of music?!? Why ruin 'Here's another mess well?' Why skip "wiser"? Why was there a bland flock of co-stars? WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ ???? Why should Larmon HARMON be in it? WHY BOZO!? And the LEARNING CHANNEL helped finance the thing? <br /> <br /> I mean, really. Fart jokes, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
