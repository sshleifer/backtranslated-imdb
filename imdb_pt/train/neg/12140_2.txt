Imitating his long title, the film finds ways to get close to the 90's. The beautiful scenery is here with everything that made the production of Hamer a trademark, but Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent negligence. The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there is nothing unexpected and nothing more than 5% of your expected attention. <br /> <br /> The direction is heavy as a direct transfer from On stage, the actors are harder than the wax figures (okay, this is a Hamer feature, but sometimes it is better presented around the package). My conclusion: this movie is rubbish, not worth the time I spend that night. Eternal life is a boring affair, and I should have expected those responsible for Cinematheque programming to know.
