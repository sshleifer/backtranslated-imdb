I do not know why I keep doing this to myself !! I continue to defend Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that he should have more credits and chances ... and then they give you a slap in the head with this rubbish! Intensive therapy is a terrible production and probably the worst thing ever done in Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstream American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. Producers and writers have turned a lot for this, but they have been very low. Intensive therapy became an embarrassing product for everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult film here. It is almost impossible to find an original copy and is only shown on special occasions such as "The Night of Disorientation". For exactly 5 minutes, the Intensive Care Center tries to tell a story and even create a plot ... then it turns into a scene film with repulsive makeup effects - albeit hilarious and cheap. The performance of the whole cast is abominable, although there are some respected names involved. The main male role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy may well be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, TV presenter and idol for many girls. He never mentions this thing he starred in, though. Like everyone in the Netherlands, he is trying to convince himself that intensive therapy never happened.
