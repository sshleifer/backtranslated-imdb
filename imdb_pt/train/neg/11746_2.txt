Well, this movie certainly had a fair amount of hype; From the rumor of the Toronto Film Festival to the reviews on CBC Radio. An indie movie refreshing, crazy and hilarious, apparently. I was looking forward to it for months. <br /> <br /> How can I explain this simply? He sucked in a big way. An exercise in film lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a comic book genius. At best, it was mildly amusing and, at worst, coma-inducing. An illiterate script directed and shoddily edited in a ruined mess. <br /> <br /> And what was with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the soundtrack? That was the only truly weird thing about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a genuinely funny and bizarre movie involving aliens, try Repoman. There is no comparison!
