The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, although it is a euphemism. This movie not only cries - it screams loud enough to break the glass. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made strident, bland thrillers looking for a semi-documentary feel. Here, they filmed in real New York locations with little "real life" acoustics to increase verisimilitude. But the naturalism of the recording serves only to amplify the disordered dialogue of the Stones and the histrionics of the tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> In a performance completely devoid of modulation, Stevens plays the wife of electronics. whiz James Mason (looking bored and bored); both are held captive by extortionate Rod Steiger (looking bloated and bored) and by his lugubrious comrades in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason unconsciously helped build. <br /> <br /> Here's another example of a crime genius's credibility, so brilliantly attentive to every detail, but still unwilling to hire a degenerate drug addict as a subaltern. The Stones' idea of ​​tension is to arrest the hysterical Stevens alone with rapist rapist Benzedrine Neville Brand, filling the frame with his beijor sweaty and drooling. But the camera work is so heavy and Brand so (strangely) demure that the effect is hardly shocking, much less suspense. The Stones, a square pair of hearts, do not even have the courage of their own lack of convictions. <br /> <br /> The movie, which ends with the burly Steiger chasing Stevens on a subway train. track, is as clumsy as its awkwardly heavy. With Angie Dickinson as amoral girlfriend of Steiger, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
