This is probably the first entry in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; in O'Leary's subsequent films, he was played by actors much younger than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all played by actors of well-known characters) meets in an old house (on a rainy night). of course!) to talk to a rich relative, who falls into a coma. <br /> <br /> While they wait for him to recover, all sorts of mysterious events happen, including some murders. A scary movie; Worth seeing!
