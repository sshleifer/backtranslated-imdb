Carly Pope plays JJ, a newly promoted Food Critic whose fancy and arrogant mother moves in with her. JJ, horrified by this change in circumstances, blackmails Alex, the restaurant owner, to entertain his mother in exchange for "perhaps" revisiting his dying restaurant. Alex predictably falls in love with his daughter as she warms to her mother. There are numerous problems with this movie, the characters are universally two-dimensional. JJ is a self-serving, hateful character, his shallow and superficial mother. JJ's colleagues in the magazine are malicious and opportunistic. The underlying message of a woman over 50 unable to get by herself, without male help, is bad, bad, bad. The performance is uniformly monotonous, the script uninspired. The movies just saving grace is the setting of New York City. I would not recommend this movie.
