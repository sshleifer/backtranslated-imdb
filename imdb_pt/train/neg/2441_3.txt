I thought "Intensive Care" was very bad and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it could be. Sometimes it's a little suspense, but never a good shock. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> The fun is in ridiculous moments. But the classic moment of all time is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. He moans at the corner of the hall. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels next to him and asks, "Poor Peter, will I give you a band aid?" <br /> <br /> This film was filmed in Dutch and English. To save costs, all boards are from the US, and the news studio background is a Manhattan skyline. Very funny if you are Dutch and watch the original Dutch version.
