I suppose any novel that is as depressing as Moby Dick would not be very supportive to the Depression-era hearers who had enough trouble. But any resemblance to Herman Melville's classic novel is pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact half the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it, not that much of what was kept for the movie. We meet Ahab Creely (he has a surname and a brother) as a happy soul with two legs and intending to marry Joan Bennett, who is the daughter of Father Mapple. This brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in a superior performance. Barrymore had not quite mastered sound cinema and he got rid of all the histrionics of the silent era, plus a theatrical voice that would shake the beams of any movie the movie was going through. <br /> <br /> We see Ahab lose. his leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I have to say that the amputation scene was pretty awful. Of course that was all before the Code. I'm still sure the 1930 audience shuddered. <br /> <br /> After that, the story of the hunt for Ahab by the whale he thinks made him bland in Joan Bennett's eyes. This is not exactly Melville's motivation; in fact, there are no female characters in Moby Dick when he wrote it. <br /> <br /> One of the things that Melville did was invest the crew of Ahab's ship, the Pequod, with personalities. In addition to Queequeg, the cannibal harpooner, the names are there, but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs could very well be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I would see this version of Moby Dick strictly out of curiosity and nothing more.
