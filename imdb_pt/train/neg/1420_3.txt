[I saw this movie once delayed on a public TV station, so I do not know if it's in the video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) that Shirley Temple did in the early 1930s. It's hard to believe anyone would let their daughter be in this little movie that today can be considered just like that side of "child pornography." <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple has a cast that probably has an average age of 5. They are all in diapers and are in a salon that serves milk instead of alcohol. The "money" is in the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> Shirley throwing a "femme fatale" goes to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about her (!). But Shirley does not really need lollipops / money because her purse is full of other "men." <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a little black boy does a suggestive dance at a nearby table (!). What a strange movie. . . babies using vigorous dialogues playing adult roles in a salon. Who invented these things in any way?
