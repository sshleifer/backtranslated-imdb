I have not seen anything so bad since I left the James Bond movie "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to get all of it out because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing she could do to save this beast. As a cross between "Pi," "Orlando," and "Tron," this movie failed miserably in every aspect of cinema. The characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy. The plot was totally unbelievable. The performance was, with the exception of Swinton, amateur. Computer graphics was worse than "Tron." Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what's the point. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why an actress of her caliber agreed to appear in such a failure, but she probably regrets now. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money or your time on this stinky one. There is nothing worth seeing here.
