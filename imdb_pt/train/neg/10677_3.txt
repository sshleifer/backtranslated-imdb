I rented End Game, never having heard about it, but I like political thrillers, so I thought I'd try. After doing some research on the film, I discovered that it had initially been planned to be released in theaters, but instead had gone straight to the DVD. After seeing this, I'm thinking, "No wonder." The film is shocking in its lack of originality. The plot and the characters are superficial. I discovered whodunnit half way, but the end was a curved ball. I have to say, I did not expect it to end the way it happened, but that's not a point in your favor. The more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad. Maybe the filmmakers saw how predictable the film was and decided to take a turn - even one that made the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want the $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back.
