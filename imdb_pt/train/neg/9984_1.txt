It was a Sunday night and I was waiting for the movie to be announced on TV. They said it was a comedy! The movie started, 10 minutes passed, after that 30 minutes and I did not laugh even once. The fact is that the movie ended and I did not even have the courage to laugh. PLEASE, someone likes me, I missed 90 minutes for nothing.
