The championship game is only a few days away, but things in New Orleans are not as they should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a murderer on the loose, life is upsetting what should be a memorable and wonderful moment. Can things be put back in order and a killer stopped before the big game was ruined? <br /> <br /> Despite what you may think when you read about the Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a plot device and a later thought. Instead, the Superdome is another one of those dreadful TV movies, accustomed to Hollywood, and those who never will be. The cast dreams about the thing without anyone looking really good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role, seeming generally lost because he is there. The plot is monotonous, uninteresting and unbelievable. Donna Mills as a hit "man"? Okay, right! It is as believable as the case she has with David Jansen's stewed liquor. The movie also has no rhythm. Trying to put all four or five story lines in the movie hits the stream that the Superdome may have had. With no drama or suspense in sight, the Superdome turns out to be a lousy example of a TV movie made in the 1970s. The only highlight for me was the voice-over work of the late Charlie Jones - a sportscaster I miss hearing . The eloquent way he exaggerates the intrigue and exaggerates the atmosphere of New Orleans is the pure cheese at its best. Like most others who saw the Superdome, I also did it courtesy of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of the KTMA's public-access episodes, but it's one of the best examples of the first shows . So even though I rated Superdome only 2/10, I'll give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
