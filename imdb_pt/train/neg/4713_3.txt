As you can guess by my rating and my title from this review I do not like Johnny Test. Now I think I know what people are going to say, "How do you know how bad it is? Have you watched it?" I watched this show a few times because I'm studying film and animation and it does not happen. t keep a candle to my standards. <br /> <br /> I want to talk first about animation because it's one of the most confusing things I've ever seen. As the first two seasons or just the first season had hand drawn animation. I thought it was a good show to see when it was drawn by hand but then it changed to flash animation and the quality slowed down a lot. <br /> <br /> So this is a strike in my eyes, but let's see the history of the show. It's hard enough to be like Dexter's lab, but there are differences because instead of a redheaded scientist, there are two and both are female. There is a talking dog (why?) And the attitudes of the parents change a little. I have others, but I do not think I can write them here (I do not mean swearing, but I mean, I do not know if there's a limit to words). Everything else is in place, even a DeeDee character, Johnny. He only tries so hard to be Dexter, but he seems to me to be a heartless imitation. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to talk about the jokes. Remember in the Dexters lab some of the jokes involved screaming? Yes, yelling might be good for a joke or two, but Dexter's lab also made crafty remarks that made me have to go back and check the joke. Johnny Test just forgets all of this and just screams 50% of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or a liner pops up. This is no comedy, this is stupid comedy (I know what some people are thinking.There are three stupid comedy stupid? Watch this and Johnny Test on your back and you laugh more at the first option). Sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations that, like Chowder, drive me crazy. I have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together: To very bizarre is not equal to comedy, this makes you just think "what am I watching?". <br /> <br /> So it happens on all accounts. Do not watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in any way, shape or form.
