In fact, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3D animated film. I bought it on DVD 3 years ago. Did not Bug's life do that, either? I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree, so I'm telling you before you go and use it like that. In addition, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a "theater" and you could buy it for DVD. The movie was cute, at least the little flies were. I liked IQ. I agree with Animaster, they have done God's work of making a movie of something that is just an adventure back-story. I recommend it for families and children.
