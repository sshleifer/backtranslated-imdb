DEATHSTALKER is perfect for fans of fantasy films B; This almost 80-minute caricature of filmmaking causes everyone to wonder - nonexistent plot, horrible acting (except at least one hoarse voice old lady), laughing scriptwriting and schlock editing, and bargain basement style definitions. There are no characters that look nice or interesting (in particular, the protagonist has NOTHING appealing about him), and the assembled actors barely do anything to rise above the F-note stuff. If that is not enough, what about the lack of a convincing plot (that this movie has none of it) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a great turkey? I was also offended by the fact that the women in this movie only serve any other purpose that: 1) is topless and / or half naked; 2) be raped; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) All of the above. Also, the background music is awful; a bizarre mess of electronic noise, cheesy chorus blasts and strident orchestral cacophony. Drowsy and numbing ear in the eye, all in one pack with only one thing to keep one interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for people looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there's a lot of it here). Otherwise I would not recommend this 100 year old CONAN to anyone, at the very least.
