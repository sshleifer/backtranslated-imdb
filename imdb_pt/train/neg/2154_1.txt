Let me confess. I found this used video and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside there was another story. In addition to the fact that the film was basically a parody of special effects of the genre "invisible man" (highly visible strings and other paraphernalia), the script did not miss a chance - in fact, it went out of its way - insulting all the not. WASP races and real or imagined homosexuals. Every insult intended for a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both. It begins to irritate your nerves, along with unstable sound, candid style photography and melodramatic story. However, the ending is a bit of a surprise. But when you get there, you hardly care less. Too bad, it could have been a reasonably good movie.
