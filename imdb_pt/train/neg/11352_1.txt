this is what you would get if you allowed a 10-year-old American (American maniac) to write a story of a lunar trip. Absolute rubbish with no redeeming qualities Perhaps it had some fascination in the 3D department. but as a narrative and entertaining animation, nothing kept to waste an hour and a half of value. Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead <br /> <br /> Damn. There are not enough lines, but I feel it sums up ... well, I agree with a review above - this is like a cold war propaganda story. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they had discovered that the flies discovered the moon landing hoax, or if the flies died in the first minute. BTW - Why did all the main characters fly deformed? - nobody had the complete compliment of the members!
