Apparently, the people who wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called movie. They described "blindly choreographed intrigue and violence." I did not see "intrigue". I saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a kung fu movie. I did not see "violence". At least I did not see anything that could lead me to suspend my disbelief over what might hurt a man with "waterproof" skin - but here I am, perhaps, revealing much of the "plot." Also, as a viewer of many movies (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unattainable. Whatever you choose to do, I will always remain. <br /> <br /> Correct, <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> Q. I was not blinded by the choreography.
