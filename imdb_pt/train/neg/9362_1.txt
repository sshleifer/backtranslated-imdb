The plot seemed to have promised. To be honest, I did not watch the whole movie. After about an hour in the movie I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth watching until the conclusion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. Nor the premise that he was being pursued by secret government officials for a human / wolf transplant. It was because the film was poorly written, the acting lacked emotion and I did not understand the various sequences of dreams with the wolves and buffaloes. When he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and dropping them in front of the zoo gate, the saying "If you can not run with the big dogs do not leave the porch" kept running through my bored mind. Save time and skip this movie. I can assure you that if you dare to watch it, you will sit with your jaw dropped as I wonder why anyone is wasting money, time, energy, and effort to make this outrageous insult to American cinema.
