Today, Bea Arthur died, so I was browsing the IMDb site and somehow ended up in a show called "Gloria". "All In The Family" was a brilliant show in its first four or five years and I bet I watched every episode more than once. However, I swear I did not know that a program called "Glory" existed. Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe, that means I had a life as a young adult instead of watching television. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that the All In The Family franchise has deteriorated so much that it has spawned a show that I have never heard of - and one that is rated very poorly by previous reviewers. <br /> <br /> I rated the show at 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me to register a vote, and TV writers and executives should be convicted for starting a program that had nothing to do on the air and would overshadow the memory of one of the biggest shows in TV history.
