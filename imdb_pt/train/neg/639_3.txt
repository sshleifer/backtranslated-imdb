The clich√© of the soldier in a state of shock of the war receives a blunt treatment. Too bad that a splendid cast, acting to the limits of his high talents, can not rescue "The Return of the Soldier" from his inability to put the viewer into emotional entanglement. Best moments, as another reviewer remarked, come when Glenda Jackson is onscreen; but even the cinematic power of Jackson can not pull the chestnuts out of his cold, never warmed the fireplace. Ann-Margret, her sexual reputation and often accused of lacking acting ability, finds her real, deep-seated skills wasted here - though she speaks in an almost flawless Middlesex accent. The banal score, which evokes the saccharine emotionalism drenched in many lackluster television miniseries, is in irrational contradiction with the emotional detachment of script, blockage, and overlapping formality of direction; Except for his score and script and corseted direction, 'The Soldier's Return' has all the right bits but can not get them working together.
