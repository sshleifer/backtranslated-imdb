I'm sorry to report that I've seen this movie several times. When it was bombarded at the box office, it was repeated nightly for about a month on HBO. And I've watched it several times because television in general is so bad - or it was back then. I no longer watch, so it may be wonderful now - as Samuel L Jackson says about pigs, "It may taste like sweet potato pie, but I'll never know why I would not eat the dirtiest." We will see. Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out right after Life of Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration came from for that. The few lightly funny parts last a long time until you close your eyes and close your teeth. There is a scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both drawn and desiccated, dying of thirst. So they meet like old acquaintances who do not know each other very well, promise to have lunch. It could have been funny. <br /> <br /> But the scene that I remember most clearly is a meeting with the pharaoh in which the pharaoh is a black street kid made in the full suit of King Tut. He must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release, they overdubbed their scene with the Hollywood equivalent of the black street language voiced by an aspiring Jimmy Walker (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or it may have been Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They have managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist, very bland, very long excrement, one of those legendary things that simply will not flush, no matter how many times you try, then you leave it to someone else to deal with it. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my criticism. If you rent this movie (DO NOT BUY, WHAT TO DO!) Get ready with a bottle of tequila and a six pack Corona. <br /> <br /> Now that they have redoed the Poseiden adventure, one of them is probably at the top of the remake list. Maybe they'll hire a comedy writer this time.
