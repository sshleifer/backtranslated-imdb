This 1973 remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, the good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a great Barton Keyes. He's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but he's the only reason to watch it. The only improvement of this remake in relation to the original is that it reduces the role of Lola Dietrichson, the step-daughter of the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's it for the good things. <br /> <br /> The bad things are many. The director records everything in an indifferent way: if you watched the film with the sound mute, it would hardly look like something especially interesting was happening. Because of the modern bad taste, the film should be colored instead of black and white. Because of the bad taste of the 70's, all the scenarios are distractedly ugly. Walter Neff's expensive apartment in particular is ghastly. <br /> <br /> The modern setting hurts in many small ways. Train travel was a bit more unusual in the 1970s than it was in the 1940s, so Dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more like a gimmick. The men stopped wearing hats, which prevented Walter from covering his brown hair while posing as Dietrichson, with white hair. The women in mourning have stopped wearing veils, which robs Samantha Eggar of the support that Barbara Stanwyck did splendidly in a key scene. (Strangely, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was experiencing a black hat and a veil before she needed them.) Stephen Bochco retains much of the writing of Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler . the same. But he makes many tiny and inexplicable changes in the dialogue that leave the script a bit flabby where once he was lean and muscular. Shockingly, the famous motorcycle cop game is gone, but look closely and you'll see what looks like a post-production cut where those lines should have been. Bochco may not be to blame. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What could have made this version tolerable is indeed a splendid Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead, we received Samantha Eggar, who appears as a villain of "Barnaby Jones." But who can blame Eggar? With a director who hardly seems interested in what's happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have done well?
