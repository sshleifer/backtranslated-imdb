This film was clearly poorly done and in a hurry. I realize that funding for any such film is hard to come by. However, if the plot had some kind of original substance, someone would have seen that they got the necessary funding, this was not the case and movies like this are not needed and have no purpose in existing. The plot for this movie was made and done better than I could add, many times before. There is no reason to make a movie that has no chance of competing with others. I have been informed by my computer that I need a minimum of ten lines to send my comment so that the following lines are just a bull to fill the space. In my opinion, there is no need for anything else about this movie. What I've said is a lot and if you've wasted enough time reading this review, for God's sake do not waste any more time watching this movie. The only exception to this is if you're the kind of person who likes to watch low-quality movies that are played on the women's entertainment network at 2:00 in the morning, so go ahead and see what I care.
