This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just bought because it looks horribly bad. And, in fact, we could not get most of it. There has been a lot of rapid advancement going on. <br /> <br /> But then we come across a scene in which Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (his name somehow slips my mind at this point). CRIPES I've never watched a single scene from a movie so many times (I'm estimating forty or so). And I've never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to show off his loins. I last saw the movie a few months ago, but I can not stop laughing as I type. Anyway, the scene is a snapshot of pictures - Englund ripping off the girl's lingerie, Englund riding a naked horse and a mysterious woman dropping the head of a snake. This is an absolute genius. You have to see for yourself.
