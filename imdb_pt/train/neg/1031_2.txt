This movie is a long chiche after another. First of all, although they have done their part, there is an unwarranted drug scene in which John smells marijuana like an idiot. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the Beatles' old cartoons. John is the nasty, envious, armed homosexual, Yoko slave, is portrayed as being in the discredited book of Albert Goldman. They continue to gush song titles into regular conversations "it's always just been Two Of Us!" John would not have been mean to his fans as well. As his death showed us that he was very good if anything. The only funny scene is when a stupid Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. John insulted says something along the lines of "Of course and while I create why you do not kneel, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin." It made me laugh for days. Really this movie is funny on how seriously it tries to be ridiculous. John and Paul also did not sit down pontificating all day, they were funny and happy that even during the Beatles ended up in a much more presentable place than those portrayed here. Forget.
