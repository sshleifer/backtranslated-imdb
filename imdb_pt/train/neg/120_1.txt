When I first saw a glimpse of this film, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrait of Lucy is absolutely horrible. Lucille Ball was an amazing comedian with incredible talent. Thinking of a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrible. I can not believe all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She may be a good actress in other roles, but playing Lucille Ball is difficult. It is very difficult to find someone who looks like Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in appearance and talent. If you've noticed Lucy's portrait of York in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or the vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar - her expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> To complete, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He is small and skinny, his accent is unreal and, once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not alike, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. <br /> <br /> Overall, the cast is extremely horrible and the story is poorly told. If people want to understand Lucille Ball's real-life situation, I suggest watching A & E's Biography of Lucy and Desi, read Lucille Ball's own book or American Masters: Finding Lucy from PBS. If you want to see a docudrama, "Before Laughter" would be a better choice. The cast of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to that. At least a similar aspect is shown instead of nothing.
