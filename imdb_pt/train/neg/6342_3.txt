I got this in the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you do not like this, go ahead!") In the box ... it seemed like a touch endorsement ... I was expecting something a bit more like "Proof of Death "... there is not much real violence in this film, or plot, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> See the poster. It's all there. Acrobatics and rock. Back and forth. A week or so in the life of a Los Angeles band performing a magic show, on a level you might see in one of the smaller strip casinos, and a new Australian stunt in town finding your feet ... They work, They know girls, they party. History end. <br /> <br /> The band obviously needed all these things because they are downright second-rate, and played a style that was already dated back in 1978. It must be said that the stuntmen in the film are genuinely revolving - the Aussie guy is really something, and the film seems motivated in large part by love and respect for "art." I hung there to see what crazy thing he would do next. I just wish he had found a better vehicle.
