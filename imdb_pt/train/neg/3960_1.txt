Hi, it may be because I'm not a theater major or a sophisticated movie observer ... I think this movie is "boring" and "dumb". <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because of Charles Bronson and it's title ... but kid, what a waste of time ... just to see two guys sitting in a safe and chatting ... <br /> < > <br /> The movie on this DVD was so "DARK" ... that I had it hard to watch the damn movie ... I know it's a 1968 film ... but they're putting it on a DVD, so they should do some digital remastering. <br /> <br /> Also, I was totally surprised to see these high notes in IMDb for this movie ... as I said before, I'm not as sophisticated as the others who commented on this movie before.
