Totally predictable stupid show about a man who killed his wife by hacking her while driving and claimed he had passed out. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel capable of driving a car after killing his wife with one? This question did not occur to writers. The story then witters about a psychologist and his failed marriage who is tied up in the bankrupt wedding of a blackout driver killing wife. An omniscient mother and a one-dimensional child are put to good measure, and the whole builds up to a predictable outcome. Are police psychologists so easily accepted? Fatal writing that actors do their best, but they are bound to fail. This is on an equal footing with a Harlequin Romance. Do not waste your time watching this unless it is what you are looking for.
