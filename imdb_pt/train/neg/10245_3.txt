I expected a lot from this movie. Kinda likes Lee as a character like Naustradamous but instead all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can not even explain this movie. He had a wooden performance, terrible script of bible pieces like hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes. But that was in the end! The rest I had to wait and wait for something significant to happen, but it did not happen. This movie is about a couple trying to discover the changes that are happening in the world, such as places in China where there was an earthquake and ending up in a convent run by eight nuns and a priest. The convent is the key to failure. The whole movie is wrong and boring. One of the Lees is worse.
