I just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. The paintings in the back of the cities looked horrible. Also the mafia characters looked very strange. Warren Beatty did not do a horrible job like Dick Tracy, but it was definitely not one of his best performances. Madonna should just be singing. Glenne Headly did a good job in this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10 just because of the incredible performance of Al Pacino. It was not a high note in his career, but he still did a good job.
