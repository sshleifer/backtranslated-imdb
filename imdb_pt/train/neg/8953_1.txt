I saw this movie literally right after the book was finished, and maybe that was a neutral or very stupid idea. I think it was the last one. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. One of the first things I noticed was that during Winston's day-to-day work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc. he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive looks to people without immense fear. One of the most important parts of the book was that, even in small activities, it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face ANYTIME. This is also shown in the scenes in the streets of the proletarians. In the book, Winston knew that it was a huge risk to wander around and was skeptical and frightened on every trip. While in the movie, he does it so often and without fear, that you lose the important feeling of heavy vigilance and you risk it right away. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary on the wall, yes, a very small change, but that raises the question: what is the purpose? There was also the most annoying thing a director could do with a book, and that's the metamorphosis of characters. <br /> <br /> The great inaccuracies were much more disturbing, however. First of all, one of the important parts of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent, but crude philosophy. In the film, they skip this and go straight to make you think that the government is driven by Hitler with technology. Which is true, in a sense, when driven with your facism, but if that's all you leave Big Brother, you really missed the point of the book. The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that, in a sense, he has some points behind his philosophy. When O'Brien is criticizing Winston at the Ministry of Love, he is listening to everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he hears and advances in his philosophy is, in fact, the most frightening and intriguing. In the end, (careful SPOILER ahead) when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the most terrifying thing is that you are not sure if it was the beating and torture that caused it, or the real power behind philosophy. I'm not saying in any way that Big Brother's philosophy has points that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing. <br /> <br /> Also, how could anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the movie? It was awful, without any connection. <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien before giving his address to Winston? One of the things that led to the book was Winstons thoughts about O'Brien before he made contact with him. In the movie, they simply jumped the gun. <br /> <br /> But that sums up why this movie was a terrible adaptation: because it's impossible NOT to jump the gun and transform characters in less than two hours. How could anyone think that this movie was watchable if it was less than two hours? At a minimum, the movie requires 3 hours to capture some of the important modes and connections. Anything less is useless. <br /> <br /> If you loved the book, and I mean that you really loved it, you would not approve of it, and chances are you already knew it. Because the book is infiltratable, and this movie proves how impossible it is to fit something decent into a small roll of film. <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten
