This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone has ever done. This is a typical 80's movie where you have a man destroying the entire army alone. "First Blood Pt. 2" is very much like Schwarzenegger's "Commando," but then you have Arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation shown as the bad guys. This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. It is true that this was the climax of the Cold War, but I am tired of having communists or Nazis always being shown as enemies. There are so many American movies that have one thing in common. Why is not there a movie that shows Americans as enemies? Who will believe that a solitary soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think something like this really would have happened? It seems that an ordinary American spectator, washed by the brain, would certainly do so.
