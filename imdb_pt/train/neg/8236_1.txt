I can not believe this is on DVD. Even less was available at my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some argue that this is a good movie if you take into consideration that it only had a budget of $ 4,000. I think that's funny. I think it's pretty bad, whatever the budget. <br /> <br /> Even more funny, I read the following in another review: "Dramatics aside, if you love horror and love something like Duel (1971) updated with a little more history and some pretty girls , you'll love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What?!? This is a shame comparing these two films. <br /> <br /> I give a "1", since I can not give a "0". I do not see how this movie can be fun.
