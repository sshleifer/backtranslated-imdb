As a cast member, I was a member of the band at every basketball game, I would like to let the world know, after being in the movie, that we had not been allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was because the producers and the director broke the contract with the University of Oregon, where it was filmed. It looks like the U of O sign was displayed. While we were recording, we were allowed to have several meals with the cast and crew. Mr. Nicholson was memorable for being one of the most rude men I've ever met. Plenty of time for a 20 year old. Certainly not what campus life was like in the late 1960s and early 1970s, despite what Hollywood might think. Oregon Trombone Player
