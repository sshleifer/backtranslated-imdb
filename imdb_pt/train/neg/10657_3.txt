I had high hopes for this movie and watched with a lot of expectations; basically because of Kamal Hassan. He is an incredible actor who has marked his footsteps in the sands of time forever. But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this movie, the brutality and violence in the dark and mechanical orange seem much better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very bold cop. Who is assigned to investigate brutal serial killings. Raghavan finds the connection line effectively in this case and is close to resolving the killings and putting the psychotic killers, two psychologically disturbed but bright medical students behind the bars, but they escape and again go into a kill. Finally Raghavan kills both after saving many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psychotic killers are the ones who will keep the public from going to theaters. Murders and sexual harassment and rape are shown very explicitly, which the film could have survived without. <br /> <br /> Even imagine that teens and children will watch this film in the movies and the kind of picture that it should paint in their minds is certainly not handsome. The director, Gautham, must realize that he also has some obligation to society and his audience. Of course, I never go to the movies looking like Gautham's name on the production list.
