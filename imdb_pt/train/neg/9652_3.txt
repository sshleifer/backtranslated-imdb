The film was written 10 years ago and a different director was planning with SRK and Aamir in main roles. <br /> <br /> The film was finally made now with Vipul Shah directing and Ajay and Salman starring together after a decade HUM DIL <br /> <br /> The film, however, falls short of 90 years, and the worst are the loopholes <br /> <br /> The movie tries to pack many commercial ingredients and we too The love triangle <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable, full of clarity and clich√© <br /> <br /> Are there gaps like the way Ajay flees from London airport and creates a place for himself without anyone? even the way he starts his band is not convincing The second half gets better with the turnaround in Ajay's tale destroying Salman but unfortunately the climax falls short and the movie ends on a bad note <br /> <br /> Direction of Vipul Shah is common to below average Music is the worst, most of the music is mediocre Among the actors Ajay gives his best although not as convincing as a rock singer, but he does superb as the negative role Salman however annoys with his punjabi and talk nonsense he only impresses when he gets stoned and out there Asin is not nothing great just a piece of Ranvijay show must stick to MTV Om Puri is alright
