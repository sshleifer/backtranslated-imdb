"Transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming 80s horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to laugh at the script. Two well-known journalists from a gossiping newspaper are sent, very against their will, to Transylvania to do a report on the alleged return of mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some adorable tricks and details to discover left and right in the film, such as a little cookie cutter egg and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put cream and sugar on the breakfast table. The healthy movie, however, is not as successful as it could and should have been, with jokes and parody situations that are too long. Roger Corman's "Transylvania Twist" production, which came out four years after that, is a lot more fun and much recommended. The movie is particularly parody of the classic Universal landmarks of the early 30's, so you better make sure you've seen them if you want to understand all the tiny jokes and references. There is a very original twist that indicates that Frankenstein's character only behaves like a crazy mad scientist when he enters his laboratory. It is also revealed that he is actually some kind of messiah of Father Damien who only cares about the status of exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the weird guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, stars as a psychotic butler who pops up and disappears at the wrong times. I'm sure that John Turturro's character in "Mr. Deeds" was inspired by the role of Richards here.
