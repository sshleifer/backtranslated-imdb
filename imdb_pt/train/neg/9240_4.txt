The idea of ​​doing a miniseries about Berlin air transport seemed to me one of the most interesting post-war German films. It is a theme that has not yet been explored. However, the creators of this series filled it with clichés. Get started with the DVD cover of the movie, which is a direct copy of the cover of 'Pearl Harbor'. Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) even comes to hear that her husband, who is a doctor (Ulrich Noethen), died in Russia and after the war she is struggling to survive. She finds a job at the American base, starts working for the coolest and most senior cop (Heino Ferch) in town, falls in love with me, becomes pregnant, and suddenly her husband appears again. Let's go!!! We have seen this many times. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their part well; Bettina Zimmermann, however, never seems to convince. For some reason, it always seems like she's a little late in giving the correct emotional reaction to the scenes. It simply did not work for me. <br /> <br /> The action scenes with the airplanes and the air elevator, sometimes we are exciting, more often not. Unpleasant things always seemed to happen to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big fan of WWII movies, I suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice cream brings much more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out!
