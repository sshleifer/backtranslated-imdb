Oh, dear sir. This movie ... It was horrible. I'm a big fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies that other people say are bad, I like it. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I'll say that. But this plot was horrible. It did not make sense! There was a lot of gore and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at first. I believe the director was trying to be "shocking" or something, but it turned out horrible. To add to the pile of crap they called a plot, the actors (besides the 'scarecrow') are terrible, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie, please do so.
