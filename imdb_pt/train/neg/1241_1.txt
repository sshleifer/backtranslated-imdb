This is the worst movie I've seen for years! It begins the ridiculous and continues the same way. I think when something is going to happen in this movie ... and the acting is worse. A finishes a little and saves the movie from a total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good, but this sucks.
