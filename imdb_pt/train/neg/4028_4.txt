This had all the ingredients of a very good film - good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good storyline (a mysterious space missile threatening to burn the planet) and a lot of films (if the Air Force had jet flashed rockets, was used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by an excess of melodrama and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The film deals with a space missile that is attacked by the Soviets and inadvertently diverted to a low atmospheric orbit. At less than five miles and at speeds exceeding 4,000 miles, it emits a million-degree escape, burning everything on the ground, including glaciers, Distant Early Warning (DEW) and Eskimo bases. <br /> <br /> Every attempt to destroy the missile fails. <br /> <br /> The first flaws in this movie appear at the beginning. While we do not expect too much from low budget movies, some things can not be overlooked - as a little research. For example, both the Soviets and the US launch anti-ballistic missiles that hit the missile with infallible accuracy. However, the first successful ABM tests were not made until March 1961 by the Russians. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of melodrama. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their romance with as much wood as a wooden hut. Parker's character cries and boo at Loggia's sacrifice as if he were on a screen test. Loggia is as heroic as a bored businessman. A scientist (Phillip Pine) does it so much that it makes William Shatner look like an actor. A bus driver was spitting a bloody end of world scene after scene. The only good actor is the film's narrator, played by veteran actor Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All this could be forgotten if it were not for the timeline. After the missile information is sent to DC, the Pentagon brings a group of scientists. A general (Larry Kerr) announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes. After that there are discussions between scientists and there is a deadly lull when the word is sought by the ambassadors to see if the missile is an attack of the Russians and if a response is needed. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the military being totally shuffled. Civil Defense people leave work and go to their stations. Eight million people rush to old-fashioned shelters as school buses pick up millions of children (and we get to see the newest city in New York I've ever seen, although watching 50-year-old science fiction movies made it look like this was the standard) . The press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, incredibly, a man at the Pentagon announces that the missile will hit Ottawa, Canada, in 51 minutes! All the action mentioned happened in 12 minutes! So to add fuel to the fire, Loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile. It slowly produces a charge of plutonium, charges it in a jeep, and takes it from a base of missiles to a base of distant missiles to place it on a missile. Along the way, he is knocked off the road by a wild driver, smashed and then robbed. He finally retrieves the plutonium and drives to the base to arm the missile. Again, all this in the same time frame of 63 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film also annoys the viewer, making it seem like Ottawa could be saved, just to show the men, women and children who are baked. The missile is said to take five minutes to reach New York. Loggia is still driving to the base (another 4 miles to go). He arrives at the base and arms the missile, a two-minute countdown is then announced. All in five minutes. New York's neighborhoods should have been at least burned. <br /> <br /> By the way, the missile is destroyed if you did not guess. The ABM warhead destroys it with a massive nuclear explosion based on plutonium. Five seconds later, the explosion dissipates and everything becomes clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear explosion equivalent to 100 Hiroshimas on the outskirts of New York and nothing happened. <br /> <br /> The film had all the elements needed to be a good B movie, but it wasted them. Loggia interpreted your character so badly that you did not care that he sacrificed himself in the end. You did not care about the other characters, or the smart scientist played by Pine. The tension that should have moved the film simply was not physically possible in the allowed time line (it would not be today, not even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult. meet. As far as I know, it has not been re-issued in any medium and for good reason. I do not know if the film should be or whether it was standard practice, but there is a scene in which the government sends all the best scientists, military and businessmen to deep shelters, saying they are too valuable to lose. There is not a single woman or minority in the group. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and he plays a piano. It was worse than "27 Days," where an alien gives five Earthlings a chance to save or destroy the planet and it does not include any black or Hispanic. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a special magazine. fi night at Turner Classic Movies and I do not expect it to show up again. If you find a copy of this somewhere, you may want to put it on Amazon.com.
