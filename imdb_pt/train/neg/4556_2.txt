I do not know what that other guy was thinking. The fact that this film was made independently does not make it less terrible. You can be as big as you want to believe ... most of this movie is nonsense. I feel like I was insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it. And that alone was no small thing. It's not just terrible acting, but the plot is never even developed. There are innumerable holes in history, to the point that you can hardly call it history. I've never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I wrote here and its purpose is to save all of you viewers an hour and a half of your life. I can not remember the last time I could not even finish watching a movie. This one really takes the cake.
