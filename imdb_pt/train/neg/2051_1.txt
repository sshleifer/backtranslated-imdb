As there was nothing wrong with acting etc etc the writing for the episode is far away for this ghost or non ghost series. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the hunter of Martian men. You have to know that in the middle of 6th grade, no matter what happens, it's not really what's happening and really does not bring anything to the series's story except to find the Martian men hunter again and waste 30 minutes to do it . by far another case of poor writing in the smallville novel. I really like the show but mostly because of the cast and the 3 or so good episodes each year but whoever is never in the writing cast that works or used to work on the soaps needs to be canned. This was by far one of the worst. With the first 4 minutes you know that what is happening is false and anything going on is a dream based on Clark's imposition, obviously caused by a character from the ghost zone and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers do not really have to create a villain who progresses in history all that week. May also added another villain to die in the last episode in which the Martian hunter was and made him fly again or back and tell Clark that he forgot his sunglasses to look more closely as in this episode and close the day.
