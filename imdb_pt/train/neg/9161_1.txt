... well, put that on the DVD, spend an hour and a half of your life that you will never go back and find out. <br /> <br /> Acting? What are you doing? <br /> <br /> Production figures? ...Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> History? Do not make me start. <br /> <br /> After many years posting on IMDb, I never thought I would see such a bad movie that I really wanted a rating lower than one. Have I always found at least a reason or two to see the merit - even if only in the intention or effort of the writer, the director, the cast or the producer? <br /> <br /> In that case, they're the same guy (!) who really needs to understand the fact, at least as demonstrated by this useless waste of video tape, that he has no talent. I mean, it would be a reasonable excuse if this was some high school "production" for your first movie class, but the "artist" referenced behind this letter was twenty-six at the time of miscarriage. <br /> <br /> How was this done? Who in their right mind wrote a check for it? Also, do not let the cover of the box fool you: there is nothing that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good "exposition" of the heartthrob on that cover. <br /> <br /> Two final items: there was a second, when this "movie" had redemptive value: the aforementioned "talent" is assaulted by its lover. I applauded! And I learned something from this "movie." There are times when something is so bad that it's actually very funny. But not in a comical way; it's just sadly humorous. Very sadly humorous.
