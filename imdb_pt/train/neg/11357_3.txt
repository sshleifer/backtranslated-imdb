1st the good news. The 3-D is spectacularly well done, and they do not go for trick-or-treating tricks. The film is based on the true story of the high point of human history, and even introduces one of the real participants in this story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the meat of the matter: It's about FLIES for krissakes! It flies with big human eyes, true, but it flies anyway. Remember when I compared the "Underworld" movies to rats and cockroaches? This was not done as a compliment, and I never dreamed that anyone would understand this literally. This one still has less empathy for it. Baby larvae? Ugh At one of these strange confluences of Hollywood group thought, this flik was evidently on the drawing board at the same time as "Space Chimps", also about creatures in space. <br /> <br /> Go rent "Apollo 13" and see a movie of 9 evaluations on the REAL space program (RIP).
