Charlotte's deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than it would otherwise be. The story is so bad and Charlotte's character dies so foolishly that you wonder if that's the end they thought for this movie. I wish someone could say that there is an alternate ending, but I fear it does not exist. As for the rest of the cst, I'd say they just did not do very well; although the guilt must be attributed to the poor script. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies absurdly, since she was the one who stole the show throughout the film. I could give this movie 2/5
