I can find very little that's good to say about this movie. I'm sure the idea and script sounded good on paper, but the filmography and acting I'm afraid of are not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I doubt that this will have great prominence in his CV filmography. Michael Caine sometimes appeared of wood in his role of doctor, and at no time did I really believe in his character. The plot was unbelievable, especially with regard to the child of the victims. Some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other movies, which sometimes I wondered if it was really a fake thriller. The lighting was sometimes dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big stars, wondering why I bothered to watch it.
