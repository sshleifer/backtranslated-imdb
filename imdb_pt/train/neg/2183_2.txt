This movie was really bad, be it a science fiction movie, a horror movie or even a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film seems (and is) definitely cheap, the actors have no idea what acting is and the script clearly shows that it was being done along with the shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary - she was really pretty - and they thought they needed something more impressive; they've failed here too (the makeup is horrible even for the late 50's, pretty funny). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why the career of director Joseph Green as such and also as a writer never materialized; he was very poor at both. The same goes for the actors, leading and supporting. <br /> <br /> The best achievement of the "Brain that would not die" is its short runtime.
