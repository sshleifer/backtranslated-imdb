I can not believe the same guy handled this crap and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was groundbreaking, fresh and well written, if badly acted. <br /> <br /> This stack can not even claim that. It begins with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then he ignores the narrative after describing what happened after that. Following the narrative correctly could have made it a good sequel in some way, but Craven chose to go in the style of his older films, having no good draw but the name of the main villain. <br /> <br /> Even the actor who played Dracula was different (going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have some respect for your liking in movies.
