Okay, possibly not, honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This made absolutely no sense, there was no plot, no characterization, no acting, just nothing. <br /> <br /> Here's what I thought when I first saw it on May 28, 2003. Be careful, this is a spoiler alert. It's also a lot of me complaining about how bad the movie is: Okay, so the movie starts and the characters are introduced, but there is no explanation for the character. As far as I knew the main character was new to this school, but apparently not. it also seemed that he lived alone ... so that he was an adopted son ... so his mother was a furious alcoholic who lived with him still. also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived alone. <br /> <br /> Now we get to the main point of the plot, this insane guy has come out of the insane asylum and is running loose. now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focuses on him closely for the contingency of the movie. I guess I must have missed an element of the main plot here, there was no reason for the main character to get hooked. even if that is the point, not being right, why all his friends, who are skeptical like 5 minutes before, suddenly follow him and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> So the movie goes on, and it gets all right. They're messing up school, blah blah blah. but wait a minute ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the show here. Wait a second, the crazy guy did not specifically tell the main character NOT to do this? It was supposed to be anyomous. <br /> <br /> Another important element of the plot was skipped ... the crazy guy was not to be insane ... everyone said he was not crazy. but as the story continues, he is VERY CLEAR OUT OF HIS MIND. but I thought the people on the news said he was not ... um ... now the movie is over. WHAT WAS THE END? WHAT THE RAY WAS THAT? not only did the final did not answer questions about the main character, he did not answer any question about the insane guy. Are these people in the same situation? if so, then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this. if not then what's the point in saying "it's you in two weeks." <br /> <br /> That's what I thought then. this is pretty much what I still think now. it's 6 months later, and if I get it for free, I can give it another try, but I doubt it. I very much doubt it.
