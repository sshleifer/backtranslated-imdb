A damn maniac with cannibal tendencies rapes a woman. He was shot by two policemen and then he was resurrected from the tomb because of some kind of satanic ceremonial rite preformed by a malignant heresy. The hunt for women continues for this zombie demon. The sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac to die again, but only with the help of the police will this become reality ... <br /> <br /> A bloody 65-minute mess ... horny zombies, doll -babies, S & M, corrupt and distorted cops, repentant heretics seeking refuge in front of Jesus Christ, and three text screens at the end of the movie explaining what happened to the surviving policeman (yes, we should know!). Two decent decepticellate shots can not save the situation. I've seen worse horror movies, but this one was also very bad. Recommended only for fans of the genre.
