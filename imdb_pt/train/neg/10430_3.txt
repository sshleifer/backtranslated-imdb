There are many good things about the new BSG: there are multiple Cylon roles for Model 8 and 6, for example, that the two actresses played superbly. There is the feeling of the old school of industrial design aboard Galactica ("My ship will not be connected, on my dead body!") In addition, all space battles, special effects (even if the scientist observer recognizes the cartoon from the darkness of the characters, its essentially imperfect nature. <br /> <br /> It makes it even more bitter that the ending was so childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, the scenes in space , the Cylons attack and all that was very good But the soft end? I always watch movies and shows these days with the timer hidden, so I never know how much time remains until the end. a special kind of torture, to see the end happen over and over again. Every time I thought, oh this is the final scene, the final shot, I have one more. <br /> <br /> What really highlighted school amateurism of all : the young scenes of Roslin. Why is it important for us to know that: {a} she lost her sisters and father in a horrific accident and {b} she had a night with an ex-student? What does this bring to the story? Where was the call? Now, I'm in favor of a more European approach, and a random act of movies and shows, and all that, but that was just ridiculous. That did not bring anything meaningful to the story. Also, I saw the "Last Frakkin special" and in it Ron revealed his own lack of notion about the plot: he could not propose a good ending to the story, so ... he just did not! It's never as much about the characters as they did in the last episode. The idea "that's been thousands of years in the past," the mitochondrial Eve thing, was also used in the Galaxy Hitchhiker's Guide, and believe me, there are many BSG observers who know this particular story of H2G2. And speaking of Hera, now there is a plot that did not work well, at all. Instead, we have Roslin doing her ex-student who is 20 years younger. Do not get me wrong, I'm all for older women with younger men. More power for them. But that ... just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> In all, (the writing on) this series is as flawed as they intended their characters to be. That goes even more for the last episode. I hope that Lost and 24 will do better, with the end of the series.
