Whale hunters choose the wrong whale. <br /> <br /> A group of yahoo explorers capture a female and tie her with her fin. The companion of the whale sees the whole thing, including the moment when the female fetus slides and falls on the deck. Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) might say that the big man is really crazy by the way he looked down, as if to say, "Get out of the city before the high tide." <br /> <br /> This story of revenge has the presence of Harris and the beauty of Bo, but not much more. This was Bo's first 'released' film, although his first work was four years earlier in 'And Once Upon a Love', released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> Q. Today, the date of this review (November 20) is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a 'whale' for a long time ..... understood? ..... whale? ..... hee-hee.
