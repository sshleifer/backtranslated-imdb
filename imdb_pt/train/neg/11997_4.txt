This movie has many disadvantages and that's all I could see. is painfully long and terribly directed. I could see the whole audience getting impatient and hoping that this would end. The execution time is over 3 hours, which could have been changed to less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The transition between stories is average. most people confessed to sitting around waiting for something better to leave. <br /> <br /> It's funny just in the pockets. ambitious project and under-execution. govinda does a fair job, anil kapoor disappointed me, rest as expected. if you are expecting something close to babel or love, then it is not near.
