This movie was terrible to say the least. I was expecting much better after seeing "High School Musical". The entire movie was a complete rip off of "The Simple Life", but it was not a reality show. <br /> <br /> The performance was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments when she was not so terrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka went bad all the time. Chris Gallinger, who represented Amanda's love interest, was playing a French guy, but he had a horrible accent. One good thing about this movie was the completely adorable Michael Trevino, who played Alyson's love interest. Just something to keep in mind, if this movie had been screened before the "High School Musical", it probably would not have looked so bad. But it was not a comparison. <br /> <br /> In general I give 2.
