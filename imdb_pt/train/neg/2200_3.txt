I love bad shark movies. I really do. I laugh hysterically at them. and the scifi channel was having a marathon of them, culminating in the premiere of their new original image, hammerhead: shark frenzy. based on the previews, it seemed like a lot of fun. essentially a remake of the benchley creature, in fact. was preceded by a display of Shark Attack 3: Megalodon, which is shark movie hilarity at its best. I was in a good mood; I was ready to go. bring it, scientist-mad-man-hammer! Oh God, did this movie go wrong? wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br /> sick. twisted MEASURED. <br /> <br /> This is theoretical reproduction at worst, my friends. when a drugged girl is drawn from a suspended animation and tied to a table, shouting because the hybrid fetus human shark, the absolutely insane "scientist" deliberately implanted in her womb, wants to leave ... Jesus monkeys. This is what I call disturbing. That's how the plot works: hmmm, thought the mad scientist. my son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining his DNA with that of a hammerhead shark because sharks do not succumb to cancer and other hammerhead sharks reproduce through the placenta. Look! a perfect amphibian! I created the next evolution of the human race! I KNOW! Let's make it reproduce! but if all those shark genes did not make my son bloodthirsty; instead of raping the hotties that keep sending to his little paradise in the jungle, he continues to eat it. but check this out! among the random people who, through some minor turnaround, ended up on my research island, is the woman my son was engaged to before he died! I bet he's going to do it! All this leads to an extremely moving and heartfelt meeting: woman: are you going to get me pregnant? mad scientist: no. he is. (Indicates shark-person beating in tank) as sweet. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. ever.
