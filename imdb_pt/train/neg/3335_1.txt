This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of all, and it's positive proof that a five-minute fable does not make a full-length movie. Poor Sid Caesar as the vain emperor, is made to look so stupid, it's hard to see him. Like the cunning tailor, Robert Morse does not have a trace of charm. Neither his unhappy nephew (Jason Carter) The "songs" are terrible and only slow down what's in the plot. The direction is practically nonexistent, and the supporting characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is beautiful as the Emperor's daughter, but her voice was obviously nicknamed for some reason, a destination shared by many of the smaller players. And the movie crawls in a rhythm of snails. Hans Christian Andersen must have been tumbling about in the grave when it appeared. One can honestly say that, at least in this film tale, it's no surprise that it went straight to the video of oblivion.
