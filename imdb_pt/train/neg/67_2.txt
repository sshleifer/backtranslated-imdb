From the outset, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy, that the outcome is totally predictable. Any good textbook on writing scripts will advise layers of characters, incorporating character arcs and three structure of act. In this movie you will not find any of this. The police are the villain and, consequently, are shown as superficial, incompetent and cowardly. It never seems to occur to the producers of this film that the police can be an honorable citizen who sees adherence to the police as a good way to contribute to the welfare of society. <br /> <br /> The spectator has no opportunity to make amends. his mind about whether Ned Kelly is a good boy or a ruthless villain. The film begins with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we have no idea of ​​his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through a chain door, but we only know he's been inside for three years, when we hear that later in some dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film contains many pictures of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction of modern movies, and this one leaves me further away from watching.
