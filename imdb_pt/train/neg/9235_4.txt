This woman never stops talking during the movie. She memorized all the lines, and delivered everything without a little natural emotion. She also has a very unpleasant hunch, and the tone of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard. This movie has a lot of Betsy Drake, and Cary Grant is not enough, which carried the little left of the film on its own.
