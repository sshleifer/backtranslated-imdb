Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only dislike each other to the point of loathing, but they have little or no redeeming quality to make a * public * like or empathize with any of the characters as well. There are movies so bad that they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter), and there are just bad things (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This film is hardly tolerable even if you are a talented MSTie rifer (eg, Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, while I'm quite talented in that sense (it's how my mind works all the time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffs, eventually in * that * movie * you'll just want to take out your own head painfully aware that the movie "Tabu" steals you about an hour and twenty minutes that you will never return. Even my MSTie talents can hardly match this slow and tedious waste of time. The most intriguing aspect of this movie is that someone has enlightened and / or funded it ... I have rented "Tabu" only for the normally talented Amber Benson, who must have been blackmailed to make this movie. I have another lesser-known movie of her in my rental queue, the reviews I should read first. Ironically, the best aspect of the film was its stunning labyrinthine mansion for its interior location.
