When Stanwyck's future husband is murdered on the eve of her wedding, she retires to a mountain cabin where she slides (kind of) off a cliff and is rescued by the wealthy lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, leading to a definitely one-sided marriage, spent on a huge property in Chicago (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted by Cortez, but finally returns to Morgan in a very restrained and unconvincing resolution of history. <br /> <br /> This film has a great cast (Morgan is one of my favorites) and a great director. , but the script is winding and seems useless at times. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but I was disappointed. The cast is still worth watching, and is good for movie buffs in the 1930s.
