This was a terrible movie. There was no plot. To top it all off, when they could not explain the blood and blood (the only good part) ... they threw some aliens! I hate it when the directors (or whatever) run out of ideas and then blame the aliens! Watch this movie if you want. But do not say I did not warn you. Two things: how could Vinny say "welcome" when he did not have a language? Too bad Mr. Jones does not play a bigger role. The second thing that bothered me, why did we show Vinny Jones's boils and him cutting them and putting them in blue liquid, then they no longer have any paper. Why not? I do not like being shown something and this has nothing to do with the story line. In short. Bad story. I would not waste my time - I wish I had seen Mirrors instead.
