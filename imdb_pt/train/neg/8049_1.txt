A warning to you not to be seduced by the names Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is useless and uninteresting, and made me think often of a Twain phrase about wanting all the characters to drown together. When someone mentions the category of Worst Films ever Produced, it's not like Plan 9 or the Assassin's Attack of the Assassin I think; are the likes of that. What a complete loss of time - mine and everyone involved in that movie.
