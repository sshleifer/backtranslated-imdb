I feel totally stolen. Someone needs to pay back the $ 4.95 I spent on Blockbuster to rent this homemade mess. This is not a musical, it's a complete waste of time and my night. What I do not understand is why this was distributed in the first place ??? ... someone MUST have made some heavy drugs the night the deal was made. I've seen better movies come out of film schools and I went to film school so I can say that as fact. The quality of this work is also VERY VERY bad to see ... shot in DV ??? Nuff said. Songs are not songs, but just jokes that sound the same in every section. Want to see a good musical? THEN DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE.
