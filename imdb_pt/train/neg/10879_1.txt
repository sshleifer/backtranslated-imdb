Lame, lame, lame !!! A 90-minute party that lasts 89 minutes. A scene full of atmosphere and possibility (an abandoned convent) is wasted by a stench of a script filled with clumsy and stupid dialogues that strive to be cool. Mostly, it's just embarrassing, and gonzo horror attempts fall headlong (a sample of the dialogue in this film: after demonstrating its artillery, fast dolly shot a close-up of Barbeau's vigilante character ?? she: 'any questions?' hyuck hyuck). Bad jokes, idiots, homophobes and judging by the effects of creatures, it seems that the director has often watched the movie 'The Evil Dead'. <br /> <br /> I owe my friends great opportunity to rent this turkey and subject them to ninety minutes wasted they will never get back. What the fuck
