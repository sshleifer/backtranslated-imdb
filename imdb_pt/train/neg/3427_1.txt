That must have been an embarrassment to all members of the wholly African-American cast. All the disparaging and derogatory stereotypes of the American black community are highlighted. I will not enforce the insults by listing them here, except to mention chickens, watermelons, and dice. <br /> <br /> A good song by Ethel Waters (and a few bad ones), and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8-year-old Sammy Davis, bring the total to something less than 1 on the IMDb chart.
