turned out to be another failed attempt by the laughable science fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script, and I interpreted the poem, but I'm sure it was a 17-year-old who thought it would be great to have a beast in the movie. AAAAAAAH! When I saw that part, I lost all hope. So ... they depart for the beginning in one that seems to be the ship that Christopher Columbus sailed! when they arrive at Heorot (which is supposed to be a Nordic mead saloon), the group of science fiction idiots decided to make the king look like a great stone castle. When I saw this part .. I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but science fiction has not yet produced a good movie, so I do not know why I have my hopes. Oh .. and Grendel and his mother are stupid too. (this comment is off topic of "Grendel") If someone from the science fiction channel is reading this ... here's good advice. NOT ALL THE MOVIES THAT YOU DO HAVE TO BE ABOUT A GREAT MONSTER THAT CAN SCRATCH PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE, IT IS NOT WHAT SCIENCE FICTION IS! AND ALSO, STOP PRODUCING LOW-TIME ACTORS LIKE STEPHEN BALDWIN TO BE IN YOUR MOVIES! IS NOT HELPING THE MOVIE, BUT MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT !!!
