I should start by saying that I am a great romantic. So I really wanted to like this movie. So I am writing my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt watching. The Leap Years tells Li-Ann's fate-filled history, which falls in love with the gentle Jeremy and commits himself to meet every leap year. A very romantic premise, based on a great tale and a cast that does not look like you're watching another Jack Neo movie. So why is it so bad? Firstly, I feel that the filmmakers thought they were filming a music video because they chose to replace the narrative and the true emotions with kitschy assemblages, predictable actions and cliches. I am upset and embarrassed to be one of the first in Singapore to watch The Leap Years, but those of us in the movies would agree that our muffled moans in the paltry performances spoke volumes. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that beat Forever Fever, Singapore's best romantic comedy so far, and The Leap Years does not even come close. Some blogs call it The Crap Years, which is hard, but in the end it's true. Do not waste your money or your emotions as I did. The movie will make you give up on love forever.
