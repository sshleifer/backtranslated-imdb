If you do not realize in the first 10 minutes of this movie that the main character, who writes a column of life advice, will have the tables so well done and learn some valuable life lessons, then there is probably something wrong with you. The set up is so predictable that it spoils the movie, even if the rest of the movie is good (which it is not). <br /> <br /> There is almost no chemistry between the protagonists, and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It's hard to believe that Binoche's character has any interest in him. So in the end, everything is so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. It's Not Great America!
