This film concerns the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his return to old friends in a seaside community. The plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means to deal with the death of a friend in which he feels somehow responsible. But this is irrelevant because the choices made in production are extremely poor and not fully realized. The scripts do not always have to be chatty, but they should at least help in the development of the story. Here, a line of attempts, like "he just took off" or "I know you do not have love of heart", completely evokes something worth to the public. Also, whenever the writer feels at a loss where to go next, he cuts to a montage of the protagonist's music walking through fields to some indie humor music. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, the kind that gives quality and substance rather than style then this is not the movie for you.
