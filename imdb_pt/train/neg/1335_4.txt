This movie was awesome !! (Not as good as Leif Garrett Longshot's masterpiece), but still amazing !! I thought Ashley looked huge compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I want to know why. Who would think they could stay in such places and almost get away with it. Dad was a jerk and my mother was very close with Helmit Head. I give 4. Anyone who likes this movie should take a look at Longshot.
