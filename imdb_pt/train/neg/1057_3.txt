I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. When I realized that the whole movie was in fact just about an older guy reliving his dream, I felt cheated. It certainly could have been a device to bring us something deeper, something more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So, do not buy a big drink or you'll be running to the bathroom. My kids did not like it either. Oh well.
