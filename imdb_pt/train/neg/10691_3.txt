I argued with myself whether I would rent this or not. I'm always afraid to rent something I've never heard of (I do not remember being in theaters). Great cast ... is what tipped the scales. 30 minutes later, I almost stopped watching. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but unbelievable. It only gets worse after that. The writers of this film could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their films even better. Or they could just try to write something a bit believable. I give grade 3 ... to 1 for writing (just because there are words) and 2 to get so many good actors to agree to make this movie, despite having to read the script. Oh my God, this movie sucks.
