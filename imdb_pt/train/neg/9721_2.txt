Who could sympathize with these two detestable protagonists? What is intended to be a light and foamy comedy about neighbors who can not give up their childhood challenge game, even as they age in adelododod, is more like an exercise in petulant indulgence and indulgence. As children, both are unbearably precocious; as adults, are intolerably immature. It's a bad combination.
