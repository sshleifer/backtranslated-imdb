Where is it written that sequels should suck? The scream 2 did not! Others did not! But this certainly had ... problems include horrible actors (only Christopher Walken could play the whole movie), bad writing (you'll never understand what's going on and I even researched the idea of ​​Nephilim before), and just horrible choices for the cast. Eric Roberts does the stupidest Archangel Michael I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague, unless you are desperate to see Christopher Walken. In that case, just move to the parts where he is in the movie, and avoid the others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
