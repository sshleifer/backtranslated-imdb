There are often badly married couples (in the general sense of the term) - in Huston's films: "African Queen" "Heaven Knows Allison" "Roots of Heaven" "Misfit" ... "The Barbarian and the Geisha "(check out the title) is another good example, so to speak. It seems that Japanese things were fashionable at the time like works such as" Sayonara "" Suzie Wong's World "and" The August Moon Tea House "testify. Huston's effort may be the worst of this quite bad (with the exception of "Susie" maybe). John Wayne fits perfectly into the Ford world, in Huston he's like a bull in a porcelain shop. His Japanese partner is totally bland. Even dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the movie from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those who fall in love with all of Huston's work need to choose this, among all their other great films out there.
