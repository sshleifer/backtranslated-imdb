<br /> <br /> What remains of Planet Earth is populated by some survivors of poor rags and hungry. They must eat insects and insects, or whatever, after a venomous war, or something, almost end up with all human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on earth still able to live in comfort, we will call him the Great Chief of the Almighty, has a great mission to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air. It seems that the Whole Knowing Big Boss is the last person on Earth who knows that these spores exist. The spores are located far from any living soul, and are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> The Big Boss boss wants the secret spores to remain in their protected secret containers. So he makes a plan to send a sex worker team to remove the spore containers from all protection systems and secret location. Sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret. Sending people to disable all protection systems allows the spores to be easily released into the air. How about leaving dogs sleeping? <br /> <br /> The only nice feature of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu. As the members of machista and ordinary action teams leave the predictable pace mechanically stimulated, the involvement of Vivian Wu's charm makes acceptable the plot idea of ​​her former employer wanting her so much. She is an object of love, an object of desire - a very believable concept! <br /> <br /> Vivian Wu fans may want to check out an excellent B movie where she's been a few years ago called DINNER PRESSA. DINHER RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
