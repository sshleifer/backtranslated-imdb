There is nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and making an American movie experience. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion, but a good thriller depends on the establishment of sympathetic and intelligent characters. As far as sympathy is concerned, the protagonists of Say Yes are a singular couple. Well done. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. Let's count the ways in which they deal poorly with the terrorism of a pursuer. <br /> <br /> 1. After a ride threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him which hotel you are staying at when you leave. <br /> <br /> 2. Beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, thus allowing you the accusation of aggression. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not bother telling the police about the persecutor and simply assume (for no good reason apparently) that the cops were bribed by him. <br /> <br /> 4. When trying to escape, leave your wife out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the pursuer kidnaps her. <br /> <br /> 5. After getting help from someone to find the stalker after their wife's kidnapping, be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face it one by one. It's no use being unfair, right? <br /> <br /> Now, I would never expect that anyone would be immune to making some mistakes under these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it is effectively impossible. for the viewer to worry about their safety, since they are victims of their own actions. This kills the fun of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, the writers did not stop with stupid characters. Since they themselves are certainly stupid to write this article, they have decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that the whole sense of reality comes out the window. <br /> <br /> 1. Does the stalker kill a police officer inside a police station? while the protagonist is sleeping less than three meters away. <br /> <br /> 2. The stalker engages in all kinds of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people, but no one but the couple seems to notice their strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. The stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being. <br /> <br /> 4. The "suspense" scenes had no imagination at all. In fact, some scenes were stolen directly from American movies. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is the decapitation near the end, which was a rather brutal scene once it was inflicted on the wife. It's a pity that the filmmakers followed him with a scandalously stupid ending coming out of the left field. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Koreans behind the making Say should be ashamed of themselves. Better yet, they should just move to California and work with people who make movies with a similar scorn for quality and intelligence.
