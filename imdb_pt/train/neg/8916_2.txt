I rented this DVD having seen it while looking for something else. When I saw the title on the jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and I loved it, I actually admire Yalom's work in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) I watched maybe 30 minutes of this movie and had to turn it off. I'm not sure I can take much more. On a superficial level, the false accents, as others have commented, are simply distracting at best and irritating and insipid at worst. The acting is monotonous when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious. The portrait of Lou Salome is simply irreverent, and the brilliant Freud seems little more than a student. I see very little of the spirit of the book transmitted until now. I was hoping to be able to recommend this movie to my students. Instead, I'll direct you to the book. Imagine that.
