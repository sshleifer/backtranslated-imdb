I'm a fan of the Nightmare series, but this one sucks. The killings are so fashionable. If you watch this 20 years later, the whole nintendo scene is outdated. I liked the flashbacks. I think they should have done a prequel on when he was still alive. That would have been more interesting. This is a movie that you can take or leave. It depends on how much free time you have.
