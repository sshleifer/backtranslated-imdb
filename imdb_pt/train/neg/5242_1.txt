well, I hated knocking on the door, I despised the 40-year-old virgin, and this little gem is a useless piece of junk. do yourself a favor and skip it. I admit, I do not like the actors in this movie, and after my 18-year-old son showed me the disguise of the DVD, I was like, "I do not like this movie," but at his insistence, I decided to give it a try , unfortunately. <br /> <br /> About two minutes into the movie I hung up, I was so offended. It's disgusting. any decent person would be offended by the filth of that movie. call me old-fashioned, but tucking the juice-covered hand of his pussy into his friend's face so he knows you've "got a little" is above the line of decency, in my opinion. That's how this putrid movie starts, and I can only imagine that it gets much worse from there. another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I bet he's proud as a punch. imagine if you could just get useless papers as he wins, would you stay at the movies? despite the payment, I would not. <br /> <br /> I should have known better; Next time I will.
