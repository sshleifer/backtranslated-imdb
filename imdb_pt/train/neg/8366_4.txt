'SherryBaby' is a very painful and sordid melodrama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of prison after a drug-related conviction and struggle to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to regain her love of his daughter daughter being cared for by his brother's family. The only reason the film should be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, a top-of-the-line actress who fits nicely into the role and carries the entire film on her shoulders. This is not enough, however, as the plot is very simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put in the wrong place - I kept asking myself the whole picture if I should regret the ex and maybe drug addicts in the future. mother as the director and screenwriter wanted, or about the innocent kid in the middle. Even the acting of Maggie Gyllenhaal could not convince me that I should not care more about the boy.
