Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a try. Ms. Bullock's role in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days), though it decides on bold and modest roles, leaves much to be desired. Her character is both omniscient, confused, and sexually misfit (Sandra's sub-plot of the past appears as an unnecessary fill that does little to develop her superficial character). The two teenagers gave decent performances, although their forensic expertise and their "get-me-can-be" attitude are belied by stupid mistakes that shout "We did it!" Chris Penn, as the all-obvious suspect, is wasted here, as is Ben Chaplin's symbolic partner / love interest character. Spoilers Ahead *** Mediocre acting aside, biggest flaws can be Traced to a TV conspiracy of the week that never has you fully buying the motives for murder in the first place, and as mentioned, the stupid mistakes (vomiting a rare food at the scene of the murder, a very convenient and framing of the school janitor, the two boys coming out together in public, a loving interest convenient to cause friction, etc etc) make the vision go from intrigues to be bored and disappointed by the killers. The ending was strictly "By the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Using the now cliché tactic of almost showing the climatic scene at the beginning of the movie, and then filling the audience with how we got there at the time, the final scenes did not surprise anyone and did not have any of the so-called intelligences that the movie intended to reach its conclusion. A concept a bit promising, but poorly executed and weak in almost every way. * outside of ****.
