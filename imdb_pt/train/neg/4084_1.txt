Every once in a while you hear radio djs inviting listeners to name movies the listener does not support or never watched all the time. This is the movie that I think ... days later. <br /> <br /> It has something to do with a play by Shakespeare. I'm not sure, but I think I gave time to this movie for a strange 20 minutes ... I think I realized that my nails did not lock, and they were looking at me begging to be cut. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed boring and pretentious to me. Although this is the first film I gave such a low note (which I actually tried to watch), I do not want to take you out of other films by English director Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that his "The cook, the thief, his wife and his lover" was really a great British film, although its content was sometimes to turn the stomach - a brilliant film, but I can understand why people refuse to see it. Another good Greenaway movie was "A zed and two noughts." Again, it had some content that went beyond the limits of good taste, but nevertheless it was intriguing. <br /> <br /> The other film I usually think too late for these radio show themes is "Brazil." I could never see it all the time until I fell asleep! <br /> <br /> Unless you have a taste for important movies that are extremely stylized, laboriously rhythmic and hard to follow, then head clear of Prosero's books.
