The movie begins with a voice telling the audience where they are and who the characters are. And that's when I started to dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities that any movie director has on hand, I really think it's a very easy and inexpensive solution to express the situation with one voice over telling it all. I truly believe that voice transmissions are treacherous to the concept of film production. <br /> <br /> I hate hearing a voice saying where we are, what date we are, and especially what the characters feel and think. I believe a director has to find a visual way to convey the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after the bad introduction, a very striking movie begins and continues for quite a long time. The lives of a middle-class family and all members individually are represented in a perfect and realistic manner. I think the director has a knack for capturing real life situations. For example, a parent who has to make their private calls in the bathroom may seem abnormal at first, but life itself leads to some situations that may seem abnormal but also very normal as well. I think the director is a good observer of real life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. After a while, the realism in the film begins to sacrifice storytelling. I really felt like I'm having a big headache because of the characters who talk non-stop. It was as if the actors and actresses received the subject and could improvise the dialogues. It's really realistic, but the characters always asking "really, that's the way," etc. each other, or the characters saying "no" or "you're listening to me," ten times when saying it just once is just enough cause I have a headache. <br /> <br /> I also think that the scenes of reading and reading books are more than they should be. I understand that the piece and the book in the film are very related to the plot, but I think the director missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes.
