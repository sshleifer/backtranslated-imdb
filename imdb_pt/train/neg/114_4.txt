It's not the cast. A more refined group of actors, you could not find. It is not the scenario. The director is in love with New York City and, at the end of the movie, we are all! Woody Allen could not improve what Bogdonovich did here. If you are going to fall in love or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. Actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood, this is what happens when they go to work on the set. It's reality for him and his peers, but it's a fantasy for most of us in the real world. So in the end, the film is hollow, superficial and without messages.
