You know you're in trouble watching a comedy, when the only fun parts are Animal Cast. It's a shame, then, that the Cat & Dog parrot was only in support and not the opposite, since humans in it were quite abysmal. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what kind of name is this), Jason, & Lindsay, I'd forget this actor's joke and do something else, since you're all so funny how much to see dry and horrible actors of painting. The main joke of the movie is one of the screaming characters, I'm not gay, which is funny as if you were not, you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossies, tedious and I daresay very simple women lead the film. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in years, and I hope I never see one so bad again, though I did not expect it.
