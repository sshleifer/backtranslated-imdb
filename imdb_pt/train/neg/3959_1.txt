this is NOT one of those movies, it's one of the biggest troupe I've seen on the scene, camera work is trying to be flashy, but in fact it's just the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries, but without sex, A The only reason I bought this was that I wanted to try the DVD and this was the cheapest I could find, possibly the worst purchase of my life and could have taken you off the DVD forever, the soundtrack is really tacky and the biggest part of the movie is made up of endless replays of clips from the first two films, why would anyone want to make such a horrible movie as this is beyond me if they had really tried to make an original movie and failed I would be cooler in this review but they not only have the right to reproduce things from the first two and then edit them and repeat them in this movie with approximately 1st original 3rd recording, which is approximately the standard of the students of the Waves of film, DO NOT buy this movie. the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you were to put it in the microwave and watch the lights flashing! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTER TRASH unbelievable! 0/10 if only the voting system allows this.
