I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and I picked it up recently. The sci fi channel ran worse, but not much. A shameless imitation of Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces the saber-toothed cats with dinosaurs. And they are on the loose, devouring as many extras as possible. The CGI is very bad, and close-ups of prosthetic catheads are laughable. We got some blood, which helps a bit. Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started all this mess understands. In addition to Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently this was filmed in Fiji. Good job if you can. Reminds me of all those monstrous low-budget STVs that were popular in the 1980s and 1990s.
