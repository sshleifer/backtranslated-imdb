Any movie that has nude scenes of Karen Allen and I'm still so bored that I leave, that's a stench! <br /> <br /> Karen gets stuck in Paris, and befriends a handsome French man with whom she is having sex soon. Of course he is married ("But, cheri, why should this be a problem?") What could be an interesting clash of cultures is (believe it or not) just annoying. I left. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie got a lot better after I left; but it would have been much better to make up for a rotten start. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself in this, run, do not walk, to the exit. Save your time and energy. For sure you save your money. It's a shame that the producer has not saved her money.
