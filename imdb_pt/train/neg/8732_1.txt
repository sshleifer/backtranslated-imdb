The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the murders. During the film, it seems that he has some problems with his daughter. In the end, the serial killer gets caught. That's it. But before you figure out who the dunnit is, you have to see a terrible acting out of all the actors. It's unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this, but that would be a great waste of time. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you.
