Oh dear, what a disappointment. I've been watching old western movies on British TV for decades, and I was not aware of it until their screening yesterday - most of the other Scott West comes in every few years and is generally worth watching again. The rich color and the outdoor settings were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made. Several times I felt like turning it off, and finally I did, in the middle of the way, something that I almost never do. Scott seemed strangely oily to charm the girls, his two partners were annoying, and so was the Mexican. thief And I have the feeling that the army uniforms were 20 years more or less modern, not that this bothered the manufacturers of many other West. <br /> <br /> Maybe it got better in the second half, but I could not. be bothered to wait and see.
