I have seen many movies from China - and from Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst was 'Unknown Pleasures'. I watched 'Platform' last night and thought the other two Jia Zhang Ke movies should be better. Tonight, I was disappointed again. I will not be watching 'Xiao Wu' tomorrow night because I just put all three movies in the trash! Who gave this film, 'Platform' ten out of ten, need to watch more cinema! The photograph was very poor: it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters due to the lack of close-up work. The plot was so disjointed that I advanced quickly to the end out of sheer frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage any day. These are true masters of Chinese cinema, not pretentious swindlers!
