What will they do now? <br /> <br /> Does it look familiar? <br /> <br /> The film seems to be trying to be a combination of the acting workshop, the indie film and the theater. It's the kind of thing actors love - it's a kind of workshop or play because it's mostly about focusing on the actors who act ... acting angry, tense, scared, talking, planning, planning - giving artists a lot of free space to really screw it up. <br /> <br /> A trio of crooks, a leader, a fool, and a brother, invent a grand scheme of assault. .. and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works. To top it all off, there's a bit of "fender-bender" and one of the thieves flung at the back of the windshield. <br /> <br /> The cops are on their tail and they stumble across a bar called poetically (and mostly) "Dino's Last Chance." Spacey, as a director, tries to stay focused on actor performance and speech delivery. He heads for a red-hot cigarette advertisement from a smoky, smoking Bogart. And he keeps all the violence off the screen, really. <br /> <br /> I think that was a mistake. Concentrating on intensity and violent scenes would have given the film some edge. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it moves very slowly and suffers from errors in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinese looks pensive and deep in the thought of being a cowardly tag. along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine police lieutenant and profanity who does everything wrong but he gets nothing to do here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only actor who is credible in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to shed blood. <br /> <br /> And the swindlers are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or try to think of some way out. that. <br /> <br /> Spacey does not have the ability to create a lot of tension and continue. The characters are mostly talking, trying to think of a plan ... and they're calm and very articulate. There is even a scene where the thugs are playing pool with a whole group of armed police outside, ready to attack. At one point, one of the bad guys even calls the police outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh, bother. <br /> <br /> These cops will either do away with them or lock them up. Should not the hidden thugs be a little scared, a little restless? Meanwhile, all the real action is going on inside. <br /> <br /> Someone gets a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off the screen and there is another low that happens ... well, a little sad. But ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway should also have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is well into a smaller part. <br /> <br /> A cop who hears reaches of a match pack at the absolute worst moment is a good look. And so it's a scene where someone crosses the rear windshield. <br /> <br /> The dialouge is obviously trying to go for an approach to David Mamet and is so profane but never so realistic or insightful. <br /> <br /> The film looks like a lot of what it really is ... a really low-budget film with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a screenplay that "is not bad but needs some more rewrites. " Spacey shows that he is not a lousy director, but he does not have the slightest idea of ​​"shaping a movie" and it looks like he's just filming actors. <br /> <br /> These actors are talented and could work with the material. , but everyone feels out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from mistakes. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that the wrong actors have been chosen. I think they found the right cast, but put them in all the wrong roles. I think changing some of the roles would have helped immensely. Having veteran actor Joe Mantagna as gang leader Gary Sinese as the furious police lieutenant on the outside in his megaphone giving orders and barking to his troops, keeping Fischter in his bloody part "and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. That would have been a big improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors drive, it works. They may even win the Oscar for it. But most of the time, when the actors drive, they tend to focus only on performances. Just shoot the actors. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for that. <br /> <br /> Hostages are practically the same in real life, as well as stories about maturing, so it is only natural that films about them pass from point A to point B as well. <br /> <br /> There are some great entries for this genre. 'Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations: "The Negotiator." <br /> <br /> This certainly will not become a cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. Still, he has some nice moments. and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on normal TV. Just not worth going out of your way to see. <br /> <br /> I give a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Spacey's other credit, "Beyond The Sea," would be better effort. Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You need to fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
