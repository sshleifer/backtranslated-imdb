I read some of the other reviews and I have to agree with those who did not get the ending. I thought it was going well ... until the end. It kept his mind working and then spread. I have no idea what happened in the last two minutes of the movie, except for a complete mess. It's as if they run out of money to reach a good ending, so they improvised. First they had a mysterious thing causing people to disappear, so they had a guy talking about Area 51 (which makes you think of aliens) and then they went to the crap. I thought the actors and actresses were fine, it's just the script that went wrong. Anyway, if you watch this movie, be prepared to be disappointed in the end.
