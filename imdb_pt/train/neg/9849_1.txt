This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's bad even at TV Movie level standards. The plot is diabolically flawed, and the names known in this movie are wasted on confusing and uncertain characters. I do not know how the director managed to keep that excuse for a movie together - it's so bad. Announced as a "psychological thriller of terror" - it's certainly horrible. There is nothing exciting about it. And this can cause you psychological damage! The opening opening scenes were so promising - a possible embarkation over whether the soul is just one aspect of the brain, but the total confusion that followed the scene of the car crash is unbelievable. No matter how hard you tried, you could not care less about the characters. There are so many ideas sprinkled that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from Chinese philosophers, and at worst the movie would really make you die of a lie! <br /> <br /> I bought more than 300 DVD movies. and this is the first one I'm going to get my money back. STEER CLEAR.
