This Italian semi-horror movie starts much like a softcore pornographic film and turns into a mystery that has some loose ends to be good, this and the fact of being rather monotonous just makes this movie a bit worthless for my taste . The only thing that really worth watching are the various breasts scattered throughout the film. The story has a guy who, at the beginning of the movie, attracts girls to the castle, where he takes them to the dungeon, goes crazy and apparently kills them. They show nudity but never show the murders at this point in the movie. Then the guy finds a beautiful red head at a party and starts going out with her and marrying her. He has a crush on redheads you see as his beloved ex-wife Evelyn was also one, she also died in circumstances that should not have been the business of the audience. After many scenes, murders begin to happen involving snakes, foxes and the like. At this point, it is fairly easy to find out who is responsible for the killings and what the reason is, so you have a nonsensical ending, where everything ends not very well. This movie just did not work for me, it left me with lots of questions and the last third of the movie simply did not have the breasts of the first two thirds of the movie. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film as it would have some kind of ending where Evelyn came up from the grave. Granted the title is not entirely misleading, as she left the grave, just not under her own power. The blood is very light mostly as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with a bit of blood as well. I just thought most of this movie was a bit dull.
