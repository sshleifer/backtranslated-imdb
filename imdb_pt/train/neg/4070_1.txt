Imagine the gothic kids running around college in a special movie, throw a hint of history and a lot of horrible acting, and you're not even close to how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> evil, bad effects, worse performance. Shocking horror attempt. Everyone I've shown this to be kind of depressed watching. The sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily because of their content, but more because they are just something that you want to end as quickly as possible. The last sex scene is just plain bad, even before it hits the guy. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who love watching movies that people hate, and that's why I chose this one. But, for your own good, save yourself time and avoid this aversion. It's so bad. I literally threw it in the trash.
