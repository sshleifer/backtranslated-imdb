In the many films I saw Warren Oates, I came to a definite conclusion: here is a talented individual. I saw Mr. Oates for the first time in the 1960 TV series called Stoney Burke. From then on, I followed his career closely and felt that he was destined for great roles. This happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him the best billing in a movie called "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia". Of course, his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in 'The Wild Bunch'. I always thought he was able to bring any character with a certain magic, until I saw him on this flop. The film is called "Chandler," a tribute to the 1950s iron fist detectives created by Raymond Chandler. Because, the synopsis said it was about a hard nose Private Eye, I was immediately interested. However, I sat patiently throughout the film and found it to be a boring, uninteresting, slow, distorted, and confusing saga that, if it had a theme or plot, should have been left in some dark backstage. Collectively and with some of Hollywood's best supporting stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough power to hit Mach 5, however, it failed in the launch bar and it was not where. As a result, one of my favorite actors got stuck in a poorly made vehicle that never got off the ground. **
