That's how the title should be, anyway. <br /> <br /> This film combines weapons, explosives and meaningless killing to make a flop of an "action" movie. Let me make my point in a series of questions: kind of answers deal. <br /> <br /> What happens in the movie? People die. <br /> <br /> Is that it? Yes. <br /> <br /> What is the plot about? What plot? <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the film? Killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> How are the characters? Extremely flawed and contradictory in relation to their own personalities. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some Panavision cameras to shoot. <br /> <br /> If you like constant killing and greed, watch the movie. If you happen to be repelled by such "low" entertainment, then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, the plot stinks, the characters are not worth it, the plot is completely resilient, and nothing fits. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: the actors, directors and those who helped make this film are certainly not "Made".
