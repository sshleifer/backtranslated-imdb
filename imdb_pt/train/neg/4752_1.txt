I've heard a lot of stories about this movie being great ... Well, I took the opportunity when I saw it for a cheap price on Ebay last month. <br /> <br /> I watched, and I have only a few comments about it: 1) Terrible plot, 2) Terrible acting, 3) More fight scenes ... <br /> <br /> I've never seen a worse movie in my life, so far !! When the story is bad, at least make the fights more interesting. But both are ridiculously bad ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she looks cool in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's about it ...
