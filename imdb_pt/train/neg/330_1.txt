I wanted to punch the TV. Watching it was torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. Terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I usually like him, but not this one. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most annoying movie in the world. The comedian that he is jealous is nasty. The only part remotely funny is the rocker with the black teeth catching all the girls. It was so annoying that he wanted to punch the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO RUIN SOMEBODY. If you like Adam Sandler a bit, do not buy it. This will only make you hate it. Do yourself a favor, if you see in the store, hide it to put everyone out of the danger of buying it. It's a waste of $ 1.99 and I paid for it.
