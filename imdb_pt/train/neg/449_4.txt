I admit I only watched a few episodes, but each one looked completely different from the next. It seems that after the first season, the producers decided to completely re-equip the show, drop characters, introduce new ones, and rewrite all the dynamics of the show. <br /> <br /> As you probably already guessed, the show is about peculiarities. Unpredictable teen Holly (Amanda Bynes), who moves in with her very tall sister, Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York. Premise decent enough: strange couple + fish out of the water + high jinx. <br /> <br /> Although I miss the sitcoms of yesteryear, this show sadly misses the mark on the funny over and over, and it's sad because they have some decent talent <br /> <br /> On top of everything, they insisted on changing the show (Val was living with a regular cast bf a season, so he went away suddenly, so she opens a bakery? what?) When things change that drastically, you get the feeling that even the * show * knows it's bad. I mean, completely new sets, written characters and new regular shows! <br /> <br /> On a side note (this is just a comment), I know this is a real TV show and not real but Val and Holly end up living in a huge duplex loft (there are stairs) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN! Are you serious!?
