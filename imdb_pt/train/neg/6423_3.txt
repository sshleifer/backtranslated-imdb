The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown had my finger dangling on the remote control, ready to take a look to see something else. The premise of two writers, down on their luck, living in a "bin" of self-storage space was slightly amusing, but painfully bland. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - the big movie guy who lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory, offered hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes. And a few more until the introduction of Kristy Swanson as film director and nymphomaniac, added a bit of seasoning. His solid acting performance elevated his presence above and beyond just a welcome inclusion to the eyes. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the obvious low-budget impacts on the film with poorly filmed scenes, dizzying rhythms and manipulation of certain moments. Some of my favorite movies of all time have been low budget, Whithnail & I being one that also deals with two guys with a dream but with luck. <br /> <br /> However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the "terrible movie" files and almost takes it to the archives "could have been a cult movie." I laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving Joe Pantoliano's character. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the house of characters are terribly clich√©, but still funny, rich and moody, where the story unfolds towards their final moments. <br /> <br /> I can see how Tinseltown was a great success. And while the filmmakers did their best to translate this into the celluloid, it simply did not work and while I laughed out loud at some scenes and in a liner, I think the first 30 minutes numbed my senses and expectations for such I would have laughed at anything. <br /> <br /> Unless you're stuck on a coffee coaster, do not take this if you see it in a bargain bucket.
