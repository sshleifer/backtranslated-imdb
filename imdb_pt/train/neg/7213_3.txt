Although I certainly consider The Exorcist a horror classic, I have to admit that I do not consider it as important as many other horror fans do. As a consequence, I have not seen many Scratchcards from the Exorcist, and if exorcism is something to go by, I'll have to say it's a good thing as this movie sucks as hell and it certainly is not worth spending. ninety minutes To be fair to the other exorcists, this is considered one of the worst, and may not be the best place to start. It is not difficult to guess what the plot will be: basically it is the same as the Exorcist and sees a girl being possessed by a demonic spirit (which is the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, which is pretty much the best thing about the movie. Exorcism was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the Spanish derivative Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I did not see any of his other films, but based on those two: I believe that originality was not one of its strengths. There are not many good things I can say about the movie itself; most of the time it just creeps and the exorcist scene is not worth waiting for. I certainly would not recommend it!
