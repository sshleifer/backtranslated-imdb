Omen IV (1991) was a bad deed for T.V. film. Since the 1980s, I think executives were experimenting with methamphetamine (the drug of choice during the 1990s), because there is no other reason to explain this farce. Why did they bother doing this? A TV movie? What were they thinking when it came up in the framework of ideas? Did they even think for a second that this movie would catch like. Maybe they thought they could do this as a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy. They should have ripped off a few dollars instead of putting that "extra" disk. <br /> <br /> Omen IV is basically a remake of the American family from the first movie. Instead of a punk boy, we have the scary girl who is a total brat for everyone around her. If the family had stronger parental abilities, then none of the demonic events that occurred in the previous films would never have occurred. These parents need to put their foot down and do some real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, it is best to avoid at all costs!
