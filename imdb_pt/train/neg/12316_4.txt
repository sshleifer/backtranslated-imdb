Director Jonathan Lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past, such as 'Greedy' and 'Clue'. This is not one of them. More like a 'Police Academy' movie than with his inspiration, he plays Steve Martin in the former role of Phil Silvers as an Army sergeant always drawing blows to the nose of his superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon seems unstable when an old enemy visits the determined base to catch Bilko in the act. Nothing much happens, actually. Everything is very annoying. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman make a few laughs, but they are all better than that and it is very painful to see them working with such fine material.
