This movie is an insult to all divers. It was stupid. It seems to have been written by monkeys. The acting was absurd. If this is the opinion most people have of the Navy, then I cry for our defense. This movie was awful. I put below "Journey to the bottom of the sea" with regard to underwater movies. Gene Hackman must have really needed the money to do this crap. Denzel Washington must have been loud. Little in the plot makes any sense. And the end. For a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would think of this garbage. If you have not found out yet, I did not like it. And if it had not been for all the pro comments, I would not have bothered to post.
