Well, what can be said about this disaster? I watched because it aired on the cable. I'm sorry to waste time, but at least I did not waste money. <br /> <br /> The creature is the most cheesy you can get! Please, you need to be very generous not to get annoyed with the CHEAP Halloween costume. Oh well, there are also horrible performance shows, f / x and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is unbelievable, you can not have a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst you can get from direct movies to videos. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PICTURES look like "Halloween." <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, please. The only "positive" thing about this rubbish is the sexy women.
