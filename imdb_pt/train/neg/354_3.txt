Look closely at the wonderful array of talents gathered to make this movie: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, even special guest appearances by Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. They prove, in a nutshell, the saying that a good cast can not save a bad script. The plot requires so many leaps of faith from the public that its implausibility should have exceeded even Hollywood standards. It is not particularly original, and the "twists" are downright cruel.
