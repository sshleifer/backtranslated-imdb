This could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not see how this could be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? it's more like a heavy drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT, but since there were no scary situations, the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for day-to-day activities like dumping a bin or going down stairs. the film had a lot of potential. they had beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed the writers thought you already knew them. they would go through peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue as to what they meant. This is simply one of those movies that says about one thing and something totally different.
