First, let me say that I'm not a fan of Dukes, but after that movie the series looked like Law and Order. The worst was the cast of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not the Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, If they ever attended the show, Roscoe was not a tough cop. He was more of a Barney Fife than the role he played in this film. <br /> <br /> The movie is loaded with the usual mistakes, cars being ripped, and it continues as if nothing had happened. The worst example of this is when the General joins Billy Prickett, and the General rushes to a hill of land, obviously slowing to a near halt, but continues to win the race.
