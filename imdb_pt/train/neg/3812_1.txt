Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Because? Because all the characters are so annoying that it is impossible to bear. The best character is Joey, even he's pretty annoying occasionally. - That DJ girl, who wrote your character? I want to kill myself every time she talks. to mention when Danny starts with his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ earned about ten thousand dollars or more in the casino.However, she is not eighteen so she should not play according to law.However, the casino was ready to pay her money, but then Danny, her father cought her and do not let her raise that money because she is not eighteen. Oh, come on, give me a break, will you? Since I saw that stupid and childish scene instantly turned off the television. Something they say in this series not even a child bought. Who in the world could think that Full House is fun and funny? Every word they say in this series seems like Shakespeare wrote Except that Shakespeare knew how to write and except that he would not be childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for Full House! <br /> <br /> For everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any desire for life or any sense of the real world, I highly recommend 'Do not see the Full House'! episode as a try. Avoid this series. Avoid your own stupidity and absurdity. This is the worst television show of all time! I'd rather watch Teletubbies. "Do not watch it."
