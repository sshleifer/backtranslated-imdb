Having grown up in Texas and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can say that this film is nauseating. Most Texans do not live like this movie indicates. The plot is weak, and the false accents are fun, and reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinkers, honky-tonkin ', rednecks. The horrible false Texas accent is what kills for me. It is true that there is a certain Texan accent in most Texan accents, but these people exaggerate. You can not get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just does not work. John Travolta should have stayed in the disco dance or in the 50's. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than as Texan.
