This movie has a very simple plot, but somehow very bad. The whole movie is about a girl being sucked in by a gate to another dimension and years later she is opened again by a witch while a group of friends (including the main actor who is having trouble overcoming her ex-girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with their new partner ... another girl ... it's true they're lesbians and there's some nudity, of course, for no specific reason). Unfortunately devil follows the now adult girl back. Unfortunately, none of this is explained. Where exactly were they? Where did the devil come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator-type outfit? The acting is terrible, I think, but it's hard to say because the writing is so bad that there might not be anything they could do with it. I gave three because the wrestler was very good and the effects were a lot of fun, even though they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not bad enough to be funny.
