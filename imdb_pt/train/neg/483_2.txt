I did not think the French could make a bad movie, but I was clearly very wrong. As has been said, this film essentially uses its title as a starting point; your portrait of your life and person has little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible - pretentious, flamboyant and insipid - and its rewriting of the facts is extraordinarily offensive, even in a genre that often makes a living by distorting, rather than retelling, the story. . Along with a fairly decent backdrop, the physical charms of Valentina Cervi are the main asset of this film, and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too; they do not waste time inventing various "erotic" sequences that have much more to do with excitement than with plot or character development. Unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a beautiful girl in a state of sexual excitement feigned can not, and does not support, this movie. The performance is not worthy of note and the score is very generic, despite one or two interesting chords. Cinematography is good, and there are some beautiful colors, but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s surreal movie than a fantasy drama. Anyway, the script leaves the camera a long time in the body of Artemisia, and very rarely in his paintings. <br /> <br /> All said, an almost complete failure. It's not smart or good enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and pretentious to work like softcore porn. So the French can fail, after all!
