What happened? 'Doubt' had so much potential to be a brilliant movie - but instead he faltered with a drawn-out, simplistic plot that made me want to stop watching. The only thing the film had was the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who did not deserve the Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of her best performances, she still gave us a solid, true character that blossomed across the screen. <br /> <br /> However, not even the brightness of a screen legend could save this movie from going away. I look down. From the boring beginning, which had no strength or impact - to the end nothing compelling, the film was really a disappointment - especially because it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film that dragged on for a long time with lots of talk and little action. <br /> <br /> In addition, the other Oscar nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was not worthy of an Oscar. (Especially because they completely left out performances like Will Smith in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as if it were one side and simple. It would have made sense to nominate her for a Razzie, since I'm sure she would have been victorious. Viola Davis did a short but true performance, but the length of her performance made me wonder if the gym really should have given her the indication. <br /> <br /> Overall, I consider Doubt one of the most disappointing films. It was a mess of a movie with so much potential, and I do not recommend it. The only bright light in the film is Meryl Streep, who despite giving an impressive and solid performance - does not do enough to save this movie. *** / 10.
