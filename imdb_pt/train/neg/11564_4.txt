Italian horror / suspense movie about a rich English lord who walks pubs and taverns for red-haired girls like his late wife Evelyn. You know he must have really loved his wife because he brings them to his house - a huge rotten castle - and makes them undress and then torture, whip and kill them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow, at the end of the film, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the hero of the film. Anyway, soon, under the advice of his uncle playboy Roberto Maldera, De Teffe establishes himself with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. She moves in and strange things begin to happen with De Teffe's fragile state of mind. He gets to see and hear his dead wife and finally just look at the title if you're still curious. In addition, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agatha (it seems she may be younger than De Teffe and have her in a wheelchair and try to look old) finds her destiny in a sexy way. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And, of course, there is a whole explanation as to why Evelyn did what he did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some things reasonably well: the film's settings are well suited for this film, though trying to make us believe that England is ridiculous at best. None of the actors looks English. Many with dark black hair, Mediterranean complexion and wearing an Englishman's clothes would not be caught dead. Cars drive on the wrong side of the road. But despite that, the crypt scene was actually filmed and I also liked the tacky resolution. And of course any movie with the sexy Erika Blanc is always an advantage. There is a trace of sexual perversion; however, I found it rather shocking to think that torturing women was too good and healthy to relieve one of their mental demons. Come on.
