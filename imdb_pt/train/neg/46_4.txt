I have been looking for this movie for a long time, because it is very rare to find out how it was one of the ills of the video. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year, it's a low budget movie. The story takes place around the Amazonian tribes who live in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while working in South America. They take her to the forest. Laura is protected by some ridiculous native who calls herself "The Devil," she has to leave all unpleasant things until they are happy. Maidens are chained. The devil demonstrates to eat meat in a horrible way. Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes to the jungle to try to rescue her,
