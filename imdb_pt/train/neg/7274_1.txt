"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is simply the worst movie of all time, much more pitiful than the inept "Plan 9 from Outer Space". <br /> <br /> The film Lampoon is told in three segments, each supposedly a parody of a genre of conventional film, but each one landing at our feet with a thud. There is no rhyme or reason for these execrable vignettes, and there are no discernible history lines. <br /> <br /> Another critic of this site wrote that the only good points about the movie are the nudity scenes. It's true that Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry show a little meat, and it's pretty good too. But the directors do not seem to realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is none of this here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is the last, with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see Benson as an ambitious young cop being accompanied by a cynical veteran played by Widmark. And for just a moment, those of us who still watch this hateful cinematic exercise are encouraged by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive story about how the young, idealistic cop brings a cleansing change in the veteran's approach to police work. But without such luck. As we said, this movie has no redeeming values. It is falling sick all the way to the final fading - which, perversely, is stretched for longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently the filmmakers knew they had a bad thing and wanted to make the most of it.
