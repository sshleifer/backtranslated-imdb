Way to go ace! You have just made a scary and grossly intriguing story of a necrophilic cannibal in a soft and gentle drama. Obviously, a movie called Dahmer would be one of two types: Horror, or documentary, right? This was neither. It was not near any detailed detail (in fact, hardly any substance). It was not morbid or scary, nor did it try to be very disturbing (as if you had to try !!) What the hell was this writer / director thinking? Here's one of the most REAL examples of serial sick killers of all time and we get seriously injured, grumpy rapes with bar roofies and long monotonous flashbacks for a time alone at their old parents' home. I think Jacobson was really trying to present (or invent) 'the soft side' of j.Dahmer.
