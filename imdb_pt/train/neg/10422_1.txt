In the first place, I'm not easily scared ... Anything except for my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely horrible. This is not appropriate for children! I was open-mouthed all the time, it just shocked me. I could not believe how bloody it was for a children's movie, bunnies being brutally murdered! It's just unnecessary to be so horrible and be rated G. I recommend being over 8 to see this. But do not get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I did not have mental scars as a child. I can not believe a parent would allow, let's say, a 4-year-old to watch it. It is only for intense and complicated, not to forget bloody, for small children. I am more than 4 and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
