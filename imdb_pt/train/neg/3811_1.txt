I hated this crap, every Friday as part of the tgif I was in, and consistently wasted a lot of time with stupidity every week. If you want to see something funny, go watch "No On Would Tell" starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really hilarious, it shows exactly why no one ever goes to a good movie career after making a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate these kids, and Bob Saget needs to jump off a bridge to always do that crap. I've seen fun things everywhere, except here. I'm writing 10 lines! Watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in terms of arts and entertainment.
