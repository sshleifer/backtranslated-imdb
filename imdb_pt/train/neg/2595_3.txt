You're kidding, that was awful! <br /> <br /> But even though I gave this film and 3 others, they were all on DVD. The film starts practically like an OK movie, but descends from the middle onwards. <br /> <br /> And the end well, let's just say it was one of the most anti-climatic finals in recent movie history. A lot in the final sequence and if you like a dose of terror, then this is the movie for you .... <br /> <br /> 3/10
