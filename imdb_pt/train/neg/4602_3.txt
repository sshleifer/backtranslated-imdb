A film without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a mafioso for money. Then they cross him. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the dead man's wife and, without her knowing he is the murderer, goes to live with her. Then he "accidentally" kills her when she finds out. Then, in a kind of WALKING TALL heroism, he takes revenge on the mafiosi who crossed him. The first problem is that, by agreeing to take the murder by designation of rent, the wanderer loses all sense of sympathy, dignity, and heroism. We can not accept anything good from it, and as a result, the rest of the world has no moral center. We just can not care less about that kind of face. And the wife (well-played by the handsome Kari Wuhrer - the sheriff of OIGHT LEGGED FREAKS), a high-class lady who runs a homeless mission, likewise loses a degree of sympathy for going to bed with the homeless wanderer her state evidently weakened after her husband's death). And when does she find out he's the guy? what does she do? She locks it in the house (as if ALL the houses have locks that you can not open from inside) with her and proceed to reprimand him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is fantastic in a role as a stout thug. Director Stuart Gordon did a lot better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
