The five or so really good westerns that Mann did are unequaled as a set in Hollywood. Even John Ford has never done so many with such quality. The curious thing about all of them is how unequal they are. My Darling Clementine from Ford is worth about two and a half years from any of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> Their real hero besides Mann and Stewart is Chase. Chase being responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote far country, bend the river and probably some others. But none of them are as finished as My Darling Clementine, but very few films, Western or otherwise are. <br /> <br /> Each of Mann's five films has big gaps, or six, let's see. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73 and yes, six, Naked Spur. Each one has a magnificent scene after a magnificent scene, with rather glaring lapses. However, so does Red River, which is still the only major western ever made. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But the far country has huge huge holes. It's annoying and only comes to life when Stewart and Mc Entire are barking hoots. The rest is quite pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. Mann's camera is a course of a man in cinematography. It's as good an eye as anyone who's been behind a moving film strip. You're hardly ever in the wrong place, ever. <br /> <br /> Far Far Country has an incredible time. And as usual, it comes from Stewart. No one in the history of the cinema received physical punishment with that man's authority. He is absolutely incredible: look at him in Bend, Far, Winchester and Man de Laramie: in Bend he was beaten and hung by a string so convincingly and with such boiling hatred that he looks like someone dislocated from Dachau, in Far he is shot from a raft with such violence, it seems so convincing that you shudder, and of course when he is dragged by the fire in Man, you find yourself looking for the marks of burns. What an actor Not to mention the moment in Winchester when he is beaten at the beginning of the hotel room, too, as well as someone else already did it. <br /> <br /> But that was Mann's territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting Jack Lord in Man of the West. As painful as any fight scene ever recorded. Cooper, though not as convincing as Stewart, is somewhat similar to looking exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, no one but anyone ever showed the human being in extremis, as did Mann. That's great, great director. <br /> <br /> See every western he has ever done. They are your real monuments, even if they are all grumpy. But so what. When he starts roaring with his big scenes, they're as good as anyone, including Ford. And his six westerns as a set are the best ever made by anyone, period. Thank you, Anthony.
