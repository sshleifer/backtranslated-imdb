Wow, what a fucking movie that was! I can not understand what people find so scary about "The Grudge". The director plays a trick (I have to admit a very good one, which is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a result, I got scared a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but as soon as I found out about the routine, I practically fell asleep, while the Scream became more and more predictable by the minute. To conclude, I can say that there are much better films in the genre to begin with, that the so-called "The Ring" predecessor was much more frightening and that buying a ticket to "The Scream" is a waste of money.
