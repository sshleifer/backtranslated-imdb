I admit. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and made it a mission to see all the movies she's been in (unfortunately that includes the horrible movies Batman and Robin, The Avengers) and the one here. <br /> This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes, it ranks even lower than The Avengers). everyone seems lost and is incoherent beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Even if you think Uma is a goddess like me, PLEASE DO NOT submit to this movie. you'll hate yourself the next morning for it.
