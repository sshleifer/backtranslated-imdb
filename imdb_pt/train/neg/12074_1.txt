Ridiculous horror movie about a rich man (John Carradine) dying and leaving everything to his four children, and his servants to be equally divided. One condition - they must spend a week at their property to get the money. And if one of them dies, the others earn more. Guess what happens next ... <br /> <br /> I saw a new impression of this movie on the cable. The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself was beautiful. It's about all the good things I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Let's list just a few of the problems that this movie has: the killer is blatantly obvious; the servants are called Igor and Elga - come on! part of the sound recording was so bad that I could not understand the dialogue (no big losses, I'm sure); the blood was scarce and very badly made; the other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible and this movie contains a truly abominable performance - so bad that you just stare at the screen unbelievably. Even Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only reasonably good performance was from the troupe Faith Domergue (who deserved more than that) and John Carradine (who seems painfully old and fragile here). I have to admit - the closing phrase in this movie is a gem! <br /> <br /> Why this was renamed "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there is another 1978 horror film with that name! <br /> Whatever the name, it's a bad movie. To be avoided at all costs.
