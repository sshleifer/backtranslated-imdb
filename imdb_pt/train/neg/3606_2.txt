This movie is the worst movie, but it's too loud for me. It's like a horror movie should be. It happens in a university where there seem to be only a handful of students. Teachers are dumber than a bag of hammers. It is full of good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so clich√© that it's hard to believe I was able to predict lines in quotation marks. The cuts have some creativity and seem to spin around stabbing people in the genitals. The lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for a fun time. Get a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch and laugh.
