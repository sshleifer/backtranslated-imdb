The Stunt Course is even worse than the typical white corporate evil capitalist movie of the week. This movie is less enjoyable than a toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good at his underrated debut film, The Silverbears, in which he gives a performance consist of the requirements of his character. This movie is so bad that the character of Leno, a hypocrite clown, is less annoying than the character of Morita, a hypocritical fool.
