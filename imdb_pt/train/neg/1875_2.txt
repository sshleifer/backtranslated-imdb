First off, I really loved Henry Fool, which puts me in a small amount of movie goers. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this movie was a total sham. Watching Hartley and the actors talking about the movie in the extras - so full of pride and making useless analogies with Star Wars - was twisting the stomach. That was hype on the part of producers (HDNET) realized to the maximum. A true example of the emperor and his new clothes. Mostly I feel that Hal has ruined HENRY FOOL forever. I do not think I can see him again in his pure and innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember, Hal, you can ENGAGE some people a few times ... The director would not be anywhere. today, if all he did was produce meaningless junk. Unfortunately, it is a neat example of the lesson taught in the film ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, or your box office hopes are really weak. It does not matter a decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to act in a straitjacket. <br /> <br /> The result, I believe, of Hartley, is insipid. With drum beats walking through the whole dialogue. There was an Apple Soundtrack loop that I recognized gave me a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they're just trying to win over a new audience. But it really is this ridiculous ride. I would be happy to ruin this movie for you, but it has been done. It's rotten. The FOOL franchise is dead. Long live the Henry Fool.
