The biggest one that bothers me is that they say that Zues uses the DUTCH commands. But she's speaking German to him. The 2 languishes are completely different, it's like saying "well, he takes French commands" and starts speaking Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi adds a sense of being a comedy actor, not a detective at all. The paper simply does not suit him, even if it becomes a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many stereotypes / predictable things. Typical comments or returns. <br /> <br /> If you do not look at these things, I think it could be a good movie to watch if you're on TV. But I would not suggest renting it.
