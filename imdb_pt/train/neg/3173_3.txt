This movie is similar to the game titled 'Blithe Spirit' written by Noel Coward. The plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to Coward's writing. I am surprised that films of this nature do not recognize the concept of the original writer. I realize that the public may not be aware that this is an imitation, but it is. <br /> <br /> Sad. These films are so expensive to produce. I was encouraged when a script is original. I even encouraged myself when it's an innovative way to produce a work that was released earlier. There were a few samples mentioned (like Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I am not satisfied when the taste of the public is taken for granted. In this situation, the taste of the public is neglected. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the best production of movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> In this case. I'd rather see the play.
