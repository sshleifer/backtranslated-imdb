You know the story..Pretty kids alone in the woods, when BAM! Something starts to cut them. <br /> <br /> Well, that crap is no different. A bunch of kids back to a hut where the male takes a twin. His brother disappeared for years before. Suddenly, a "UNKOWN CREATURE" starred, and his only help is a doctor / motorcyclist. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie was bad is a euphemism, it sucks! The acting was horrible. The creature looked very tacky. And like all the movies they do today, they try to get you done, which they do not! <br /> <br /> There's a bright spot on this LOST star, Maggie Grace, as the female lead.
