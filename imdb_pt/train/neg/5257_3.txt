For a "horror" movie made for TV, the film started very interesting. I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the movie. But the ending was a total disappointment. The movie was going fast and was built up, it seemed anyway, for a very climactic ending. But guess what there is no end. The film was over and after almost an hour and a half the audience just wondered what happened. Why did all the unanswered questions in the movie go unanswered? There was no explanation on any of the key points of the plot. This movie is like watching a murder mystery and then never figuring out who did it. Very dissapointed. This movie looks like the producers ran out of money and never completed the movie. A real bomb!
