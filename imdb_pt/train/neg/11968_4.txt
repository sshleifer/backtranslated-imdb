This is just typical Bruce Willis, schtick action movie. Watch with popcorn and your friends. Rent it, to save money. <br /> <br /> None of this is realistic. The battles are not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. The victims are not realistic. And why was Tom Skerritt's character talking to Willis of DECK OF THE CARRIER? What is up with that? Can not he do it from inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. gets a machete sore. There are a lot of medium bursts. <br /> <br /> If this film accurately represents the Navy SEALS, then do not get stuck in Africa hoping they will come and save you! <br /> <br /> The noble attack on the village bothered me the most. "Seats in the first row for ethnic cleansing" ... while Bruce watches the slaughter taking place in town. So, what does he do? He crawls into town on his belly. Yes. How many died while they were in putrefaction? Oh well ... a body count was needed, I guess. <br /> <br /> And if that African guy was so important, why did not he take the helicopter with the elderly and the children? Can he say "Duh?" <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie was very dark. Not just in the plot, but a lot happens at night, it was difficult to understand what was happening. <br /> <br /> Rent it.
