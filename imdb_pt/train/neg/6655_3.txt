The only redeeming quality of this exaggerated melodrama is the setting in southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song. Stephanie Powers is miscast and betrayed by a false accent. As has been said, is she too old to play an 18-year-old girl and look as young as a grandmother with a college granddaughter? Lee Remick is good, although she is also eternal in her later years. Talented Joanna Lumley is underused and can also look young forever when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Do not know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal? The most reliable performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs. This makes gullibility that the handsome, masculine suitors of this epic would remain single while patiently awaiting the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them. Can anyone believe that the beautiful Robert Urich would remain single for decades hoping that Stephanie Powers would finally accept their endless marriage proposals? The engagement of World War II between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is laughable. To begin with, the Germans did not occupy the section of Provence from France until the end of the war, it was controlled by the French puppet government of Vichy. We see the French resistance staging an invasion of daylight in Mistral's mansion to steal sheets, after which all sit under a bridge waiting for a heavy load of Nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them? If you want to see a well-acted miniseries in a foreign country, do not watch Mistral's Daughter. A much better alternative would be The Thorn Birds.
