Recently, I was online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In his long list of movies was this movie and I thought I should be hallucinating with such an offensive title and premise. But no, that's really what it was. And since the film had only 27 minutes, I decided to give it a try. If it had ended up being some porn movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team tried, on a budget of about $ 49, to make a Star Trek movie about a crew of very gay men traveling through the galaxy, ending the female oppression killing all women - as they did in the Earth! And in every case, they were greeted with applause and thanks from the now gay men of the planet. <br /> <br /> Subtle, this is not. With some of the most obscene and juvenile character names I've ever heard, I do not even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review removed! However, despite the absolute crappiness of everything, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. But, as I have already mentioned, due to raw names and strange matters (although there is no nudity), it is an adult-only movie. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this movie left me with 1001 questions about WHO would do this, WHY do it and WHO was the target audience?! It may not be the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the strangest and possibly the most offensive!
