I grew up watching and loving TNG. I just finished watching the entire ST Voyager series on DVD, which may have increased my feeling of disgust with this episode, since the difference in style and approach between the two shows could not be more glaring. The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, which is how he would probably have been treated in VOY. They could have characterized memories that would be "new" to the audience, rather than simply regurgitate old show clips. The transitions between the "memories" and the "gifts" in this episode begin as a clich√© at the beginning, and quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears out. Bar no worse episode ever.
