From the point of view of plot and motion, this movie was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in the theater hoping this would end and I relieved after 80 long minutes that mercifully happened. Basically, five characters appear in the film, A Son & Father, the son's girlfriend, and two male characters of the child's age who appear and disappear without context or explanation. The movie and the scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but in fact nothing ever happened to reveal this in one way or another. There were some brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, his son's girlfriend appears in a window outside his bedroom and they engage in a strange conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible seduction to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was "older." End of story.
