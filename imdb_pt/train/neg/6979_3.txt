I watched this movie too, and although this is very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and I would not recommend it to women who have small children ... The terror on this mother's face when she sees her son about to be run over by a The train is truly bleak. And the sad thing is that internally she dies. Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains. All the money in the world she makes dolls does not hide the pain she has. I remember her desperate face as she took money from her clothes to try to heal her son. It surprises me that this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it I thought people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was also a way for the poor of the mountains.
