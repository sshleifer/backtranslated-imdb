Simply put, this is a simplistic, one-dimensional film. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that this is not going to try to be something deep or do much with the character of Hitler. Instead, from the first minutes of the film in which we see baby Hitler looking like an evil with the song barely touching the background, we have a vision of Hitler presenting him as a caricatured supervillain, apparently ripped from a TV show on the morning of Saturday. The film REALLY wants to argue that Hitler was bad, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? Ultimately, making him such a unidimensionally maleficent character is both tedious and confusing (one must ask how the inept and opioid character of the movie persuades a nation to follow him or be elected the man of the Year of Time). This movie had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrific acts of the 20th century, and tries to plunge into his mind. Instead, he basically just says, "Hey, Hitler was mean, I just thought you'd like to know ..." over and over again. The great irony is that the film was still attacked for presenting a very nice view of the character. Give me some time.
