James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a 'mental illness center' for a medical residency mission with Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There, he notices that many inmates are being killed by 'The Ripper', who takes their souls to the devil in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and stupid that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when the character of Helen, James Bishop's blonde fiancee arrives at the asylum, that it is almost unbelievable that a writer has had the courage to include them in a script. And James's return to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients? And the cast, made up of actors and actresses of ham? Honestly, I do not know what or who is the worst in this movie: the script, the director or the cast. The correct answer certainly is all of them. I've seen this movie on cable television, and I'm surprised how a producer can spend money on such trash. This horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurdity of the plot. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Devil '(` Devil')
