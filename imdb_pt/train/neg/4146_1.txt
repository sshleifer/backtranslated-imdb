After watching this thing, after reading the summary on the back of the DVD, then thinking about the actual movie ... I got a little dizzy. I thought, maybe I've fallen asleep and dreamed that I was a baby with down syndrome waltzing through an endless forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no other purpose then occasionally the bad taste of lesbianism . Where (zombies?) Come out of nowhere and (vampires?) Who (seduce) pure citizens of heart on their way to save the world. Neither zombies nor vampires remarkably meet. The only fight I remember was taking the knickers off the Bonny Giroux walrus. Coo Coo ca FAT! All of them! Maybe because we were seeing the widescreen stretched and too lazy to change it to its native resolution, but that really made it more fun ... In conclusion, my thought thesis had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter. matter, and then acting the whole of this film. This made Bloodrayne look like Citizen F *** ING KANE
