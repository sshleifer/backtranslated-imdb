Birthday girl does not know what she wants to be - it's a comedy, it's a drama ... she just does not know. What could have been a very funny or moving film ends up in no man's land. The premise is original enough to have secured a script full of interesting scenarios, but hardly anybody delivers and ends up running out. This is a shame if you look at the cast - it's very solid all the time, but they do not stand a chance to shine. Very disappointing.
