Michael Keaton has never been a good actor; in the films of Tim Burton Batman he always falls in the shadows of his great villains. Here he stars as a widowed husband who picks up radio frequencies that look like dead people trying to make contact with the living ... Well, this is supposed to be a very shocking thriller but it really misses from every point that's shocking you. Because there are many things that end up unexplained, unknown and uninteresting. So where's the shocking excitement when it all starts to be such a bad movie that, in the first place, WHITE NOISE plays the fool? Really bad acting and horrifyingly edited, this movie is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton tries to make a return of thriller, but ends up losing the target more than ever.
