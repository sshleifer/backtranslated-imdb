Everything about this movie was terrible. To start with, this movie had a very good cast and I find it impossible to cast such a big cast in the biggest disaster of the gangster movies genre of all time. The soundtrack was like one of a very bad comedy. He had this song all through the movie and started to get pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BE INFLATED WITH THIS DISASTER, YOU WILL BE JUST INJURED.
