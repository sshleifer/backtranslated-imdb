"Horrible People" should be the subtitle of this horrible movie. If you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things, then look out your window in real life. But if you want to see nasty people doing boring things, you'll have to watch this horrible Mike Leigh movie. The characters speak at length but can never communicate with each other. Why not? Presumably because Leigh stuff we all are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and he wants to film real life. But we are not, and he failed.
