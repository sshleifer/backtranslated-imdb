Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish from a movie. To begin with, the script was definitely written to be turned into a B movie, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to rise from the television) and Hutton (looking for the "two" of a "one-two punch") . he hoped he would define his career after "Ordinary People") became attached to the image. Cheese lines, big bad wipes from scene to scene (Come on - who wears wipes after 12th grade Telecommunications class?), And just the old bad acting sinks that movie. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad plague of this movie. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material. I must admit to feeling Duchovny's pain as he reads the lines that are the narration. While watching me laugh when I'm sure the director wanted me to be terrified, nothing prepared me for the final line of Duchonvey's voice: "If you need a doctor, call 911." If only the studio had called 911, this dog from a movie would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
