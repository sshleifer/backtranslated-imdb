If you do not mind having your emotions joked then you will not mind this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy British crime mysteries, following clues and seeing how they all logically fit in the end, you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to this deception: <br /> <br /> While police use CCTV cameras early to gather clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the sight of children just before his disappearance is not caught in Camera. This is a critical part of the mystery. It is inconsistent to have the car that the kids were stuck in the camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. <br /> <br /> * The film goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking. Children's movements, but miss the opportunity to use the same sophisticated equipment, are tracking vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from locations visible through crime scene cameras as part of developing lanes. <br /> <br /> * In England, driving is on the left. The director does everything to get the car in the crime scene park to the right, several yards from the flower kiosk, when he could have parked immediately behind or even beside; as the huge truck did. The police's forensic team is so meticulous as to find a cell phone dropped in a sewer several miles from the crime scene but finds no evidence of blood. of the head trauma at the scene of the crime, although they had achieved the scene hours after the disappearance and without intermediate rains. <br /> <br /> * Search dogs were not used to find missing children; that of the country that is well known for developing the hunting dog for hunting and hunting. <br /> <br /> It is illogical that such highly publicized news does not point to the presumably innocent truck driver who stopped at the Flower Kiosk. <br /> <br /> It is illogical for the mother to go to such extremes and spend so much effort to leave tracks of carpet fibers under her nails for her murder investigators, even persuading her daughter to do the same. even though she simply could not have left the mobile home unguarded. If she had the good sense to ask her daughter to put carpet fibers under her fingernails, she could easily ask her daughter to ask for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The suspect who kidnapped the girl was portrayed as mentally slow / moody-justifying her mother's unconscious drowning? but he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self-incriminate. <br /> <br /> There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a real disappointment of the detective's aficionado. 'Five Days' is a very weak British crime story.
