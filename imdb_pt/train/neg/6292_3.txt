I wonder how much this movie actually has to do with the 1984 movie "Bachelor Party" starring Tom Hanks. Is this movie really an official sequel? This movie is missing in every department and obviously it is best not to watch it. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this movie is simply not good or funny enough. It's based mostly on the character's stereotypical ratings; instead, the movie really does present some good, original and funny moments. <br /> Of course there is also very little present history and bare chest of the film than the pages of the script. You just keep hoping that things finally begin. There is a main plot somewhere, but this one is so unoriginal and performed so poorly in the movie that it seems more something non-existent. I think there's even a message and a moral story somewhere, but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it just does not work out. <br /> <br /> It's basically a typical teen comedy, with lots of sex jokes and nudity, just without the main teen characters, which makes the story even sadder and tasteless. The film makes some really bad jokes, which are poorly placed for any kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I regret having seen this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
