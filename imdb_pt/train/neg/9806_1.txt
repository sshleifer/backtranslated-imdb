I can not, for my life, explain what is the popularity of the children's television program, power rangers. <br /> <br /> I never understood why innocent children liked this show in the first place, since the characters look so dumb and not worth worrying about. <br /> <br /> The costumes look quite atrocious, like the multicolored spandex that people use to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the purpose of this article? show anyway, but for children to learn to fight to solve their problems? What about the horrible haircuts and clothes in this show? Not to mention that this show is still playing on cable TV, just to make money to teach kids to fight each other when they disagree on a particular problem. <br /> <br /> There is much better entertainment for kids today, hopefully they are not naive like the kids of the 90's who attended this show. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what is the homo erotic tension between the red and green guards?
