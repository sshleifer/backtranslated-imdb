I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but I could not sit down with this putrid piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was intended as erotic, even to the soundtrack of pornography. There was no glance at what made Dahmer work, no exploration of who his victims were. Nothing but "See how scary this guy is." And I have to give the filmmakers so much - their Dahmer is the scariest thing ever to disgrace the screen.
