Sogo Ishii may be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a descendant of the Genji clan. Cinema has the main features of low-budget production, including blinking fight scenes and clumsy mounts (the type you can find in an underproduced drama). Benkei monk informs his spiritual teacher that his fate is to defeat the mysterious spirit guarding Gojoe's bridge at night, but he does not realize that this decision will bring him into direct conflict with almost all elements of society at that time - but that he could gain him enlightenment. <br /> <br /> There is no lack of ambition, however, in his depiction of the conflict between the sacred and the mundane. The artistic flourishing in some of the photographs and issues helps to compensate for the style of film production. <br /> <br /> A disappointment.
