There were some interesting Polish documentaries about worm breeding in brail_ !! The competition (worm farming) had a better plot and more interesting characters. I was physically sick after watching this movie. The traitor husband (I think dougray_scott_) was a joke in all the meanings of the word. Poor Jennifer must really need the work and what there was with the accent! Random locations and meetings reminded me of a high school joke, and showed the humility of a 10-year-old in cooking class. It was so bad that I think I'm going to write the sequence called "this is not a laxist". Thank you for listening was a great burden of my conscience.
