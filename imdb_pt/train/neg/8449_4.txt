that absurd history, murder blackmail, child sex allegations, gays and the catholic church ... absolute gut. How is it that most UK-based TV dramas, sitcoms etc have to include the mandatory Gay, it's really getting tiresome now. Everyone accepts that there are gay people in society, but there are other minority groups, but we do not want her to shake our throats (I'll pass this on) at each show. In addition to the above, the drama was of what could have been a little interesting story in a pantomime, the priest was a pedophile and there are gays running everywhere, oh yeah, to be totally one of the gay couples was black. I'm amazed at the ecclestone even by contemplating this when he read the script.
