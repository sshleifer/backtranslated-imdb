Manga drama about a glamorous model (Margaux Hemingway) who is raped by a nerdy but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon) - to whom she was introduced by her younger sister (played by real life brother Mariel), whose music teacher he is . While the central action of the court maintains the attention - largely thanks to a performance by Anne Bancroft as Hemingway's lawyer - the film is often merely brilliant but also dramatically unconvincing: the jury takes ostensibly the side of the musician because: sensual of her profession and b) offered no resistance to the alleged assailant when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together. What the f ***? she was clearly bound - what resistance could she realistically offer? <br /> <br /> The second half of the film - involving Sarandon's sister rape, curiously anticipating IRREVERSIBLE (2002) in a tunnel - is a bit contrived: Mariel's character should know better than to trust Sarandon after what he did to his sister, but Margaux herself stupidly reproaches the line of work that indirectly took her humiliating experience almost immediately! The climax - in which Sarandon gets his fair desserts, with Margaux suddenly becoming a fearless, resourceful vigilante - is nevertheless a pleasure to the multitudes in the style of Death Wish (1974); in fact, the ubiquitous Italian film magnate Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting how the two Hemingway sisters took very different turns (it was the film's premiere of both): Margaux's career never took him away (despite his undeniable good looks and commendable participation here) - while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen's MANHATTAN (1979), and curiously she would play a glamorous victim of violent violence as she rehearsed the role of real life. "Playboy", centerfold Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosse's STAR 80 (1983). With the added pressure of some failed marriages, Margaux took refuge in alcohol and eventually died of a drug overdose in 1996; frighteningly, the Hemingway family had a history of suicide - notably the sisters' grandfather, celebrated author Ernest, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1961.
