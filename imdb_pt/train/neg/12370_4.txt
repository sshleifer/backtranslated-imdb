They probably should have called this movie from The Map, because most of the stupid movie is rotated around a map of a graveyard. Not to mention how many of the same boring map images exist. The only thing they show more than the map itself is the little drops of sweat that are constantly piling up on the forehead of our main character. Of course this was the way the filmmakers would show us how the incredibly tense things are rising up in the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on now, could not you have just shown us one of the death scenes? We hear so much about how everyone listed on the map is falling like flies, but we can not see anything. Some as I bury life manged to keep my attention so I was quite generous with the rating I gave, but I will not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat, I recommend renting a movie that I best, as I spit in your grave or I drink your blood.
