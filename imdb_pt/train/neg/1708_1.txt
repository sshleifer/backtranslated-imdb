OK, I do not really have much to say about this movie besides: I've seen more than 4,000 movies in my life, and over 2,300 of them were horror movies. Although I have some difficulty in deciding which one is the best (unlike my favorite, which I can say is George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD), I can say without the slightest hesitation that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute . the worst horror movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There is simply nothing positive you can say about this movie. The acting, the dialogue, the direction, the makeup, the music ... Every aspect of this film is simply so below what is acceptable that I am surprised that this has been launched. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a complete horror or zombie horror expert, please pay attention to my warning and DO NOT waste your time with this crap. There is no pleasure in seeing this. You will not even laugh at the total ineptitude on display ... Trust me. Please.
