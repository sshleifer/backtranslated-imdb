The finale of Weissmuller Tarzan's films is quite weak. There are some things that make this movie unfeasible. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan passes much of the film using floppy sandals. In my opinion, any footwear on Tarzan, whether sandals or boots, as sometimes portrayed, takes away the character, who is supposedly anti-civilization and pro-jungle. <br /> <br /> Second, Benji's character, as mentioned in an earlier post, totally derails the movie as the comic book. For me, your character is unnecessary for the plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, while Weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure like Tarzan, it is evident that he was not at his best. Although in his later films of Jungle Jim, his physique has improved a little with this film. <br /> <br /> The octopus battle is a great idea, but I think it should have been made in an earlier Weissmuller movie when it was at its physical peak. Similarly, the battle, which takes only 30 seconds at most, would be far more exciting if it were dragged for 90 seconds to 2 minutes, like the classic battle of giant crocodiles in Tarzan and his companion. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are extremely pleasing to the eye, she can not save this latest Weissmuller movie - a disappointing end to a great character race.
