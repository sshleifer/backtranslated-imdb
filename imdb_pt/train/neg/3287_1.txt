If this movie should be renamed, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard." To summarize, this film is no more than 88 minutes of two immature country punks who accompany the famous 1968 Dodge Charger around town and country, chasing girls and evading the law. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of "Dukes" and what stains the film is that the characters are out of fashion. The excess of profanity, sexual references and drug use, made the good name of the "Dukes" in garbage trailer. <br /> <br /> Aside from comparing him to the television program, the acting was horrible. The only actor to work out was the famous 1969 Dodge Charger called General Lee. The others exaggerated the character's role, which tarnished the film. <br /> <br /> The "Dukes" were another victim of the TV transition tragedy for 21st Century cinema in Hollywood. Skip this movie and buy the TV series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My note: F
