This is perhaps the most scary display of Santa Claus ever committed to any media, be it a book, a photo or a movie. Santa looks like a pervert looking at the kids and the twisted history of bringing Merlin to help him defeat one of Satan's servants, Pitch, does not make things better. It's ridiculous to say the least, with bad effects, even by the standards of 1959. If a child watched this movie, he would have nightmares and would never wish for Santa to visit. They would have scars for life. Imagine the boy in "A Christmas Story" when they start yelling after being put on Santa's lap. This is how it would be if children saw this movie.
