The film crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so filming on the Israeli side dominated. I was struck by the almost completely opposite points of view of the mothers. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of deprivation and despair. With completely different points of view, any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of minds. The word "peace" does not have the same meaning for each of them. Peace to the Palestinian was freedom. The peace for the Israeli was security. With such an abyss, is this kind of movie really worth a lot? I finished with the feeling that I had witnessed useless propaganda - both sides were not convincing.
