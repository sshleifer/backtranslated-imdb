It seems evident from this adaptation that he did not. Not only did he leave the plot behind, he made his own! The things he chose to leave were so ridiculously unbelievable that I was glad he chose to leave out some of the more important parts of the novel. The plot was nebulous, inconsistent and agitated to say the least. I do not want to say anything of bad mood about the actors, but they can not act! Dickens is difficult, of course, but this is pathetic! Micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth-century Kramer, and the less you talk about Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, watch the wonderful BBC adaptation of 1999. As for the screenwriter, I think he read the Cliff Notes!
