I'm not sure what. I just could not laugh at it. I had an open mind. I did not want to be a tight-ass about it. But I seriously just could not laugh at this movie. It was not funny to me. Some parts seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard. Just because you put two very funny men together does not mean that this is going to be a great comedy. Some movies should not be made. This is one of them. Because it makes a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. At least. But I just was not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give anything smaller than a two. And that's all I'm giving. <br /> <br /> 2/10
