I'll keep it short, as I know I do not need to say too much. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a weird little movie that obviously attracts some, but I found it shockingly bland from almost the beginning. The film did very little to make any of the characters friendly and the story has sometimes become so complicated that I completely lost interest. Like I said, I know others liked it, but I thought Kitamura's "Alive" was anything but - a lame and extremely annoying drama, disguised as an action movie and sci-fi teaser. I felt like I had been sucked into watching this movie, based on its intriguing premise and super exciting cover art. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Move on to the funniest Kitamura game, "Versus," or your 2004 riot "Godzilla: Final Wars." <br /> <br /> And do not get me wrong, I'm always ready for a good movie of the thinking man, but it certainly was not. There was no time when I really cared about a single event that happened in this overly pragmatic, dialogue-filled film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
