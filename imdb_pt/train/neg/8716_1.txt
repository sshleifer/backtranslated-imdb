I do not know where to start; acting, special effects and writing are as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production team got to the point where they said, "Our work is ready, it's time to launch." I'm happy that the first two in the series never made it to the UK. I would really recommend watching this movie just so you can appreciate just how well most movies are. <br /> <br /> I do not know how any of the other IMDb users might find it scary when the "terrifying" dinosaurs girdle. Downstairs halls with rubber arms waving around.
