Sam Mraovich, we know you tried so hard. This is your magnum opus, a shining example for the rest of us that you certainly deserve to be nominated at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as you claim on its website in the 1998 era). It is better to be silent and to be considered a fool than to speak and remove all doubts. With Ben & Arthur, you do just that. <br /> <br /> Apparently mounted with a lack of education or education, the movie script guides us toward the truly bizarre with each new scene. It's that insane excuse of a story that may also be the best ally in the movie. Beginning tepidly, the homosexual characters, Ben and Arthur, try to marry, going so far as to cross the country to do so, in the shadow of the finest palms in Vermont. But, all this posture is merely a lead-in for BLOOD. Then more blood, and more and more blood. I mean, there must be at least $ 20 in fake blood makeup in the final third of this movie. <br /> <br /> The film in its entirety is a technical gaffe. From sound to editing to music, which consists of a single distorted bass note on a keyboard, it's a wonder the movie holds together on any media you view it on. It's a shame that some decent amateur performances are wasted here. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sam. I'm sure you've made five numbers in this movie in rents or whatever it is that takes poor souls (like me) to watch this movie. Unfortunately, we're not laughing at you.
