No reason to bother renting this movie. From the initial credits, I knew I was in trouble. <br /> <br /> It was filmed like it was a soft porn movie, but really there's nothing erotic about it. The look at the world of sex addiction is intriguing, but only to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> Dreadful sex scenes, bad plot and special appearances by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save this movie. .
