The supernatural and vengeful cop is back for a third installment, this time serving as guardian angel of an unfairly accused female police officer. Default stalk and slash, but well represented and directed, making it strangely interesting and watchable, although the violence is not to scruple (especially the court director who was originally given an "NC-17" rating). <Br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
