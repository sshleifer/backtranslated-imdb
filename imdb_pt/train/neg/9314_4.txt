Well ... overall, this movie was pretty much useless, and it's basically a horror movie that turned out to be more of a comedy. I just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a horror movie. This was definitely not what we were looking for, but it suited us for humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. And especially that Tracy girl whenever she's in the boardroom telling the clown to leave. They show almost no emotion and it is so obvious that they are acting. And also when the clown is looking through that black box thing and grabs Mark, he does not even seem to be scared even though the clown has grabbed him and started to attack him. And seriously, would you be just PLAYING if you were being chased? I'd be running for my life! (Even though someone could probably run more than the clown because he has 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects are not as good as whenever the clown cuts Susan's head in the woods, so whenever he throws his head on the board . room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise throws her head back. Also as in the previous guy's comment, the beginning makes absolutely no sense and I do not even see why it was included in the movie. So, what did this movie do in 2003? The music made it look like it was made in the 80's, and the camera-ing (?) Does not even look professional. Half the time, it looks like the camera can not stay stable when it's supposed to be. Overall, I have to say I enjoyed the movie. I do not recommend though, if you're trying to find something to scare him, but if you're looking for something to make fun or laugh, I'd recommend it for sure.
