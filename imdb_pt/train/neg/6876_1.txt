Yes, this was pure babbling patronizing unbelievable. We know that the French often have a distorted idea of ​​the US, they are Puritanism and visions of sex. As an American (hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, no element of the Midwestern city depicted in this film seemed real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years before his penis was too big? Where in the world would you find this? A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A city with perhaps 16 people less than two hours from Chicago, but without a large gas station, no televisions at home, no McDonalds, no children ... A population that knows the intimate details of each other but unites relentlessly like a big family that hates each other. Adult males plant cushions in the local cafeteria, have farms, but do not reap, kill the guy they do not like in front of everyone and seem to get away, and everyone with the same emotion? The liberated French girl who is going to have sex with the 17-year-old virgin boy because of his sexual generosity, the over-meat guy coming out of cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to help deflower this 17-year-old boy ? HELP! I am so perplexed and amazed at the absurdity of this film that I am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the first A-to-Z on what to avoid. Wow, I hope I have not spoiled everything for you!
