I saw this movie on a drive-in in 1959. Even "Howard the Duck" I considered this the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie tried to combine all genres in one; comedy, horror, teen angst and the hot rod that must have triggered "My Mother, The Car." It may merit a second preview to see if it is a precise reflection of your time.
