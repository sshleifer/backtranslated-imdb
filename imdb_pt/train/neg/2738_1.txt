Trash / bad movies are usually not bad because I'll find them fun. This is so bad that I'm speechless to describe it - it's down "bad". There is an instruction at the beginning of the movie that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the instruction and a dozen beer did not help me sit through the movie. A tagliner compares this to KILLBILL, which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our smart. Obviously. this tagliner had a plan to entice him to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of renting this, put it on the floor! If you are thinking of buying, do not think! If you do not have this DVD, do not throw it, throw it in the bin immediately.
