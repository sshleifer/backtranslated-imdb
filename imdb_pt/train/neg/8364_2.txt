I can see the guys doing budget preparation for this movie. "Well, let's see now, we spent 50% getting Dirk Benidict, because Galactic Battle Star and A-Team were cool. We spent 40% doing a Demon Costume, it does not matter that the Demon is intangible in the script. the rest making the movie. " This was very bad and very clich√© .... Have a loved one present while watching (or bring a good book)
