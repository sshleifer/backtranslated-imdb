Like most people, I love "A Christmas Story". I had never heard of this movie and maybe for good reason - it sucks. The same place, the same narrator, the same director, but lacked the warm imprecision of the original. Charles Grodin was a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can not imagine anyone being able to replace him. The story seems forced and does not have the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors, the Bumpus, is ridiculous. In "A Christmas Story," Ralphie's obsession with BB's gun sounds cute, but his obsession with this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the bully in the original neighborhood, is replaced in this film by another boy with keys and a weird hat, but with little of the threatening appeal of Scud Farkus. It would be very difficult to match the original, even if this film was made with the original team.
