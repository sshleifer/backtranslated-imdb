I've never watched a movie in such a short time. The only saving grace was the fast forward function on the DVD drive. It was like watching a badly produced CBC movie. Obviously there was no money for lighting, filming, scenery, location, writers, editors, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story! I need to write ten lines of comment ... Bad, horrible, horrible, miserable, harrowing, tortuous, bilious, cloying, disgusting, fromage, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, puke, stinky, smelly, vile, putrid, all I I do not know if I can continue to complete all ten lines of how bad this production piece was!
