My roommate rented this movie the other night, so we watched together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is really positive, because the whole film is filmed in this colorful, grainy and post-MTV texture. Quick sequences, cold angles, radical camera movements - at the moment you feel like you're about to watch another "Snatch" at the moment .... <br /> <br /> When the plot begins to unfold, start feeling as if an excess amphetamine was dosed. things just do not make sense anymore. I'd hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving certain scenes, but then again, the movie is so bad that you're actually better off not watching it. <br /> <br /> First you think it's a crime story told in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. WRONG. This conversation provides no coherent narrative. On the contrary, the Domino lesbian appears in the character of Lucy Liu during the second part of the film, which ends up leading the audience to more confusion. <br /> <br /> So I thought maybe it was a movie about a girl of tributaries. but dysfunctional background that grew to be a difficult bounty hunter. Anyway, this is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. But after that, the question of Domino's character is totally lost to the criminal plot. So, in short, not this is not a movie about the character of Domino. <br /> <br /> So I thought, it's probably a story of a robbery. A very bloody assault. 10 million have disappeared, bounty hunters are chasing suspicious thieves, mafia children are executed, hands are removed, Domino tries to find out why they do not receive rewards certificates, and so on. But soon this impression is dispelled by another reversal of plotting. <br /> <br /> This time we are faced with a sad story of an obese African American woman who pretends to be a driver's license at the local MVD and at 28 is the youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars in the Jerry Springer show, tries to publicize some new and crazy racial theory, and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main plot? Well, nobody knows. Except that the director had to explain to the public where the bounty hunters would pay $ 300,000 to the collectors. <br /> <br /> So at some point you start to think, "Oh, it's about our society and the way the media distorts things." There's a reality TV crew driving with the bounty hunters and doing some violent scenes. Bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors, who just whine all the time for having their noses broken and for dragging many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a movie about media, they only appear sporadically throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are many other sub-plots: the afflicted Afghan committed to liberating Afghanistan, the love story between Dominoes. and Chocco, the mescaline episode, the FBI surveillance operation ... <br /> <br /> All of the things mentioned above can be put into 2-hour film? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it's a real mess!
