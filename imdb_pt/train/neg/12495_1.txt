Okay, I love bad horror. I particularly love horror bad enough to make fun of. Demonicus, or House of the Dead - those were bad enough to make fun of. Severed was not. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoilers - who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I sat throughout the movie, and I have a lot of comments, both in the style "this sucks "and in the realm of real criticism. Plot (more or less) - There's a guy in this town (which is possibly in Seattle, see comment below) that is running and cutting heads. He's been doing this for over a year (I will not go back for exact numbers - thank you), possibly two or three years. One head a week. And the police are now calling it a "specialist" (who ONCE refers to himself as a medium but never appears again). <br /> <br /> Schya, right! The feds assume after what, THREE homicides linked? After almost a hundred and so nameless killings we would be under damn martial law !!!!! <br /> <br /> In any case, this "expert" consults the voodoo cub that the police have ignored all the time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it is Baron Samedi, a Voodoo spirit, who is cutting heads to gain enough power to become a body (and then presumably dominate the world - or possibly just go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> One. <br /> <br /> Scenery - where is this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you might not realize that at the bar / rave (busy by about ten of the movie crew and their family) there is a sign for a local radio station, and that in the highly entertaining, Pulp Fiction "esqe dialogue (as IF) between the two policemen (yes, those who have their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the movie) they discuss" the new stadium "which may still have been a problem when this film was done. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize on behalf of the film and my head is ashamed. <br /> <br /> OK, here's where it's really critical - be a horror movie writer (not posted, do not look up my name on IMDb), I research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - as a Voudon Loa (spirit) who holds cemeteries and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with "Satan" - is actually a cheat "Loki" God. <br /> <br /> In other words, he does not cut his head. <br /> <br /> In addition, most of Voudoun's religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies are centered around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that if he already owned someone, why make a NEW body? <br /> <br /> If Baron Samedi had a body, he would not cut off his heads, get some good rum and cigars and parody! In summary, the only thing they did I was (surprisingly) certain is that in unnecessary reading of the Tarot card (used only to show that the voodoo girl is "scary") they did not spoil the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I did research. (Someone remembers the late late ad for tarot readings on the phone - "Lovers - you'll soon fall madly in love ..." and all that nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you did it So far, through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I'm more sorry if you feel the need to watch the movie because of me, so please do not.
