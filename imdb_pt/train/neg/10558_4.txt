I do not know why this has fans and I do not know why I gave the punctuation I got. This is absurd. There are many giallo in which it is necessary to suspend the disbelief, to let the image roll and to reach it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor policeman has to explain what we saw. But this has very little to do and has very long sequences, where nothing happens and has no relevance to anything, while we have to hear a more repetitive soundtrack, even by Italian standards. Not a giallo, this is a complete miscellany of horror ideas with Klaus Kinski in one of his most glaring 'phoned in' performances. I think he showed up, did a day's work and left Mr. D'Amato to get other people to fill him out. Ewa is clear, beautiful, but no, it is not enough, and in the end we saw much of his snap. everywhere, long after we had completely lost interest in this stupid and pretentious buzz. Maybe I was not in the mood!
