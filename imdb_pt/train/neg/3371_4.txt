Incredibly unlikely and foolish potboiler who at least has some razor-sharp and razor-sharp photo but is unbelievable too much to generate too much tension. I was kind of hoping that Stanwyck would not go back in time, because, in fact, she was overloaded with the wet in more than one way, husband, and she also had an idiot child ... why did not you run off with Meeker? But the lingering question remains ... what kind of wood was that quay stand made if a rotten piece of it did not float? Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does the best he can with the material, but it's threadbare.
