I got this movie on Sci-Fi before I got to work. If you have any interest in watching Dean Cain dive in and avoid being engulfed in flames at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. If that does not interest you, well, I'm afraid you wish for you to be the only one engulfed in flames, because this movie is very bad. The acting, to begin with, is horrible, terrible and terrible. The characters are completely unpleasant, and the dialogue is worse than their typical Z-grade Sci-fi movie. In the end, the movie started to remind me of 'Hollow Man' (complete with escape through the elevator shaft), except with a dragon, not a naked and invisible man. Unlike other similar movies, however, this was not a bit bad ... it was just bad.
