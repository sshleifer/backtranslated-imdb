As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are comic bold. I think the director was thrilled by his "artistic vision" about the look of the film instead of needing attention to the content. Despite their stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story almost incoherent. Madonna was probably chosen purely as a stunt double to get a pre-release. One good thing about his appearance here lent some credit to his album "I'm Breathless," which was a stratospheric success (due in large part to the inclusion of the dance-hit "Vogue" - which did not is not even related to this movie). I think most of the money in this movie came from tie-ins for Madonna's "I'm Breathless" album. <br /> <br /> If you watch at home for the final titles, you think "there are two hours of my life that I would like to have back". Save yourself the time wasted - do not bother with it.
