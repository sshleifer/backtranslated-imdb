Worst movie I've seen since the afternoon of Gingerale. I suppose this is a horror / comedy. I practically predicted all the scenes in this movie. The special effects were not so special. I believe I could come up with such good effects than I have around the house. I wish I had something good to say about this movie, but I'm afraid I do not know. Even Coolio should be ashamed to appear in such a turkey. I, after thinking a little, have a good thing to say about this movie - it's over.
