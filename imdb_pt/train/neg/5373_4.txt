This is a classic example of a growing problem with movies. Why is background noise and soundtrack louder than dialogue? What sense does it make? This movie is not alone. Most movies seem to do this now. For 2 years, I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV and there it is again. BACKGROUND noise that could be occurring in a city block behind the actors drowns the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was even more disturbing in this film because, in the English version, the woman grunts constantly. I kept waiting for Jean Reno to say, "Excuse me, you would either speak or take the balls out of your mouth." If you watch on DVD and have even French in high school, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I give 4 because Reno was so good in Leon. People rave about the scenery, but I saw on a TV and I lived in the Rocky Mountains for a few years, then "Enh".
