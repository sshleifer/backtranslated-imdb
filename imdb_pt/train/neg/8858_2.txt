Ben, an out-of-town cop, is convinced that his sister has been brutally killed and wants to bring her murderer to justice, but he is approached by Stefan, who believes his sister was the victim of a werewolf cult. Then Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan travel to Transylvania to end this evil. <br /> <br /> This is incredibly horrible, and I wondered how it got released. It makes the original 'Howling' look like a masterpiece. What Christopher Lee was thinking, since this is the worst performance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was a lot wrong with this really cheap movie, which ranged from Annie's hamie and wood performances. McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to forget Lee), tacky fashion (those sunnies), cheap and lame special effects, misuse of lighting, humor ... if there were trashy music from the 80s with part of the film focusing only on an unknown band), werewolf has orgies that is a sight to see and a tiresome story with annoying and annoying dialogue. I thought if it was so bad it would be very funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positives were the location and settings of the movie looked great, but that's about it ... in fact, I will add the short pickle scene from Sybil Danning as well. <br /> <br /> During the End Credits The band plays their crap song during an odd set of scenes from the movie, which I ask the question why? <br /> <br /> A terrible mess, but at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
