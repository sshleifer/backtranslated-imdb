While I consider myself a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original film that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that later matured and become much more appealing in the series are there, The Gathering's rhythm is slow, the makeup a bit inadequate and the plot messy. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to ignore these issues, I remember that The Gathering almost took me away, which soon turned into a spectacular series.
