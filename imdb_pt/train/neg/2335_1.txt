A film so unsure that the creators might have hoped to put a classic noir title from the original film, "Farewell My Lovely," thinking the naive would take on a remake. The characters are so mean and nasty that they deserved their cold reception when they were first released. Time only increases your absurdity. Having none of the tricks, cinematography, despair, or desperation of the classic noir, he relied on a complicated and meaningless criminal plot that would easily result in several prisons in a matter of hours. As if that were not enough, he launched an absolutely erotic attempt at eroticism in which at least one of the participants did not take the trouble to shower in several days. It only made this mess even more painful to watch. Find a good classic from the forties or fifties instead of wasting two hours with this flaw.
