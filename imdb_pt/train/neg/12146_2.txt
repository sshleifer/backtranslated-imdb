This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be cruel and shocking; But FEEDING THE MASSES goes limp like some of the hard-legged zombies chasing the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus virus is being knocked over by the government manipulated by newspapers and television stations. Some brave but dumb souls from Channel 5 TV News feel that their audience is getting false hopes and no idea of ​​the real danger at hand. An anxious reporter (Racheal Morris) and his cameraman (William Garberina), with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), risk their lives and physical integrity to present a live broadcast to show their misfortune in their hand. Do yourself a favor and do not watch. This thing is obviously very low budget and comes across the feel of a high school game was bad. Acting is atrocious and meat-hungry zombies are almost comical. Also featured are Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. FEEDING THE MASSES must be left to starve.
