Firstly ... I've never considered myself a Uater Boll Hater since I've never seen one of his films, but after seeing that cheap excuse for a movie called "Seed" (which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about I'm close to joining the hate club. This movie makes absolutely no sense at all ... the plot is a joke and although Boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people, 90% of this movie is just plain boring. can summarize this film as follows: 1. Hooded killer watches animal clips being tortured on TV. This is a real-life filming of fur farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason "to do a statement about humanity "and give Peta an address. Since this movie has no message and is the worst piece of pornography torture, you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning. /> 2. Death by electrocution with a pretext that reveals what happens most late in this movie printed on the screen, so that all the retarded will receive it. <br /> <br /> 3. Cops watch videos of animals, babies and women starving and breaking into the basement of the Seeds, having idiot nightmares and crying in their whiskey because Seed is such a bad evil. Although the acting is good, the film takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotion ... 4. Police officers detonate Seed in their house, act stupidly and are struck in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you barely see anything except flashlights. Seed is a super assassin who is everywhere at the same time and all the cops act stupid enough to be killed ... except for one who catches him. 5. Seed grabs the chair and we see his electrocution as long as all the other things in this "movie" ... he will not die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he should be released if you survive 3 electric bumps. Guess what ... they just bury him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. Seed leaves his grave, kills everyone else in another biting part, and then looks for the main cop to take revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman gets her head with a hammer in an endless sequence from a point of view only by the fun and shocking value of it. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed captures the family of the police, lures him to his home, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun, the cop shoots himself over the head, considering that's what Seed wants (it's hard to get into their heads since he not only wears the mask but never utters a word ... the movie barely has any dialogue, so do not care. 9. Boll goes to a shocking nihilistic end where Seed locks up his daughter with her dead father to rot like the people we saw in the video in sequence 3. <br /> <br /> That's it ... no message, no plot, no motive, no face behind the mask, no bottom but a stupid story that Seed was burned as a child . <br /> <br /> This movie is based purely on a few key scenes and their shock value.I barely remember a film so empty of any emotion or message or entertainment.It's like watching the August Underground ... this is good with me, some people will appreciate this snuff without a brain. easy to bear is the pseudo-message at the beginning and the fact that the film is well done considering the camera work, effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> So how does Boll get money to make such "movies" when thousands of talented directors work on tight budgets? "Seed" is not just the essence of ridicule, its living proof that the free market is flawed ... lucky that the German taxpayer is paying for many of that waste to get deductions.
