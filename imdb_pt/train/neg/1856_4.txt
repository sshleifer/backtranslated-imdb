I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction to the films produced and distributed by A-pix Entertainment, and without exception, everything this company deals with is crap! First, and this is very important, never watch this movie sober! Because you? Unlike many other bad movies, this is an intentionally bad feeling. I just can not understand how the snowman is fake, and that's why it's always shown only briefly, the way it moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the crap Michael Keaton, because it was also made a good movie, and that version is as bad as that.
