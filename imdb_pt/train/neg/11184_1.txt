This is a truly terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just writing this so some people somewhere will keep an eye on him. If I stopped a person from wasting part of his precious life watching this movie, I will die happy. <br /> <br /> Unspeakably dull, although since starring Al Pacino I've been fooled into thinking that at any time something interesting was going to happen. Then the credits rolled, and I realized I had been completely cheated in watching this unbelievable drivel. <br /> <br /> I can not believe this movie has scored as high as the IMDb (more than 5 stars when I last voted). Are you voting ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please do not watch this movie!
