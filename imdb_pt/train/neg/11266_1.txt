Well, what to say ... <br /> <br /> Having seen the movie I still have to wonder what the hell the point of all this really was? V.Dodgy camera moves on the patio at one point ... I had to look away from the screen, I was feeling physically sick ... Round and Round and Round .... You get the idea ... /> <br /> VERY MUCH strange accents on many points .... "Those who should know, know" <br /> <br /> Unless you go in for free, or get paid to watch it, or Your partner is about to make you paint the house or something ... so forget it ...
