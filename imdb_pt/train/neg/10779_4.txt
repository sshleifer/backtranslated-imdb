I found this movie to be an absolute disappointment. The talent available to the director - notably Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the four main clues) - was completely wasted on a bland and mediocre story whose conclusion could not be bothered once. introduced to the terrible stereoscopic characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is simply annoying (appearing to reprise her high-profile role, minus humor), Crystal just plays her same old hyper-active, neurotic and boring alter-ego, and Cusack simply walks on her side bored with the whole project. <br /> <br /> For what is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, much less chemistry, and as for comedy - (possible SPOILERS) well, the only moments of humor moderated came from the back of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - the writer obviously unable to show any originality. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably amused as the Mexican lover and Walken made an amusing turn as a parody of a dogmas-maverick-Dogme-type director - but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead (Spoilers) we were treated with Billy Crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog. Pure genius. For a big fan of most of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely disappointed by a movie with lots of good ideas, and at the same time completely unable to explore or elaborate on any of them, instead of resorting to the same old style cliches and even lowering himself to the depths of almost 'coarse and adolescent' humor at times. Very bad 4/10.
