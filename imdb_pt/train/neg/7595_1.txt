"Ask the Dust" sounded intriguing to the trailer, and we especially liked all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not attractive enough to be considered drama, and it was not funny enough to be a comedy. It seemed to practically satirize itself and with no fun effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this to improve, my wife and I left, valuing not to waste more time with this absurdity. It just was not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It looks like it was written, produced and directed by a high school kid; worse, it was such a shameful waste of extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
