The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (I'm sorry, I'm biased, I think the pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies), and 0.5 for the fact that it's shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seats. I was surprised to be able to sit through it. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the positives of the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. That's all there is to save the entire movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, I'm sure most people (including me) would not have touched the movie. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about the negatives. Firstly, it is real dragged, with many and many repeated scenes. Scenes from Nachi and Azumi keep coming back. It looks more like a dramatic way to film. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks and this movie too. Secondly, the film is very unrealistic in a historical setting. I do not care about unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a poor way of showing creativity, playing ninjas who act like bears and cobwebs, etc ... this reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy scenario. In addition, to portray "I do not know" the effect, the director shoots people dying with blood spraying (literally) around ... people do not realize that their head was cut ... etc ... etc. .. etc ... Many of these spoils the show. It seems that the influence of the anime is strong in this film. Degrades the show a lot. Third, Azumi is not supposed to be a killer. She looks more like a one-man army to me, only she's a woman. I do not think you see murderers in army camps. The only time I felt she acted like "I liked a killer" was when she killed Kato Kiyomasa at the end of Azumi 1. Lastly, the plot was weak in both films. It's a linear plot without development and surprises anyway.
