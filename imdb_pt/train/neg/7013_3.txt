Unfortunately this film, 54, was a pathetic attempt at the true story of 'Studio 54'. The only good thing in the photo was "Mike Myers" which was a joy to watch. 'Snow Cambpell', although his role was small, unfortunately it was bad. The bottom line is that this movie lacked a good performance from the actors except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt at a good script.
