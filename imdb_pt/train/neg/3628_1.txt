The dream of an art maven. Overrated, overvalued, exaggerated; a pretentious melange who not only did not deserve the Best Photography of 1951 by her own merits, was overshadowed by competition from the start. Place in the Sun, Detective Story, Tram Call of Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; his name, if it was released in 1951, is better than this kind of art. The closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few actors in their time were less able (in acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 Worst of 51 (I've seen 201 movies), and among the 5 worst winners of the Oscar for Best Picture.
