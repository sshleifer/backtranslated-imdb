His first film after the death of longtime friend, John Belushi, Aykroyd shows a lot of fatigue trying to remove a character who would have been a blink of an eye to Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead, "Doctor Detroit" gives us Aykroyd book teacher disguised as a strange and violent pimp to fend off a rival known only as a mother. That's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four checkers to protect and a pimp's dinner (or something) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems stunned most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> It was in this film that Aykroyd met the future wife Donna Dixon. At least something good came out of this chaotic mess. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. You want a good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". You want it badly, see "Doctor Detroit."
