I honestly can not believe what passes for entertainment now. Violence, sexual innuendo, adult threatening children, rawness, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitting hell, stereotyped jokes about African Americans, police officers and fat people and children fleeing the house in the middle of the night - yes, it sure sounds like a children's movie to me - NO !!! Add to that the dark and scary elements - a dead woman owning and turning into a house and keeping her beloved husband a prisoner for over 20 years, and also terrorizing a whole neighborhood - how sweet it is for the kids. COUNTRY - this is really what you want your kids to watch - is this what you want to teach them about life? <br /> <br /> This movie is too scary for small children, and I am afraid that teenagers today may be living a little of this movie scenario - so why rub it on their faces? As for an adult audience - you will not find this scary or amusing - just boring, artificial and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - ignorant parents, ignorant cops, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative nannies, and beer drinkers / female boyfriends. What great stuff for kids - does it really sound like a kid's movie to anyone? Even computer animation and good voice work are not enough to rescue this terrible movie. Save your money, save your time and save the minds of your kids - go renting Ice Age, Monsters Inc., the Incredibles, Shrek, Insect Life - ANY of them is way better than this horrible movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - it's a shame for you to make a disaster and then to cash in as a child / family movie!
