I'll say that at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. The acting is mostly not good (I guess Sky just showed some promise) and you feel weird watching. All the scenes that must have felt are really superficial, as when Ng appears to his parents. There are lots of gross details, like the kanji tattoo on Sky's shoulder, the magnets in the girls' refrigerator, and the horrible set decoration ... and the music ... and the clothes ... and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at one point "I'm gay, not corny." And not aware. Even the comment is horrible, I hung up after Ng talked about how weird she was playing a lesbian.
