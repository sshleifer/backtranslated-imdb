Beautiful bodies, beautiful colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, banal plot. The name of the prima donna, Camilla, and the eponymous flowers that often appear are enough to remind us of the similarities in the plot of La Dame aux Camelias, Dumas, Camille, starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last. but not least the opera of Verdi La Traviata. Nice young people, not very virtuous, social outcasts for one reason or another, they loved each other, they separated, they met in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... Forgive banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialogues in the opera, but why waste Hayak , Don Sutherland, a beautiful interpretation of Los Angeles in the 1930's, an earthquake deus ex machina that conveniently kills the other woman, and all that beauty in this mediocre turkey where there is no beautiful corner?
