Wow, what a jerk. Definitely one of the worst bacon movies. The poor performance coupled with a script formulated, if not incredulous, makes me crave the time I wasted watching it on cable television back. I can not say much about it, a basketball hunter is very attached to the person he is recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that is about to go to war and which happens to be decided by a basketball game. Note: F +
