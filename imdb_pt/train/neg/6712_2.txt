I think you have to give some points for the courage to write a musical around a history class, but how about a decent song? <br /> <br /> Does Howard DeSilva's cartoons unfold to spark the interest of children who would otherwise be tired? <br /> <br /> William Daniels's contemporary acting style (for the time) means appealing to a demographic audience of the 1960s and 1970s? <br /> <br /> Do we need all the "inner jokes" about NY and NJ? (I can hear the blue-haired Broadway crowd laughing at the time.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I find the whole piece dated, annoying and very strident to the screen
