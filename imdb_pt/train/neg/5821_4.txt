As others have noted, this should have been an excellent film in the Hammer style, and it seems to me that this is how most actors were instructed to play it ... but the script is so heavy, poorly paced and full of many soliloquies tasteless (poor Timothy Dalton is overwhelmed with most of them) that everything is too exaggerated and self-important. This is an unusually weak performance of Dalton, although he quietly preaches the climatic scene in which Dr. Rock finally realizes what he did. The only actor who does very well is Patrick Stewart, which is a welcome sight. Freddie Francis may have been a great cinematographer, but he was a lousy director.
