Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first post on IMDb, although I use it as a reference for a long time. So I would like to greet all of you. The fact that I am a Greek will inevitably affect my judgment, I hope not to bore you. <br /> <br /> I spent two years of my life (all of us, indeed, Greeks), analyzing Omirus epos (not Homers as you see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. If I remember correctly, it was Iliada (Iliad) in the 8th year and Odyssey (Odyssey) in the 9th year. Warner's Troy, was a huge disappointment to me and my Greek colleagues across the campus (I study in the UK). <br /> Iliad epos is one of the best literary works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet, Omirus, for 400 years after the war. Historians have put the Trojan War around 1200 BC, and the real reason for the war is not the beauty of Helen but the strategically crucial position of Troy. That being said, one can now understand that Omirus Epos is not presenting the events (as historically not required), but this was never the purpose of this work. Reading this immense poem one can imagine the very definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty, and so on. The best part and the most educational were also those long conversations between the warriors before the battle. None of these though were revealed in 'Troy' <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap to my eyes, and to other English speaking Finnish people and German colleagues to me as well. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars on such a bad scene. By the way, the perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics did all the work), and yet it's the best work of Wolfgang Petersen. <br /> <br /> I conclude by saying that you better watch something else. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a really expensive B movie. <br /> <br /> Congratulations <br /> <br /> Alex
