I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure this would be a good movie if something had happened. Nothing does. It is short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes long. After an hour of frustration, I examined the remaining 20 minutes. Freeman plays an actor - who has not worked for some time - researching a part he could play, such as a cashier in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing happens. She decides to give him a ride home and they go to an Arby's, a Target, a washer. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Never. <br /> <br /> I do not understand. But I also do not get the Bill Murray movies "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers". If you like these movies, you might like it. Many people find films so capricious, charming, or - for reasons beyond my control - they find the dialogue fascinating. A common device in such films is to have a LONG silence / silence delay after an actor delivers a line that should be meaningful. We know it is significant because it is followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. Sorry, I must be a Philistine. I dont understand. To me, this kind of movie is not funny, charming or thought-provoking. They are just boring. Because? Because there is no comedy. No drama No tension. Do not laugh Without suspense. No action. Nothing to watch. In short, none of the things I go to the movies for. I can get bored for free. I see eccentric / quirky characters in real life. I go to the Target, fast food restaurants and washer. These elements do not make a movie, even if the stars are doing these things. I pay to have fun. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing, have fun. If you want to drool over Paz Vega, you can look and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. A total snoozefest.
