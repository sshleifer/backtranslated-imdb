While Frank Loesser's songs are some of the best Broadway has to offer, they are applauded for the lethargic presentation and uninspired presentation of Joseph L. Mankiewicz - when it's over, it looks like you did not see a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present Loesser's challenging but melodious melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the showstopping `Adelaide's Lament ', concludes having Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) belt at the end while sitting on a lounger; and Stubby Kaye's faux-spiritual, "Sit, you're shaking the boat," has his chorus of support sitting on folding chairs as he just stands there. Mankiewicz takes all the fun out of everything, letting the static scenes last a long time and his dialogue (adapted from the Abe Burrows scene book) has nothing of the intelligence that his films like 'All About Eve' have. Part of the blame has to go to the leaders, almost all who are miscast: Marlon Brando seems perplexed why he is in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays a very good guy and has none of the edge that makes him so essential (The songs are not adapted to his style) and Jean Simmons barely records the way a Shirley Jones could. Only Blaine, like the beloved dancer Adelaide, commands our attention like a Broadway professional should. The colorful art direction is Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created the flashy sets.
