Scary .. Yes Scary !! Full of nudity (from fat people to skinny people), Maslin Beach happens on a nude beach in SA <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie two years ago - it's safe to say that it made it a bizarre topic discussion at school the next day. This movie was horrible! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a demonstration of nudity! This movie reached its lowest point with one of the characters of the new era looking down between the legs of a girl. <br /> <br /> Girl: You will not find God there! Guy: No, but I think I found paradise. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss issues like farting, adultery and the process of overcoming the genitals together. AVOID!
