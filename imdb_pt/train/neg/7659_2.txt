Alone in the dark is a bad movie and tied with Deuce Bigalow for worst movie of the year. I wanted it to be all I had to say, but of course the IMDb stipulates a word count and all that. <br /> <br /> I'm into two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie. A low budget like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Hands. Or an immense budget disgrace like Gigli, Superbabies, or such antics. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director does not have a clue. Films like this happen because the director is an idiot idiot who just does not care about his audience. <br /> <br /> It is most shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll (The mentor behind this shocking crap and already has some real rubbish on his resume) has created something that only happens once on a blue moon. The horror movie really terribly bad. Everything about it is a mess. CGI cheese, bad plot, random insane camera cuts and terrible soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark is a terrible movie that must be watched by absolutely no one. Woo hoo! Review more. Give me a sprout, roll in 2006 and I'll NEVER tell you about it again. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
