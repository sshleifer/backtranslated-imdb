Falls into the movie category of "Very ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments to be taken seriously." Considering Shriek If you know what I did last Friday the thirteenth or back of my boyfriend knows they are bad, not scarecrows. Evil Dead has set such a high standard for the comic horror of an economic genre that the Scarecrows are simply out of place. <br /> <br /> Suspicions of inexperience are immediately at play as there are no signs of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airplane in the air. The repeated display of a photo of 3 men just screams through a story arc, but nothing comes. Although men are obviously scarecrows, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this film is too serious for its own good can produce some smiles. I do not remember if Joe Bob Briggs ever predicted Scarecrows, but I do believe he would not lower that. However, with a IMDb rating of more than 6, there are many people who disagree.
