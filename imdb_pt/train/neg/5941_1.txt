As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I was looking forward to this movie. I'm sad to see it's a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray Notorious B.I.G. Much of the story follows the true son of Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. when I was a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay homage to his father. Derek Luke is as unconvincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. In short, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with this is the real people who are playing. It was annoying and did not give any information about the notorious B.I.G. which fans and non-fans did not know. I was especially disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress wasted here as Voletta Wallace. The film slugs and slugs thinking that the notorious B.I.G. the fans will spend lots of money on it. I'm sorry to say that it happened. You're not even close to a good movie. I was expecting a lot of it, but unfortunately I did not get any of it. I think you should definitely skip this one.
