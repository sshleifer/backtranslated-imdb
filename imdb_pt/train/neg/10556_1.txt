This is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little meaningful dialogue, no context for the events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused and clueless spectator; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without hearing the director's comment. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. It includes some images of actual and horrific acts of violence, including wartime executions. Although it works in the context of the film, I feel that the ideas behind the film could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is not absolutely for the weak or the easily offended, and should under no circumstances be shown to minors. <br /> <br /> The climax is anti-climax compared to the content of the rest of the film. If you're not listening to the comment while it happens, you'll probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's comment was a one-shot, "Feel the guy and let him talk, no cuts" kind of comment. Although this is not necessarily bad, the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes complaining about his college, shooting conditions, co-producers, bad movies and a dozen other things. Constant negativity diminishes what is otherwise an essential tool for understanding the film. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed many years ago in 16mm and Super8 films over a four year period with an extremely low budget. Because of this, the video and audio quality is poor. That alone does not make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie even worse.
