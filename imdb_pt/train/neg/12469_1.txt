I rarely give up on a movie without seeing the whole show. This is particularly true when I rented it on DVD. Syriana was one I gave up on. Halfway, I turned it off in bored disgust. <br /> <br /> This film is disconnected, boring, confusing and lackluster. The performance was dry and without credible representations. The general plot was good, but developed in such an insipid and boring way that it failed to capture my attention or interest. Multiple subplots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than a real connected storyline. Too bad that such a serious subject and great actors could create such a failure. I can not imagine this movie getting any indication, much less a prize.
