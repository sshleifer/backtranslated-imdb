I watched this movie a long time ago (about 10 years or more) and I liked it. I remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again. The second time was not pleasant. The acting is "so, so", the plot is illogical, irrational and predictable. <br /> <br /> The acting ... I'm sure it was not difficult for the actresses to play these characters. The plot ... there is no way in hell those women would have escaped with the first robbery, much less the second. (Side note: Why TT did not realize that even if she brought a sum of money to the court date, they would ask where she got it and she would not have a logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a con man! ). It is horribly stereotyped that black women basically say that the only way black women can "hit the system" or get a large amount of money is to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. He plays a lot in sympathy b / c they all die in the end (bar Jada), but it's not sad (you're thinking 'They were so stupid, they deserve to die). You just do not care about the characters unless you're a shallow person. <br /> <br /> I can not believe this movie is more than 5 years old.
