Suffice it to say that - despite the strange ridiculous panegyric to his "skills" of disinterest here posted - the director of this inept and hateful Tosh has not made a film since. Well, that's great news as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies has all the bile of its creator, but lacks the intelligence and technical proficiency that make Martin Amis the readable novelist. When will the British film industry wake up and realize that if you want to regain status you already had, you should stop producing junk like this and create something that real people really want to see? <br /> /> Avoid like the plague.
