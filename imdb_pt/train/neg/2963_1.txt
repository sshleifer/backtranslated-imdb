Since I started to visit this site and vote for movies, I have never given any movie a rating of 1. Even the disturbing "Dance! Workout with Barbie" has a 2. There is a reason for that. Every time I see myself watching a really bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "This movie is really as bad as the horrible soul-sucking monster that is' Theodore Rex '? "And I was never able to answer" yes ". <br /> <br /> I would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said "Hey! Let's redo 'Blade Runner' with Barney on the Harrison Ford Role!" and decided it was a good idea to spend time and money to record. Also, I want to know for what kind of market they would sell this if it were not close to the video. This is a rare monster: a movie that is too violent for kids and insanely stupid for adults. I would ask "what were they thinking?" but in this case it can be really redundant. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you are one of five or six fanatical fans of "Howard the Duck", or if you are curious to see the most insane evil movie of all time, or you really want to punish yourself.
