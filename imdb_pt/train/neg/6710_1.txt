I've seen over 1000 movies and this stands out as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a shame they had to associate that rubbish with The Angels' 1963 song, "My Boyfriend's Back." If you have to choose between watching this movie and doing a painful dental treatment, I suggest the dental work.
