This remake of Tim Burton's original "Planet of the Apes" from 1968 (and starring Charleton Heston) is a far cry from the quality and plot of the original. <br /> <br /> Certainly the special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not. The characters were boring and the dialogue was horrible. I sat through the entire movie with a friend (who fortunately only rented it) and completely understood why, before Christmas, all the "Planet of the Apes" toys at Target were in the bin. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: Do not put this on your resume. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone: watch the original movie "Planet of the Apes" from 1968.
