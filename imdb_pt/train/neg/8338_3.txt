This movie is very important because it suggested to me this consideration: sometimes you may want to be sick ... sometimes you may want to have a syndrome ... sometimes, for example, you may want to have Goldfield Syndrome ... in this way you do not remember this boring movie ... and most of all you do not remember Adam "superfluores" Sandler ... sometimes simply, you may wish ... have rented another movie ... <br /> < My vote? 3 out of 10. My suggestion? If you are not a fan of annoying romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke there is no Adam Sandler fan ... I want to wait), save yourself ... Someone to save? Drew Barrymore. ... possibly.
