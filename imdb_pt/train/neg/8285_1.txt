This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only has no acting ability, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. You really listen to a serious dialogue that says, "I love you more." "No, I love you more." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I could not take it anymore. Her "southern girl charm" simply does not work and is really very annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall and she delivers lines as if she were reading the direct script of the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the screenplay before agreeing to do it, or did he fall in love with his father Joe (father of Jessica and also producer of the movie) of big profits? I hope he knows now better than signing another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate to see the look of pain on his face as he suffers from the bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think the previous commentator giving this film an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie in some way or hired by Papa Joe to give the film a better rating. No one in their right mind would find this movie interesting. <br /> <br /> Jessica has lots of money, right? Maybe buy some acting classes?
