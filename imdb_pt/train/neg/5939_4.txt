I thought the film was good, but very disappointed that they did not get the true picture of their life. I was so eager to see your mother being a real Jamaican, that this is driving me crazy. Just watching the beginning of the movie told me the movie was not accurate. That I completely lost interest only a matter of seconds since the beginning of the film. I'm very disappointed, it's like watching a biography of Mark Anthony and getting Arnold to play the part. I do not know what the writer was thinking of losing a valuable piece of the movie that I'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life. I'll say the movie was good, besides the great Fla !!!!!!
