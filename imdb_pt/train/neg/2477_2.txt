If you want to know the true story of Wendigo, I suggest you take a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This movie was not only bad, but it had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved the book when I read it as a boy (in "Campfire Chillers" by EM Freeman) and I was so excited to see a movie based on it come out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were many PC (Politically Correct) subtons throughout the movie that had no place in the movie. When the book was written, the PC did not even exist. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is not to waste your time or money !! If you see it on the shelf of the video store, LEAVE IT THERE.
