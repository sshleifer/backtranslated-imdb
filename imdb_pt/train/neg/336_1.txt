Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the stellar chain it ruins all the good work making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds reached the peak, then began making car chase movies from Hal Needham. Arnold Schwarzenegger has become Hollywood's hottest property, only to mock himself with the appalling Last Action Hero. And here, the loquacious Eddie Murphy wipes out memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this "family" adventure film, which is an incredibly tedious, childish, and often horrible flaw in which the chance to see Charlotte Lewis's big breasts in a tight blouse is the most attractive aspect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The story is pure and monotonous. It concerns the social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types and said that he is the Chosen One. Chosen for what, I hear you ask. His job is to rescue a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, the charming Charles Dance seems very embarrassed to be in the movie, but, hey, I'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. Of all Murphy's movies, this is easily the worst. I have read a few comments that suggest that it is good to see Murphy in an atypical role, in a type of non-stereotyped film, and although both points are vaguely true, there is no forgiveness for the fact that the film - though atypical and non-stereotyped can be - it's an absolute load of rubbish. <br /> <br />
