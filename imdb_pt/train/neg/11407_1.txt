This movie is a perfect example of an excellent book being ruined by a movie. Jacob I am Loved is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no plot, the plot disappears and the editing is horrible. Above all, the music is directly from a synthesizer and sounds incredibly terrible. Bridget Fonda's performance is decent, but everyone's performance is totally amateurish. I would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer, as a study on how not to produce a movie, because it is full of bad scenes, bad transitions and performances that should have been re-filmed! Read the book and do not waste your time with this movie.
