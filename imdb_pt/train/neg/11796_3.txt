Nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then watch Phat Beach. However, do not rent and definitely DO NOT buy. That would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV and found myself laughing at certain points. I did not laugh a lot and did not laugh too much. However, there were subtle jokes and comments that I laughed at. If you are looking for an extremely funny movie, then watch Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional film (something this movie tries to watch), watch something like "hoop dreams" or "Jason's Lyric". If you're looking for a good black serve, go watch a porn movie by Dominique Simone because the nudity in this movie is almost non-existent. However, if you have nothing better to do and that's on the cable, go ahead and watch. You'll be a little fun. <br /> <br /> *** 3 out of 10 ***
