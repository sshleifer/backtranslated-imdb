'P' (or Club-P) should really be called 'L' for lame. All the festivals have a disappointment and this is the only one that can not live according to its logline: "Thai lesbians fighting monsters". On the contrary, this is the tale of a girl from the interior of the Khmer that grandmother taught her a bit of witchcraft along with some strange (but specific) rules: "do not walk under a clothesline," "eat raw meat," and " do not accept money for your powers. " Well, guess what, the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a 'bar girl' and succeeds in breaking all the rules her grandmother taught her, which later releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the 'foreigners' who pay for she. While this movie may not even be released in Thailand due to the controversial subject, most American audiences will find this horror film, a cross between "Showgirls" and "Interview with the Vampire." "as directed by Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> If it were not for some scenes with significant amounts of blood, the MPAA could probably rate this just for preteens.There is literally the adult rate of open TV, although you expect at least one sex scene considering the fact that the movie is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a real-life Thai porn star. <br /> <br /> As for the 'lesbian' angle, there is a brief kiss and a pair of "I love you" to prove that the two main stars really are a couple. And the P-bar has to be the only exotic dance club on the planet, where the girls keep their cangas and do acrobatics (there is a swordsman who cuts cucumbers from a girl's mouth ... ooh, phallic images.) NO nudity, NO real monster (unless you count a Thai spirit five feet tall with yellow eyes), and ANY way ANY ADULT SHOULD PAY TO SEE THIS TYPE IS tupidity except on DVD. You have been warned!
