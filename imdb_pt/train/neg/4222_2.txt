For those of us who lived during those weeks of filming in the city and around the Valley - not to forget the tedious days of road closure and "filming." As a reminder to those who live here - locations include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. The bank was the BC headquarters; Chase scenes included Moon Drive off Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd, and Hwy 1. Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most accessible, Matt Broderick was above all of us - even back then. As far as the film is concerned - a joke in a script and even a bigger laugh in relation to acting and plot - but who cares about that level? A beautiful time capsule for those who enjoy the coastal landscape and the valley. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Joe's Bar (the Jed tavern in the movie), the original name of the movie was Welcome to Buzzsaw - Old Erba's parking lot was the town square, yard shots were on Grove Street in Boulder Creek; turn off the limit of thinking and see some actors in their early days.
