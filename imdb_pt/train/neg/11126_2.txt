Of all the movies I've seen, this one almost comes to the bottom (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching the bottom of the pit). It is rushed, the story is unstable and the events described are poorly represented. . Of course we have to put some of that in the door of the book writer. The book the film was filmed on is scandalously heavy and illogical. Oprah gives a palatable appearance as the mother of "Bigger", but is not nearly to her potential. Other famous artists also seem to be at their worst. The plot revolves around an African-American who has decided to take a job as a driver. By taking the family's daughter to a communist dinner, he becomes familiar. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he works for is not against the blacks, but he thinks they are. Then, when he gets home, he puts her to bed, but she starts to scream. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but suffocates her. Now, fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl, he does what any man of logical reasoning would do - he pushes her into the coal kiln. So the investigators are holding a missing person case and they check the furnace (the idiot was not expected to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are detestable segments of the courtroom.) Desperate for a bad movie, this could do the job, but if you seriously want to learn about cultural issues in the 1940s and 50s or see a good drama, there are much better options.
