This is a typical Universal Horror movie: it's technically compact, if by numbers, with a cookie cutter plan and some serious overeating. The most interesting part of this film is his stuntman Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disease as the "monster" of the movie. It's sad to see this exploited man, but he probably made good use of the money they paid him. Hatton is less horrifying than the studio expected, as I felt more pity for fear or disgust. Martin Koslack is on board as the crazy movie artist, and he's a lot of fun in that part. I like to see Koslack in just about anything; For some reason, the man amuses me. The only other part of the movie that entertained me is the absurdity of the film in the art world. Here we are shown evil art critics who amuse themselves in their ability to break artists; this is side by side with the male "hero" of the movie, who is an "artist" who paints ... take this ... hold girls. Somehow, our hero's work is reviewed side by side with the villain's absurd sculpture. It is also entertaining the main critic of the film, who at one point claims that he despises the art of the hero because "women like that do not exist" to which our heroine responds with the assurance that the critic simply does not go far enough. Finally, there is a little subplot about the domestication of heroine (which is an art criticism) by the leader ... completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to witness. Overall, this movie is a mediocre picture with some fun elements.
