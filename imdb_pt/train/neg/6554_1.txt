I would not give this movie a rating, it's not worthy. I just watched because I'm a Pfieffer fan. I loved her and watched anything she did. Even with this failure, she did not disappoint. Every scene with her kept the viewer watching ... waiting ... for something to happen, but nothing happened. He had some good stories, but they ended abruptly as soon as they started. Some of the other characters had potential, but nothing became of it. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 when she made this movie and the most charming. The wardrobe and set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can watch almost everything and rarely come across a movie that I can not find something to like, but this was a failure. I do not understand <br /> <br /> The worst thing about it all, had a big hook in the end. There was a final scene that woke you up and said wow, this movie is finally going somewhere, so the credits roll. Good suffering. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that said 0.99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and seeing my cat eating would have been more exciting. Well said. In fact, this comment was more fun than the movie because it sums it up nicely. I also lost 0.99 cents in this dud.dud.dud.
