I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but that was too much. The performance was not great, but that was not the real problem. The question was the sinking sensation I had in the pit of my stomach, about 20 minutes after the movie. These characters were empty. They had almost no depth, and what little they had was devoted to the cruelty they exhibited among themselves, under the guise of friendship. Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give those characters real personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was ugly.
