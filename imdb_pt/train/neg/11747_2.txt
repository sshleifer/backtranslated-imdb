Although he has some favorable pressure after playing at Toronto Intl. Film Festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much of it. One - is a very low budget Canadian film. Two - is written, directed and starred by the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it's Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But even though I was watching with low expectations, it still resulted in a much greater disappointment than I thought possible. <br /> <br /> In short - bad script, bad acting, terrible direction! Do not waste your time or money on this turkey. Claims to be a comedy, but I only laughed twice. Also, there is horrible music all around. As this has some attention I'll never know.
