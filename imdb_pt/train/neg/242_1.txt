From a poorly planned plot that makes almost no sense for bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to poor quality, even if Peter Falk can not find his way, it's better to miss "Finding John Christmas." Bertinelli's acting is without depth or emotion, as are his co-stars William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as Noah's love interest. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the single parent's daughter Noah is almost unbearable to watch and much less hear sing. But who can blame them with stuff like that? Michael J. Murray's script is youthful at best. <br /> <br /> Every year at this moment, I look for the TV guides and look forward to some of the truly inspiring Christmas films and Christmas classics appearing on the small screen. Films such as "Miracle on 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful "The shop around the corner" and, of course, the 1951 version of "Scrooge." There are classic Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and a great performance from Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift to you is like a piece of advice. His time would be better spent researching these movies than finding Finding John Christmas. Merry Christmas!
