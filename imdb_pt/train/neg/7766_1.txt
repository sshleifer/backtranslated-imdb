<br /> <br /> As with the other episodes in this television series for the various adventures of the sea legend, Horatio Hornblower's superhuman infallibility ruins all suspense. <br /> <br /> As little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of the NEXT GENERATION, Horatio Hornblower invincibly saves all situations. Every clever solution comes inevitably from Horatio Hornblower's lips. Immensely superior, Hornblower's main problem in this film series seems to be tolerating the many wrong characters above and below him in the chain of command. A perfect being contributes to a dull story. So superior is our hero that even those who try to help him are powerless to do something right unless the Hornblower is there to direct and control all his movements. <br /> <br /> What's the point in telling a story about anything? the person who can not do wrong and repeatedly will win everything every time? What is the point of attending such a story?
