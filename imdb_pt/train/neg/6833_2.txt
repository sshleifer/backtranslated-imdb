Jean-Claude Van Damme plays twin brothers Alex and Chad, both martial arts experts who come together to overthrow the mafiosi responsible for the murder of their parents in this empty-headed martial arts action that does not have a plot that would make better use of trick of having two Jean-Claude Van Dammes. Some scenes ok, but this is not one of Van Damme's best.
