I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOPs. And this is certainly an OOP. A year after The Exorcist, she's back in business with this movie, but what we all know is that Blair's career never burst, she has never become a mega-star. That's one reason why many of his films are OOP. She gives a good performance in this film. It is about a reject not recognized by her parents and has no friends. I played 15 years old playing a 14 year old girl, that's funny. The film is also known for the rape scene in the showers if they put a broom on their virginity. Most issues are cut because, I do not know, there's no blood involved, all right, Blair is naked, but nothing is shown, no T & A to offend people. But the film is slow, extremely slow. It does not make me happy normally, but I almost fell asleep. It is only about 14 years becoming a rebel against society, but there is no flow of blood, no blood, no nothing. Why this is categorized into horror still is a wonder to me. If you are a Blair fan, buy it if you can find it, otherwise leave it as is.
