I want to start by saying that I am a Republican, even if I do not agree with many of the things Bush did in office. And I love the daily program and the Colbert report. They have to be two of my favorite shows on TV. I like the jokes about Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy who ever walked the earth (I believe he's not the dumbest either). But it gets to a point where enough is enough and it's not so funny anymore. I see where this can be funny and it is (he's making fun of our authority figure, he's hilarious). Central comedy, though, is just trying to have fun with it. I mean, maybe a special episode, but a whole series is just dumb. It seems that CC is just saying the same jokes we have heard many times. I really can not see this show going on for 1 season.
