Words fail me. This film was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight I really wish I had not done it. Although I have tried to go through this until the final credits, I have to admit that it could not last more than an hour, so my opinion could be unfair. However, this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of filmmaking, to be given a review that is anything but cruel. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch any part of this movie. .
