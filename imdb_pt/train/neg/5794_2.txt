the Germans stand out in the open air and are shot down with a machine gun. The good ones never die unless they are for dramatic ends. the "plot" has so many holes that are laughable. (Where were the German soldiers once they rolled the fuel tank toward the train?) Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, hijacking a train? How stupid is that! The Germans know where you're going, it's not like you can leave the lane and walk away! What a waste. I would rather hit myself on the head with a hammer ball 10 times and then have to sit again. I mean, seriously, it looks like it was made in the 60's, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! The team is more believable than this horrible excuse for a movie. Just watch if you need a good laugh. This movie is for Tele Sevalas what Green Beret went to John Wayne.
