Recently, I saw the documentary "The revolution will not be televised", also known as "Chavez: inside the coup". At first I thought it showed a genuine inner vision of events during the coup in Venezuela in April 2002. What bothered me, however, was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive, and that in no way Hugo Ch치vez was criticized at the time. This is peculiar because, if a documentary is giving a non-biased explanation about what happened, there should also be some of that. After all, Ch치vez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, as the documentary has several years, a lot of additional information is available on the internet today, and it was not difficult to find, for example, "Urgent Investigation about Chavez - the coup of the 5 European TV companies that financed the film featuring falsehoods flagrant about Venezuela ". It lists the many intentional or unintentional errors and forgeries in the documentary. (Just use the title as a search string in Google, you will find it). Another interesting document was the video recording of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary, "X-ray of a lie." For me, it seems to be a good counterweight to "Ch치vez: within the coup". It's available on video.google. I strongly advise you to watch "Chavez: inside the coup" to look at "X-ray of a lie" and then form your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were (well known or not) part of Ch치vez's propaganda.
