This is loosely based on the ideas of the original hit of the '80s. It's all happening these days when we see a base in Afghanistan being destroyed by a UAV early on. <br /> <br /> And that's where the movie jumps the shark. UAVs are not armed. They could be, but I do not think this has ever been really tried. We were able to see the computer that commanded this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are introduced to "hacker" Will Farmer (he is good at chemistry and electronics who does not make him a computer hacker) and his love interest, Annie) and Will's first hacking attempt is not just a complete failure. and Annie guessed who it was. We also know Wills mom who works for a chemical company. <br /> <br /> Wills taking money from his neighbors bank account (Mr Massude) is not a hack (he helped set up the account), so we took a nod back to the original movie where they decide not to play Termonuclear Global War and they play The Dead Code. The trait that RIPLEY's office is running is NOT on Will, but on Massude's PC, so all the evidence they were collecting was useless against Will. <br /> <br /> Exactly because the RIPLEY closes Will's machine is not explained (he's just playing an online game?) and also why he felt the need to have to turn off all the electricity in the whole block where he lived too. Why an anti-terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable. What about RIPLEY activating your cell phone? I do not think so, he was not connected to the PC and the message would not ring unless he actually answered the phone, so there's more "hacked" science there as well. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude's house. , take it away and Will will receive an envelope that ends up containing a lot of money. The search for the license plate of the car that took the Massude is not a "hack", since you never saw him invade the computer of the DMV. RIPLEY agents who catch Dennis at the airport while he's searching will not have the authority to arrest or detain him. Will's mother did not "steal chemicals and biological agents" as well. And even if she did not have the right to arrest or arrest Dennis. Patriot Act or not. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Will was worried about being arrested for any crime in Canada, since it is a totally different country with different laws for the US. <br /> <br /> The computer was dishonest and all the lawsuit against Will, his mother and Dennis were not sanctioned by a government agency. The phone phreak that we see Will is going to make is the first show of any hacking skill in the movie, we also have a hack on RIPLEY that seemed very easy for such a powerful system. The "guy" that ran into Annie at the airport and was also watching them on the street had nothing to do with Ripley and the laughable notion that Ripley could track down a cell phone while underground was so dumb as the idea that a computer reads lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film when they mention Stephen Falken as the designer of the RIPLEY system replaced, the Joshua Project. We find that the "face" that came across Annie is Falken (not sadly interpreted by the original actor), who faked his own death. <br /> <br /> We can also see the WOPR as "what will help them". He hit RIPLEY and they kept the same voice they used back then. Falken and WOPR are destroyed very quickly after being used very little (the same explosion must kill Will, Annie and the Russian. They are also unlikely to create an autonomous computer system that has the capacity to bomb chemical weapons the country that operates out. <br /> <br /> The whole plot and idea of ​​"Decontamination" is totally unbelievable.These kinds of orders would have to go through the President or the Joint Staff.Then another risible and unbelievable idea. > <br /> The IP hacks against RIPLEY are not made by Will, he just contacts one of his friends who suggests and implements the idea. It is exceedingly laughable that Will would get a login only by increasing the functioning of RIPLEY Ter Joshua as a backdoor in Ripley (especially after being blown to pieces) is an incredible excuse and screams from a very desperate writer who had no ideas and wanted to end this movie. in awful where RIPLE Y is playing Dead Code and we see a countdown (saying 17 minutes), so Ripley says "Decontamination in 30 minutes," how crap is that when they can not even keep their own timer? RIPLEY's mission against Philadelphia is interrupted (very easily in my opinion) and decides to attack Joshua on his internal circuits and redirect the missile to a Philadelphia to Washington, where Ripley is parked. The idea of ​​nuclear exchange to make RIPLEY realize what she's doing is not going to work (surely she already knew if she had Joshua inside her as he had already learned that lesson in the original movie?) It's more a nod back to the original film . <br /> <br /> The excuse of having Ripley repeating the same words as Joshua at the end of the original movie serves to show how many original ideas they failed to create. <br /> <br /> If you want to point fingers to bad and stolen ideas, the guilty men are Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. This is a horrible movie and it's best to avoid it.
