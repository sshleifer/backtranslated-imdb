I rented this movie today thinking it could be a good football movie, since I'm a big fan of football. Boy, was I wrong. This film is very religious and preacher and is REALLY unrealistic. This movie pretty much says that if you are a Christian, you can get everything you want in life with ease, like becoming a great football player! You do not become a great football player by becoming a Christian and asking God, you do it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you anything ... puh-lease. That is not true, duh. I laughed several times because of this embarrassment. The only part that was funny was when they were being idiots (Shultz, the cartoonist? No, the guy who flew over the Atlantic, etc etc.), but really that movie was not that good. I do not recommend it, especially if you are not Christian, lol.
