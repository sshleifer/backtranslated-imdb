Okay, what the hell am I watching now? "The Witches' Mountain" has to be one of the most incoherent and insane exploration films of all time, and at the same time it is also strangely convincing. There is absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt that there was already a roadmap to work, but somehow I could not turn it off. Clawing her head in confusion begins immediately, with an opening sequence about an angry little girl who killed her mother's cat. So you think this movie revolves around children possessed by evil forces? No, because after this introduction, the girl and her badness are simply no longer mentioned. Then cut to a guy, with the most trimmed mustache you've ever seen, which ends with the girlfriend in a not subtle way. When she asks him to spend his vacation with her, he promptly calls his employer, asking him for any type of task! Great movement. The film finally begins now as he travels to an isolated hilly area to photograph some peaks. Although not before he picks up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and photographs her topless! Throughout your journey, all sorts of strange events occur ?? You guessed ?? are never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! Really, car wizards? Apparently, a group of silent witches owns the mountains and practice voodoo on the invaders. That's as close as I get to describing the plot, but is there a good chance I'm away? Most important here is the atmosphere! "The Witches' Mountain" is occasionally very scary, with its scary music and interesting cinematography. All the supporting characters look mysterious and the rapturous Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. This is the kind of European horror movie that could have been legendary if someone had bothered to write a structured script.
