as an inspirational director, this movie was thrilling to watch with criticism in mind. Filmed with high-end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. The editing is good acting decent, sound effects are not too exaggerated. I would have given a 7 for an independent movie, but the story is not so interesting. It's more about the drama side, character development than a horror movie. <br /> <br /> It's not for those who want to scare themselves with scared fear, or sit with popcorn to just enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> Sincerely this movie would be nice if we were still in the 50's. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family that has a dry field, and that's just it.
