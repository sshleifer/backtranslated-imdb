I was very disappointed with this 1970 movie based on a story by Bernard Malamud. This is basically a story of possible redemption, racial prejudice and non-compliance with life based on mistrust. <br /> <br /> A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his seriously ill wife. If Morris Mishkin only believes in the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris basically gave up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When he believes, Fanny improves, but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly. It would have been great if there had been a translation into English in the last scene when Fanny died talking to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who has successfully run Miss. Kaminska in her brilliant Oscar-nominated show in 1966. Kaminska is reduced in the film mainly in bed scenes and her gentleness in her speech does not really convey the desperate situation she faces. calling for Ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying the Jewish religion.For most of the film, she does not notice the apparition of the Angel in her apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is confusing and the scene where the Angel's girlfriend confronts Belafonte in his apartment is memorable, but we all do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> Those who watch this movie must have left the theater in a state of depression and despair.
