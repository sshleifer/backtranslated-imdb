A very silly movie, full of stupid messages and Jewish references. It was a serious movie, but it could not be taken seriously. A familiar movie plot ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. An atrocious subplot involving Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and very regimented. I have noticed that Al Pacino's acting skills seem to be going down. A problem solver with problems, but nothing more troubling than the horrible Atlanta accent. Damage control needs to fix this damage from a movie. Okay, my linings are bad, but not as bad as the ones in this movie. This movie is not only annoying, but revolting as well. Usually, a revolting movie is watchable for the wrong reasons. This movie is unwatchable. I was able to sit down with that. The plot, if written a little better, with, perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplot, and even more idiot jokes, could have taken away this suspense of the slime. What remains is a silly and monotonous movie that made sure that it was punched in our heads that Eli Wurman was Jewish. An embarrassment to all good Jews everywhere.
