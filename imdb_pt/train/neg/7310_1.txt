** SPOILERS BELOW !!! Cabin Fever has my nod to the WORST movie of the year ... I've seen it is. This movie is straight from the GARBAGE! There is so much wrong with the movie that you can not help but be amazed at how bad it really is. This movie had a lot of potential to be good, but in the end did not do any of that. The characters were as dumb as one can be; for the whole movie you're just wondering "why would you do that?" or "what is your goal in doing this?" ... that's how illogical and stupid the characters are. We have no background in them, so of course you do not give a rat about their fate ... you could only laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - The 'whore' (Marcy), for example ... was she so excited that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no sense in it ... it's almost like the filmmakers need an excuse to give you the virus, so voila! UGH. <br /> <br /> Would anyone really go to the woods and drink tap water from a cabin without looking at it first? <br /> <br /> Why did not Bert shoot the sick guy? from the start? The movie would have been like this ... besides, they ended up killing him anyway. <br /> <br /> - Why did it take so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to walk? 'No, I'll wait until 2 of my friends are infected (one to one death blink) to finally choose to leave here. <br /> <br /> - What exactly was the rationale behind Paul's attempt to fish? the Hermit's body, only to fall into the contaminated reservoir and become infected with the virus? Pure stupidity! <br /> <br /> I swear that common sense was not a friend, let alone a knowledge of these idiots. I do not think there has been a worse ending to a movie. At first, the children asked the cashier's box what the rifle was, and he replied that "it's for the blacks." At the end of the movie, 3 young black men (dressed in loose clothes, one of them in a cloth no less) enter the store ... discover that the box was cleaning to be used for hunting. Then he begins to give them all the pounds and handshakes and play with them as if they were his companions. <br /> <br /> Ok, what the heck was the point that?!?!?!? How insipid can it be, what do filmmakers THINK about putting it in the film? I, as a black man, was offended by Nigger's opening comment. It was a meaningless and pointless remark. My question to the filmmakers: what was the end goal with the black boys? Was it to force me to forget the initial racist comment made earlier? To smooth things out with black spectators, making a joke out of it? Well, at least I did not find that pathetic attempt at humor funny at all. The whole movie was a joke ... a pathetic attempt to make movies that should not be given the time of day. Did Peter Jackson really think this movie is so good? What movie was he looking at? <br /> <br /> ZERO out of stars **** .... if I could give a lower rating than I would. Please, comrades of IMDb, do not waste an hour and a half of your precious life watching this abomination of a 'movie'. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
