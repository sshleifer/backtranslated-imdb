Devil's Experience: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies fall into two categories, those with a similarity of plot (Puxa, which is a lucky pizzeria) and those without (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's experience falls solidly into the last category. <br /> <br /> Of course the horror version of hardcore porn. An almost completely plot less 43 minutes of waiting for the shot of the money. Shot on video in 1985, it consists of three relatively non-descriptive Japanese boys who torture a rather uninteresting Japanese girl. Tortures range from the banal (hitting it 50 times, kicking it a hundred), the fool (tying it to an office chair and turning it around), the fear factor (a bath of worms and sheep guts) and finally the shot. (A well-pierced eyeball piercing). <br /> <br /> That's it, no plot, no motive, just Blair witch tree shots and torture. The girl seems bored and, except for shouting, "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition" during the scene of the office chair, I was bored. Staring blankly at the screen, waiting for the money shot. Just like hardcore porn.
