The original is a relaxing clock, with some truly memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, although not the worst of the sequels of DTV, does not have the brightness. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the lack of a story. Like Belle's Magical World, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. Magical World, although marginally better, still manages to make a mess in history. Among the vignettes, we see the mice at work, and personally I think the tricks of Jaq and Gus are the redeeming merits of this film. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best, on Cinderella getting used to being a princess. That's the best, because the rats were funnier here. The worst of the vignettes, when Jaq becomes human, is cute at times, but has a lack of imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia falls in love, was also cute. The problem was that I could not imagine Anastasia being friendly to Cinderella, for I regarded her as the wickedest of the sisters. This was also marked by a ridiculous sub-plot about Lucifer falling in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> The incidental music was very pleasant to hear, however I hated the songs, they were really uninspired, and nothing like Tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original. <br /> <br /> The characters were the strongest development here. Cinderella, though still caring, has lost her sincerity and much of her original charm, although she wears very beautiful clothes. The duke had some really funny moments, but they were not enough to save the movie, just like Prudence and the king. As I mentioned, the rats were the redeeming merits of the film, because only they contributed to the cuteness of the film. I have to also say that the animation is colorful and above average, and the dubbing was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> In short, a cute, though not original, sequel that was hampered by the songs and the lack of a story. 4/10 for rats, dubbing, animation and some beautiful dresses.
