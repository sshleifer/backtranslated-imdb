My personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and make this movie play for eternity on all the surfaces available in that room. The whole notion that Streisand plays a boy / man just begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous the premise of this film is. The most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of "voluntary suspension of disbelief." . . it is impossible to do this in this movie.
