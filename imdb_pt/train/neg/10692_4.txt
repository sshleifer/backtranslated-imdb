Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered when she went to Italy, tired of the treatment of Hollywood glamor. First she was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI, an artistic failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress. And now it's EUROPE 51, another boring exercise of soggy feeling. <br /> <br /> Nor does history do much for Alexander KNOX, in another ungrateful role as his suffering husband trying to comfort her after suicidal death. of your son. At least this one has better production values ​​and a more coherent roadmap than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive here but is moving toward a more matronly appearance as a wealthy society woman. She is never able to cope with the sudden loss of her child despite the attempts of a kindly male friend. "Sometimes I think I'm going crazy," she tells her husband. A portentous statement in a movie that is totally without humor or grace, but gives us a sense of where the story is going. Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve their emotional health, and from there the plot changes for the worse. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the movie is that it is not interesting enough to turn into a project. for a big star like Bergman. The film loses its rhythm in the middle of the story as Bergman becomes increasingly disturbed and her husband suspects that she is in two moments. The story descends from there after she nurses a wanderer through her terminal illness. The final thread of the plot has her husband needing to put her for observation in a mental asylum. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers nobly through everything (overcompensating the loss of her son), but no use. It's not one of your best movies, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Trivia note: If she wanted neo-realism with mental illness, she could have been better accepting the lead in THE SNAKE PIT when it was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak !! He would have done more for his career than EUROPA 51. <br /> <br /> In short: Another dark indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman.
