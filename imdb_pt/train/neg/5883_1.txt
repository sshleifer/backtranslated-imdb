This movie does not contain humor for those who lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me graphically of my own life experiences. This movie was the man's version of "Dear Mom". It graphically and accurately describes the life that many children of a father with mental illness pass. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to corrupt and act like God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it was funny. No way, I say! It's a sick humor at best. <br /> <br /> The film is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use for this movie is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe in what families actually live.
