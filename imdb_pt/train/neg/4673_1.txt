I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie, based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is mischievous and does not perform well. I wanted to photograph Maggie Smith ... or rather, her silly and tasteless role. The real problem and what is missing in this latest version is a good script, music and direction. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep in the movies watching this long, drawn-out, extremely boring movie. There are more pauses in the dialog box than a Pinter playback. In the book I felt a deep affection for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also did not like the turnaround in which your aunt has a sexual attraction for Morris. Eeeeeeeek YUK. <br /> <br /> See if you can not sleep, it's a definite sleep. Do not watch if you are depressed. You'll need Zoloft after that. <br /> <br /> Of course, "The Heiress" was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the lead roles. The actor who played his father was on the mark as the indifferent and cold father ... still suffering for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The film was not faithful to the book, but neither is this. <br /> <br /> This movie was a box office failure. I have no doubts as to why.
