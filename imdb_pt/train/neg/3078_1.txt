I did not think it was possible for a horror comedy movie to fail so deeply on both fronts ... really horrible. The fact that he does not take himself seriously (usually a good thing) works against him, mainly because the actors are so wooden that you would really swear they are reading tips cards. However, the MST3K version, as always, has some laughter ....
