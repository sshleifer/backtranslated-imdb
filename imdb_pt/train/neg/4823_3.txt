Lame Lame and two-dimensional script made the characters look like cardboard cutouts. Needless to say, it made it difficult to empathize with any of the characters, especially the groom; He looked and acted more like a cartoon. In summary, I think you could say that you were on par with your typical made for TV drama. He uses virtually every clich√© in the book. The tortured classical musician who wants to go out and play salsa. The free-spirited bride became embroiled in a personality she did not love. I will not list them, or else it would be a spoiler because I would be giving the whole plot. The dancing was OK but nothing special. I've seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was very tight. I saw it on YouTube. Luckily I did not pay much money to see in a theater. I'm still a bit shocked by the amount of great reviews that this movie has garnished.
