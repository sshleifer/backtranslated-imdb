So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that is clearly full of crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tons of reptile poop above mentioned, and mud, not just daily but with enthusiasm. He was never able to make me want to do it, but he managed to get his wife to come close. <br /> <br /> This movie does not fit into my parallel universe of movie category - movies for people who have just had their teeth pierced, have a migraine, or have no cinematic experience and therefore as silent mediocrity (currently well-populated by Disney movies). It is very noisy. Well, Steve is very noisy. He is so happy all the time, and would cut off the adolescent blas√© (I can hear now: "that movie was so STUPID") or Tylenol with codeine. I would say his enthusiasm is catching on, but if it was, I would have a room full of snakes, and that has not happened yet. I agreed that they are beauties, but I still will not caress them. <br /> <br /> The plot was indeed predictable. The thugs were so bad that for a minute I thought I was shopping on a consumer electronics superstore. But the movie was full of animals and Steve and Terri, and that's why I watched. This plot (if you could call it that) was really one more reason to throw another crocodile in a truck. My expectations were low and they remained that way. <br /> <br /> I was hoping, though, that there was a bit of a sequel, where Steve and Terri (having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with skin. I still can not believe we will not see Steve again. I hope that Terri and the children will continue to be involved in the Australian Zoo and the Discovery Channel at least. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me how forceful this crocodile is. Crikey!
