The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went to the heavy cast list should not have mattered if it had been staged with talent and imagination and some sympathy for the satirical intent of the original. Instead we have strangely bad song sequences and dances featuring beggars and quaint prostitutes, and the ultimate alienation is achieved by revealing that the action took place on a stage of a music studio, appropriately enough for a production that is more Lionel ' Oliver 'Blair than Brecht. The talent of actor is shamefully misused: Migenes and Walters are good, but do not have to try very hard: Migenes at least has a great voice and some feeling for the material. Julia looks perfect like Mack, but struggles with the character, tight with a fake plum accent. Harris's Peachum is embarrassingly behaved and Polly is atrocious. The adaptations of lyrics, script and music are often strange: it was a bad move to base the film on the Broadway version of Marc Blitzstein, but at least his words were sung, unlike most of which was interpolated in fidelity gestures. And the attempt to get past the low budget filming at claustrophobic angles in foggy scenes lit by blues and oranges as if by some sort of bargain, Vittorio Storaro, completely fails - the film seems cheap, poor quality and thoughtless. Shameful.
