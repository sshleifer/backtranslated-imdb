These were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that. So by the time I was 70, I was convincing myself that it was only a few more minutes, and it lasted until the end of which I'm kind of proud to regard this movie as a great test for human patience and tolerance. Was it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try and if you're strong enough, you can even last it to the end ... The movie has no coherence and the characters seem to have no sense at all . All the movie's happenings, you can be sure you've seen it somewhere before, and they seem to be placed in this movie just to fill the film roll.
