Now, I'm not a film critic, but I hated "September 11." This movie was generally bad. With the exception of the segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu, which was the most effective and direct on the subject, the short films were, at best, boring and, at worst, offensive. The worst in my mind was Youssef Chahine's pretentious segment, in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers, even suggesting that the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause. The segment was completely out of the question, and considering Chahine's apparent lack of decency, a waste of time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a film presenting their views on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was in bad taste.
