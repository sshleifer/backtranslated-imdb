One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obligated to express pleasure even in the less attractive films of the TCM library, as this would explain him extolling the "virtues" of this "charming" film during his performance when I saw this on cable. Seeing that any old movie about IMDb gets the 'classic' status of a number of flattering amateur critics, I thought there was an extreme need for a more honest review of that movie. <br /> <br /> This is not your father's name. Shop around the corner '. For all my puns with 'You've Got Mail', it still overcomes this as a remake in almost every imaginable way. For those who saw the original, the flaws will only be even more obvious. <br /> <br /> From one of the sequences of Meet Cute, I remember seeing (a sad attempt at 'humor'), this The movie begins on the wrong foot and never comes back to the point. This "musical" only qualifies as one in the most sparse sense of the term. There's a hint of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then Judy singing "I Do not Care" while shaking her arms as if in a convulsion. The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her best numbers here. Miss Garland has been wonderful in many musical films, but here she seems terribly mischievous. The paper was originally filled by June Allyson and Judy is definitely unable to refill Margaret Sullavan's old shoes. Van Johnson also transforms into a rather bland performance as a second type Jimmy Stewart. The clues never reach the chemistry of Stewart / Sullavan or even that of Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that knows (some) the notes, but not the music. It does not really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest to Van Johnson's character to complicate matters unnecessarily. Replacing the remake by the infidelity subplot of the original is a banal plotting device that involves an invaluable violin. It's almost embarrassing to watch and feel as if you've been taken from an episode of Three's Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flow condenser. It's really just an excuse for a Keaton fall. Even the high resolution scene among romantic leads is mismanaged. After seeing the two films, you'll understand why they called 'the Lubitsch Touch' and NOT the 'Robert Z. Leonard Touch'. <br /> <br /> Avoid this and watch the original movie again or watch Judy Garland. previous films, unless you are an iconoclast who likes to see a big star fall on the ground.
