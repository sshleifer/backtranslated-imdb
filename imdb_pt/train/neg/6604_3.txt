The first one was the best. The second sucked because the dialogue was terrible. Although the plot was not so bad (in fact, all stories are good and bad). Throughout the film, I dosed out a few times. I know Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expert, but he's not a good actor at Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was not good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible performance (But this is based on his screenplay). All the characters were not that good. But, some of the things I like at rush hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes. I know Jackie Chan does not do those things that are good for him.
