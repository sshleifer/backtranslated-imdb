This clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad cinema. Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of an ill-bred character in an ill-fated movie, thus creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The main purpose of the film is how a boy's temporary excursion to the Canadian desert after surviving a plane crash allows the disgruntled teenager to deal with his anguish in finding out his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately, it turns into a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two especially gaudy scenes involving a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is not just sitting in some alley somewhere dreaming about this movie. (and what a nightmare it is!). In addition, despite the harbingers of some critics on the family's visibility of the film, there are several scenes that are not suitable for very young children or to watch a family, including a graphic scene of the pilot dead underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded. > All in all, a terrible movie that no one should be subjected to, let alone innocent children.
