Alan Alda plays real-life writer "Sports Illustrated" George Plimpton, who has already been invited to join the Detroit Lions team as an honorary member. A disheartening and curious drama, curiously tempered with fantasy. Director Alex March approaches this material in an interesting way, filming it almost documentary (with macho comments) and still giving the story a whimsical touch of whimsy; yet bringing cinematic ostentation into this set-up, it turns the main narrative into a mess. Alda's presumptuous, uncharismatic performance is another drawback, although the support cast is filled with real-life athletes (and glaring at Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend - how's that for a fantasy?). * 1/2 of ****
