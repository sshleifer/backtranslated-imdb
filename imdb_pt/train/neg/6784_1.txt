I tried to watch this movie twice and even then quickly move the annoying parts but still have not gotten to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this movie * genuinely * got good reviews. I think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to liven up the movie for marketing purposes. His reviews seem very unrealistic and it seems like an internal work, which makes things more pitiful. Movies should receive true positive comments on their own and not invented !! <br /> <br /> The performance was reminiscent of a tacky pornographic film, and not in a funny way. I do not mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it. <br /> <br /> I found the main character annoying. Her facial expressions and mood were unbearably childish. I thought it was intentional to make the conspiracy of women seem more pleasant and founded, but they were even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very embarrassing (their bosses exaggerated in the business speech) and the sarcastic comments bland. <br /> <br /> I did not find anything redeeming about this movie apart from some of the attractive women. <br /> <br /> I never felt that a rating was so misleading. I was interested in his premise, but I fled for the rest. Sure, see if you want, but I did not want anyone else to wait. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
