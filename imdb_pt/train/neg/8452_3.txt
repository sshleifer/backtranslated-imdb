This is the first time I comment on a movie because I felt that if the right person read it, he could wake up and do something about it. In recent months, ABC Family has started to showcase a new movie format. I've seen the last three and enjoyed them. They were involved and did the trick. My wife likes these movies. I was anxious to see "See Jane Date". The trailers looked great. Unfortunately, this is a film in which the book must be light years ahead of the effort exhibited by the writers and musicians involved with this project. The year is 2003, the source (all bad), the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store. It was intrusive and added no emotional content to the film. It worked against that. I work in the film and television business. I like to have fun. This is an example where I kept thinking it could get worse. The script had lines from another decade and I know these women can act, but you would not know that in this movie. To add to the overall experience, the end left me shaking my head. Advice to executives at Disney, ABC, ABC Family and producers: Under no circumstances, do not hire the composer or music supervisor to make your future films. They have lost touch and need to understand what the word "contemporary", "present day" and "present" mean when describing a romantic comedy. There is a world passing through you. All in all a great disappointment from people in Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
