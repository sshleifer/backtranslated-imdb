I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, where their customs and locations echo real photographs taken from the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks just like the photographs taken that day from Blanche mourning her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes remain beautiful until the end, even after a full shot of holes (Bonnie was badly burned in a car accident in the year before his famous ambush, and did not look like a cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tedious, and the acting is bad, particularly the leaders. Very disappointing. Stay with Beatty and Dunaway. Theirs may not be "the true story," but it's a great movie.
