The movie is really very slow. There are some good pictures but they can not make up for the fact that the movie is really annoying. You see a sexual relationship with many watermelons and a sexual relationship while eating a melon and maybe a little more. It may seem interesting to someone, but believe me to watch it for 2 hours is not fun. Although you laughed several times, it is not enough and can be more of despair and disbelief than of fun. To disturb the director of boredom try to put some video clips from the movie to the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs, maybe from the 50's, but it's hard to say exactly and they're trying to be so funny that it's really sad. Several times you get the feeling that the plot can evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created, but in the end it just evaporates and that's it. Beside the clips, there are almost no dialog boxes, let alone music. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally I can not recommend the movie. I believe that art is something that should not be boring. During the projection, there were yawns around the movies, which only corroborates my brief review.
