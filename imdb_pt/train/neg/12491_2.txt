Hm Despite being a nice film to provoke plot holes, pointing to atrocious and primitive special effects (at best) (which led me to see this movie three times in the last six years), Severed is among the worst I've ever seen . visa. I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen at the crime scene on the dance floor. All in all, I really do not like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest is a mix of confusing dialogues and images that do not progress in history to a logical conclusion (which I can not remember anyway).
