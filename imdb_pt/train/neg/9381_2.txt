Mona, the tramp, lives on the fringes of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction. <br /> <br /> I've watched this because of all the stellar reviews, but I'm afraid I've missed something. Mona's character has little or no personality as she walks through life being rude to people, getting high and not contributing anything to anyone's life. It is not interesting or exciting. She's just useless. <br /> <br /> I have seen and met enough people like this: there is no secret meaning for what they are doing. They're just lazy bums. I would not want Mona anywhere near me, since she tends to steal anything that is not nailed down and leave her friends in trouble. Of course she's puzzling - because there's nothing for her. Many addicts, vagabonds and vagabonds I've seen are enigmatic; I would not want to see a movie about them either. <br /> <br /> Possibly there is something there that I totally lost. Otherwise, I'm assuming that all comments are from people who assume that anything done by a French director is high art.
