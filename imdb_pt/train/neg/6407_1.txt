I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. This is a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously, this movie is living proof that the formula works. If it is not broken, it does not need repair. A street hero still vulnerable, a former martial arts master hardened with a heart of gold and a serial killer with 'problems'. Pure magic.
