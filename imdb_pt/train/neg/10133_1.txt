Unless you are mentally ill or the toughest segal fan, you will tire of this horrible excuse for a movie in less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The Plot - Even for a Seagal movie, the plot is just plain stupid. I mean, it's not just bad, it's just consistent. <br /> <br /> The acting - unbelievably wooden. Literally seen best acting in porn. Ironically, this movie tries to profit from this audience that a "lesbian love scene" is totally worthy of pity. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - would not seem out of place in a 1960s sword and witchcraft movie. <br /> <br /> Unless you suffer from insomnia and exhausted all other cures, do not make the same mistake as me and buy this DVD because you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back. .
