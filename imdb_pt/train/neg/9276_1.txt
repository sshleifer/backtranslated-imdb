This is a really miserable little movie. It is true that the original (in) holy trinity was governed by the law of decreasing returns with the third, "The Final Conflict" degenerating into a ridiculous sub-plot midway through the film seemingly merely to provide the unnecessarily tortuous necessary deaths they have now became the whole reason of being of the series "Omen". But then fool this TV movie (do not be fooled by the widescreen aspect ratio of the transfer, this was and is strictly small screen) on the back of a series. of generously pleasant demonic refrigerators was unforgivable, particularly endorsed as it was, by executive producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I would give the plot if there were any, besides the usual death scenes (hopelessly attenuated for TV sensitivity) and some of the worst performances I have ever seen. Everyone involved in this project even the catering staff should be ashamed that this farce has come to the screen, much less disguised under the name of Omen. If a person is convinced by my comment to avoid this mess, I will feel better about it.
