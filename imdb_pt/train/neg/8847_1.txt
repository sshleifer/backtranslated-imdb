This US novel, 'Knots Landing' has all the entertainment value of being stuck in an elevator. Each episode contained plots like rape, murder, kidnapping, and drug smuggling, not unlike the plots of other theater plays of the period. As for the cast, I've seen better actors in a box of cereal. From the middle to the late 1990s, 'Knots' replicates contaminate U.K-Gold like a mountain of milk diapers. I regret to announce that I had to suffer because my mother was a big fan of the program and watched religiously. Although, since then, the reruns have been few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). The only positive thing that can be said of 'Knots' is the captivating melody of the saxophone's signature, later used as the title song for the I.T.V sitcom, 'The Upper Hand'. Great legacy that, huh?
