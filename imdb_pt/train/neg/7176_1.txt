I have nothing more to say, but it was horrible. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. And if certain actors do not want people to question their sexuality, maybe they should refrain from making more of those films. There was at least one visa that made me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think about what was happening that was cut from the movie. SHUDDER to know what went through the minds of the actors who made this film. Shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that occurred in the minds of the directors. Like I said before, it's a degrading mess. It's not even funny. As Ebert said about the movie Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, not a good story and not even a good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
