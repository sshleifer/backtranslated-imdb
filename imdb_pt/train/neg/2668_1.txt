do not be fooled into renting this movie. It has nothing to do with a death row escape, despite the title (English). I can not think of anything good to say about the movie. Poor acting, poor fitting, bad direction ... risible "plot", and the sound / music was so annoying, it's a wonder this movie does not come with a warning label. The only possible way to watch this movie and enjoy it is by its historical quality of cheesiness. They just do not make such bad movies anymore.
