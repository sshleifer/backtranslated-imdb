Best-selling writer George Plimpton (Alan Alda) takes on a task for Sports Illustrated. He must go incognito to the Detroit Lions training camp and attempt a position as a third string quarterback. He is quickly discovered by team members with Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. All the team finds it amusing to cause stumbling in the writer's determination to enter the Quarterback for a series in a real game. <br /> <br /> This film is the debut of Alda and also helped Karras to leave the football field to act. In addition to the 1968 Detroit Lions, the cast also includes "Sugar Ray" Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton. <br /> <br /> Alex March directs this story based on the book by Plimton.
