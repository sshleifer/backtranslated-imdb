Oh the hilarity! Oh the joy! Another movie that is so bad is good! Or so I thought. In fact, this loses the "so bad is good" phase and goes, unfortunately, directly to the "it could have been so bad, it's good, but they messed up everything and left it completely bad." <br /> <br /> To start your way too long. Cut half an hour and could have been more bearable. Then put in such ridiculous plots as "the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the Earth because he has all the food stocked and he will get rich if the mission fails!" Duh! Or the "talking bomb" plot device last seen in Dark Star. Guess what .... just like in Dark Star, the pump has a malfunction ..... hmmmm. Add a dash of "we can not get out of a kindergarten play" and you will have a solar crisis in a nutshell. Light relief should be in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we call it in this movie whose sole purpose in the film is to take a child around the desert and call the father Jack is not the kind of person who is not the only one who has a good sense of humor. film. <br /> <br /> My award for "Most of the ironic Line Delivered Straight-Faced" goes to Charlton Heston, who, meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages, comments that his son seems a little "out of shape" while he is standing there with his gut protruding over his waist and in dire need of a Captain Kirk corset. Also entertaining is the bad guy top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that made me think of Andy Warhol for some reason. <br /> <br /> Beyond of these hilarities, there is little to recommend this movie. The ending is a sequel copied from (but mercifully shorter than) the final sequence of 2001. Tips to take more advantage of this movie, if you are foolish enough to watch it, like I did: <br /> <br /> 1. Whenever the bomb speaks, imagine her name is Tarquin (trust me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. Whenever Chuck Heston is on the screen and you're about to to speak, avoid him reciting a phrase from Planet of the Apes, like "Take your filthy paws off me!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Whenever the female leader is looking stressed (this is most of the time), keep hoping against hope that she is having an aneurysm and dies soon. <br /> <br /> 4. During the endless scenes "the ship has broken again", keep waiting for technology / engineer guys to call a Scotty-ism like "You can not change the laws of physics!" or some of those crap. <br /> <br /> Other than that, do whatever it takes to get past you. I dozed in the middle of the road and woke up to realize that I had not lost anything, nor did the story (though laughable) advance. So do not worry about turning off some, you will not lose anything.
