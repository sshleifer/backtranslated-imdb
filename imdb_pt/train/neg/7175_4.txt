This may have been based on historical events, and we know that the producers of this TV documentary took liberties to make it more dramatic - I can live with that - but it was so poorly done! I was amazed by the unfolding of a crisis in the air, as everyone seemed calm, surely someone would have panicked, and that smooth flight, without apparent discomfort to the passenger - come! Not sure about the regulations, nowadays some of the airline's security stuff seems foolish OTT, but why take off the shoes before the emergency landing, common sense tells me this is not a good idea! The shots of this massive passenger plane down this remote runway were not convincing and fake. In fact it would have been an incredible sight to have seen from the nearby ground in this movie was out of proportion and looked like the model it probably was. The escape slides appeared in the front and middle emergency doors, but no one appeared to come out the front, though the fall was much smaller. The captain returned to the plane after the landing - why? this has never been explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to a lack of fuel, but there must have been some fuel circulating in the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of an explosion must have been a very real danger, even if the evacuation seemed almost slow and everyone left at the foot of the slides instead of going as far as possible, as I'm sure he would have done. There were just too many inconsistencies, mistakes and false actions in it. I would rather have seen a representation of the drama in real time and with a realistic movement of the plane portrayed. It had the potential to be quite exciting, but undoubtedly due to budget constraints they failed and made a feeling that a plane losing all the engines was no big deal, and you would plan safely until a crash landing, but no real danger ! - the reality, of course, is a little different!
