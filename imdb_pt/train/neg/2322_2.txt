I searched the entire video store to find this movie, being the big fan of elvis that I am, and I thought it was a big disappointment. kurt russel had most of the "elvis moves" down and the voice imitation was great, but elvis's voice-over dubbed just did not work for me. the voice did not always match the mouths of the russels, and it was difficult for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me to be perceptible. Also, there were so many discrepancies in the movie, people who do not know much about Elvis would probably think they were facts. The songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life, the time he picked up his first guitar is wrong, I'm sure his brother Jesse Garron was buried in an unidentified tomb, not with a large tombstone reading JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV movie, but they jumped on important events, like the special return, and dragged some scenes for a long time. if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis at his best rent, it's like this, or another elvis show. hearing and seeing Elvis's true preform is the only way to truly see his talent. (brilliant statement I know, but still ... go out and rent a good elvis flic.)
