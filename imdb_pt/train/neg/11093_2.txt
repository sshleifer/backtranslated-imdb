If this movie were about a fictional character, the film could stand alone and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" that are grossly unfair to Ruben Carter. Many of the minor facts were disregarded (Carter was not the number one candidate at the time of the killings, there is no evidence that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, such as apparently being stolen from a decision by Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable for those of us who saw the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful of Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around much more trouble than any normal person should be (been arrested several times for beating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter has never been, seeing his actions in the 60s and so far, when he refuses to talk to his son, a person that people can admire. Everyone knows that Jewison can drive, and Washington can take action, but why they chose that story as their vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so in need of a black hero that they need to distort the truth in all their biographical photos to make them believable? (Here's a suggestion How about Denzel making a movie about himself? Now that's inspiring.) Based on all the inaccuracies in the film, I would suggest passing this one.
