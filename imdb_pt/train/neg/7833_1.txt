I just saw the third week of Stephen King's Nightmares and Dreamscapes miniseries; that is, I've seen 6 episodes so far. I have to say the stories are really weak. I read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, a collection of short stories published long ago. I remember that most of the stories were average to bad, but there was one that was really great, if not great. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say is that just because this mini-series is from a collection of Stephen King's Stories does not mean that this will be good. In fact, if your previous collection of short stories is of any indication, then most of this miniseries will be medium to poor. <br /> <br /> In defense of Stephen King, I did not read these new tales. Maybe they are as good as stories in a book and are not easily adaptable to television, or it may have been the writers' fault trying to write an interesting script. Who knows. In addition, these short stories may have been made exclusively for this miniseries and not for printing purposes. Maybe that might have been the problem. If Stephen King had sent these garbage stories to an editor, I'm sure the publisher would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because, as it is, it's just boring. <br /> <br /> What is clear in all of this is that the problem is with the stories / script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some great people acting on it. <br /> <br /> Watching this mini-series really makes me appreciate those old "Twilight Zone" series.Each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and fascinating.I do not understand why this mini series could not perform feat I am sure that this miniseries had a fair amount of money to make a good miniseries, but unfortunately, something should not have been clicked. For example, this week, two episodes were shown. The first one involved a writer of horror stories who buys a picture taken by an artist who committed suicide. The writer begins to see changes in the image while driving home. Feeling uncomfortable, he throws away the painting, but continues to appear close to him (I'm not even going to mention the second episode of this week involving criminals and their looting because it was even more annoying than this and <br /> <br /> This premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing I was frustrated because there were many gaps in the story as well as strange materials that were shown that did nothing to help the story. After the last scene, I was left with more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series, but it was very aggravating due to poor stories / script. If it was a movie, I would have recommended that people wait for the movie to go live or something similar. I do not even recommend it to be rented at your rental. However, since this is on TNT, a cable channel, I would say that if you have not seen it yet, try for a week. If you do not like this week then you will not like the past or future series, as they all share the same boring trait.
