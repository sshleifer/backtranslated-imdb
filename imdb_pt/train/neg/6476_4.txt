I had high hopes for this movie because I loved the original so much. It seems that Disney, however, is trying to perfect the art of the bad sequels to the DVD. They deserve a razzie. Several, actually. I thought the idea had merit, but the music was absolutely horrible and the story was not much better. What happened to the good music that Disney used to have in your movies? Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... to Hercules and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. They've made so many great movies over the years that it's so sad that they have sunk to the point of making sequences that are not good enough to enter the theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is not an indication of what's coming to the Walt Disney Corporation.
