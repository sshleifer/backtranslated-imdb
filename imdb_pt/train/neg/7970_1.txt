If you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life watching it depends on how you like your horror movies. If you like them so damn horrible they are hysterical, watch out. Jigsaw is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen 'Long Time Dead'), and I say this as a fan of the low budget horror / gore genre and having seen a few good ones to compare it to, it with. I will not even go into the details of what makes this movie bad as it is, the only good thing about it is that it's so terrible that it's one of the funniest things I've seen in years. If you can find this for cheap rent it is definitely worth seeing if you were involved in doing so - shame on you. : o) IMDb needs to introduce a 0/10 ranking especially for this movie, it deserves it completely.
