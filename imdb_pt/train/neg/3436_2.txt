A girl is taking a shower without knowing that a serial rapist is looking at her through the skylight. Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone are hot on their trail but are not hot enough to find him after he kills, rapes and eats a girl's nipple. This is expected to be the end of the film. Not because it's too gruesome, but because the level of performance is horribly atrocious. Unfortunately it is not the end and, months later, the rapist is resurrected as a zombie by a group of Satanists. So he continues where he left off, with the detectives on the case again, this time a flying baby is after him too (do not ask). There have been very good low budget films (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty in the spring), but that's what's shaving the bottom of the barrel. Horrible acting, crappy dime store special effects, lame comedy attempt and oh yes, and the end sucks too. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul gets totally naked; Anne R. Key topless
