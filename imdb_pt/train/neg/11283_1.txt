I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a complete waste of two hours, the plot was thin and confusing, the prestigious training of players had a terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents. The camera work was a bit experimental in some places, and although you could see what the director was trying to convey, it made it even harder to watch. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of the narration throughout the film, almost as if the whole plot was being dictated to the public. The best performances had nothing to do with acting. In fact, probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people, although admit that he plays the secretary of the stereotypical office. Do not under any circumstances go and see this movie unless you need a reason to regain lost sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned money.
