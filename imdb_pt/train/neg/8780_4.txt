Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies. Soon after, he is approached by a dr. Price, an expert on Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), who claims to have received messages from Jonathan's wife, Anna, through various electronic devices. Is Anna trying to say something to Jonathan? Is this just a suggestion of something on a larger cosmic or supernatural scale? It's good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story with which he's stuck is complicated and absurd in some points; it's as if the movie does not know how to answer any of the questions it brings, so it just distracts the viewer with new, unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is very good, convincingly scaled Desperate Widow trying desperately to communicate with his late wife. He matured somewhat as an actor, leaving behind the friendship papers he played 15 or more years before. He looks a bit craggy, with perhaps a little more wrinkle than might be expected, but he has lost none of the cunning and pride he demonstrated during his quarter-century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So it's not that Keaton does. in a mediocre performance, is that the script itself is subpar. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more confusing as it advances, each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path. All this is good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable outcome, something that connects more or less everything and explains ... something. But not the white noise; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than before I first saw him. <br /> <br /> Keaton is really the only reason to watch this crap, although he gets the support of Ian McNeice (as Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as the requirement of love interest.
