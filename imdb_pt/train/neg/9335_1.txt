The reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so poorly written, and this is entirely the fault of the novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly banal and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A bankrupt couple - a locked American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamed - is snatched by a strong, self-directed criminal, and after some adventures (mostly terribly violent) alternating with scenes that show the hot killer, she leaves the partner impotent for the killer, who, no matter how bad, sees her more clearly than anyone before. Nothing can help this movie to succeed, not even the marked face of Scott Glenn as the killer, or the attractive latitude of Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz, and not even Harvey Keitel's brave acting as the CIA specialist assigned to track down the killer . A serious waste of time.
