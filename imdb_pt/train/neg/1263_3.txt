There's nothing like watching giant robots battling in a wasteland in the desert, and Robot Wars really delivers. Of course, the acting is terrible, the dialogue is insignificant and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! The special effects themselves are actually very good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but contain a minimum of graphics computing and instead use thumbnails, so it has aged quite well. Its flaws are easily ignored given the short running time of the films, and it has a certain ironic humor in parts that make it quite enjoyable. I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or science fiction who is looking for a joyous hour of distraction.
