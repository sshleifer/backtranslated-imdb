There are many pretentious people out there pretending that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning, and ignorant idiots like me do not "understand" it. Obviously, that means we should stick to the scum of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There's all the artistic clich√© in the book - I think it's good that the director is one of the few chosen. Almost a self-parody drowning in its own pretense. The director of the film (almost equally embarrassing) 'Ratcatcher' returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense; is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation. The best way to describe this movie is alienating to viewers.
