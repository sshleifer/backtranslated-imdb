As much as the B movies, the SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit down. A solitary high school student who is constantly chosen by peers and rejected by the girls, ends up entering his trailer mother having sex with a drunken hick. He then chases the boy in a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the souls of the children were transferred to a scarecrow, which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him, as well as the teachers. This scarecrow, in addition to having a direct line for each of its victims, can also make Matrix-like moves in the air and kill people on the sidewalks in broad daylight. Besides, why did he always look like a rotting corpse? As well as the two unnecessary sequels that followed, this is not even worth a laugh.
