This "movie" is more like a video clip. Kusturica said in a 2004 interview that when he's making movies, he feels like making music, and when he's making music, he feels like making movies. The best thing in "Promise me this" is the song, written by Stribor Kusturica. Kusturica said in the same interview that, for him, the dialogues in the movies are like noise. "Promise me this" has very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I like "Life is a miracle". It was also like a video clip in the first 30 minutes and a few moments later, but it had a nice plot. "Promise me this" has no plot. I was expecting this movie with high expectations, because I read, that the script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite writers, who also participated in "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica they are "noises", and to my regret, I only saw two dialogues, which I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director to make his music video chaotic for the music of his son Stribor. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for "Time of the Gypsies" and "Black Cat White Cat") said in an interview that Kusturica never follows the script. "White cat black cat" was the only script, to which Kusturica said, that he will not touch it. According to Gordan Mihic, after all Kusturica returns to the script, and if he does not, he does not make a good movie. And I think this is the case with "Promise me this". He should have followed the script of Ranko Bozic. <br /> <br /> "Promise me this" is considered a "comedy", but a few moments ago, which made me laugh. The comic moments are in the same "black cat white cat" style, but they are not so funny. I think the difference comes from the fact that "white cat black cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. <br /> <br /> However, I know some people, who liked "Promise me this", they find very positive film.
