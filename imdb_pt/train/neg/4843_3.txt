Well, I had also heard all the reviews and comments on how this movie deserves the Oscar for best film, so I went to see today. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read the other comments, you will learn from members of the US military who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are. They mirrored my own thoughts; as the movie played, I - a complete civilian - kept thinking to myself: "say what? there is no way this can happen ..." 2) There is very little that really happens in terms of plot. A new bomb detainee appears to replace one who was killed (a death that is not clearly explained). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush of his work. Your attitude puts others at risk. THAT'S IT! 3) This movie is far from being as suspenseful as alleged. If you want to suspense try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally powerful, try renting the Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and starring Burt Lancaster (who told me personally at a supermarket meeting that it was a movie he was immensely proud of and one that he saw as some of his best works, and that he was still upset, had been largely ignored following the Apocalypse Now), or an old classic black and white WWII Sink The Bismark, who , especially for an English film, is incredibly painful. Do not waste your time on Hurt Locker.
