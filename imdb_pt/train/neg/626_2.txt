The spirit of a murdered high school nerd encourages a scarecrow that then avenges itself all. <br /> <br /> This movie really bothered me. He has a great monster, has some good low budget effects, a bit of atmosphere, but manages to short-circuit good and bad things. Halfway through, I began to move forward quickly and then go through the chapters of the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problems with this movie are many. First, the cast seems to be about thirty years old and yet, they must be in high school. You do not believe in anything from the beginning. The scarecrow, though it sounds great, is not much beyond that. He says stupid linings and moves in a way more designed to be funny than scary. Is this a comedy or a horror movie? It's a problem that goes beyond liners for much of the dialog and configuration. It looks more like a bunch of cliches than sincere horror movies. I as some expect the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind, horror fans who want to mock the genre instead of hugging it. <br /> <br /> Despite the good looking monster this is a movie to avoid. Even if you pick up the bargain box for less than five dollars, you're paying a lot. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
