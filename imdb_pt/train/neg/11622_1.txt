Dave is going through a divorce and his mind goes back to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I should say he fixes on his girlfriend last. He remembers the day the relationship ended. The dream sequences only miss the nebulous transitions. He fondly remembers his favorite songs and places that they were. I'm not an advisor, but maybe this has something to do with the failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets a woman who is half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being "turned off" by his shiver, begins to take an interest in him. Did I mention how scary Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He does not move his arms when he walks too. It's weird. Too much of a long story short, Dave plans to hunt down Mary (the old friend gallant) and kill her ... err ... I mean confront her. He does that. Which was really scary. He believes she is married, but he still flies halfway across the country to meet her. He arranges his house to make sure she is alone before he "falls" into her. He has an unpleasant conversation with her, which ends with sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and returns to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mainly for unintentional comic value. I'm still entertaining the wife with my impressions of Dave ... "I heard another song from Dave and Mary!"
