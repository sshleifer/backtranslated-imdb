Think of "play". It is worth seeing once for the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. Organize Melvyn Douglas in "Ghost Story" with Melvyn Duglas from this movie. Are there loose vampires in this "Bavarian" village, or is there a more natural, albeit equally sinister, explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, who is cast as a particularly stupid character. It's fun to look at your different facial expressions in what is actually a stock character. It does not happen much for long, but then we find out that Atwill's pipe-smoking doctor is the real killer. There is a lot of "comic relief," but that goes for the course of this age. Fay Wray sounds pretty good.
