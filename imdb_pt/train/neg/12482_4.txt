Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and is starring Rick Hill, who is some kind of bodybuilder and famous for it, if I get it right? The plot follows as Death Stalker (Hillstalker) tries to get something back from the evil lord, and he has to travel to the Lord's Cave. He encounters many dwarves and monsters during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien and, of course, to Conan the Barbarian. This is a great success for Conan, and despite being a very stupid movie, it has many good merits and is recommended for fans of junk and tolerate movie addicts! <br /> <br /> There are not many cinematic merits in this movie. Some scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker focuses on to show are naked women and huge Hill muscles. Women are usually helpless and very stupid victims too, so this is a very macho movie and therefore may not please many feminists! The fight scenes are nothing special and very boring, and the monsters are nothing special. And all the other aspects of the movie are also very amateurish and poorly done, but what do you expect from a low budget effort like this? This tries to be as good as Conan, but fails a lot. As I said, this may please the fans of the turkey cinema, but no one else. This belongs to the category that is so bad that is great! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is not yet as bad as it could be, and like a turkey movie, I appreciate it almost as much as other turkeys, the nice ones. clear! If bad movies are your cup of tea, try this and have fun, but if you do not understand "fun and bad movies," stay away. And if one does not bear a great deal of nudity, then stay away too. There is more nudity than violence and because of these scenes, the movie has an R rating. Otherwise, this could be some PG family safe movie! <br /> <br /> 4/10
