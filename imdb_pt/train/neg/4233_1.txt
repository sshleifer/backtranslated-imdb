I could not believe I spent $ 14.00 on this. The only quality left is the scandalous wound. The dubbing was worse than any I've ever experienced. It looks like it was filmed with a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig was spent on special effects because there was so much blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen but I have to recognize the abundance that was not as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so silly and unbelievable
