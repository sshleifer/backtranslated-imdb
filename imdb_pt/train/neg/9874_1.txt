A fabulous book about a fox and his family doing what foxes do. who is stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try various ways to solve the problem. They are, of course, "lost" at every step and while the trio are camped in the fox's hole, the family makes attacks on the three ranchers. <br /> <br /> The "movie" version, and I use the term film very loosely, is more of a terrible god pastiche of American assault movies particularly the Oceans films. They even have George Clooney as Mr Fox to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story completely completely. So congratulations to them. They will make lots of money and destroy another Roald Dahl's classic children's book.
