Okay, admittedly as an Orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I'll be a bit biased against this movie. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's sole purpose in making this film was the orthodox attack. With our wigs, modest clothes and separate seats, we're a pretty easy target. Yakin never crossed the surface. The result is a movie with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia that he loves him more than G-d or his parents. So he deliberately defies his father's order that he not go swimming because of his weakened health. 2. Sonia turns out on her son's bris. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe she's never been to one before. Let's face it, even the Reformed Jews have bris milah ceremonies nowadays. 3. Was Mendel asleep during chosson's classes? He should satisfy the passions of his wife in bed and refrain from kissing her on the street. Especially in the middle of Boro Park's busiest street! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to have been married for over a year, and he just now realized they were not meant for each other? A small arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to pick up the first man her parents set her up with. Nor will it be avoided by the community if the marriage does not work out. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business so badly, she did not have to go through her lecherous cowardice. There are orthodox doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia was more annoyed than nice. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat down and waited for things to happen, and then complained that she did not like the result. This is not standing for the environment; this is favoring the stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved.
