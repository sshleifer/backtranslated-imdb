Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... Full of cliches, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. If you have nothing better to do, however, it provides 40 minutes of simple and unpretentious entertainment, endless looks for great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. On the other hand, if you're looking for something more than that, stay away ... <br /> <br /> Oh, and by the way, if you've ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running a , you have two choices: 1. You will feel sick every two minutes for the sheer stupidity and foolishness of how the show features Business Hotel or, 2. Look at it as a science-fiction comedy like I did, lie down, relax and Laugh it!
