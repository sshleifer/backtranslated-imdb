This sequel is completely uneven, incoherent and disconnected in "plot" (if there is one) and tries to be very difficult to be modern (ridiculous, out of character period and 21st century style predominate) and cute (yawn: there are many manufactured jokes and breastfed with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot. Even Glenn Close (and she's usually very good) rummages through this movie, parodying herself as the original De Ville and the lead on Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that is not even good to see. This is a good example of a bad and pointless sequel. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, characterization, and acceptable acting. This doesn `t happen. This is bad.
