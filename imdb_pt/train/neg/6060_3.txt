There is this girl and she is running in the forest, but she ends up in this woman's clinic and she wants an abortion. Your dad is out in a van and he's all pissed off about it. The whole episode takes place inside and outside this abortion clinic. I'm not really pro-choice, but I wanted the choice to kill this episode. I was laughing when I saw the baby leave and he went to the corner. The part where they were doing the ultrasound was also very funny. I was really feeling sorry for poor dad in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter and I could not blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I was laughing a lot and I suggest watching "Pick me up" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode, but it was not so good.
