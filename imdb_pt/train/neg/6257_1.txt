SPOILERS Strange people with generous tastes have reviewed this movie. Allow me to add balance by pointing the following: Script: Dreadful. As Tom and Dan are "getting to know each other", fighting over movies, the conversation is clearly one person's, and I suspect it was the director, who worked his words carefully to look smart. At one point, Dan asks, "Have you heard of the HIV virus?" and sounds as natural as asking, "Did you communicate with the nine alien races?" Performance: White teeth and a sculpted face do not make a sensitive performer. Speedman did well enough with what he was given, I suppose, but Marsden was terrible-unfriendly, unbelievable, and frankly smug and stupid throughout his captivity. There is a void in their performances (see also Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Lot: Spare me! The mid-flight moments were not exciting, but annoying and weak. Remind Marsden by pretending to try keys at the door and then throwing them down: "They do not work, man!" Tee-hee And beware of the flashbacks in semi-black and white, which are started with some schlocky sound taken from CSI and other crime dramas. <br /> <br /> Most important of all, the most dangerous, the evil and the offensive, is homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a movie in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan may have taken the condom or not used it - excuse me, where was Tom while they had sex? There are some insider partner vilanisms that stand out as a villainy of gay men in general. <br /> <br /> In short: Be careful!
