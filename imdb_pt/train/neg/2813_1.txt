Usually I would never rent a movie like that because you know it's going to be bad just looking at the box. I rented seven movies at the same time, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, I discovered that the guy from the videostore gave me the wrong tape. In the box of Wes Craven's new nightmare I found this film lame. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly annoying, the acting is bad and the plot does not make sense. It's hard to write a good review because I have no idea what the movie really was. At the end of the movie you have more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> On the 'Max Power's' scale from 1 to 10, I rate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I would like to correct the Corinthian review (just below mine). He says Robert Englund is stealing lingerie, riding bareback, etc. The guy who did these things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not by Robert Englund.
