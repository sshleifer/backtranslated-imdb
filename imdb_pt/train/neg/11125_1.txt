Hey, look, deal with it, there are far better portrayals of black America's difficulties than that. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story, which I mentioned, blows. <br /> <br /> This was done in the mid 80's and is horrible in the music / score department. It's funny to see Oprah as a kind of last-day prostitute. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Bigger buries Elizabeth McGovern in the incinerator. Pure classic cinema. First, I do not care how drunk you are, you will react to the 1200F grade flame (no matter how bad your acting). But they really milked that scene ... it was comical. I will tell you what, however, I was very pleased to see Elizabeth McGovern burn in a false death; She irritates me.
