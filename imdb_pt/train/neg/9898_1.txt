This version of "Moby Dick" insults the public, claiming it is based on Melville's novel, even going so far as to show a false first sentence of the chapter, instead of the famous "Call me Ishmael." In addition to having atrocious atrocities, even from John Barrymore, this is perhaps the best example of how Hollywood (especially the first Hollywood) would review and change a famous novel just to increase its chances at the box office. The beautiful poetic language of the novel has been absolutely eradicated, and Ahab has been transformed from a mad, obsessive madman to a evil-looking hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after his fianc√© (!) Departs from him after seeing his wooden leg . To this is added the standard evil brother who wants the groom to himself, and a different end!
