I had never heard of this, so I discovered that it is the man with the deadly lens, which I had heard of but did not see. Connery's presence led me to buy it, and it's no good. He wants to be a kind of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but that's not funny unless you find the name General Wombat (?) Funny. It appears as a 1970s flat thriller until the last ten minutes, when it comes to life. There are many flat scenes in the White House between the president and his aides that do not work. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited to get to the whole plot of the nuclear bomb rescue and the suicide attacks, which I think are made to be played by laughter, but again, they are not. how funny. The local footage is great, but the studio stuff looks like cheap TV. I could not believe the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did that. Just laugh: Connery throws off his wig before putting on his helmet and hopping off a plane. It never seems like a genius.
