<br /> <br /> The movie begins as a comic hero movie. It is about the boy who is chosen, has no parents and is madly in love with the school # 1 girl. Nothing surprises in the movie, there is nothing that you can not get into the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that either he is not a good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like that. Maybe children around the age of ten might enjoy the movie, but it's a bit violent for the younger generation. You can not help but think of movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All these titles are better. I almost quit the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good, though, was the computer animation, BUT even that is not something to put on the Christmas tree! So, my recommendation: do not watch this movie even if you get paid for it!
