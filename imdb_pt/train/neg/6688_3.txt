This movie is very bad, but I have some interesting information about it: It was filmed in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. A good part of the movie extras are NAU theater students. I was a freshman that year, at the theater, but for some reason I did not get involved with the production. However, I met several people who did and can provide this rather strange fact: There is a scene in this film where two of the directors, as part of their trotting ritual, have to run naked into the wood. They are seen from behind in the movie, doing just that. The thing is, these are not the actors, but two guys I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "later stunts" will remain anonymous, at least for this site, unless they decide to "reveal" themselves!
