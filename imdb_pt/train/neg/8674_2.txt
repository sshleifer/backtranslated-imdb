The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" have an exaggerated charm: it begins with texts from the Bible (the part that Samuel Jackson recites for his future victims in "Pulp Fiction"), continues with two karate classes. teachers in New York discussing the eternal question of mankind (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba appears, interpreting himself; he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, intentional or unintentional, is soon overwhelmed by disjointed history, lack of action for long periods of time, and the poor quality of any present action. For simplicity, see "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable movie to watch: 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are almost no fights. <br /> <br /> 3) The struggles that exist are short and terribly filmed. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is beautiful, her face is glorious. It's only for them that I give "The Bodyguard" a 2nd star in 10. This movie 87 minutes seems like 5 hours.
