Outstanding and not memorable remake of an old and celebrated English film. Although it may be excessively vilified as a total disaster (which it is not), it never builds any tension and betrays its TV origins. Richard Burton dreams of his role, and the closed face of Sophia Loren (in this film) also does not show much passion. (**)
