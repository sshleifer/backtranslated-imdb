I give this marriage 3 years and that is to stretch it. Adrianne Curry has her dirty, spoiled, controlling, noisy mouth, and her bi-sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris that he has an image to protect and should avoid the strip clubs. He married her. Chris has low self-esteem and a different tempo. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry, but this combination will not have a happy ending forever. His mother said he was an old cock and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth. Here 2 very good people who will end up in a nasty divorce. I do not think your old "Brady Family" will fit into your new life. I see them being excluded. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. She leaned against him and was there for him.
