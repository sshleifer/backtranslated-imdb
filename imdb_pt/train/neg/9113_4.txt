They had such potential for this movie and they crumble completely. In the first Cruel Intentions, we wondered what motivated the main characters to become the way they are and to act the way they do. There is almost no character development in this prequel. In fact, it's a very sad story, but this movie did nothing for me. It was as if they'd let go of good writing instead of unnecessary words. And the end makes absolutely no sense and explains nothing. The writing was simply terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used at least 3 of the EXACT SAME lines that were in the original. Such as "low boy" or the kiss scene, and a few others I do not remember. I was not impressed by Robin's acting, but Amy did a great job. That's the only thing that reconciled this movie.
