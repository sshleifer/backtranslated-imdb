With a cast list like this, I expected a lot better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the film lying in bed. The best actresses in the world can not do anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the film. The plot summary says a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother approaches death. The thing is she never says anything to her daughters except puzzling advice to be happy. All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped. I also felt that the comings and goings between the past and the present were unnecessary. It seemed that the idea had been stolen from the book The Da Vinci Code, in which the device was used to increase suspense, or from the Notebook where they used the device to create the endless novel of the main characters in the story. Anyway, it was a cheap device in this movie because it did not work to create anything. It was a way to try suspense in a movie that has none. I came out wondering why good movies can not be written for women. It was really a disappointment.
