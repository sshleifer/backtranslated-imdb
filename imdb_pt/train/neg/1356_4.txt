I first and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this "spoof". Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally presented the film at the screening I saw in Chicago. He has worked on the film for years and is the first in a trilogy intended. "What is it?" is the attempt of Crispin Glover in an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by Herzog, Lynch etc. <br /> <br /> I had heard rumors of that movie years ago "epic porn movie with all the down syndrome cast headed by crispin glover". When it finally came out I watched the trailer online and read the synopsis and I was foaming in the mouth with anticipation. I went to chicago to see and it was a big disappointment. If he took the fool, like the grandmother who smoked marijuana and the dancing dolls, he would get something much better, but only 10 minutes long. <br /> <br /> In other words just watch the trailer, have fun and leave it like this. There are some striking images and juxtapositions and fantastic phrases, but their lack of focus is a disappointment.
