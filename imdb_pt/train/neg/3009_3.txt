This song keeps buzzing in my head. It's not the best song, but it's the '80s. This movie is about a vocalist who "is supposed to be dead while he is accused of murder while chasing his girlfriend, who sings supporting vocals in his band. The singer whose name is Billy "Eye" (yes, right) is dead after two years and his band returns to a concert that the vocalist reserves the vocalist this time. Billy chases her and eventually goes around killing all these people and terrorizing the girl and making people around her think that there is something wrong with her and that she is imagining things. She finally decides to go to a graveyard and dig up her grave to see if it's still there. She sees that he is dead, but still sees and hears his voice. During the end of the movie, we discovered the reason behind it all, Billy has a brother named John (right again) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to go back to him and put blame his brother and then get his girlfriend and terrify her because she called him crazy. The ending is very shocking and the acting is very lame and wood. But .... I do like it anyway. I watch by the music. I wanted to have this.
