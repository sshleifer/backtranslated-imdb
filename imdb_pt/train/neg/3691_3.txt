I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant at first, but Baba was a big disappointment. Between a horrible plot, the action and the songs were just mediocre. The plot becomes very boring. Instead of competing for a position as NTR or MGR, Rajni almost seemed to be in charge of the next great guru of Tamil Nadu. My wife tells me that since this movie came out, Rajni stopped making more movies! <br /> <br /> We were lucky initially to have bought Babu (an oldie from Sivajiganeshan) online by accident when we tried to buy this one. .... it was a great movie, which made up for having bought this drug ... except that it makes Baba seem even worse in comparison! <br /> <br /> Bryan
