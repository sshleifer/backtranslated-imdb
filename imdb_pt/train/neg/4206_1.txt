I was at the film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the writer / director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one bothered to ask anyone. Rarely has a movie been so misdirected (why the random pictures were taken from some scenes?), Acted unhappily (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional range from A to B. It parks on A and brings a lunch) and totally unhelpful. Characters behave completely outside the character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. Finally, the movie comes to a completely random and purposeless ending that supposedly makes you think. Unfortunately, what you think is, "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life that I will never return."
