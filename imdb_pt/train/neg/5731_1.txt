I watched the unrated version of this movie and realized about 30 minutes when I was never getting my time back. I persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would eventually become realistic, the special FX would really seem special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I am a complete gore dog. I cite some of the 80's movies among the big names in the movie world. However, this was not done in the 1980s, if that movie had been released in the early 1980s, the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad. That is not how you do not have this defense. The dialogue is terrible, with so many bad lines that I was shaking with writing, instead of squirming with torture. I do not like Hostel, I never did, I thought it was over rated, more hyped and felt nothing to the protagonists, however, it shines like a beacon to the grandeur next to this rubbish. The back of the Live Feed cover promised a twist that you'd never see coming, I'm still waiting for the turnaround that was promised.
