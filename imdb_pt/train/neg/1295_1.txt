This is seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love Japanese movies, and I think another movie from the same director, 80,000 v electric dragon, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie - Asano is a fantastic actor and the plot was immensely appealing. but I could not find anything fun about it. <br /> <br /> The film takes forever so that nothing happens. and the effects the director wore-such as constant percussion and exorbitant slow-motion use-only added to my growing annoyance with the fact that the plot was so frighteningly slow and the actors openly exaggerated. much of the boredom was the result of unnecessary additions that were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent in asano walking around cutting Buddha statues and proclaiming how he does not worship anything. that added nothing to the plot. a Japanese movie buff and I were constantly checking the time. We could not believe that this movie was as terrible as it was. and the end was horrible. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for getting through, but unfortunately I was wrong.
