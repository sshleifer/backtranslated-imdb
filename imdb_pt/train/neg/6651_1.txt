This is absolutely the worst movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> First, I'll say that the acting was very good, and all over the cast. <br /> <br /> This was apparently intended to be very eccentric and, in that regard, succeeded. Likewise, the story revolves around a self-centered pretender, who is a chronic liar without talent and without talent, whose source of self-confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers. <br /> <br /> This was worse than watching a car accident.
