Description: Corny, totally stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and annoying that it will make you wonder why these abnormally stupid people wasted 2 months or more to spend a budget (think this ...) probably no more than $ 700 to make this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I'm giving you the best advice in the world: Save, save time, life and money, NO - I repeat, I do not even wonder if you should see this movie. This movie is so tacky that it will make your face look purple from indignant boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You can really admire this. (Like I said before, if you have a one-digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 actors, some puppets you bought in a garage sale and of course cameras and music, I gaurentee you will make a homemade video a little more fun than this absolute crap.
