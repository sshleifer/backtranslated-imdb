Bangville police reportedly marked the premiere of Keystone Kops, in honor of the studio where they worked. In this, however, they do not dress in silly clothes or drive the fast car that is their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a farm girl who begged her father for a calf. Later, she sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. One responds and the pursuit continues. Then Mabel knocks on the door as soon as someone is coming. It turns out it's her mother who jumps to the conclusion that thieves are there! So while Mabel blocks her door with furniture, mom and dad try to get in on the action! This was perhaps the most fun part of the short, along with some police car blasts. This was a short 7 minute ride that went so fast that it ran out before we started. The only real characterization that is developed is that of Mabel, who exudes charm only with her face and large eyes, and seems so optimistic and cheerful here, except, of course, when she is afraid. It's easy to see why she has become a star. It's largely because of her that I recommended seeing this at least once and why I'm giving it a 4.
