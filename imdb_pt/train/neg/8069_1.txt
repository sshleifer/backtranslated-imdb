An incoherent mess with a deafening soundtrack, "Soul Survivors" is the latest entry in the horror film genre "Who's Dead and Who's Alive". Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, are getting ready to go to different colleges, but before they split up until Thanksgiving, they take part in a late party at a rave party at a church burned at the suggestion of lush. Annabel slut (Eliza Dushku, aka Faith, the other vampire slayer). Scary and unmotivated people start paying close attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and in a short time the quartet leaves the party. Going away in their SUV, they are pursued and then passed by the scary and ruthless guys who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional action in the middle of the road, causing an unpleasant and fatal accident when the SUV goes over a landfill and plunges in a river. Sean is dead (or is he?), And Cassie spends the rest of the movie dealing with loneliness and guilt (she was driving) when she is not being haunted by Sean's ghost or chased by those scary and unmotivated guys. Many unexplained inconsistencies follow as Cassie's state of mind degenerates further, until we reach the predictable conclusion. So who is dead and who is alive? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who really cares?
