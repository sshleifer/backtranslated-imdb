How sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise reduced to making that horrible excuse for a movie. Tina still looked fit and attractive, but for some reason looks really scared. I can understand her fear; fearing that this 3rd rate stench would somehow be released to the general public. Besides, I'm a fan of the nice Adam West. Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and in great shape to a man his age. His performance here is passable, but the script is so bad that it is difficult to even hear the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The film is an assault on Brando's classic motorcycle movie, The Wild Ones; Outlaw motorcycle gang is out of control in a small hick town. The motorcyclists here look like a motley group and I'm sure they did not want them to date my sister. The performance is hard and wooden, and the story is as old as the sand. Hellriders is the hell to watch!
