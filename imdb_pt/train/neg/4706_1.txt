That's right, you heard me that this movie is a damn ABOMINATION. First, the band, who the hell is going to see or hear a band called "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! It's not just the terrible name, but the musicians can not play anything either! In addition, the vocalist sounds more feminine than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is horrible! They are not just terrible musicians, but they are terrible actors. Led by a director of poor quality and fine plot, this has to be the most idiotic movie ever. I would like this website to allow you to use a ZERO OR BELOW vote of 10, because giving this dirt a 1/10 is being very generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if you can call this a comedy movie. If you're looking for comedy with music, go to the guy "Weird Al" Yankovic because he does it a lot better than these pre-talented ones.
