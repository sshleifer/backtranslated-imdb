Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The acting, the dialogue, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the plot. I actually can not say anything positive about this, although I like Swedish movies. The fight scenes are so ridiculous that it's impossible to take it seriously. And when the main character loses his shirt while dodging bullets in a strip bar, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke, or does anyone really think these are ingredients in a good movie? Regina Lund is the only descendant of actor, but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions. It makes you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this ...
