I got this movie because I worked in a movie store, so I got free rentals. It went in and the cover made it look good. Nice, carrying a gun, okay, I'll take a look. <br /> <br /> Oh man, bad move. That was so awful, I spent half of the movie watching on fast-forward to get to nudity, which was minimal. I think maybe there are three scenes of partial nudity. <br /> <br /> Cheese dialogue, shitty violence, poor excuses of characters. I feel bad about putting this movie on the ground because I know it was done on a cheap budget but it was also "Clerks" and it became a cult classic and a franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
