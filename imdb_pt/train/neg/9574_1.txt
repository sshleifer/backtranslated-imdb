This has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Only when I think I have seen the most stupid scene in history does an even more dumb and bizarre scene emerge. I think travestis poodles did it for me, or rather, her tongue talking ... or maybe the guy picking up the statue of the virgin mother on a jeep windshield stuck in her throat. Decisions decisions ...
