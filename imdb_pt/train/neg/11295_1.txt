I understand that this film is made for children and as a parent I have been watching a lot of movies that do not particularly interest me, but I can appreciate, from a constructive point of view, how it is being received by my children. Parents should be encouraged, after all, to participate in their children's activities and monitor the quality of the entertainment they watch, so there must be something pleasing to an adult audience on some level, even in children's films. Disney has always understood that, and that's why it's so hard to understand how to let such a full-length piece of Drek get its name. <br /> <br /> Technically, the editing of the sound is awful and all the sounds of dialogue are overcome. dubbed and unnatural. Personally I hate it, but it was doubly horrible considering that the dialogue itself seemed to have been written by a 12 year old for a school project. The "acting" reminded me of a school play and none of the children's actors had any kind of emotion in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short film. <br /> <br /> Now before leaving as a video-geek measuring a children's movie with an adult cue, the only thing that can save even the worst children's movie is a positive message. Far from me determining how a message should be delivered as long as the right message is sent. Let's take a walk in this movie to see what messages are given: <br /> <br /> If you're lost, do not worry, you'll inevitably find your way home. <br /> <br /> Approach wildlife without any fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition just because you "know" it can. <br /> <br /> And my favorite, the final message left in the movie: <br /> <br /> It's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right.
