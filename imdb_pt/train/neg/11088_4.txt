This is an OK movie, but it has no real depth, either emotionally or in terms of storytelling. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none, also without real suspense. <br /> <br /> Washington is credible in leadership but he is sleeping walking through it, there is no room to flex any muscles acting for him or the support cast. <br /> <br /> The story simply gets a little boring, even though you've never heard of the title character, the ending was obvious, but unlike other films about such injustices, it has no emotional impact, you do not it matters with him and with the motivations of those who are outside. than worrying about their well-being. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to inject some emotion using the kid outside that the hero loves Carter, but this seems forced. <br /> <br /> It's an OK movie, but instantly forgettable.
