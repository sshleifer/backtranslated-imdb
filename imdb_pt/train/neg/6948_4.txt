One interesting idea (four African American women crushed under the heel of society's boot assert themselves by robbing banks) is ruined by F. Gary Gray's terribly slow direction and an excruciating script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full of unintentional moments funny Instead of presenting a keen commentary on the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men mistreat and humiliate them cruelly, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to beat their unsuspecting audience with intellectual notions of operatic tragedy. It is melodrama at its worst. Gray causes his actors to lose every weary line and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to take the slack, opting to keep his camera trained on the confused faces of the artists. And they are confused: although actors like Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress she is an excellent rapper), they need a safer hand than Gray to guide and as a result, they come out so strident and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Stay away.
