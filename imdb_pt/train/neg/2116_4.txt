The horror images of Poverty Row from the 1930s and '40s depressed the hell out of me. God knows I have nothing against low-budget movies, but those produced in that period have such a gloomy and poor look - and ultimately they are not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more fun than the "Bottom of the Barrel Dreck," such as "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man," but it's not classic. Bela Lugosi, far beyond her apogee "Dracula", represents another mad doctor; the unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a dubious young reporter (Luana Walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also on hand, which can appeal to hardcore fans of the 1930s and 40s.
