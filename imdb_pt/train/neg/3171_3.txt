Was this the best movie I've ever seen? No. Was it the worst? No. As a mother of four, it's good to see something light and fun. It was great, but it was cute. <br /> <br /> I think I definitely had some room to improve, but I tried. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this movie deserves the extreme. level of abuse of the other reviewer. They obviously do not care about Eva Longoria. I think she was better at this than at the Watchtower. I think movies are a matter of opinion. Actors play a big role in whether it's a success or a failure. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cast did not work. Maybe there was a lot going on. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to talk about an ordinary movie, not a terrible movie. It could just be a girl's movie. Like the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband still talks about it. :)
