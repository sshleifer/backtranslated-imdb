Meet three beautiful California women who will cover a festival (or something). All hotels are reserved so they have to spend the night in an old and scary house. What they do not know is that there's a scary inhabitant there who likes to kill ... yawn. Bored, meaningless, completely stupid "horror." Bach and his two friends are certainly beautiful, but the movie itself is bland! Bach and her friends are not actresses - their faces are empty until the end. The final "revelation" is ridiculously predictable and there is no blood or blood to keep you interested along the way. There is some expected female nudity, but that is not enough to save that. Boring, meaningless and unfamiliar (for good reason). A 1 all the way.
