First a technical review. The script is so slow, it really is a story of 25 minutes blown up to 1 hour and 40 minutes. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. The "acting" is pathetic, they seem to actually have taken students out of classes to read a few lines of a dumb card. As for the whole "point" of history, ie "war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!) It really is non-existent. Without the scene "let's shock them and get great publicity" no one would be talking about this movie. It's so bad that it actually bothers me to think that better things used money could have happened. Believe me, I've seen some bad films of "emperor's new clothes," but the only thing I can say to them is that at least they were well filmed and well made while the camera swayed during two scenes! Read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not talk about it.
