"Triumph of Love" is proof that not every author of the Comédie-Française who uses the court disguised as dating as Shakespeare is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Or perhaps something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, a playwright inspired by the Commedia Dell Arte of whom Brittannica says: "His subtle feeling and intelligent wordplay became known as marivaudage." <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino amuses himself with three mixed novels, his role in the pants was not even for Cherubino in "Marriage of Figaro." <br /> <br /> The herky-jerky issue is annoying and it just seems to indicate that it took many takes for every long speech. <br /> <br /> Best was Fiona Shaw as the cheated spinster as well as the fantasies. <br /> <br /> The glimpses of the audience we see and the closing of the curtain to give a wink that this is all gimmick really does not help. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/29/2002)
