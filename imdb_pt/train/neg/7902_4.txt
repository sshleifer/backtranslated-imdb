Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another Gremlins clone that came out of the' 80s. I'm not much of a fake fan. <br /> <br /> First were the excellent 'Gremlins'. <br /> <br /> Then came the Critters' average. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the awful Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> But the full wells would have to go to 'Hobgoblins'. <br /> <br /> Is there more? <br /> <br /> Now 'Munchies' for me would have to fall somewhere between 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. In fact, I probably found it more fun than 'Ghoulies', but I preferred the person's darkest tone. From the beginning, he creates his silly nature (which is best for him), but because of this nature, Hammy's acting (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) may be somewhat arrogant that you prefer to just watch the hunger running loose. That's when the fun happens. Most of the time, the story focuses mainly on hunger (hungry, horny and destructive) in a lot of supposed comic encounters (some moments work) in the deserted little town while a couple of people are in pursuit. It's silly, but strangely engaging, thanks to the fast pace. The creatures themselves seem rather insipid and poorly detailed, as if they were basic dolls being thrown. Where their personalities came from is that they can actually talk ... and with attitude. Charlie Stratton and the quarrelsome Nadine Van der Velde (who was in Critters) were welcome. Harvey Korman was accepted in two roles. Robert Picardo also appears. <br /> <br /> Fun entertainment for the less demanding.
