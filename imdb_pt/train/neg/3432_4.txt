A killer, cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. At his grave, a cult met with plans to resuscitate him, peeing into the grave. This obviously works and he wakes up by taking the guy's penis and he's back in his old ways of killing with a new zombie look. The two policemen, one of whom is getting a little crazy with the city scum and has a problem with drugs, are back on the case. Two members of the original cult also try to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. Thinking they filed out they leave the grave, comes a plastic doll that was used in the original resurrection. It sounds a little confusing, but it really is not just crap. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore on the faces of the gore series and he's as terrible as the boring cop in this movie. The other cop only struggles to pull out his terrible lines. Now I'm all for low budget cinema, but this movie is just terrible. If it had not been for the very easy ladies and the nudity, I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a little blood, but it is never more than a few animal bowels placed in the stomach of the victims. The zombie makeup, on the other hand, looks great and his long penis he uses to rape his victims is kind of funny at times. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls for a sex doll. The doll with the voice of squirrels is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy in a fishing line. <br /> <br /> The ending is extremely bad. You'd expect the killer to fight a lot more than he did. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
