I saw this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 now) and it scared me for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was attracted by music to (obviously) violence. My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch and both said they would never let me watch such a movie. I think they just say that knowing I have such strong feelings about it; 0) I'm currently reading the book (for morbid curiosity and for being a classic) and it's really a great story. However, I do not think it should have been turned into a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe kids these days thought it was strange, but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks, and I still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way. It gives me a little heartbeat every time. Yah I'm a coward, but I strongly suggest that any parent wanting to show this movie to their kids, read the book to them or watch first to make sure they approve the content. Not everyone thinks this is as disturbing as I am, but we're out there;
