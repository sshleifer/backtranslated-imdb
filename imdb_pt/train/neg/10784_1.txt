It was disgusting and painful. What a waste of cast! I swear, the audience (half full) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes. This is no lie. Do not even rent it. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was too cruel to be believable. <br /> <br /> Cusack was fine. That's right. I felt sorry for him (the actor) in case people remember this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as she always is. Charming and sweet but without purpose. The "romance" with John was completely unbelievable.
