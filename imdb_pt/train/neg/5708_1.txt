People like me are going to end this movie. It's not just realistic. The plot is so predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens conviently. Of course, they find the treasure and become filthy and deceive the villain. We've seen this a million times before. The writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie goes public is stupid. They must be right because most people really liked this movie. I mean, solve puzzles in a matter of seconds. The secret treasure room hidden under the Manhattan subway? You would think that with all the work that happened in New York underground, the room would have been discovered before. and everything that was built during the civil war? PLEASE: And the love story between Ben and Abigail? How cute, and I thought the novel in Clive Cussler's novels was weak. They just fall in love like that, in 2 seconds, what I would be most concerned about saving my own ass, then get some. hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 trash
