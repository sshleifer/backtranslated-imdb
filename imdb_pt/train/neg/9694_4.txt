Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story. The bohemian Jean Seberg and his equally widowed widower, the father David Niven, in the south of France, with the crazy Mylène Demongeot. Things are fine until family friend Deborah Kerr shows up. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds it very difficult to resist the conquest of Kerr. Alright with Seberg, as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (as she did all the women of her past ... including Demongeot). When it seems she's becoming the second banana in Niven's life, Seberg takes revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with more sunny colored scenes. Georges Périnal's cinematography is impressive. The film features some of Preminger's less aggressive directions, although he rarely allows close-ups, making it difficult to understand what the actors are really feeling. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and is filled with acid dialogues and funny scenes (mostly involving Demongeot with a bird's brain). Seberg feels reasonably well, but Niven is the least attractive of him ... and he does not show chemistry with Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really fails with this casting. It's a paper that seems tailor made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as the alleged suitor of Seberg and Martita Hunt as his foolish mother. Juliette Gréco, playing herself, sings the title song in a nightclub in Paris. The great titles are from the regular Preminger Saul Bass.
