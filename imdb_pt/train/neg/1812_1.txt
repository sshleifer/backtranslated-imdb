Go immediately and rent this movie. It will be on a lower shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust. No one's going to touch you in years. It may even be a $ .50 special! Worth ten dollars, I swear! Buy! There are not many movies that can be compared to this - the celluloid version of goo that forms in the bottom of a trash can after a few years. Yes, I gave it a '1', but it really deserves much lower. 1-10 scales were not designed with things like this in mind.
