Unfortunately I have to agree with the criticism written by halopes. <br /> <br /> For a short film the cinematography, costumes, scenarios, sound, editing and everything else is very, very good. This may seem surprising at first, but I was told that the technical staff working on it were professionals, so quality is to be expected. The problem, as usual, lies in history itself. <br /> <br /> The thing is, it's not really a story. To tell a story (or in the case of the cinema, SHOW a story) you need plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist: events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, he can not. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. He is a kind of supernatural entity that observes mankind. That's it. So what we have here is pure exposure. Instead of showing a story, we are simply learning things about this Tim Watcher individual. Of course, given the peculiar nature of Tim Watcher and the short duration of the film, it is difficult to provide enough information about him to make the film appeal to the narration aloud. In this case, it is used in the worst possible sense, which is to give information that we would otherwise never get. In fact, if it was not for VO, we thought the character was just a crazy old man out there looking at things. To make matters worse, VO also explains what's happening on the screen! The images we show are just a decoration for the text we are hearing. <br /> <br /> I could say that this short film would be a good video for a band or something, but because the images do not work. By itself, it is impossible to say that. What remains, of course, has value as a measure of the crew's technical capabilities (not incredible, but good), but can not entertain, amuse, thrill or at least show a story.
