In short, overlong and filled with more Swiss cheese subplots have holes! The director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, those two blend together like vinegar and oil. For starters, the comedy is not very funny and youthful. Also, the movie is not really realistic. Freedoms are taken in relation to the legal system in committing French citizens against their will and apparent ease of flight with drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on my big screen TV at home and saw myself screaming in the movie to move on. Eventually, near the end, I quickly sent the last long speech that one of the main characters makes to the son of his former lover. At that time I was exhausted by the absurd and confusing plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a crazy old ex-lover. Sometimes the plot drifts to the families of the two main characters and then back to one of them - either Ismael or especially Nora. To the detriment of the public, the views continue to shift from Nora and Ishmael, her ex-lover confined against her will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films, and none of them are well developed. The epilogue does not really involve many of the subplots and seems to want the viewer to believe that Nora will somehow find happiness, although, given their real-life circumstances, the odds are equivalent to the chance of a snowball in hell. The actors do their best and are attractive but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring glitches of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.
