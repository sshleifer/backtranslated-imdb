Images that usually glorify a hero have meaning. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you really felt sympathy for them, despite their evil deeds. Because? They were two people trapped in the depression when people were desperate to survive. <br /> <br /> This movie has absolutely no substance. The character of Viggo Mortensen soon emerges as a popular hero. Because? He speeds up an Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his wife is suffering. Nobody bothers to understand why he is trying to get away from everyone. Even worse, when perception becomes apparent that he is not a red-collar terrorist, no one in government wants to help him while they try to save his butts. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley co-stars as a radio Emcee building on history in support of our hero. <br /> <br /> The ending is absolutely unbelievable.
