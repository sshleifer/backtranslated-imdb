How many centuries will it be until the Japanese / Asian horror movies leave the ghost-haired woman with long hair? Admittedly, they have managed to rip the "Ringu" a million times, and it often worked well - which serves to show that originality is not a big requirement in the horror genre (or that I am very uncritical and critical). Easy to please?). However, this time I found myself a bit restless, a little bored. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should, with its absurd 110 minutes of length. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, the WTO has no atmosphere and enthusiasm. Also, the ending is confusing: it does not make any sense. As for the touch: Miike could have a melody more effective than that forgettable little thing. Even if it has been played a dozen times, I can not even remember - that was how scary it was. Speaking of Miike, to him this is a kind of commercial venture, so if someone thinks they might be perverting the type "Bijita Q" or "Audition", they are wasting their time.
