... And I never thought a movie deserved to get a 1! But this is honestly the worst movie I have ever watched. My wife picked it up because of the cast, but the plot since the DVD box looked pretty predictable. It's not a mystery or a teen movie. It does not include sensuality, if the title could remotely suggest any of you. This is just a total no-no. Do not waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of young people in an already adult gothic setting where a killer goes after them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth watching. Max Makowski does the worst of Nick Stahl.
