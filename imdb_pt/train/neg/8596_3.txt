Basically, this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity, which was a witty and beautifully portrayed movie, with several turns of truly victorious characters. Watching detectives does not have any of that. <br /> <br /> The premise of a geek from a video store being picked up by a mysterious mysterious woman is good, but it is never fully or properly exploited, thanks to a very weak script. and the misuse of links, not to mention the lack of a real style of storytelling. I mean, this movie is centered around MOVIES, but it's in itself incredibly non-mathematical! This is a big failure right there. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that we simply do not care about the main characters because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) fail to make them real or friendly in any real way. So the movie turns out to be a series of episodes involving two people who seem, well, not terribly interesting. <br /> <br /> Ah, yes, another thing: for a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And romance is not romantic, either. <br /> <br /> So, avoid it. Even in its 90-minute runtime, it's not worth sitting down ...
