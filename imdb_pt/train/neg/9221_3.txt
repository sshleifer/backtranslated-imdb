Everything you need to know about this movie happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack reflecting the late 60's period, and everyone, except for some of their characters, is unpleasant.

A couple laughs and some thoughtful art directions are the only things worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting as documentation of Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's annoying brutality was something to be overcome, but here is the only quality of his character. Schwartzman's familiar connection has clearly put him in this role; here are waiting for your choices to improve.
