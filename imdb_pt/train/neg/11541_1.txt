This movie is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It's amazing how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie agreed to act in such a worthless garbage peace. The film is rape / beatings and revenge genre. The couple went to the party and on the way back they hit a deer and he left to finish when a jeep full of thugs arrived. He did not go to his car, instead he was kicked and beaten well while she tries to drive the engine of the car that betrayed her and she was raped by a gang. So somehow she is in her father's house and one of the thugs is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him ... So stupid scenery! Down Hollywood! He was against this revenge, but "She is raped" "They laugh with her" so she must kill them all ... But once inside the house she was pleased pushing the top of the rifle into thugs and moving away while he went crazy and perform the bad guy. Personally I think the director runs out of money before ending this because the film ends before executing anyone else involved in that rape and beating, which is not a big surprise because the sponsor obviously already saw this and wanted to get their money back. LoL This film is not even for people who like to watch rape because they see nothing of what they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It is to cause disturbances that this peace of garbage has been made by British cinematography that I I personally like it and that's the reason I watched it. Do not do it yourself, you have better things to do than watch movies from stupid scenarios ...
