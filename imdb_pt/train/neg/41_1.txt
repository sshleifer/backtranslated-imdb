How can you say that a horror movie is terrible? when you can not stop laughing at that, of course! The plot has been well approached by other reviewers, so I'll add a few things about the hilarity of it all. <br /> <br /> Some comments put the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought was on some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly this happens, it seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is formed by a pair of black women, some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa beating the drums ... God the Devil is a great black man with a terrible case of pink eyes. <BR> One of the film's most frantic moments is when "Pablito" finds his partner hanging on a tree covered with what appears to be an orange substance that I presume to be blood, starts screaming for minutes without stop (this is really funny), and then your partner's head falls to the ground and "Pablito" kicks a little for what I suppose to be "shits n 'laughs" and the eyes really move ... <br /> But of course then the "freak" is gone when you realize that the eyes have moved because the movie is just plain bad ... <br /> <br /> I did not laugh like this in a loooong while, and I definitely I recommend this movie for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... grab a beer case and start watching this movie, you'll love it! If you're looking for a horror or horror movie, do not bother.
