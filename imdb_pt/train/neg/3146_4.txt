the author of the book, by the same title, should not have used her name for this film. if you have read the book, this film makes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events of the book and its spirit that the film and the book seem to have very little in common except the title and some superficial details. the film adds nothing, in terms of artistic merit, to the literary achievement of the book. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. the plot not only moves at an incredibly slow pace, but offers nothing more while it is moving slowly (like the development of a character, for example). some viewers may be entertained by some of the lesbian love scenes later in the movie, but you can also watch a special show for the material they show in therese and isabelle - it's quite meek and unimaginative at all.
