I remember watching this movie several times as a kid, and there were parts of it (many actually) that I did not understand. I think I've seen it once when I was an adult and then I understood those parts. The only problem in seeing him as an adult was that it was not fun for me. So what kind of movie is this? Is it a "children's movie"? Not difficult. It contains language and subject not suitable for children. Is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like going through their own children? Maybe, but why not focus more on the character of John Ritter instead of Junior? When a film has a main character of 7 years of age, to do well with the audience, it must be a movie for the seven and under the crowd, otherwise, older people will not have how to relate years of age would not like to see a movie about a kid who is a whole year younger than they are). I'm sure that this movie did not go well at the box office, and the reason has to be because it could not find a niche in the market.
