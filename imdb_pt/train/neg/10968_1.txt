*** THIS IS MANY, LOTS OF SPOONS, NOT WHAT IT MATTERS, FOR EVERYTHING IS SO PATENTLY OBVIOUS *** Oh my God, where do I start? Well, here - this is the first time I come home from a movie and said, "I have to go to IMDb and write a review of this NOW. It's my civic duty." Such is the wickedness of this film. <br /> <br /> * Start the digress * But let me just say one thing before you start. I'm not a big Harvard-noir-weenie (actually I went to college on the other side of Mass Ave in Cambridge, one in which smart people without rich dad and trust funds go, what should I put it directly into the census group nerd-who-would-obsessively-love-comic-book-movies, and I still hated this movie ...). My viewing preference is for the intellectual cinematographic work that includes Die Hards, Bond films, Clerks and The Grail. I wish the Titanic had never sunk, not so much for the lives lost, but lest we be subjected to the dung of a movie. And the only and only reason I'll watch an arrogant French art film is if there's a young and often naked Emmanuelle Beart. I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of your precious 10s here on IMDb, for God's sake. So I'm as shallow as they come, so I'm not criticizing this movie because I'm looking for some standard of cinematic excellence - it's because Elektra stinks like a dead three week old goat. * End of the tour * OK, there's so much evil here that I have to try to categorize it. Here it goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the reasons a man would like to see this movie is to see a lot of hot JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted it). I think between this and "Finding Nemo," the latter was the sexiest movie. Do you know the red clothes she advertised using in all the ads you see? You see it TWICE - once in the beginning, once in the end. Vadio. For the rest, she basically looks like what Morrissey would be like if she were a woman - lots of black pouting and pouting. Which brings me to the incredible variety of expression that JGar demonstrates in his performance - from "pouting" to "pouting and crying." Oh my God, you'd think she was being forced to date Ben Affleck or something horrible like that. Wait ... MAJOR MEN / GAL: They show the same range of expression and acting ability you would expect from a somewhat mature grapefruit. At least alongside JGar's performance, it does not stand out much. The role of a guy is to stay there and be huge, the other is to stay there and have things come out of it, and the woman's role is to stay there and breathe and / or kiss people. They can pull off these incredible feats. The main villain has the most difficult role of all - he has to SIMULTANEOUSLY a) look angry and b) look like Asian. He does a good job at it. I think there was a fifth bad guy / gal, but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie in self-defense. <br /> <br /> TRACK WORKS! This film has as many surprises as a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Let's just put it this way - my wife, who has only been in the US for half a year and speaks only a small amount of English - whispered this to me when the girl first appeared on the JG block, and I swear to God I I'm not doing this: "She's going home to kill a girl. And that's before the father appeared on the screen. Now my wife is not stupid, but she is not being courted by Mensa for her gifts, and she has not had zero exposure to the Daredevil or the comic book genre. And she discovered this in 0.00015 seconds without any stimulus and no prior information. Such is the obvious truism of this film. <br /> <br /> STUPIDITY RARELY BEFORE LIFE! Okay, so there's this big guy in the movie. He can take a shotgun puff and brush the shot like a lint, and he can take an Electra stab at his chest and just bend the metal (or melt - or something like that - more defenses kicking, thank God). But JG bounces in his head and he explodes? A noggin of Achilles? IT'S OK! Such is the numbing stupidity of this film. <br /> <br /> Ack. I'm starting to have a brain hemorrhage so I have to stop. But you were warned. If you have to cut your own tires intentionally to prevent you from seeing this movie, DO IT. And if Armageddon comes, please, be it before it comes out on DVD.
