Before seeing this movie, I would have said that I loved everything Kathy Bates did. Now it's all but one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his acting. Someone should have told him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, ignorant, or clich√©d. Same for Randy Quaid's stereotypes. The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who is not an actor strong enough to carry this waterlogged mess. If you like the country, you will enjoy the scenery. It's the best I can give. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of independent, quirky movies, but that's just terrible.
