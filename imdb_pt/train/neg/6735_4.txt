The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is very rhythmic. Did not fall flat. The next best thing is the supporting performances of the actor who plays the future fiance Edward, the always wonderful Holland Taylor and the actor who plays Taylor's husband. The actor who helped criticize Messing's potential clothing in an early scene brings an absurd and yet winning quality to the process. Okay, that's about it on the bright side. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I love, is far more credible expressing scorn for Messing than in any scene in which he is trying to be a pro or supporter. As others have remarked, he seems to have no emotional investment in this endeavor besides wrapping him up as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to take the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She's adequate doing it, but she just is not strong enough an actress to take it all away without help. Give her an "E" for effort and a "C +" for conquest. Given Mulroney's indifference, the only thing that could have helped Messing would have been a brilliantly arrogant Irons-esquire performance of the actor playing his ex-fiance Jeffrey. Instead, their performance is weak, whining and irresponsible. <br /> <br /> If I tried to analyze this later, it would obviously pay more attention than most people involved. It's harmless enough to pass the time if you have nothing else to do, and less unfriendly (and less creative) than the wedding singer, but you're much better off watching "My Best Friend's Wedding" again.
