I am a big fan of Troma, but I can not understand why they bought the rights to this movie. It's so annoying that I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. Some where in the plot summary says "but what Satan does not know he's stuck with annoying tourists" Well, they do not seem to bother you in the movie, just me. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I like bad movies, but it was annoying.
