I bought this in the records of the tower after seeing the commercial info about a thousand and five hundred times in the central comedy. I was really looking forward to watching this. My God, where did I go wrong? Now, before I give my comment, let me just say that I am a person who may well find the good in all the movies, the hell I own more than 1,500 dvd's! With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst movie I've ever seen. I tried to give it a try, but not only was not it funny. It made no sense, no offense what-so-ever, and it was all stupid. God, who in his right mind thought these crap was funny? This is going straight to the bottom of the deposit ...
