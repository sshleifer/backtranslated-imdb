The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a Holocaust survivor, part of Mengele's twin experiences, consisting mainly of her version of what happened at Auschwitz and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments. The film obviously had great reviews. It is one of those topics that no one dares to express a contrary opinion on. <br /> <br /> I also, for a large part of the film, was sucked by the excitement that the filmmaker so obviously wanted the viewer to focus. One of Eric Monder's IMDb user reviews (obviously having nothing critical to say about it in a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar. "In one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of Jews argues with Kor in a Jewish center, the meaning of the word" forgive "is even debated, but Kor, isolated and in smaller numbers, has his own" But at this point The filthiness of the film in my sleepy emotional repertoire had come loose enough so that I could see clearly once more. After "will power" Eva Kor forgives her "Nazi captors", the film begins to delve into what is generous, at least from Kor's point of view. The film continues to accompany her, going through her public statement, forgiving the Nazis and entering new territory. To me, this was the film's flesh, surrounded by inedible fat from its "act of forgiveness." Obviously, she was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> On a mission to test her forgiveness theory in order to heal past wounds, she makes her way to the "promised land" to meet some. Arabs to discuss with them the issues they face and to see if the dialogue can not lead to a better understanding of the situation and strongly interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the US about their act of forgiving the Nazis, including one in one Jewish. center in Chicago. From then on, anyone who is not eye-watery and can not see the screen will have difficulty losing the obvious contradiction in their statements. <br /> <br /> First, you immediately notice your body language, defensive. and did not want to hear in a room full of Arab academics and teachers. Her comments about how she feared they might kidnap her shows how much wastage of time, effort and money the whole act was. A little annoyed Dr. Sami Advan (professor of education at the University of Bethlehem) hits when he tells Kor out for a statement she makes about how she would rather be sleeping in her apartment. <br /> <br /> Finally, the debate at the Jewish center in Chicago, where it is "grilled" about the meaning of forgiveness and its right to do so, in the wake of those who continue to suffer from the trauma of the acts. <br /> <br /> go straight to the point. At the end of the movie, I hoped I had not chosen to watch the movie. The film was poorly done, failing to delve into anything over Auschwitz beyond purely trivial, just enough to ensure that the holocaust is reinvigorated in the memory of the spectators and incite a flood of tears. It showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary, could not engage in fair discussions. His discussion skills were limited to repeating his position on forgiveness (at best) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate. <br /> <br /> Finally, everyone is so retarded today that they can not tell the difference between making peace. and forgive? Citing another IMDb user, "I do not see her forgiveness as being weak - on the contrary, she just wanted to ease her hold of her soul, she wanted the suffering to end, so she let it go." This would be the perfect definition of the layman to MAKE PEACE. <br /> <br /> I think that in a world of propaganda, blind faith and politically correct, there is no room to question those who "have gone through more than the human mind can understand." <br /> <br /> PS The dictionary certainly should go into every book list to buy that everyone keeps doing.
