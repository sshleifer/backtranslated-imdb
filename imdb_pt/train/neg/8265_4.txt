She was catapulted from 13 to 30 years, with magic dust involved, courtesy of Matt, 13, but nothing is made of it except as an inexplicable device. New York City, especially Central Park, but also every part of the place incorporated into the film, seems hopeful and easily habitable, and, save for Lucy, there is no villain in Jenna's adult life, and not even Lucy is seen as monstrous just as a nasty 13-year-old kid grew 17 years more dishonest. Chris, the boy who has always been the object of Jenna's desire, is now a taxi driver, and you've seen enough movies to know that Matt is going to play a big part in Jenna's future. You are not sure what can stop this before it is finally reached, although I am here to whisper in your ear, so to speak, that the device is not unique. In fact, this is not just a variation on the theme of "Big" by Tom Hanks, though it's not nearly as good, but also a strict version of the Cinderella story sub-set.
