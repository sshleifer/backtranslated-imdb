This straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis' career. As is the tradition of Disney, quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick exchange of money; this is a lazy retread with Moranis accidentally shrinking himself and some relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Instantly dated visual effects and dialogue crummy abound in this laments cheese, which did nothing but made me sting for the days of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' when that sort of thing was done correctly. Surprisingly, this is directed by director of photography Dean Cundey, who should devote himself to daily work or choose better material next time.
