The teasers of Tree of Palme try to pass it as a kind of allegory for a fairy tale with real meaning, and immediately begin to delirious with the animation. I should have known what that meant. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palme, is a good example of the whole movie problem. One minute, Palme is a humble hero in search of himself, the next is a violent psychopath with a sickly fixation on a girl he has already taken care of. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the movie, Palme is ill-defined. You do not relate to the characters, although Shatta has acquired some fans. It seems the writer was more interested in studying all the drama and complexity than he could in this film than actually exploiting the motivations and personalities of his characters. <br /> <br /> New and useless story lines have been introduced in the last fifteen years. minutes of the movie. The writer had to seriously simplify his story. Maybe he was trying to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can not help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been more suitable for a TV series or graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the movie, I simply could not stand the sheer lack of quality and start laughing at how the characters, the relationships and the plot were invented. I touched my companion and he began to crack as well as a young man sitting behind us. We try so hard to control ourselves, but we just can not get the worst quality out of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the animation is incredible and viewers will admire the lush scenery and the charming character. drawings. The animation almost guides you; when you do not care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
