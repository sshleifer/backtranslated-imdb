OK, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You have been loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie. It was the TV program "The Crocodile Hunter" with bad acting, bad scripts and misdirection between Steve capturing or teaching us about animals. He was entertaining as an animal / specialist candidate. Millions will miss him. But the whole idea of ​​the movie was a big mistake. The plot was so broken, almost non-existent. Casting was awful. The performance was not even worth the actors of elementary school. The steering must also be defective. If you do not get decent performance halfway to your actors, no matter how bad the screenplay is, you should not be that good in the first place. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never seen this movie. Of course, I watched for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son) while hanging out with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so discriminating, liked the movie a lot, but he never asked to see it again. If you want good memories of Steve Irwin, buy your series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve, I know I would not like to be remembered for this movie. Respect it: avoid this movie!
