Do not waste your time or money on this. The half decent cast can fool you into thinking that this teen thriller, although not about to break any records, can entertain slightly for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It will not. <br /> <br /> This will not scare you, laugh, cry or even challenge your intellect. This will leave you wondering how this movie has finished production. Yes, it's really that bad.
