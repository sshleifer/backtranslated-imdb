Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan. He is also a highly qualified surgeon and circulates freely in Kabul, operating wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission, he casually takes a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 meters. He is then promoted to sergeant, but is unable to decide between a career as a sniper and surgeon, so he leaves the Army completely. A year later, frustrated with civilian life, he joins the Navy and the last scene proudly shows off a white uniform.
