The only reason I watched this movie was because I had recently read Robert Hough's fictional account, less than perfect but interesting, about the life of Big Cat trainer Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in a less than flattering light. <br /> <br /> I had not realized until I checked the movie later in IMDb that it was originally a series. Whoever edited the original 233-minute runtime to the 68-minute version available on DVD did a great job. The abbreviated version works just as well as any B movie of the period, despite the many "duh-what?" moments. For example, are we really expected to believe that our hero dug a six-foot-deep tiger trap in one morning without even soaking his breeches? Looking at the chapter titles, I see that the number five is titled "Gorilla Warfare" and the number eleven is called "The Gorilla." There were no gorillas in the movie. I think that's where some of the cuts were made. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
