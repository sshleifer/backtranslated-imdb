This movie should have been fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But he crawled, had unlovable characters, and had no target audience. <br /> <br /> Some children go to a space camp and are accidentally thrown into space by a robot friend of theirs (appropriately named Jinx). Space scenes are long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and cheesy or scary, depending on your point of view. Adults will be bored and full of fear, children can be scared, since the way this was filmed really leaves a strange feeling about it. <br /> <br /> There is a new novel, but unlike the shuttle - this never takes off. . Why it is included first is not clear except maybe to add extra tension between the characters - but failed if that was the idea. <br /> <br /> A young Lea Thompson must be quirky and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the Future" is great. But no, she was annoying and common-looking. It's not someone you'd like to date, have as a friend or even consider as a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He's really lucky that he appeared in the movies again in that performance. Maybe he can act like Mikey in Life Cereal commercials, but he does not seem to know how to be a normal kid. It does not fit the screen and I do not think we can identify with it at home. I really would have been happier if he had never returned to Earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
