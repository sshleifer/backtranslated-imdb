And this comes from someone who will support almost any visualization. The acting and the sound are terrible. This may qualify for a "bad" merit point for some. However, I take my horror movies seriously and that's just crap - it's just sooooo cheap, I think that's my main complaint. The dialogue is often hilarious - attention to how often "you scared me" is used. The actress "child" is seriously horrible - I pray that her acting career ends here ... on the line "DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS" worth watching over and over again.
