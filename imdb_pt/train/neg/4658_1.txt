BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a ghastly and meaningless remake of David Lean's 1945 classic, based on Noel Coward's Still Life piece. A doctor removes a particle of sand from a woman's eye at a train station, he is in a miserable relationship, she is happily married social worker of Italian descent. They meet by chance on another occasion, form an instant attraction and combine to meet each Wednesday. The two fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together they realize they have no realistic chances of happiness and agree to participate. The original part of an act of Coward concerned two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two Super Stars and Hollywood veterans Epics, are not an idea of ​​"ordinary people." Loren in particular is miscast - Sophia Loren in full make-up, looking like a million dollars, working as part-time volunteer social worker in a Citizen Advice Bureau is not true. Burton, seemingly dejected, with dyed hair, a lot of makeup and platform shoes, does not appear to be a general of medicine. That being said, you can not really blame them for having an affair after seeing your spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends his nights making venomous reviews and treating his husband with total contempt. Loren's husband Jack Hedley makes pottery around the house all day and is extremely boring: the most exciting thing he's ever done is having an affair six years earlier. Your final scene together will induce nausea ("You've been far, far away", etc.). That great British job actor, John LeMesurier, has a three minute turnout as a friend of Burton's, and seems a bit drunk, speaking his lines in a barely audible voice. It's a sad and forgettable performance in a sad and horrible reprise of a classic movie. Avoid at all costs.
