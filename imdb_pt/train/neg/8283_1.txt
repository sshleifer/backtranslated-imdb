This is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used to make this joke. I personally do not care one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent or what so many people find fascinating about her. Just like a movie, this is something that would not even pass a film school. The script is a mess, the acting is appalling, and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-author of "Bottle Rocket") did it makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. He did "Old School" for crying out loud! This does not even belong to the same state of my "Old School" DVD! Please, for whatever reason, DO NOT WATCH THIS! I see that there is a comment that this is so bad that it is good, but that frankly is very kind. When we stop seeing singers who obviously can not keep trying, I hope it ends soon. The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of that dump. As for the plot, well, it's almost non-existent and so poorly done and written (yes, I know it's another rehash) I highly doubt anyone will remember anything about it. Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time, but if you do, feel sorry for the REAL actors involved in wasting your time doing this bomb. Jessica Simpson, you're pretty, but you'd rather sing, though I'm not much of a fan either. And who made this movie, I would not put it on your resume. 1/10 because you can not give a zero.
