This movie is another one on my list of movies so do not bother. I saw this 40 years ago as a teenager, stayed up late to do it, was very upset to find that it was about 95% romance, 4% of everything, 1% of history, if that. It's what I call bait and switch movie, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. This is a subject that deserves a good cinematographic treatment, this film is almost an insult to who served. The true members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not running away from the law nor were products of abusive homes, they were in fact idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect that many of them came from a higher class than the character of Tab Hunter. Flight school is not for the clever smart and knows it all, an individual like the one pictured here would not have lasted two days, it would have been the palisade or the infantry. Discipline in the French army was often quite fierce. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
