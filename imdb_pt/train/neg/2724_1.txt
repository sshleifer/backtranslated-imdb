I would like to say that unlike many of the people who did not like this movie and found it impossible to understand that I was able to understand it for what it is ... A very incoherent plot attempt. <br /> <br /> I do not like to play that word, but in this case it fits in very well. First, the director presents the material in an extremely "arrogant" and, worse, extremely incoherent way. It is inconsistent that he presents the material in a disorderly disorderly order, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect of us, the viewer of CARE until the end <br /> <br /> I respect surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a more than real world that is not connected to real life). But there is nothing surreal about having a history in the modern day and a modern Earth environment, which is the most important thing not to engage the public but, moreover, simply a series of disjointed events that barely come together. The most accurate way to describe the experience of seeing this movie is to see a story; perhaps even a very good story as it was based on a book but being thwarted by the fact that the camera does not seem to capture the necessary moments and tie any means of coherence. <br /> <br /> Let's compare stylistic cinema. Compare "Seul contre tous" by Gaspar Noe, with that. He gave us a coherent story, extremely engaging and intellectually profound. This film offers no intellectual study, and although it is very stylistic in its fragmented presentation, the director has finally abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we have left is a mess of events that barely fit together. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is possible to make sense of things ... to a POINT. But as I said earlier, the viewer will reach a stage where he will simply say "who cares". It's like watching a monotonous and mundane story of a man going to a grocery store and buying groceries in non-chronological order. Even with murders, it's completely uninteresting and uninteresting. Many people today give high marks to something they can not understand or make sense simply out of fear of appearing foolish, and in every way this movie TRIES to make the viewer seem foolish. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time on your hands, then, please watch this movie, taking into account what I said about it. It's a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and that's my final reasoning.
