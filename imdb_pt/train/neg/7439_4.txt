A different look at the horror. The differences in style between American and Russian films are interesting. However, from my American perspective, this movie was not so good. The protagonist, Marie played by Anastasia Hille was not a nice character and I had trouble identifying with her. She was unpleasant most of the time and confused by much of the little time left. Too much time was spent in bringing it to the main location of the movie. So much time passed before any real suspense was accumulated. Once that happened, it seemed that the volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct to Video movies and they did not use sex to make up for a fine storyline. All in all I would recommend to rent but not for the theater goers.
