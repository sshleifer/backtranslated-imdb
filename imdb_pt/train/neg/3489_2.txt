This was my first and probably the last film by Angelopoulos. I was eager to get into it, as it featured Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and it was a movie by Theo, whom I heard a lot. The opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep of soldiers on the border between Greece and Albania. IT'S OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The movie had big holes and I do not know what to mention first. The main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15 minute monologue, killing the action and patience of the viewers, nothing happening onscreen for 15 or even 20 minutes, plus this old lady telling a story. All that is presumed to be shown through action was simply said to the camera by the old lady. At one point, the TV crew was going to the bar. They saw the corner and immediately the winter begins! Probably filmed on different days, continuity leaked out. A lot of problems with storytelling, went from absurd to irrational, never clinging to a style, making the viewer ask questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni, given a role that lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks, Albanians, or Balkans agreed, the films showed much historical, ethnic, or political inaccuracy, only to make a film about "humanity" as a red in another critique. Much more to say but no time to lose in a poor movie, which was not movie at all, but follies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money.
