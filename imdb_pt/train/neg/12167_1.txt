Despite being a sequel to the more potent original, this is yet another comic remake of Friday the 13th about Angela's new psychopathic antics, killing more nubile teens for her "immorality" in a camp. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks great. There are some very funny sex scenes with some cute girls, but the movie is (unintentionally) comical, rather than suspenseful, it's a stinky one. <br /> <br /> * out of the house. <Br /> <br /> MPAA: Punctuation: R for graphic violence and nudity, nudity and for some sexuality, language and drug use.
