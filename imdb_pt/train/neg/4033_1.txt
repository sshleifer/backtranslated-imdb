It hurts me to write such blunt criticism, but by failing to do so, I am simply encouraging such people. Firstly, just because a movie is done on a small budget is not automatically good or pleasant. In fact, in this case, the small budget is probably the only film making, as it kept large amounts of money from being wasted on a one-legged racing horse with shit. Have you seen a comedy in the theater? You've heard people laugh and think, "What the hell are you on?" Well, even those cats were not laughing. Things got so bad in the way that my cat took his first shower. This is not movie, this is kids ... there are no monkeys making pictures that leave you feeling like moving to France. I have to go, there's a clown at my door .............
