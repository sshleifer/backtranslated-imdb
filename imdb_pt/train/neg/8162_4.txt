Your attitude towards Prom Night II will determine the joy you get from the movie. If you're expecting a horror masterpiece, look elsewhere. If you like exotic movies that are fun to watch, you will enjoy it. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life making a success over Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd by channeling Schrage's anger perfectly during her time "owned". <br /> <br /> It's not a classic movie, but a fun way to kill a few hours with a perverse ending. <br /> <br />
