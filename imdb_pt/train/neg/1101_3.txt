This fake journey never comes close to combining the wit and craziness of the great adventure these guys did in their first movie. This plot tries to deviate from its prequel to capture some new blood from the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and does not lead anywhere interesting or funny. <br /> <br /> There's been almost half an hour lost in showing the guys doing a rock show (and many people watching on "free TV" - since when does this happen?) Surely the screenwriter could have done something more creative; See how all the random elements of the first film were organized together by a convergence in scientific presentation. Not in this movie, which pretty much wiped out the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke is over. <br /> <br /> The Grim Reaper is played in the mix for any reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is poorly made and lacking sparks for comedy or public involvement. There is a ZZ Top print, hammered for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
