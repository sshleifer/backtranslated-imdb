There! This was a bit painful to sit on. It has a cute and fun premise, but everything goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and boring, and he does not disappoint with that. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville performed surprisingly decent performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, played a lot. I know that's how the parts were written, and it's hard to blame the actors when the script and director make them do such a thing. If you're going to have outrageous characters, fine, but you have to have good stuff to make it work. Not here. Run screaming out of this movie if you can.
