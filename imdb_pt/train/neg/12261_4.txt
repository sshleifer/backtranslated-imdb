Standard "paint-by-numbers" monster fare, filled with a lot of routine plotting devices for great creature movies. It is as if someone had a deck of cards with ideas from other films written on them that were shuffled and distributed. Whatever the plot lines and characters that emerged in the deal, they were thrown into the script. <br /> <br /> The characters are so clich√©d that you can play a game of "Guess who ends up being a monster meal" after less than ten minutes in the movie, and probably catch every one of them right-- including the order that they will be devoured. Many of the characters are so unpleasant that you hope the creature catches them. Some of the main characters include: a clone of Billy Idol who surfs with sharks, a loud booty who flirts with funds, a captain Ahab with revenge, and Ahab's girlfriend who does scumbags in a bar. Oh, and a great big beast who needs anger control therapy. <br /> <br /> Along the way, people argue a lot, pretty girls run around with wet shirts, couples kissing on exotic beaches, explosions occur ruins of a sanctuary, and greasy-faced pirates appear. <br /> <br /> Fun for the most part, but one thing bothered me: the insensitivity of the characters when other people were killed. After a violent end, they make jokes of a line. I could almost hear shots on the edge. <br /> <br /> Overall, OK, if you have 90 minutes to lose, and you want to laugh at such a bad movie is good. Otherwise, you may want to skip this one.
