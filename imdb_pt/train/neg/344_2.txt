Let me be very clear about this movie. I did not watch this movie because of the plot, I watch through the sassy sex scenes. That said, this film is so horrible that I have fun amidst the joy of seeing a pious body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and shrinking eyes at the mess of a plot. Spoiler alert First scene of the movie I have already shrunk. You see a woman painting something by the lake, in sheer ecstasy and serene, then a beautiful girl approaches and asks if she could paint to the side of her. When the two finish, they show each other what they have done ... and the woman has painted A VINEYARD WHEN THEY ARE FACING THE HELL OF THE LAKE. What kind of crazy director would make that kind of mistake? And in another scene, Traci manages to kill his teacher's mistress, crushing him with the candle stick, and then she swims, and none of the city police suspected her once. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DID NOT YOU GO A SLEEVE MADE IT? FINGER PRINTS ARE ON ALL GOD BOAT DONN !! After that, it gets worse, whenever Mandy is around, there's the "chilling" sound that sounds like a cat on a wheeze. It's also a shame that Rosanna Arquette is in this movie. I feel very sad about her having to star in this super low budget soft-porn no brainer. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to star in this film. All in all, 2/10.
