Everyone in this movie tells Raffy Carruthers how talented she is, what a great director she will one day be, etc. I think they're being nice. Even Kimble Rendall, who directed this film, shows more talent than she does. "The next Jane Campion," they call her; and even beyond the fact that both are overvalued, the two have much in common. They both direct movies. They are women. They are both Australians. (Well, give or take.) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's one of those movies where a character is considered brilliant, and we just have to swallow and accept it. But I'm going to say this to Carruthers: she's cute. It is fascinating. Not even. Here are some thoughts about his lack of talent: (1) Part of a director's talent is in dealing with people. Why is Carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting his team up to take notice of it? In order to make it easier for everyone to get off the set and get killed, I hope. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is this one of the least convincing representations of a movie set I've ever seen? After all, it must have been filmed on a REAL set. How could they go wrong? If Rendall's set was half an unmanaged mess, it's a wonder he completed his movie. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers - the fictional director - set himself the task of creating a new brand. 80's horror movie. Fat Chance. I doubt it can be done these days. I suspect that Rendall - the current and most talented director - has devoted himself to the same task, realized that it could not be done, and resolved (sigh) knowing parody instead. Of course, a parody is not enough to function as a parody. As the cast and crew set foot in the secluded mansion, the movie spends most of its time doing what the 1980s horror films did ... well, not bad. <br /> <br /> (4) and yet ... the film begins with not a parody, but an 80s horror pastiche, starring honestly (that's too good to be true) Molly Ringwald. This pastiche is much better than anything that follows. (It's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie inside the movie instead of the movie.) However, it was also filmed in the late 90's. Maybe it's still possible to do the horror of the 1980s. You only have than to drop the parody thing and know it. <br /> <br /> (5) I never imagined what the teen terror of the '80s would be like if all the characters had an Australian accent, but now I know. And strangely, I'm glad to know. One need I never knew I had was fulfilled.
