I watched this movie recently and had high hopes. Not so much based on the director, who had not made a movie release before, but more based on his cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (starring in Body Double, a masterpiece by Brian De Palma) have already starred in great films. Not together, and that fact has not changed exactly because of it. <br /> <br /> The film is unbelievable, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that can make it a little attractive is the selection of locations in which it was filmed. In my humble opinion: do not waste your time on this.
