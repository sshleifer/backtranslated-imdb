No wonder the historian Ian Kershaw, author of Hitler's groundbreaking biography, who was originally the scientific advisor for this TV movie, dissociated himself from it. The film is historically very incorrect. The mistakes begin shortly when Hitler's father, Alois, dies at home, while in reality he dies in a pub. In the film, Hitler moves from Vienna to Munich in 1914, when in fact he moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on and on. Hitler's childhood and youth are portrayed as too short, which makes it quite difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important people at the beginning of the party, such as Hitler's paternal friend, Dietrich Eckart, or the philosopher "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg, are totally absent. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script obviously follows Hanfstaengl's own brightness about the vision of himself that he gave in his postwar biography. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-Semitic and was crazy about his "Fuehrer". But the biggest problem in the film is the portrait of Hitler himself. He is characterized as someone who is constantly hostile, has neither charisma nor charm and constantly commands everyone around. After watching the movie, we wondered how such a disgusting person was able to get followers. Since we all know, what evil criminal Hitler was, of course every writer is tempted to portray Hitler as utterly disgusting and uncharismatic. But the facts are that in particular it could be quite charming and fun. His comrades did not follow him because he constantly yelled at them, but because they liked this strange man. In addition to all these historical mistakes, the film is well done, the actors are first class, the takeovers and the production design give a believable impression of the time.
