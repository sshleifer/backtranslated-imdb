"Rambo: First Blood Part II" by George P. Cosmatos, is pure fulfillment of desires. The United States clearly did not win the war in Vietnam. They have caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this film continues the fairy tale of the so innocent soldiers. The only thugs were the nation's leaders, who made this war happen. Rambo's character is perfect for realizing this. He is extremely patriotic, regrets that Americans have not enjoyed and celebrated the achievements of the single soldier, but it has nothing but mistrust for leaders and politicians. Like any war movie (eg, "We Were Soldiers"), it also avoids the need to provide an understandable reason for involvement in South Asia. And also the motive of every American soldier who was there. Instead, Rambo takes revenge on the wounds of an entire nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with memories rather than suppress them. "Did we win this time?" Yes you do.
