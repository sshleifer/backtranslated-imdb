A remake of the superb 1972 movie of the play, very well casting Caine as the enemy of his character from the first film. But doing nothing more than good. An unsatisfactory performance of the actors, Law and Caine, further diluted by the weak self-indulgent direction. <br /> <br /> The heat of the setting in the original is abandoned by a super modern home establishment. The subtle interaction between Oliver and Caine, who made the first film so watchable, is replaced by a horrible and impetuous arrogance that instantly generates disdain on the viewer. But that's not the smart, back and forth to like one then the other character that the original promoted so well, this is an obvious OTT character murder of both characters from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This version of Sleuth is not worth seeing, watch the original movie and be dazzled by the opening act.
