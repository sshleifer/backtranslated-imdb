A Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast, economical and a lot of fun. I really love how the studio explored the less glamorous elements of our daily life. This is one of the few melodramas from Warner that just does not work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless newspaper editor who resurrects the 20-year history of a murderess with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance, but he is surrounded by actors who do not cut the mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good but the poor performance of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie. Starr is particularly bad during his big dramatic scene near the end of the movie. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of the Hollywood pre-code. The direction of LeRoy is full of innovative visual touches, but he can not overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations. Sol Polito's camera work is strong. Somehow, this piece of dreck received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (in a year that gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
