When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought we could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it. <br /> <br /> We have been deceived, to spare. <br /> <br /> For my part, I felt Billy Crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film. Of course, he made some good jokes, but as a character he did nothing but take up space. <br /> <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. In past shows, she plays well as an obstinate and self-determined lady. In this movie, she seems completely repressed and had very little fire. This is not the Julia Roberts that my wife likes to watch. <br /> <br /> OK, if I were to find a good thing, it would have to be Christopher Walken. Now this is entertainment. But, like Billy Crystal, almost nothing is shown of his character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of irrational laughter with little redeeming value, go see. But if you're looking for a smart romantic comedy, this is not your movie. That's not it.
