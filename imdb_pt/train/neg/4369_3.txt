*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British thriller made in the USA by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius who needs to leave his research because his funds have dried up. Karloff is forced to withdraw to France and start a medical practice. It is proposed by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows Karloff needs the money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees to the proposal and soon becomes her husband's personal physician. All the time, the wife is poking about the city with the local is not good playboy. Karloff finally injects the old geyser with venom and it starts. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and discovers that the will was changed. When he spills the bean to his wife, she becomes furious and even bites his son's hand. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse lost the hiccup Karloff used to kill the old man. When Karloff discovers that he is not receiving money, he asks his wife to poison his son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hiccup. The analysis shows poison, but not exactly at the moment Karloff kidnaps the nurse. <br /> <br /> To shorten the story, the nurse escapes, picks up the police and manages to save the child who is about to be injected. by Karloff. Karloff injects himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good points. Karloff is possessed and plays the kind of crazy doctor he did in The Devil's Commands and The Man Who Lived the Most. It is peculiar, however, to see him walk in a rigid and slightly curved manner. We never find out why he's walking like this. I suspect the director thought it made him more sinister. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the wife of 2 timings overcomes something terrible. She has a French accent. Even if she overdoes it badly, you can still hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting ...). <br /> <br /> A little below average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the Sinister Cinema VHS copy, the audio will be a bit unstable.
