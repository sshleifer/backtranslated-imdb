I saw this by chance on a lazy summer afternoon. He was playing on HBO's family programming channel. At first I was attracted by what I thought was a Disney animation. But after a few minutes, I found myself looking for the remote control so I could find the 'INFO BUTTON' to find out what the world was on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I like him in many of his films, but one thing he is not, is a voice artist. Of course he has one of the most unique voices in Hollywood, but it only works as part of a larger visual package. Attaching his voice to a fluffy duck made the remark a bit difficult. As for the rest of the cast, uninspired. I do not think working on this movie has attracted a good voice about the talents out there. <br /> <br /> So the weak voice talent, the strong animation ... who was that movie target? Gay teen ducks? I dont understand. Is there really a shortage of models for young and future homosexuals, that we should resort to animated ducks? Cute story, and like the title, this movie that I found difficult to love, as well as an ugly duckling.
