I do not see how someone who even likes Van Damne might like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie really begins with some promise. I'd say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie are great. The action scenes with the family wing trying to save the twins is a great start and is a good clue to the main story. However, the film is all down there. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice if the director had kept the original premise. Siblings are born in different parts of the world and learn different skills. It is assumed that one brother is skilled in martial arts, but the other brother must be skilled in firearms. How convenient when the time comes when the brother who has never picked up a gun before is suddenly a great sniper, and the brother who has not learned any martial art is suddenly making divisions and high kicks. The plot, the action, etc. are simply ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne is confronting a soldier armed with an AK-47? The soldier is about 100 yards away. Instead of aiming and firing at Van Damne, he is making a war cry as if he were wielding a battle ax and running for it. Van Damne continues to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bun Yeung is a skilled martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Cake is playing barrels in Van Damne as Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating film that promised a lot. If you are a fan of Van Damne, save your time and watch Hard Target or one of your previous films.
