Okay, so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and a half minutes out of my life here is the basic summary: Genie comes out of the ghetto boom, gives this boy desgrenados desires 3 hair, the boy wastes his wishes on forgetting which, shaq sucks for rap, and I think that's it. <br /> <br /> So I mostly laughed, I cried ...... but mostly I laughed at the sheer comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of a nba player / rapper and boy with unkempt hair. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and in great need of a good laugh. <br /> I am going to give a 3 of 10 only b / c the movie is based on 3 magical wishes. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes, one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like Hollywood did not spend money doing it.
