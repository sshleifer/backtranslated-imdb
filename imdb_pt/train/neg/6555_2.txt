So the other night I decided to watch Tales from Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or power, passion, murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the film, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring and I felt I had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot of the movie is really confusing. There are two story lines running simultaneously during the movie. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the movie I was waiting for the moment these two stories came together to make the plot clear to me. But not yet. <br /> <br /> 2) The movie title says the movie will be about Natica Jackson. Well, sometimes it is. As said the film covers two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shorter. So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice. <br /> <br /> To conclude my story, I really recommend you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf of the store in a place that no one can see it. By doing this, you will not waste 90 minutes of your life, as I did.
