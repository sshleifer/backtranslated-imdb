The film was watchable while Nicolson was onscreen. However, I had to fight the hassle when the film relied on Meryl Streep to take scenes without Jack; she was as insipid as she could be. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters have been portrayed before - and much better. It looked like a real-life scenario in the worst sense: 90% of daily life is boring, and not worth writing or watching. Why Ephron felt his life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about escapes me. Perhaps she has written this as therapy - for many writers, putting an episode of her life on paper is cathartic. Well, but why anyone in Hollywood thought that story deserved to be filmed is still a mystery to me.
