Why does Hollywood feel the need to redo movies that were so brilliant at their peak? But is it considerably worse because Hollywood feels the need to redo those horror movies that were not brilliant to begin with? Night, The Amityville Horror) Like their originals, these remakes fail to create atmosphere, character or any genuine scares. Prom night is so flat and uninteresting that it's hard to watch, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> It's a poorly executed, massively uninteresting and boring tour that fails on everything it was designed to do. Of course the Hollywood Horror is dead. Even the likes of The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent batch. The prom night is practically bloodless and I will not even mention how bad the plot is. His inability to seal the killers makes this the least suspenseful horror film since erm ... the original. <br /> <br /> One of the most notorious horror films of the '80s returns to terrify viewers with this remake that proves how horrendous high school dances can truly be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her prom in style. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally arrives, Donna and her best friend friends get ready to enjoy the last big collapse in high school, living and partying until dawn. But while Donna is willing to look beyond her nightmares and into a brighter future, the man she thought escaped forever returned to one last dance. An obsessed killer is on the loose, and he will kill anyone who tries to stop him from reaching his only Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see the day of graduation, and what will Donna do when she is forced to face her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis co-star in the slasher remake that will have teenagers dressed in tuxedos everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they enter the dance floor. A plot that will probably put you off to see this. Witch if you ask me is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without much work to do, McCormick tries desperately to take the strain out of the most ordinary situation. At one point, a girl is leaning on a floor lamp (a lamp!) And McCormick tries to fill it in a moment of fright. Desperate times really require desperate measures. There have not been so many cabinet pictures since the last IKEA catalog. At the time of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there is probably a strange and scary movie to be extracted from the mercantilization of glamor and the scary obsession of society with youthful beauty. This is not the movie. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid at all costs. Nobody's going to like Prom Night, it's a disappointment to those who usually like hack-job remakes. Considering his absolute lack of blood or fear. One night you'll be in a hurry to forget.
