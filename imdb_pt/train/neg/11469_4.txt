The ORCA is not exactly bad, but it's not the best time for Richard Harris either. Like a madman, a fisherman resembling Ahab, Harris enters a death game with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale's "wife" and the fetus. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale specialist who gets involved with Harris. She yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and somehow ends up in the Arctic fighting the revenge of the crazed whale. There are no special effects to speak except what appears to be a round mirror to the eye of a whale - there are innumerable Harris plans reflected in the eyes so the public understands that the whale knows who it is. Bo Derek, as one of Harris's crew members, has a particularly nasty getaway with the Orca and most of the supporting cast, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn also do not do very well.
