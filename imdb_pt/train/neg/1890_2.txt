The problem I encounter with this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or a movie. A mixture of the two genres simply does not work and this leaves everything hanging in the middle of nowhere. This is most important because the director has chosen the extremes of what should be happening around our daily lives, making it a rather unconvincing documentary. If it's to be a thriller / drama, this is very boring and monotonous. In both cases, what is the morality or message the director is trying to convey to the public? That around us are people who mistreat others who are willing to be mistreated? That there are many crazy madmen around us? So what?
