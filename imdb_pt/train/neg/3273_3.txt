The Dukes of Hazzard is a great achievement? a $ 53 million movie that is worse than any episode of a 25-year-old TV show. The storyline is useful enough, but irrational fun is rarely found and the cast is rather atrocious: Johnny Knoxville is more transient than protagonist, MC Gainey's sheriff, Roscoe, is a boring bandit, boring Enos of Michael Weston, apparently Willie Nelson seems to be waiting for the cancellation of the check and Burt Reynolds, stuck in some purgatory where he is doomed to relive his old films as a player, is a curious choice for Boss Hogg to say the least, but he has a good time with a heckler and a hundred-dollar bill. Do you know that a movie is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen presences ?? But worse than the screenplay or cast is the desperate direction of Jay Chandrasekhar: seemingly born with no notion of comic timing, unable to do much more than two basic shots and seemingly clueless how to shoot a car chase let alone the decent pair. acrobatics in the film, he seems determined to sap the movie of any signs of life before they materialize. There are a couple of postmodern moments around the Confederate Flag and Daisy's stereotyped role in each episode, but no movie that makes you wait for the days when Hal Needham was directing this kind of thing (and evil) can be a good thing.
