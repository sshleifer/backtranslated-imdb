Based on the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this movie. I really apologized to them - all 4 of us hated and spent all of our time looking at our watches waiting for the movie to finally end. Half of the stickers are bizarre, with very little entertainment value. There were some scenes from Paris - for example, I was anxious to see some photos of the Latin Quarter, but I really could not recognize anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything, or reacted in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual movies, do not miss it. If you are down to earth like me, you will regret what you have seen.
