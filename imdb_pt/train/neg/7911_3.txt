It was not remarkable enough to be really horrible, he was incredibly lame. The story was not at all bad, but the execution was horrible. For starters, it was too quick to get emotionally involved with what was happening. It was just badly paced. The dialogue was so absolutely dull, just boring and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, cripts, made it boring of Deadpool. How the hell do you make Deadpool boring? He was not even funny. He was not crazy. He was just a boring guy with a pair of swords he could not even use properly. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And since when he had telekenisis to make the cards simply float and fly, or super force to jump hundreds of meters in the air? And what the hell was going on with all the stupid moves of the chopper? I mean, we know they're mutants, but they still exist within the realm of physics. A round bo's staff is not a helicopter blade, you can not fly spinning too fast. Which Gambit would not be able to do anyway. Neither Deadpool, especially when using it as a substitute for a true fight choreography. <br /> <br /> And this film is proof that cable work should only be used by fight coordinators who know what they are doing and know better than to use it at all. not married. shot. as a substitute for real fight choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of Marvel's most physical comic fighters (Logan, Creed and Wilson), and some of the worst fighting choreographies I've ever seen in the movie's recent memory. It was as if the stunt coordinator had just shrugged and left everything to the guys for special effects. <br /> <br /> And then you had the outbreak, with all those mutants that did nothing. Even the mutants that had been shown in their cells to have powers (good to see a quicksilver nod), f-all when they left. Only Emma-really-lame-to-this-movie-Frost and Cyclops did something. <br /> <br /> And since when was Logan so beautiful? And the stupid one: "The bullet will take away your memory". Do not you think Xavier and the X-Men would have noticed the big bullet holes in their adamantium skull when they did X-ray on X1? I felt sorry for the man of Liev Schrieber, he really brought a good saber considering the script. He made one of Marvel's simplest super villains look real. But he could not save the film from his own epic claudication. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this was the level of the "Daredevil" to suck. Decent history, good actors, absolutely horrible execution.
