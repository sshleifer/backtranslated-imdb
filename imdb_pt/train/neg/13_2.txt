Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi-interesting characters. As the writer (also one of the stars?), Fictionalized his own bullshit and added an incredulous fantasy of drugs and murder to make it "hot." From the predictable rap and house soundtrack to family conflicts, it's misinterpreted, stereotyped, and ultimately terribly annoying. Even the title was made before - the IMDb list FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: I saw on Showtime, which listed the synopsis of one of the other movies. I was in the middle before realizing that no one was a police officer in disguise. Even the other stereotype would have made it interesting if that happened.
