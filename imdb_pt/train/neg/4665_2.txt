I really wanted to like the pillow book. Intriguing story, interesting character outlines, Ewan Macgregor not totally totally glorious. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway was so delighted to present the film in a unique way, not for the benefit of the film. I will not even mention the abysmal performance of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> You get distracted from the story with 4 billion tiny windows and calligraphy scrolling at the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the song you're playing. It seems that he lost the vision to present the real story and develop the plot, and got involved with foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a portrait of John Singer Sargeant in a colorful Hallmark frame that says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in large bright letters. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a fluke of the auteur director's ego instead of what might have been - disturbingly and horribly beautiful. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), It could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's best to relegate to art classes that take themselves too seriously.
