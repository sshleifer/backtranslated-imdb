When I look for new cars, I hope boats are not shown. When I drink the Coke source, I should expect the drink to contain Coca-Cola. When I watch a movie that embellishes itself with the name of an excellent scientist, I hope it is in some way relevant to that person or to his work. This could have been people arguing the diary of my grannys. The material covered is relevant only by the fact that they vaguely draw science. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, and the second time I stopped watching it. <br /> <br /> I love science and documentaries. I'd rather watch them on the latest blockbuster. However, does this fall far short of providing anything worth your time? Avoid at all costs.
