I should explain why I gave this ... "work of art" rating of 1 star out of the possible 10. Simply because it is difficult or almost impossible to classify it impartially. it would probably have been the same if I had given the 10/10 - explanations would anyway have followed. <br /> <br /> I do not like these senseless movies like HOSTEL - I think it's disgusting and pretty terrible (in every way possible contextual), but as I discovered after watching this movie - there is a genre called "historical drama" - and it probably would have been 10/10, as there is a lot of it and Tarantino would have been more than happy with it (and made Kill Bill 3 shed even more blood on the screen than here to show that it is possible ). but the thing about the "historical drama" genre is that it's a subcategory of "junk films" where John Romero is the blood-dead-of-the-courage emperor and then can not automatically be classified as his standard movie - how these are movies that are made on purpose and you can not tell if the comically bad moment was made, or simply was bad. is for people who like to have fun, bad script and everything else. And by some turn of faith - I am one of them too. There are days when I have a desire to see a really bad movie and look for some junk and here you go - the day is saved! but this is definitely my opinion and does not match with others. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to say is that if you want to watch a terrible movie - then Fellini's Casanova is definitely the choice, but take my advice and do not evaluate it by default.
