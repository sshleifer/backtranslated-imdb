Another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits to fight each other. This time the time travelers of the future arrive in 1992 and recruit some people to return with them to 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving a future Japan from destruction. But having fulfilled this task, time travelers are revealed as a bunch of double crossers whose own creature goes into fury, and without Godzilla to stop it? Eek! It all sounds pretty silly, and it probably is, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks pretty good as well. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just rubbish, not nice junk, and the film ends up being as monotonous as its predecessors. Keep an eye on Spielberg's fragile joke.
