This unprecedented adaptation of one of Martin Amis's weaker novels can not even make comparisons with other drugged works such as Requiem For A Dream or anything written by Irvine Walsh as he struggles to decide whether it's a stick figure or a hyper- realist. Hallucinations conducted by William Marsh in super-saturated tones, a group of students who dropped out of public school converge on a mansion waiting for three American friends to attend a weekend of decadent drugs. And that's it. Except for the absurd sub-plot that will soon be the main plot about an extremist group that expresses itself with the violent assassinations of the world's elite figures, whether political or pampered. Inside the first roll, you know exactly where you're going. <br /> <br /> What does a talented actor like Paul Bettany do in this tiresome and poorly written hole? Made before her rise to fame and Jennifer Connelly can be sure that if he had been offered this garbage now he would have immediately changed agents! Avoid.
