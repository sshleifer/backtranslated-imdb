This film was not programmed in the Italian theaters, I saw it in a manifestation called "fantafestival". I find it terrible because some scenes look like chaotic and somber music videos, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no suspicion in the movies. movie. Music is completely out of the story and I have no words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the movie seems to be interesting, but a few minutes later, it becomes busy.The story is interesting, but the precise development of a complete review.
