Two old friends are sent to Japan to retrieve the results of a genetic research containing video tapes, which is stolen by the black-suited ninjas at the beginning of the film. First they only have to learn a little ninja skill, because "only ninjas can defeat the ninjas". <br /> <br /> Sakura's assassins strive to be a fun ninja movie, but they fail so much. The whole movie is so hollow and predictable that it's hard to say something good about it: the same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before, the characters are briefly drawn, the direction is monotonous and the screenplay offers nothing surprising, even in the final scene, which by itself reduced the value of the film (garbage). <br /> <br /> Even the 80's ninja fan who understands the aesthetics of junk, it's hard to find this film to be unusable. . It simply offers nothing new to the viewer, neither on the visual level nor in the plot. Shurikens are played and katanas are swaying, but not enough to lead the way, and similar fighting scenes dull even the most insensitive viewer after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's hard to recommend movie to anyone. Even the clumsy performance of Franco Nero in "Enter the Ninja" lags behind the American ninjas of Sakura's killer. Even in visual level movies has no ball and it is a waste of time trying to find great fighting scenes in this film: There are none. All in all, one of the most futile ninja movies I've ever seen. It does not matter even for curiosity. Trust me on this. <br /> <br /> Â½ of 10.
