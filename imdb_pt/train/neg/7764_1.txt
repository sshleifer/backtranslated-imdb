What is it ? A low budget sexual comedy? Either way, it perfectly describes the people in Spain. They could have a better idea, I mean, they've made this kind of movie since the 60's ... and people like them! This is not a teenage or family comedy (you can not let your 12 year old son watch two guys in bed kissing, he will never want to go to Spain). This should be classified as "R" because only people over 35 seem to laugh watching: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I do not like gays (which is a pretty important part of the movie). <br /> <br /> Alien humor is horrible in movies (except Kusturica), stick with the dramas! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
