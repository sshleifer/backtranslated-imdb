To be honest, I knew what to expect before watching this movie, and I have to say that it has the worst acting I have ever seen. It has its moments, and on a comedy level it's a lot of fun, but I fear it's not scary, and stupidity is taken to a new level. There is much unnecessary, and the plot is everywhere. I have no idea why the aliens were evil, and why they got to that remote part of the country, (I mean who would go there anyway?), But I did not care about it, because I had fun with the costumes and the bad CGI. As for the B films, this deserves the title of "being so bad, it's good" and pleasing the filmmakers because they probably knew what they were doing. Long can these movies continue .....
