Mix exotic exotic tropical locations, babies in tiny costumes, explosions, cute clones of Dudley Do-Right, a movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), a bit of martial arts and a sexy villain (Tracy Lor ... Sorry, Tracy Elizabeth Lords) and you would think it would be a fun escapist. Not so! This is a somber TV movie and although it likes to promote itself as a "Charlie's Angels" deal, it's not nearly as good as the original series or even the recent but irreverent and stupid C.A. movies. This abomination is best described as an Andy Sidaris movie by THIRD RATE. Nowhere as fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii," although some of the fighting scenes are decent enough. The girls spend a lot of time posing and trying to look very straight and it gets annoying after a while. There are genre things better than that out there. Oh yes, and "babies" are not as good as they like to think they are. Terrible soundtrack ... when it's there.
