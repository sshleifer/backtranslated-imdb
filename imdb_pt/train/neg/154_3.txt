I watched this on DVD in the original language with English subs. Either the caption was too bad or the actual dialogue does not make much history and gives any character development. There are some HK stars, but the film does not need its presence to improve or get worse. Is bad. The bright, colorful scenes made in computer graphics are attractive for color and brightness, but can become oppressive in a short time. If anything this makes me think of a kid movie with its uninterrupted barrage of cg, fight scenes and crap plot. I'm sure I understood what happened in the film, but the whole delivery of the story went awry.
