What the ........... is it? This should undoubtedly be the biggest waste of film, settings and camera of all time. I know you can not set your expectations for a high 80's slasher, but this is too stupid to be true. I taught this movie for $ 0.89 and still feel like asking for my money back. Can you imagine who STINKS is? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this movie and what are their motivations? Well, actually, you could not care less. And why should you? The makers of this piece of junk certainly did not care. They did not try to create a little tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's a lot easier to find money with a name like this) also made Kindred (1986) which was quite nice and recently he did Soul Survivors. Crap complete as well, but at least that one had Eliza Dushku. This junk has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who ??) Yes, that's right, the girl Melrose Place. Your very memorable character dies about 15 min. after the opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but no one seems to mention or miss him later, so who cares? The rest of the actors ... they do not deserve the term actors, in fact they are completely uninteresting. You're waiting for them to die a quick and painful death ... and not just your characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
