I gotta admit I got this one a few times on the USA Network. There's just something about the sheer stupidity of this movie that makes me want to watch it whenever it's on. Yes, you're right about the sub-par act, the plot that only a seven-year-old could enjoy, etc. But I can not help feeling sympathy for some of the actors. Then again, some of these actors signed up for the even more heinous sequence.
