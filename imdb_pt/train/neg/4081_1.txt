This is not the worst movie I've seen of Peter Greenaway, but it's close. This dishonor goes to the worst pillow book. The films of this director of 3 that I saw I think they all to be miserable. Like The Cook ... any positive film he exhibits is utterly irremediable by the disgust of his material and global presentation.
