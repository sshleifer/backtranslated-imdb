Of course, he had some of the ingredients of a good movie. The plot is good, if a little bland and the acting good enough, though I did not understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a pronounced Australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the US. My biggest problem, however, was with the wardrobe. I know as a rule, the average American is considered a sloppy closet by any European who trusts himself but that was beyond that. Anna's color combinations were positively ghastly !! And that excuse for potato sack, sad for a coat she wore throughout the movie made me go out on hives. I suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many schoolteachers walk through Prada?), But simple does not mean an absolute lack of taste. A word to the wise ...
