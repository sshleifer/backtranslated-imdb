As an ordinary movie watcher, I can not say I enjoyed watching this movie. Not too emotional for a drama, not too exciting for a thriller, not too fast for an action. In addition, some moments of the film are hardly credible. OK, I understand, the soldiers get a little crazy out there, but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life, shooting into the middle of a hostile city, and after being yelled at by a teacher's wife to run away, without having made a question (appropriately). It would look terribly romantic if it was an animation or something, but it's supposed to be a SERIOUS movie about the war. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes the impression that it's just a crude preview of a movie, and it needs a lot of work. It seems that the filmmakers wanted to create an image of a brave emotional soldier, but all these "curves" of their psychology seem simply unnatural. <br /> <br /> This photo left a question in my head: WHY? Why did they give an Oscar? Why six? And IMHO is the most exciting part of the movie :)
