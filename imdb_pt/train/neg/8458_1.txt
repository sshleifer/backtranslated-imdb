I bought this movie last week at my local movie gallery. It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one. Horrible mistake. The box says it would be a very good movie. Well, it starts as if it were this great movie. For about 5 minutes, this is it. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who is killed trying to save her boyfriend, Jack, from a bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a farmer the people of the city fear. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she is supposed to be afraid of this bull, and goes on that hunt to find him. It was the first 5 minutes that are good. What follows after that will only get 100 times worse. Who wrote the script, in my opinion, had to make some acid trip or something, because nothing else made sense. Jack is running away and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary, who gives him a ride. I think Mary is a Virgin Mary type character. You know, the mother of Jesus. But who knows, I could not do that. While they're running ... we get to see bandits, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc ... And all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts trying to figure out what's going on. Needless to say, I got the film back and traded for something else. It's horrible, I tell you, horrible. And, there is absolutely no bull fight in this movie. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. I hope I have helped some other people not waste time on this film.
