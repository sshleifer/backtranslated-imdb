The movie seemed to appeal to me because of the new type of Pokémon Celebi. But the plot was off course and had no interest like the other movies. It was a waste of money and time. The same vile humor and bad cliché. The movie was no use if you wanted to make the Pokémon famous. The movie should be better not associated with anime like Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. The design and settings do not conform to the standards of the original anime. It's a shame to even talk about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and will give up the Pokémon. Digimon is more of an anime and does not fall close to Pokémon. The second film is released at the end of 2002.
