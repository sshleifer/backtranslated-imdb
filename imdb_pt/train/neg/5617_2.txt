This documentary is based on incomplete considerations of evidence, in which Brian Flemming, perhaps on purpose, fails to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial error is one of the first: His claims about the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ overlook key facts, such as: The existence of some creeds formulated within Paul's letters. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus have already been made in statements of faith, possibly within a few years of the death and resurrection of Christ. ** The testimonies of early Christians can not simply be dismissed as mere fantasy. There were, in fact, many people claiming to be the Messiah during this period, but only one remained: Jesus. Because? For it would have been absurd to have believed that Christ was the Messiah and to die for these beliefs if they knew that he had not been resurrected. ** Even though the Gospels are more liberated, we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written during the lives of other eyewitnesses that would indicate inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier. What I'm saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and selfish job that evokes different arguments and evidence to serve its anti-Christian view. Do not be fooled by bad research.
