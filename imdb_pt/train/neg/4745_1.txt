Needless to say, this movie was horrible. The Chinese wholeness is awakened in their being because the ancestors were hard to sell. But to tell the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it, is just laughable. This is like saying that every American knows American history without studying, Filipino, etc., etc. This is not believable. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible. He talked about Shin being from a monastery in China - later identifying him from Beijing. However, the opening sequences of the film show the map focusing on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas such as Mongolia on its own, granted. But it is a distinct nation and even labels "Mongolia" on the map. Did the Disney studios fail in the geography of 5th grade? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial, at best, and yet she feels connected to him. Your training is just extravagant too. And let's get right to the point: everything about this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry. The action of Taekwondo was super played and unrealistic in many cases. The evil-eyed thing was tacky. However, the end of getting out would have been the only thing of descent on that. They should have let evil eyes end in him. But instead, evil is defeated. Yey! <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not worth the dog's time in the movie. Brenda Song should continue with another studio. "F"
