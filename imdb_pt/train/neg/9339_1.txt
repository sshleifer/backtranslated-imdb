I thought they should have called this movie "Whites" instead of "Heights." Godawful ... the kind of movie that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so obsessed and think their lives are so important ... give me some time. Such a white lily cast that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character, this movie was clamoring for someone real to come in and steal it ... and so they introduce, get this, a character even whiter than the rest of the cast (I thought he was an albino at first), who is supposed to be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher that accent! Intellectually dishonest ... this movie is the kind of movie that can fool so many people into thinking it's worth it because it has the pitfalls of something more ambitious. Better to fill the theaters with MI5-10 than with that pretentious crap ... it must have been a better move because you can not fall off the floor.
