I'm shocked to find out how many fans this program has. They still did not say that Friends was, at best, an "average" sitcom and not as good as the others. Let's face it, were it not for the cast of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows if this show would have lasted as long as it did. I doubt that much. Although as the series progressed, the Friends became progressively more predictable, lame and boring than I could care less about the characters - of whom they are the most overrated in TV history - or their suffering or who I was with sleeping with whom. And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even when I had all these Hollywood actors in the movie world, I still have not bothered to tune in. The writing on Friends became obsolete and I lost interest in this show from the sixth season and in the end. Well, it was predictable to say the least. <br /> <br /> What was annoying was that it lasted for ten seasons, while some of my favorite shows lasted only three, four seasons for example and were eventually canceled and blew out forever. The show should have stopped immediately when the cast wanted higher salaries. In fact, as far as the series went, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it was over in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of the sitcom. Now we are talking about a reunion show of friends coming to our TV screens very soon. And yet, I will not be looking forward to it.
