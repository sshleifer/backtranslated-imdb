Let's start by saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said "I missed the joyride". I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> The jokes were terrible. The presentations were medium. Something went terribly wrong with the movie. Emraan totally deserved better. Everything CELINA JAITLEY did was exhibit. Hrishitta bhatt was fine. Emraan hashmi was also fine. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. so he uses RADHA and pretends to love her, just because his father is a musical director and could help him become famous (since the father obeys everything his daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to GOA for fun. There he meets ROME (CELINA JAITLEY) and falls in love with his appearance and tries to flirt with her BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> So that night, ROME can not open the bedroom door, and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he can not, ROME will ask for help. While she is away, MANN is able to open the door and decides to enter and sits in her BLA BLA BLA bed. ROME comes and they have one night only. However, that night, ROME fell in love with him. That morning they identify the underworld don (MAHESH) who sees everything. He loves ROME and could not bear what he saw. He orders them to marry and, with fear, MANN obeys the order and ROME of Merry. So the wedding news ends in the paper. MANN is later discovers that he loves ROME after they make a music video together. He is now caught between love and fame. BLAH BLAH BLAH. <br /> <br /> the movie is horrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic and the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is also amazing. PEOPLE, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.
