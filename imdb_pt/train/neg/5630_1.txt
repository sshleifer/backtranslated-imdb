The only reason I watched the movie until the end was the "hope" of seeing something interesting. The movie is very bad and the girl's performance is very, very bad, honestly, I'm not a film critic or an expert, but you just need common sense to realize that this job is incredibly bad. The first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to speak was: "She has an affair with Willem Dafoe and he agreed to help her with the script and appear in her film since she is the brilliant director. " .. surprise, surprise, the next day after watching the movie I discovered on the internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife. Terrible history and terrible performance.
