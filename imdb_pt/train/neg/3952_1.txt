Return of the Boogyman is a horrible movie that does not play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they do flashbacks from older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a clip show. <br /> <br /> Movie Mutch is constant and irritating flashbacks from the first movie. Again and again the same footage. How boring is that. <br /> <br /> The film is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first film. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie I did not want to see. the same scenes over and over again and I do not know who it would be. The whole movie looks like it was made quickly to make a few bucks and that's it.
