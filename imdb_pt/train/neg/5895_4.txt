Is Miike like Chabrol, alternating art with dreck, sometimes confusing the two? Does he match the fifty-fifty rate with some claim to Chabrol? Do we see here much or little Miike? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill ten lines just by quoting the theft thefts, allusions and cliches of Chakushin ari (One Missed Call). Others here will hit most of them, though it may not be the Saimin of Ochiai (hypnosis) for despicable television provoking supernatural things. Just once, when Yumi catches the zombie mother in his arms, One One Call Call scares me a little. <br /> <br /> Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in Audition's abuse story, and as Boss Aoki of Dead or Alive, drowning droppings tank and more, may be the most convincingly evil character actor I've ever seen. So here he is a cop.
