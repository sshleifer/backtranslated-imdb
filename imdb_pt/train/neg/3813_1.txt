What a crime ... <br /> <br /> You forgot to brush your teeth ... let's do a 30-minute show about it and get some kids to make some noise and then make dad give a talk to them, because that's what He has to do. <br /> <br /> But do not forget that Uncle Joey has to make some weird noises and cool guys, so Uncle Jesse has to show up in his black leather jacket and jeans and look good for a few minutes while everything world discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around ... <br /> <br /> Yes, full of little adventures about a lot of nothing and a whole story to build around it. <br /> <br /> Full House will not only bore you with tears, but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would.
