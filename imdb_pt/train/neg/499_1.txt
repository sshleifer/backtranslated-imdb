The Horror Channel plays nothing but gothic erotic movies every night from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am, but the 'fright' factor of them is very limited, if any. In fact, I'm sure I'll find a million-pound lottery lottery more than anything this channel has to offer. <br /> <br /> The Lego Dance Dance deserves a special mention, because I feel, the undisputed low of a channel full of basses. I can not even begin to say how bad this movie is, but for the purpose of completing the 10 minimum lines required by this site, I'll at least give it a try. <br /> <br /> First, the title is misleading. and has no resemblance to the onscreen action. In fact, the movie could have been called 'Toothbrush' or 'Wallpaper' for everything that has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpaper. <br /> <br /> There are no leeches for miles and the worst is that there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here. A more appropriate title would have been: 'The Italian Count takes five people to a scary castle and bores us for ninety minutes.' Yes, that fits better. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and the dubbing is terrible, and that guy who plays Seymour was almost as woody in his walk as it was in his character ... abysmal. The only saving grace of this film is a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two very small and very interesting scenes of heterosexual sex, and the additional attraction in which each female character releases her kit. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, direct a great birth away from this. No vampire, no dance, no scene of brutal or horrendous nature, and no way in God's land. I'll never, never, ever watch this again. <br /> <br /> No word of lies, this movie could put you out of movies for life.
