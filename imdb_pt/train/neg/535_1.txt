Some of these comments from the viewer are simply ridiculous. Is not it painful to watch with your significant other? I was apologizing to my boyfriend for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and terribly strange. <br /> <br /> Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were unfit for this, especially with Vanessa making that ridiculous American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same clumsy girl she was in My So-Called Life. She still has to struggle in some way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only redeeming parts of this movie, she stood on the screen for five minutes, and I swear to God, she reached out the screen and gave me an awkward slap. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, it gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, this was a well filmed movie, it was really beautiful, the settings were curiously dressed, providing relief for the intense boredom I was feeling. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's just pathetic when a movie that features a cast consisting of "The Greatest Actresses of Our Time" sucks. It sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors, and the main character (Ann) was a big jerk. I was glad she died. But that's because I felt bad for Lila, Ann's friend - mostly because those two women were better actors and made me feel a little empathetic. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD job, Evening the movie. You were not funny and it was not even thought-provoking. I hope the book is better, so do not waste even more people's time. 3/10
