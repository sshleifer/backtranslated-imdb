All I could think of while watching this movie was the B-grade slop. Many have spoken about its redeeming quality, is how this film portrays such a realistic depiction of the effects of drugs and an individual and his subsequent spiral into a state of self-perpetuation of unfortunate events. However, in fact, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and therefore not convincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. As for the plot, it was dull, unimaginative, implausible. it's complicated. You can read most of the other reports on this movie and they will say pretty much the same as I would do. <br /> <br /> Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive, but when faced with this boring action ... it seems they can only upload a movie so far. The action is weak and intermittent: some punches thrown here and there, and a final shooting at the end. Nothing really to write about. <br /> <br /> As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great to watch for the simple reason that they are 'bad', you have fun in that fact. This film, however, is a void. Is nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, if someone is really in need of an educational film to scare people away from drug use, I would seriously recommend any number of other films out there that would address these issues in a much more form effective. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Repulse in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Although one should also take a look at some more gay films on the same subject, like 'Go' (both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'. In a final note, the possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones, was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a little of that great movie was corrupted by 'Loaded' is vile. <br /> <br /> Overall, I strongly suggest that you save your money and your time by NOT watching this movie.
