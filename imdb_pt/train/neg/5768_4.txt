Well I was excited in the beginning to download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is great, the lip sync is horrible, and you keep watching the movie in the hope of understanding what's going on just to realize that nothing is happening. You do not feel any emotion for the characters, only sorry for the creators for wasting their time. I saw short films with twice the excitement in half the time! This could have been a great short if they had just hired a real director. I'm sure everyone in Blender is excited to show off their software and rendering capabilities, but sorry for telling stories is what a movie does.
