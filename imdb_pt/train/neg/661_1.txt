OK. So I just got back. Before I begin my analysis, let me tell you something: I wanted to like this movie. I know I've been negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and really go out liking the movie. I did not do. <br /> <br /> It's not just the fact that every cliché of horror you can imagine is in it. And is not it just the fact that they turn every little thing into a scare (walking on a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?). It just was not scary. One thing that surprised me was: there was more blood than I thought there would be ... which is not saying much. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Donna being left by Lisa's mother for her. House. She comes ... goes upstairs. The camera slides to her father, dead on the couch. Spooky. It goes up, where the baseball bat scene happens. He finds his brother in his bed, apparently dead (how could she say? He did not have a blood stain on him). Killer enters, Donna hides under the bed, the mother dies. She runs out screaming for help. Killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut to the therapy session. This confused many people - everyone was asking if her family really died or if she imagined it - and she mentions how the nightmares began to return. The fill dialog follows. <br /> <br /> They are very fast. Few scenes in the hall, they go to the hotel. Of course the killer is already there (for some reason he escaped three days ago, but the police / family was not informed until he was already there). More filler follows. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about what happens in the movie, because I do not want to ruin it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan already made a post about it. But on the subjects of the deaths: they were not so exciting. People in the theater really laughed out loud (an experience I've never had before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls) during several of them. One in particular: the bus guy who gives the most 'hilarious' face with fear I've ever seen. The only death that involved blood was Lisa's, and that was very scarce. Your throat is cut, blood (if you can even say that - it was practically black) sneezes into the curtain thing. The only other blood was in Claire when we saw her body. Apparently Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death. HM alright? The film was one of the most clichés I have ever seen. Let's see here .. obligatory close-mirror-curtain-BOOM! scene. Checks. Twice, actually (you could tell they were fighting). Mandatory back-up-in-killer. Checks. There's also the backup scene in the lamp, but you've all seen it. Oh, you say you want a bird scare? Well, you got it! (Yes, they managed to incorporate one of these here). And, of course, the scene "we have security on all exits, but he still runs away." Should I continue? I could. <br /> <br /> For those who say the characters are not stupid, are you kidding me? "Oh, even though the huge alarm is ringing, literally PLEASE SPEND THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I'm going upstairs to pick up my package." These characters were some of the most flawed and idiotic characters of all time. The only nice character - Lisa - did one of the most stupid moves in the movie. Oh, I just realized that the psycho-teacher is here! I need to leave my strong boyfriend behind to flee alone to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator is slowing down? construction site! "Ugh At the end of the film, they all deserved to die. The only death anyone felt in remorse was Donna's boyfriend (I can not even remember his name - is it that bad?), And by that time the audience was completely drained of this cliché-free, scary movie. <br /> There were SOME good points - the acting was decent for the most part, and it was well filmed. But that's all. <br /> <br /> I would give 1/5, and that is generous. Just for the laughs (and believe me, the audience had some), and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People were booing after the movie ended and the buzzing after was very negative. Expect bad legs for that.
