"Unhinged" is a weird little movie, a forgotten slasher of the golden age of the genre. It is difficult to write a satisfactory review of this film simply because the film is so unique. The storyline is rather exaggerated - three young women on their way to a rock show are in a car crash and end up stranded in the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize that something is not right when they hear a strange breath and noises from the attic. In addition, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they fight intensely in front of their guest for dinner. The old mother even calls her daughter a prostitute and a bitch and accuses her of sneaking into the night to sleep with them. In the middle of the movie, when a girl finally decides to go out and get help, the murder begins. <br /> <br /> As far as acting goes, this movie is at the bottom of the barrel. NONE of the three beached girls can act, particularly the "leading" girl. It's almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same wood tone throughout the film. Mother and daughter are better, but not much. The movie is also very boring in parts and really, really creeps. The deaths are horrible, but nothing we have not seen before. However, as mentioned here, the film actually earns points with it's brilliantly disturbing and bloody ending. It comes totally from the left field and has the same shock value as the end of the classic "Sleepaway Camp" camp. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is boring and suffers from a horrendous and boring performance, a boring rhythm. The isolated and scary mansion and dark, sinister lighting give the film a grainy realism, but this is quickly shaken when one of the characters tries to act. It might be worth it if you manage to stay until the end, but I say it's best to just move forward in the last 10 minutes. 4 out 10
