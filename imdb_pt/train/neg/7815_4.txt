As a longtime comic book fan of Superman, through the 1950 series, the first two movies of Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark and finally Smallville, I was really hoping for something clever with "Superman Returns." instead we made Lex Luthor do another real estate conversion attempt, another super-beaten kryptonite sequence while wielding, and internal inconsistencies: he could not stop falling into the ocean when stuck with 6 " of kryptonite, but when Lois breaks 3 "of it, * leaving the rest embedded in it *, can it lift * a continent * into space? Really, the only hero in the story was Lois's partner - I do not remember his name out of hand. He did all sorts of heroic things that save lives with nothing but courage and skill - no superpowers, no invulnerability ... just a normal human. <br /> <br /> They keep making Superman so small. Why can not we have Superman battling Brainiac or fighting to save General Zod's universe instead of Lex's petty schemes? Oh, I forgot ... they're doing it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yeah ... I think I'm staying with Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You probably should, too ...
