'Chances Are' is a big mistake to see. You could meet director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and expect something fun from him. But I think I have to disappoint you. He made a very, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to the story, Christopher McDonald dies to be rebellious as a baby. The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns to his former hometown, where she meets her ex-daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?). <br /> <br /> They fall in love with each other. Then appears ex-wife Jr, Cybill Shepherd and Jr falls in love with her as well. I guess I do not even need to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr is at his worst. He copies Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> After the pastor 'Moonlighting' prove that she is not fit to act in movies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is one thing that this dull comedy can be used: as an antidote to insomnia.
