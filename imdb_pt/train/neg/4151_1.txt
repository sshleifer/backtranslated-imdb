This is probably the best horror movie ever made since Ed Wood died. <br /> <br /> I can not ruin the end because I have absolutely no idea what happened. I'll try my best, though. There are some types of lesbian vampires, but they keep changing bodies, so any character may or may not be the character you should think you are, or you may be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you may think, since none of the characters makes sense to begin with. There is no plot, character development, and random people appear, speak a few lines and then disappear, never to be heard again. There are also zombies, who are * possibly * the enemies of vampires, but there is also a kind of dream sequence within a dream in a psychiatric hospital, so perhaps none of this has really happened, and is the whole hallucination of the main character. . <br /> <br /> The positive side? Both girls from the front take off their shirts for a few moments. The special effects are simply incomprehensible (I particularly liked the incredibly slow and awkward fighting sequences). Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which increases the overall level of hilarity. <br /> <br /> It is worth the price of rent. We laughed until we cried.
