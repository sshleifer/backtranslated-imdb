This may be the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical of all time. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every scene and moment sounds false. I'll say though, that's almost bad enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> The hairstyles are remarkably dated. I can not for the life of me understand what one understands (conceptually) by opening the film with a theater exterior, where "A Chorus Line" is playing. Should we think these people are auditioning for "A Chorus Line," which contains the stories about the people who are taking the test? Oh, no, the show is crumbling. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production, and listened to the album hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do it?
