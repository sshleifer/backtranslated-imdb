Having just lost a few hours watching this and for 80% of that time in complete disbelief, I can give that garbage the turkey prize of the year, no problem. To say that the plot was unbelievable is a big euphemism. Frankly I'm lost for words to describe this absolute gut. It's not just the characters completely and totally without any resemblance of originality (this sort of thing was much better in dozens of 'serial killer movies'), but the acting was terrible. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who have been paid to do this, I hope you give your money back. Believe me, there are many new releases that are much, much better. Go and see.
