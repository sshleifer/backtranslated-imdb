The turgid rhythm of this film dulls us to any shock it may offer. There was no real suspense. Most of the characters were insipid. The Irish priest of the breast was as lame as the love interest. The interest is deceptive. The girl they chose to provide the film's sensuality might be better. The central conflict of the main character was not engaging. This movie is totally devoid of any good points. It's like a tedious exercise from someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but did it anyway.
