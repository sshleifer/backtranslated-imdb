In this movie, Joe Pesci hits a basketball. joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> and being consistent, the rest of the script is also not believable. Pesci is a funny guy who saves this movie from the absolute wreckage behind the basement, but the other roles were very bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which was not even well played. instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he looked more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there's the symbolic piece that's attributed to pesci as a girlfriend or something ... I do not even remember ... she was forgettable. <br /> <br /> Anyone who rates this movie above 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of movie studio trying to improve the reputation of this submerged movie, or at least one of those millions of media minions who do not can criticize efficiently (you know, people who feel bad if they give themselves something to score below 6). <br /> <br /> stay away ... away. and shame on the central comedy, where I saw this movie. they usually choose the best.
