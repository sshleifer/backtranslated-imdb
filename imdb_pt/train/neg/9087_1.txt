Canadians are too polite to boo, but the Toronto Film Festival crowd left the theater mumbling that they would rate the film 0 or 1 on their voting tokens. The premise is that a modern filmmaker is playing a 17th-century fable about the loves of pastors and pastors established in the distant past when the druids were the spiritual leaders. Working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms, including silly and impractical clothes and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry. The lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiot codes of conduct from which arise the situations of fakers and varied. The film could have been hilarious as a Monty Python piece, with which it closely resembles, but Rohmer's effort falls far short. The audience laughed at the jokes, but otherwise regretted the slow pace. The finish comes all in one race and is truly terrible. This is a trivial movie and a waste of time from your movie.
