I've always been a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman, so when the Sci-Fi Channel shot this movie, I had to see it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is a Wonder Woman movie just in name. She does not wear proper attire [she must have refused or ordered major changes] and the plot is like a poor man's James Bond. There is none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success, that is, superhuman strength or determined will. I do not even think Cathy is so attractive anyway. I would not waste your time on this.
