I'm sorry for all the fans, but this is a useless movie. The acting is bad, even wood, exaggerates the fear factor from the outset and does not work exactly. I think it should have been a turnaround in the end, but ended up being annoyingly confusing. What the hell? The guy who was killing everyone was one of the hunted? Try again. <br /> <br /> It's almost original, and neither is it particularly good as a direct slasher. And that's saying something. <br /> <br /> I think whoever did the casting, who wrote the script, and who thought of the concept should be ruthlessly fired and deported. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. If someone puts it in a party, throw the disk out the window and make a good horror movie, like Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
