A somewhat clumsy mystery of espionage with a predictable conspiracy about the dangers of World War II. The mystery is whether or not Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia. The best performance is made by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor who turned bad. He is the head of an espionage ring that tries to get information from Jane's amnesiac, coded information related to allied activities. Is she going to tell? Can she remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) is convincing as Massey's accomplice. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is nothing short of disastrous. It looks so bad that the cast has to be ranked as one of the worst in movie history. It is unfortunate that such a talented actor has a role that does not match their talents. The film is worth a look, despite being half spy and half gangster film, and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters. It's easy to forget that, amnesia is not necessary.
