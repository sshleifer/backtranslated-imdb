This is an anti-Serbian propaganda film made for TV. "Muslims are good, Serbian Orthodox Christians are bad." <br /> <br /> That's the message. <br /> <br /> Using "entertainment" to convey an advertising message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> And apparently many viewers and reviewers go with it. <br /> <br /> I know better. The Serbs, under the command of General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks, saved 500 American pamphlets shot from the Germans in World War II. Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and put British support behind Communist Tito. Roosevelt did the same, and as a result, after the war ended, Yugoslavia was handed over to communist Tito. <br /> <br /> And US ally Milhalovitch has been stifled by the media ever since. <br /> <br /> The film is part of the anti-Serb propaganda campaign designed by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG), which culminated in the Kosovo "War" in which Serbia was bombed by NATO because of false statements by the ICG. "in Kosovo full of" victims "of the unpleasant Serbs.The fact that there are no such common graves and the Albanians (Muslims) have no interest in Kosovo of Serbia are facts that most of the media does not print. /> I chose this film to watch because the description of a phrase on the video cover looked interesting. Imagine my disgust when I discovered that I had been cheated and rented another branch of the propaganda machine directed to Serbia. <br /> <br /> From this propaganda, someone should make a film about the Clinton administration's reluctance to enlighten Congress and the American people about its complicity in delivering Iran's weapons to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. I will not hold my breath waiting for such a movie.
