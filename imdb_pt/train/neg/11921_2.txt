I can summarize this movie using 20 words or less. Very predictable of a plot with potential to be funny, but instead falls flat on the floor. See, 19 words, however, I did not completely paint this movie with just a star but I decided to hit it two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and provided only eye drops to prevent me from ripping the DVD leaves the machine and explodes with an M80. My advice, take the $ 4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this accident by train, or you may want to send me the $ 50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged to take out your 12 gauge to use this piece of junk as a target practice.
