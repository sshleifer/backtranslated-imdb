Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... well, two of my friends and I, we ordered Pizza, sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi or at least something mummy but funny as Versus. But the naked blood sucked. It is a complete waste. All right, the scene with the woman who likes to eat is very striking. But that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. I will not summerize the plot, other people have already done, I just wanted to stop the hype. But watch and evaluate for yourself. Maybe we can push the rating to where it should be. One more thing that comes to my mind: the soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter ever was - ok, John is cool ... :) 2/10
