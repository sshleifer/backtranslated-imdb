I saw this movie the other night and I have to honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is fair, but the plot is totally ridiculous. A killer is born because of all the "energy used to make the movie" and if the film is burned, will the killer die? How unbelievable is that? The characters were underdeveloped to say the least ... for example, the man suddenly mentions "Are not you trying to complete the movie because your mother could not?" So should we go along with this? We had no idea she was her daughter until the middle of the movie. The film really did not highlight anyone, we knew nothing about the main people who survived, except that Ringwald's character was a crying actress, the guy was on the set when people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like his mother. . Do not truly dive to know who they are. It seemed like things were raging to get to the murders. The whole plot is very weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who has enjoyed this crap obviously needs to learn a thing or two about making movies. I can not believe that anyone would agree to star or even work on this photo. It's not funny, it was not scary and it was clich√© throughout the movie. I saw myself predicting what would happen before each scene, which I believe you were not difficult to do. It's a disgrace and I'm sorry I missed an hour and a half watching the mess. 1/10
