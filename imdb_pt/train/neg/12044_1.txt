I went to see the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here is what I learned: Contrary to popular opinion and history in general, Greek men were not gay. EVER. This was clearly established immediately at the beginning of the film and reinforced every five minutes or more thereafter. So it's safe for the American guys to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Helen de Troy always had impeccable hair and make-up. She looked beautiful in all her brief appearances in scenes that, although numerous, were probably all filmed the same day, one after another, with the director saying, "Okay, now it's beautiful ... okay ... OK, now looks scared ... well ... now it looks depressed ... well ... now it seems interested ... well ... now it's beautiful again ... well ... " > More Greek and Trojan men had a British accent. Those with an American accent could not act. <br /> <br /> The Trojans were similar to the Greeks, but they tended to be on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt does not blink Troy's biggest Helen line was, "They're coming after me." <br /> <br /> Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs go to the end. <br /> <br /> Achilles had a young friend with whom he was very close, but that was fine. They were cousins. It does not matter what the story says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell a whole story with just one expression. The Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names, but their statues looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in the drag. <br /> <br /> Greek men never touched unless they were fighting, just like American men. <br /> <br /> All the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color ... Light Egyptian, by Max Factor. Troy had only three women. <br /> <br /> There were many blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who otherwise would have really stood out. <br /> <br /> Despite their coastal location in the desert, the Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of wood to make bonfires, funeral pyres, Trojan horses, and the like. British actors look silly with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt only changes his expression when the sun is shining directly in his eyes. <br /> <br /> The Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their clothes always looked flawless. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the Greek temples were always in ruins, even when they were all new.
