I gave 1 for this movie. I can not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the greatest directors of Italian cinema, made such a stupid and ridiculous movie! All the stories of the people involved in the film are insubstantial, boring and uninteresting. Too long, too boring. The only things I've saved in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope Scola radically changes themes and style in his next film.
