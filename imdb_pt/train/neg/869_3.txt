Where to start ... If this movie had been a dark comedy, I'd say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (remember this was the price I paid, I bought it at Wal-Mart), this movie should be a thriller. The only THRILL I received was to watch Anne Wilkes's miserable interpretation of Misery without the snow-covered area of ​​Kirkland. If you want a good laugh on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to watch something at least halfway decent, then do not bother. <br /> <br /> I at least enjoy bad movies, the more, the better in most cases. But Wow ... I meant WOW !! The only person in the whole movie who did not speak badly was the boy, played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.
