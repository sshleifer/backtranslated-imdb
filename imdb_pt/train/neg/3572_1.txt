The wonderful "Z" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora movie about six months after "Butterfly." I had high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously BAD in this movie. <br /> <br /> Once again, it was the '80s and I have to tell you that Harold Robbin's work was eclipsed by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann ripped it off (she hated the way he wrote women), Irwin Shaw's work attracted many women and of course Sidney Sheldon had her kingdom in the late 1970s and then came Jackie Collins who made the women stronger and equal to men in every way in their books, more so. That's why this job smelled. Harold Robbin's work in the 1980s simply did not catch the audience. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's jobs was like throwing kerosene into the fire. The support cast was not a help either. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... that was horrible to see, and even 20 years later, it looks even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and everything was shot to hell when this was done. It would be difficult for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters has released her in "Hairspray" as a spark), although she has a good voice as a singer. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, wherever you are. ..Hairspray can go on tour! Join the show. You may be the biggest return story yet. <br /> <br /> I just hope they burn this movie for you, if you do.
