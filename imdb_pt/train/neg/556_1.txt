In my book "Wild Instinct" was a perfect movie. He has performed exceptionally in the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors in the smallest role. He had a wonderful picture, music and the noir scriptwriter of all time. All of this adding up to a movie that is as good as it will ever get! <br /> <br /> This sequence is exactly the opposite, it can not get worse, bad acting and a lame script, combined with inept direction, this is too bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you focused is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which is an exact copy of the original. These copies are so bad they make you laugh and I laugh a lot, though, because it was like watching the demolition of a glowing monument. The only good thing about this horrible mess is the excerpts from Jerry Goldsmith's BI1 score. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-wit in charge of the script even included the "There's No Smoking in This Room" dialogue at the interrogation scene, and yes she sends her lawyer (who is now a lawyer) away! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to have seen this horrible movie that should never have been made! It damages the original, it's so bad. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Mrs. Stone offered the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job, but obviously can not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body also applies to the production of films. There should be a law: never make a sequel to a perfect movie!
