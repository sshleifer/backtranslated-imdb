I do not want to go too far in the details because I really can not justify wasting too much time reviewing this movie but I had to give an alternative opinion to help people avoid the movie. The animation is rude and the story alternates between boring / nonsensical and extremely annoying. The mood was completely lost in the audience, and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is not a sci-fi action or anything like that - it's a slapstick comedy attempt, and the humor just did not work after being translated. It was a total task to watch this movie, and a horrible way for me to start the film festival, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for anything - I was not expecting a sequel to Ghost in the Shell, but I was expecting something fun, and just did not get it. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent the Kino Journey.
