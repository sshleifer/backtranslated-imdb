I'm being generous giving this movie 2 stars. the line about "you saw the wizard of oz" was the best part for me! with the terrible writing and acting as exhibited in this movie it is no wonder so many are taken on useless tv reality shows. do yourself a favor and leave the house and hit a royalty baseball game, you'll be glad you did it!
