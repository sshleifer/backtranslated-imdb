I found myself very involved in this movie, at least in the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie, it's Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic !! But that's where it ends. I seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie is able to confuse me completely, but I felt lying out, they all the time they take you in one direction and then suddenly they decide to go in a completely different direction in the end, they did not take any hits on it, this is not misleading, write and plan very badly, someone did not think of anything! <br /> <br /> I felt the movie would have been so much better if they had gotten into the plot that you were in front of, they also seemed to answer nothing, why did Jane (maria) set fire to the teacher's house? <br /> <br /> It's a great pity as I felt it started out as a relatively good movie.
