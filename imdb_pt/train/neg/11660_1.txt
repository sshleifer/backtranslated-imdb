Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear he has no real knowledge about how to make movies. he made a brilliant movie and this is a horror movie. Horror movie 2 was OK too, but everything Keenan did are real disasters. avoid such titles as do not be a threat to the center-south while drinking your juice on the hood ..... I know, what a title !!! Obviously, this movie too, just anything that has the name Keenans in the credits. <br /> <br /> It was an hour and a half in stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. Just trust me on this, maybe women might like this movie a little because of some of the things that happen, but overall this movie will never be appreciated by anyone with a taste in movies ........ 1/10 ....... Seaton
