I feel blessed to own what is known as Steven Seagal's worst film ever made. I knew I was doing something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. In the middle of the movie my eyes started to ache and I was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> Steven is Steven (with an ever-changing voice) and totally unbelievable in his role (as always). Who the hell leaves people in ponytail masks for the Forces? He also always devotes himself to totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years younger. The supporting actors seem to have been shot in the dark - by the way, did they film that movie in the dark with just a flashlight? <br /> <br /> This is truly abominable in every way possible. Invite all your friends and have a social event - it's truly special.
