Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sit there, both of us thinking, this has to improve, these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap. Unattractive characters, banal script and apathetic rhythm make long two hours. I actually could not hack and went out to do the grocery shopping (cat serinha being more attractive than this movie). The husband stayed and confirmed that it did not improve - by the time Buddy is killed, you were wishing everyone was run over by a car and end their miserable lives. It would be infinitely more fun. Beautiful landscapes and fantasies can not keep this alive.
