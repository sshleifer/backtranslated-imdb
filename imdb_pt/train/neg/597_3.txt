This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized. There are two ways to watch horror movies: either you do not really explain what is happening (or who the killer is, as in the Saw Massacre) or give the characters lots of background story and characterization so that everything is explained (Halloween it could be an example of this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Creep fails in this area.I see absolutely no reason to give a little fragment of the story by Craig without fully grasping the essence of his character or his motivation. character is fully realized, although the circular nature of Kate's character in the film is the most successful part of the story. In the end, this story is unmotivated and none of the performances give her the life necessary to make it captivating or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and the production of empty films that drag the film. <br /> <br /> This film will stand as another example of film (with the most is) this could be so much better even if it was never great. The only thing that was used correctly in the film was the scenario: the characters, the story, the direction and the writing in general would have benefited from a serious face-lift. <br /> <br /> The Creep serves a purpose as a stupid, silly horror movie without any intellectual or emotional investment, but alas, that's about it ...
