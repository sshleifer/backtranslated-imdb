I did not like this movie! In the first place, I do not know why, but everyone here says that Clémence Poésy's piece is excellent, which in my opinion is absolutely wrong! She's not like Natasha: another apparition, another character ... What's worse, she's a very inexperienced actress and that's why she was not able to play that role! She completely disfigured the heroine! That was really disgusting to watch her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunken man, who did not shave for 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye ... (Thank God, in this movie there are some actors whose piece was amazing!) I suppose, Alessio Boni dealt with his work very well! I was pleasantly surprised! He is one of the few people who read the book, which is very important for the play. )) The only thing I liked about this job was very beautiful view and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand a real sense, the goal, with which Leon Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
