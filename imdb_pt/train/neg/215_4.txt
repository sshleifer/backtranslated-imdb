I'm not much like Love Sick as I imagine. Finally the film expresses Alex's sexual relationship, kik, Sandu, his triangular love was full of intensity, frustration and envy, finally Alex woke up and realized that they would not have resulted and future. Happening was sad. <br /> <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu was at the AMC Theater on Sunday at 12 noon on 10/08/06, with us watching the film together. After the film, he told the public that the purpose of creating this film, which was to express Romanian sexual relations, was a bit complicated. <br /> <br /> From my point of view, sex life is always complicated everywhere, I do not feel any particular impression and effect of the film. The love of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and his brother Sandu were a kind of story next to the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons why I do not like this movie are, first, the movie did not tell us how they started to fall in love? It seems that after Alex moved to the building where Kiki lived, two girls fall in love. It does not make sense at all. Like a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Many fragments, you need to imagine and connect these stories through your mind. Secondly, the whole movie did not have a sexual intercourse scene of Alex and Kik, that's what I was hoping for ????. However, I still had some parts that I deserved to recommend. The "ear piercing" part was interesting. Alex was willing to suffer piercing pain to enjoy kik's love. This was a touching scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. In addition, the scene of them were lying on the football field, the conversation expressed their loves were true and passionate.
