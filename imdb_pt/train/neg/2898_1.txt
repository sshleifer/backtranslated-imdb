Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finally finished watching this terrible movie !!! I wanted to turn it off within the first as 10 minutes, but thought I'd give it a go because it just had to improve. Or at least have some redeeming qualities, as I figured at least it would be a kind of movie, or something really clever, or very well filmed or something ... Needless to say that was not the case and I wasted about an hour and a half of my life. I'm not even going to understand why it's terrible, because it's a waste of my time to explain that this may "contain spoilers" ... IMDb, you should calm down about the spoilers thing and pay more attention to ensuring that people who evaluate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved in any way in the movie or anything like that. I thought I would be humorous after this terrible movie to come bad hoe the rating would be and I was very, very shocked to see the ratings quite high ... all ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly should be about some completely different I'm still a big fan of IMDb, but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should not be higher than maaaybbbeee as a 3.
