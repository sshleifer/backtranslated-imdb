Seriously, I mean it very seriously, when I started watching the show I thought it was good. But the plots only got worse. The plot was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, he sometimes acts stupid. Your jokes are exaggerated. Your mother is the most silly character on the show. How can a mother treat her own child in this way, it would be okay if she were the daughter-in-law, but this was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first shows were a little funny. The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job. I do not know how these shows begin to play for so long. <br /> <br /> If you're really bored as I was and have nothing else to watch, I suggest you watch it.
