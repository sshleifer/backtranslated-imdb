In the first 17 minutes of director Bradford May's "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die," we've already gone through a silly recap of dubbing the first two films, hilarious over-performance, about three minutes of simply ripped footage of and a lengthy announcement of the tormented and tormented title character attends Universal Theme Parks - Universal being the company that distributed the film. Yes, "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die" is the handful when it comes to cheap money in the success of an earlier movie. This time, disfigured anti-hero Peyton Westlake (aka, "Darkman," played by Mummy, actor Arnold Vosloo, bangs horns with the evil lord of crime and the lousy husband Peter Rooker (played brilliantly by Jeff Fahey), and over the course of his career. A tiny movie grows to develop an affection for Rooker's wife and daughter, once again learning to care for someone else. <br /> <br /> This film is basically just a silly way for the studio to make more money from Sam Raimi's original movie, which I consider to be a great thriller. <br /> <Yes, and there is also a series of idiot sub-plots, including a villain who was supposed to be one of the original doctors to save Darkman after her scars, and she seduced our hero into thinking she's an ally before revealing her. create more superhuman thugs like Darkman. Apparently, she can not simply do the same thing in the bad guys she did in Darkman. Because? I really can not explain, because the film certainly does not. <br /> <br /> There is also a murder subplot involving a District Attourney that is threatening to overthrow the Rooker organization, and some other very silly things. happening. <br /> <br /> But that does not make sense. This movie looks like two or three episodes of a television program edited together more than a real movie. The direction alternates between very good and completely careless (a scene in which Darkman assembles his train-like vehicle and dodges a rocket launcher is simply silly), and the editing is a mixed bag. The movie only moves very quickly so someone really cares what's going on. And without spoiling it, the final 15 minutes of this movie, and in fact, the whole series is kind of ... I do not know ... 15 more minutes of filming backpacks. <br /> <br /> In fact, commenting on the issue, one of my favorite things in this movie is watching re-filmed footage from previous films, and then looking for images inside this movie that is repeated several times. Yes, it is so cheap. It's one thing to do a recap at the beginning of the movie, and maybe repeat one or two shots, but in full volume they do that (minutes of repeated pictures from previous movies), it's just sloppy and amateurish. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have to say that Darkman's psychedelic montage freak-outs are a little overdone in this movie. They are so stylized and exaggerated that they work, but only in light doses and in the proper context, as Raimi did in the original film. Here, there are at least four or five, and they feel very abrupt and out of place. <br /> <br /> That said, the film does have some good points. Some action scenes are well done. The clich√© story of Darkman yearning for a real life works properly for a direct resource to the DVD. Some of the performances are good, particularly Rooker's wife, portrayed by the beautiful Roxann Dawson. In addition, while there is no Danny Elfman, composer Randy Miller composes an enjoyable song that draws on Elfman's original themes. <br /> <br /> But overall, the film is too fast, cheap and silly to be taken seriously. Arnold Vosloo seems alternately bored and exuberant from scene to scene, and Fahey, while a joy to watch as an exaggerated villain, simply does not fit the series. <br /> <br /> As "Darkman II", I would recommend this to fans of the original, who will certainly laugh. Otherwise you do not have to sign up. One out of ten.
