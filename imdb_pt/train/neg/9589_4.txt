This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. It's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dancing across the screen - each with no apparent connection to the next. I rented this movie because I'm a David Bowie fan and I really appreciate the musicals. Ultimately, Bowie was in the movie for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. The moral of the story was really disconcerting. I did not know if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling. In the first half of the movie, I was laughing at how cheesy it was, but I liked the campiness of the "unsold" message. When the blacks began to be murdered, I thought my tape had been confused. Maybe I rented half of two different movies? No, there was a string of songs and dances from "Keep Britain White." I'm sorry, but World War II is not something you can write a musical about. At least not a musical that could be described as "exaggerated" as I have several times in this review. Overall, I would say that this movie could be so much better if it decided and created better actors. (And put David Bowie in it longer!) My Note: C-
