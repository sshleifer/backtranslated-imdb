When the movie was released, it was the biggest hit and soon became Blockbuster. But honestly, the film is a ridiculous watch with a plot that glorifies a loser. The movie has a Tag-line - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara", which means Sweet Love, but Sacrifice is Immortal. In the film, the hero of the film (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for the protagonist (Pooja Gandhi), although the two love each other! Its justification is the meaning of the slogan. This movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this attitude of "Priest-like Sacrificial" very thoughtful and therefore became the cult movie that is when they could have moved on with their lives. Ganesh's acting in the movie is Amadora, Crassa and Childishly Stupid. He really looks funny in a song, (Where Ondu Sari ...) when he should look all stylish and cool. Your appearance also does not help the main role. His hair style is poorly made in most of the film. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. His fantasies are horrendous in the film and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The good part about the film is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music of Mano Murthy, which are in fact the real saving graces of the film. Also the lyrics of Jayant Kaikini are very well written. The director Yograj Bhat has to be praised picturization the songs in a tasteful way. <br /> <br /> Anyway everything, except the songs, the movie is very common !!!!!!
