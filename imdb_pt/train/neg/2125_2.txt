If I had not been forced to watch this for work, I would never have spent the first 10 minutes. And even then I'll admit that I've moved fast through parts. The film version of 63 was far superior in all respects. Yes, I read that this one is more faithful to the original game, but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script in 1963! It's a long time, drags, the songs that are in this version and not in the movie version are boring and unimaginative. The version of "Kids" in the 1963 version was very funny and a true classic of the sarcastic humor of the parents. In this version, Kim is very old, Conrad is absolutely horrible to see (when someone ripped off his shirt of him I closed in disgust ... the director of this version has no idea what is sexy). This Conrad can not dance, can not sing (he can not even stay tuned) and is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley had really been like this, his career would have ended before he started. As for the other actors, well, I kept waiting for Alexander's wig to fall while he danced and Daly was totally acting like Mom. See Stapleton's performance in the film version to see the same role correctly performed by someone who understands the timing of comics. This TV version is nothing but a total waste of time from anyone.
