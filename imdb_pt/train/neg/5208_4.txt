This mini-series, also based on a book by Alex Haley as "Queen", tried to use similar formulas, that is, building a long history following the lives of a family for many years. While in 'Queen' the result was masterful, here in Mama Flora lacked the inspiration. First, perhaps in the book itself, and certainly in this television production. Much has been put in too much of a hurry over the years, so the unfolding saga is superficial, superficial, not as authentic as in the "Queen." Complete marks for set design in the earlier parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed, it seemed to degenerate into a sort of impassable mixture of Dallasian-forsythian in the last third of its three hours or more in duration. I expected more; but evidently Haley was less inspired by this story than by his quasi-biographical "Queen," and Peter Werner III is no match for John Erman. Only recommended for those who have an appetite for these long tales of growing generations.
