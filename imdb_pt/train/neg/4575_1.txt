I admit that I'm just a college student right now, a bigger Englishman in that. By the time I saw this movie, I was a high school student - I mean the first year of high school, but it may have been important, difficult to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes a long way in my honors physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that led me to read about the subject in several books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article I might find in Discover and like. I'm not a PhD by any means. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is just terrible. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everyone is. My mother is one of those people and since seeing this movie, she tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the movie. I tried to point out the various flaws and problems I had seen with the logic and science of the films - and they are numerous - and she rejected my claims because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with PhDs" In this case, apparently yes. <br /> <br /> Leaving behind the fact that earning a PhD does not necessarily require a person to be right or, indeed, intelligent. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to displace half of the film. Leaving this behind, the filmmakers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to imply that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he was completely opposed to them. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on but I think the Intuitor did a good job of unmasking the film, so feel free to read this if you want. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
