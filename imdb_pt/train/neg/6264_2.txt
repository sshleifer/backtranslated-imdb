Nightmare Weekend is a positive proof that some people are so desperate to be 'in the movies' that they are prepared to do just about anything. <br /> <br /> I'm not referring to the countless women who seem very happy to look completely starkers at this awful piece of garbage (after all, the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to co-star with a poorly made puppet named George. Now this is embarrassing !!! <br /> <br /> A bio-electronic being created by brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a demented lunatic clown with green wool for hair) is the artificially intelligent. interface to an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device (a silver ball the size of a golf ball) that, when ingested, can reverse character disturbances. <br /> <br /> Edward's personality change experiments have been successful in animal laboratories, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to conduct tests on humans, fearing that there may still be side effects. His evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no such scruples, and goes on to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all turn into hideous mutant murderers. <br /> <br /> With special bargaining effects, a cast totally devoid of talent and a plot that is almost impossible to follow (I took notes while watching the film, and yet I'm not entirely convinced that my synopsis is correct ), Nightmare Weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even multiple scenes of soft-core sex and a touch of blood can redeem. <br /> <br /> This movie also features one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), a walkman wearing an idiot who takes music from the '80s in a way that makes it look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
