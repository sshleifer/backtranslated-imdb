I just saw the movie last weekend, I'm upset and disappointed in that. Basically, the film says that immigrants, especially those from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, bring with them all who can with them from the old country and invade and take over what the Americans have been working with. What a very wrong way to look at immigration, and a much worse way of telling people about it. That's the main thing. Another thing, the general writing, directing and filming is at the amateur level of the village. The actors did very well, but it was not for them to save that pile of crap. Some jokes were funny, but most were bad and tacky. I could not wait to leave the theater, want my money back.
