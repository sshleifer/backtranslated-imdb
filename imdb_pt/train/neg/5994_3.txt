OK ... this movie could have been soooo good! All generations were exposed to the Thunderbirds and came to worship and this movie had some of the features one would look for in a good Thunderbird movie. The boats themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen while still keeping the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was simply fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, although not exactly who I saw Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and asked to believe in 8 year olds could fly 200 ton machines. It's not so much the fact that the film was centered around the kids that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was hitting me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard-earned money spent on the movie, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so obnoxious in the movie and that he seemed to be able to drive both the machines and his brothers ... which were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some very simple machines to use, if this is the case. <br /> <br /> The movie did not seem to know if it wanted to be serious or cheating. He tried to pay homage as he satirized and generally fell on his face. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 for Lady P)
