Actually, they spelled BRAIN on the credits, not BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they did not have the budget for a spelling checker. All the production money went to big old cars. There are at least two Packards visible here. One is a Darin convertible. A good yellow Packard convertible. <br /> <br /> The studio scenes show that there was some money spent on costumes and decorations. Old cameras, an exterior of Cyrus, street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing image were there. Written and misdirected. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it runs for about 104 minutes. It was over 85 minutes. He came to an end without reaching a conclusion. There was a collision, but no conclusion. The movie just got rid of the credits. 99 cents for that. I paid 99 cents for that. I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat's face while he was more excited. For a few seconds on Cyrus's scene after Darren McGavin got a call, it looked like maybe. .. this movie would have a surprise twist that would make an interesting movie. Then he stayed there. <br /> <br /> The young Latin actor played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) might have played a much bigger role in everything that was going on here. This cast could have made a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think if they cut out Brian's role and use Steven Bauer instead and change the script, save the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis band sound, then they have something. <br /> <br /> Here Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
