Oh my gosh! Please, for the sake of all that is sacred, do not watch this movie! It's 82 minutes of my life that I will never go back. Of course, I could have stopped watching it halfway. But I thought I could improve. It was not. Anyone who really liked this movie is a seriously sick and distorted individual. No wonder Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this movie is horrible, from acting to editing. I do not even normally write comments here, but in this case I will make an exception. I just wish someone had warned me before I hired this catastrophe.
