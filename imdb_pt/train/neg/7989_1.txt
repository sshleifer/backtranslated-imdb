I had high expectations after "My Beautiful Laundrette", "Bend Like Beckham" and (less) "East Is East". The stories of British Asians nesting in their foster home have had many good results on the big screen as well as a number of excellent TV and radio series (Goodness gracious me, etc.). This falls flat. Despite a good start, it quickly fell. <br /> <br /> Ultimately this was a terribly typical BBC effort, with strong regional accents, exaggerated characters, a soundtrack to "those were the days" and many "problems" in an attempt to be worthy . <br /> <br /> I've seen myself shrinking at many points during this movie. Writing is predictable. All possible cliches were dragged and airy. In fact, I find it difficult to think of any inter-cultural / intergenerational devices that could have been used that were not. The characters were fine and clich√©s: the eccentric nonconformist minister; the well-meaning but ultimately racist woman; overweight, arrogant aunt; the insistent Indian parents; the neighbor of the working class; the "wise" deep grandmother; the biker riding villain. The script was weak, with every chance of shocking the audience with racist dialogues of the two white racist characters taken. And why it had to be set in the 70's (besides needing an excuse for a soundtrack of the 70's) is a mystery. Possibly makes the characters unbelievable a little more believable for people born after 1979. I do not know. Even these things aside, a good performance could have led to a respectable obscurity. Instead, the usual suspects of "BBC comedy" were taken out. "Bend it like Beckham" had much better comedic acting (and serious acting, actually) than that, with a cast virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> In summary, a lazy script cliched, more acted, in a dull predictable story. Miss yourself <br /> <br />
