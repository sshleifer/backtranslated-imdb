Besides the great cinematography of the wonderful James Wong Howe in the battle scenes, this film is a real suspense. <br /> <br /> This is the second film I've seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda. The first was "Rembrandt" by Charles Laughton. It was so bad I hung up. This fear is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps, her performance as the virgin queen was good by the standards of 1937, but when you compare it to that of a Helen Mirren, it is absolutely no match. Robotically, Robson affirms his lines. His message of battle for the British troops is so heartless. <br /> <br /> Even a dashing Laurence Olivier can not save this boredom. <br /> <br /> Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she does not really convey anything here. To think, that Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the story with the Spanish Armada has been so boring in this movie.
