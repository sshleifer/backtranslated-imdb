This movie has some of the worst performances I've ever seen! Some scenes are original, like the nails that come across the floor. This nail trap picks up these bad guys. The rest of the movie degrades as you go. I can not believe this movie is not even in the 100 lowest films of all time. I also can not believe there are sequences! The next piece of crap I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Could the R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than that? <br /> <br />
