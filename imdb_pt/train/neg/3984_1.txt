I saw this movie a few years ago on the BBC I sat through it. As? I do not know, it's up there in the "so bad that good maps" Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman should shiver when they see him now. I think Woody Allen would have done wonders with the weird plot, and part Baldwin could have been played with gusto by Leslie Nelson.it was back tonight I tried to watch again, but life is too short. the few minutes I saw were for the lovely Nicole, she was so hot in 93, did Baldwin ever make a good movie? Pullman threw his stock in the "nice but dim" trade the F-word character coming out of his mouth when the "frasier" lady miscastado as a detective accuses him of murder sounds so wrong. stay very far
