I joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a movie. I was not even drawn for a second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They played every topic they could think of hoping something would stay. I would bet (and hopefully) that all involved in Teachers look back with shame. There are some great actors here, but you would never know that. Thank God it did not destroy the careers of Morgan Freeman, Judd Hirsh, Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. There was no vision, no labor of love here, just a horrible effort that went awry. BTW I do not think the writer ever set foot in a real school.
