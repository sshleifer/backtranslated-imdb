I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this one. <br /> <br /> The story is very boring, and has little to do with the original Timecop. A lot of Timecop stuff was discarded, and they put new stupid things in it instead. This story is occurring in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason the timeline is now more dangerous: confusing: <br /> <br /> And the action scenes are nothing to be happy with, most of them are not ... only the first one is great ... and there are not many action scenes, and they are all very short <br /> <br /> At one point in the story, the main character travels in time about 5 times in a few minutes ... no, wait, do it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: Do not waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
