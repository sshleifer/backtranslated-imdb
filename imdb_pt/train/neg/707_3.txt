"Feast of All Saints?" At where...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Has the story and theme of the Feast of All Saints been edited? <br /> <br /> What a waste of a wonderful title! There is never anything in history that has the most remote connection to the "Feast of All Saints". There is also nothing in the story about "All Souls Day," which the term is referring to. Why bother to use this title if you never intend to include any kind of plot or theme on "All Souls Day" or "All Saints' Day"? <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad script and amateur writing <br /> <br /> How did they attract such a talent to this clunker? The writing is so amateur - characters who have known each other throughout life make long speeches about their life history to the public. In no way do people talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the director thinking? <br /> <br /> The direction is equally bad! Forced and overly deliberate style seems amateurish. In one scene, a character is shouting "Get your hands off of me" and no one is touching him! The most misdirected scene, however, is the incredibly exaggerated battle scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Excessive gore in a very fake and silly battle scenario <br /> <br /> There are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene. It looks like a Saturday Night Live !! You can see extras waiting for your clues to cross the camera. Everyone plays their death scene as 4th grade boys - exaggerating every sigh and contraction. The blood in the battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied that it looks like someone has used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight red lines on their clothes. <br /> <br /> This whole battle scene is a cheese war parody movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride a horse and deliver the joke. <br /> <br /> Who in real life would behave this way? The most ridiculous of writing, directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl is standing under the corpse of her hanged father - who is terribly maimed and literally dripping blood from their open wounds. Even a total idiot would know he's dead! However, she is - very monotonously - repeatedly saying "Daddy, Dad ..." while looking at someone off screen. She delivered with as much credibility and passion as you would expect from a non-actor kid who was repeating the queue for the cameras all day. <br /> <br /> Even if the poor kid had acting skills, the scene is completely unbelievable. The little girl would not even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage - surrounded by hundreds of corpses, while she quietly stays there !! Natural instincts made the boy scream and terrorize him, fleeing the bloody carnage! <br /> <br /> Let's suppose we're Horrified or Laughing ...?! <br /> <br /> A particularly pathetic detail, which gives the scene an SNL satire tone, is the hanged parent, with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish on a hook! Unintentionally funny details make the whole scene look fake and silly. <br /> <br /> In Fantasy La-La-Land, Moms and Daughters are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another funny detail is that you see a central character - the girl's mother - at the end of the scene and the next scene, which occurs more than 20 years later, it looks exactly the same! She is still young and beautiful, and now the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost turned off the movie because the direction and writing were obviously horrible - but I tried to keep it because I wanted to see the Louisiana settings and I like all the actors. I do not know what those great actors were thinking when they accepted those roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the target audience? <br /> <br /> The excessive amount of blood and violence misrepresented in the opening scene is strangely out of place with the narrative tone of the novel that follows. It's also a weird way to start a movie that, for the rest of the time, seems aimed at reading novels. Strange inconstancy in the tone!
