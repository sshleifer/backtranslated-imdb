This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had difficult times to watch it to the end. I had seen this guy from Rodney in Natural Born Killers and I thought he was funny as hell at it, but this movie was crap. The "jokes" were not funny, the actors were not funny, anything about it was not even remotely funny. Do not waste time on this! Only positive things about it were the beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon that I'm sure tried her best, but the script was horrible too. That's why I rated "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
