What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very intriguing screenplay? Were there any pieces left on purpose? What about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this confusing story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candice Bergen, who made a horrible performance, take such an ungrateful part? <br /> <br /> The Domino Principle wants to be on an equal footing with The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin. A big misfire by Stanley Kramer.
