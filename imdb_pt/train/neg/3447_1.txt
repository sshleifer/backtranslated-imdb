This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline. This movie is agonizingly slow and I was bored for almost all 98 minutes. While acting is mediocre at best, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and slow, with no real direction. Occasionally, a strange climate is defined only to be broken by some useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and vomiting between shots, they did after all have to try to digest a terrible script. As a big fan of good horror films, I'm always annoyed that something so bad is going to happen. Save yourself 98 minutes you will never go back.
