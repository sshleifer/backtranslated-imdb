There are many highly talented filmmakers / actors in Germany right now. None of them is associated with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Why do producers really invest money in something like that? You could have made 10 good movies with that trash budget! It's no fun to have seven grown men running around like dwarfs pretending to be funny. The funny thing is that the producer of the movie (who happens to be the oldest guy in the group) is playing the NEWEST Dwarf. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments that scream for captions saying "You're supposed to laugh now!" It's hard to believe this crap is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Many people actually got up and left the cinema 30 minutes after the movie. I should have done the same instead of wasting my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
