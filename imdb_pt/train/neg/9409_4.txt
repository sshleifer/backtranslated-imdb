I liked this show! I think it was nothing wrong with that! Only Spider does not punch anyone, but just for that the show does not suck! Some people just think this show is bad because of it. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Bad Sandman never shows up, but I like it! Best Spidey show ever !! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda But there have been a few episodes that was really very bad like: Rocket Racer and The Spot which was embarrassing to watch. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. Morbius's first suck plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And that annoys me that he was almost the main villain of season two. Of course I have to mention Hydro Man! It was terrible! I'd rather see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidey as Spider-Man! <br /> <br /> But I think all that was bad!
