This movie is being shown repeatedly on the cable lately, so ... <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these two attractive women to fight with both Luke Wilson and the equally vile 'villain' in this movie. The female actresses are very cute and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it's 'funny' that Luke's friend is even uglier / idiot / idiot out there, but well, that's what we have. <br /> <br /> None of the female leaders ever will ever speak to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we have are crying, crying and fighting, and so on, more than two guys who were best described on Friday the 13th.
