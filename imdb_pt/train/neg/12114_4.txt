Strange people living in a city live their lives. There is the licker guy who licks it all, a junk diver who finds a body he takes home to live with, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to wipe the girls from their evil ways .. .com eccentric in the extreme, this black and white film is better without the color. The monochrome takes advantage of the two steps of the home movie sensation. Like a Troma movie, this movie is fun in strides and gusts, but mostly it's weird because of strangers and soon it becomes a hole since you see the set ups you can guess where it's going most of the time - not always - but enough not to be fun (although I did not see the cleaning coming). Worth a shot if you have nothing else to watch and you're expecting the next set of Golden Girls to come from Netflix.
