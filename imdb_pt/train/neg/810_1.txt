If you are one of the people who meets "According to Jim" great television comedy, this will shake your world. And I must add, praise for proving that good talents, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC who prefers to overdo it like Jim Belushi's show year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a large brown, steamy, brown "thank-you", the size of a shepherd, for all the geniuses who loved the first film. That's exactly what the fans of this movie and the smaller Belushi deserve. The comic chops and Jim's choice in projects are never far behind his ability to catch a blues pattern. Look for him to try to show off all his various talent shortages on every project he throws to the public as a coarse zoo chimp. <br /> <br /> If you like Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
