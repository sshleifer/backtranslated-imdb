Prom Night 2 is an OK horror movie, but prom night is much better and this movie about how the Queen Mary Lou dance in 1957 is killed by her boyfriend and returns 30 years later to revenge. The best actor in this film is Micheal Ironside and the film starring other actors and actresses like Justin Louis (me), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (me). And there are some good scenes like when Mary Lou kills the girl who is trying to hide in her closet smashing the closets together and how one of the students is at the computer and Mary Lou electrocutes him to death. All in all this is a good / OK horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
