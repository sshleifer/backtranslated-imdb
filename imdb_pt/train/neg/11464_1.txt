Although I do not claim to be some kind of marine life expert, I must say that anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not accept this notion of a whale (and not even the mother!) Having a clue about revenge because he witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans! I mean, really! That's basically the whole plot. Richard Harris must have been extremely difficult for papers to have accepted this garbage. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it, you'd feel like you're demanding your money back.
