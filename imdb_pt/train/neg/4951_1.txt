I commented on it when it first debuted and did a "thumbs down" analysis, commenting that I would give the benefit of the doubt beyond the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes now until this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show sucks. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong with that. All. Going by just the bad animation and design, the stories are ridiculously complicated and with no development of character or apparent interest by the writers of this story to substantiate any stories. <br /> <br /> And for the love of God. Is it just me, or is it the Joker in ALL EPISODES? Is Gotham a revolving door justice system? Or, again, it is just a complete lack of interest from writers to put any effort into other villains (see "without character development" above). <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, every Joker tale is the same 3 part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker gasses people. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker proposes to supply the whole city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was an episode that I saw that was not a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster ... the episode "Think Thunk" on the quiz show. This was the worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I have Batman in my basement". <br /> <br /> I can not really say what I feel like this show is because it's probably against the ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastardization". Thank God for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. It was Bat-Entertainment, Fox's Back and Kids WB days. Things so good, and I should have known this, just could not have lasted forever, unfortunately.
