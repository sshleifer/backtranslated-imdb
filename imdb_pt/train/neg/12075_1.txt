This Hamlet made one of the most annoying episodes of the MST3000 of all time. I am not a fan of Shakespeare, but I do not believe he intended his works to be so slow and bland. It is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many Hamlets listed. Like I said, this one is pretty boring. It's in black and white, the pace is slow and the scenery is minimal. The actors are all dubbed too, so that does not help. This is the only MST 3000 that I can not watch at once because the guy who is playing Hamlet says that his lines can make someone sleep.
