Here we are: two travelers from a distant futuristic world come to Earth ... one is on a desperate mission to preserve one life, another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the savior of an entire race. So, What could we call a killing machine? It's almost like he's some kind of destroyer, or eradicator ... sort of like an exterminator or something. What is the word I'm looking for ... something that ends things? Hmmmm .... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the protector (who quickly removes the white tunic he stole from Luke Skywalker in favor of local clothing) meets the young woman first and impregnates her with a future-born hero . to be. The damn uhhhh ... "exterminator" kills some hicks and steals his guns and clothes, then tries to locate the woman visiting his place of work and asking around, looking menacingly in the eyes of the people and repeating her name menacingly. <br /> <br /> Then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly immortal and unstoppable "exterminator" pursues the couple across the field. At some point he can get boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, in an exciting ending, he will try to crush them under the wheels of a huge full tank truck. acid. Then the truck will fall. They will be saved ... but no! He will then rise again, as strong as ever. He will kill the protector and chase after the girl in a meat packaging plant, where in a terrifying finish, he is pushed into a large piece of industrial cutting machinery, and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe I'm extrapolating too much ... after all, I stopped watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically impregnates Sean Young by kissing her in a bar, then tells her that the child will be born in 3 days. <br /> <br /> The costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I loved them the first time I saw them in Star Trek: Next Generation too! Sean Young makes another big upset as an unemployed Replicant, and Stephen Baldwin, who works in the sweat category, is also on board as Young's Fat Boyfriend. Not sure where it fits into the plot though ... maybe it's an import from a different James Cameron movie?
