In 1993, "visitors" was a huge success in France. So the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence is among the worst ever made. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not keep its promises. In fact, you're supposed to tell a single story. Jean Reno should go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back to the Middle Ages so that time can normally take its course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and so making it back to the Middle Ages is quite difficult ... Instead, the film goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot. As a consequence, the film sometimes becomes confusing, sometimes a bit confusing. <br /> <br /> But the film also suffers from the performance of almost all the actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that, however, they could avoid in the first film: they're going over and they become annoying. So why did Jean-Marie Poire, the filmmaker, involve Muriel Robin in the lead female role? He made a mistake because she seems unconfortable and is absolutely unfortunate. The other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel is non-existent and Christian Bujeau is unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course the film contains some good moments with efficient gags, but often falls into vulgarity and ease. Certain sequences and dialogues are affected. It also seems hollow because Poir√© picks up elements that guaranteed the success of the first film. Thus, a young woman takes Reno to a close relative of her family and asks him to participate in their marriage. <br /> <br /> A difficult and disappointing job. Anyway, what is the interest of this otherwise commercial movie? <br /> <br />
