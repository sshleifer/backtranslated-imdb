Vovochka is his daily movie against the hooligan. Vovochka, the main character, is marked as a bad influence on the children of the neighborhood. With the wisdom words of an adult couple he encounters along the way, he finds that changing his malicious ways is difficult but worthy of being done. Personally, I encountered actor who played Vovochka very annoying to sympathize with, however, the change of tone of the film would allow him to feel more emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good, but bad things still happen. This fight makes the movie a bit different from other movies of the same genre, that's the flavor I wanted to say. After all, I did not really care about this movie, although it was more likely to target a younger audience.
