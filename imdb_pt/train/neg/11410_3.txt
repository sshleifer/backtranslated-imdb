Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his interpretation as GIDEON. This movie could have been a classic if Lambert performed as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. <br /> <br /> Sorry because the story is meaningful to us in life, the supporting performances of Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excellent. 3 out of 10.
