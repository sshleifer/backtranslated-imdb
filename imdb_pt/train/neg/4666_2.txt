This movie is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on the skin. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely bizarre. I do not see any "sensual" or "erotic" tone. The plot turns an old art form into fetish porn. In addition, the scenes that are shot in Hong Kong certainly portray bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, bad living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I keep thinking that "The Pillow Book" is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. <br /> <br /> "The Pillow Book" is a perverted but boring film. Seriously stay away from it.
