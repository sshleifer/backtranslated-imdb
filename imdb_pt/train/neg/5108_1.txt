I can not help but laugh at the people who praise this show as comforting and shocking. On the one hand, it is totally unreal that these people have a perfect life after their new homes. <br /> <br /> How can these families afford to keep these new mega-houses? And your poor neighbors? Property tax should certainly increase once this happens. Besides, the noise would bother me. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how excessive can a reality show be on television? It's pretty much the same garbage repetitive week after week. We are introduced to a family in distress, they reform the house, then surprise the family and everyone breaks the boxes of tissues. <br /> <br /> Not to mention just how boring the part of retirement is. The only interesting part of the program is to see what the house is like, but even this segment is destroyed by confused and false hiccups. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show that pretends to be sincere but falls flat. Skip this one. If you like reality shows, "Survivor" is far superior and moving.
