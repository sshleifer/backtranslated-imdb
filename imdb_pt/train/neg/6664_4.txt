What begins as a gentle country, harmless and mildly pleasant romantic novel changes pace as Harlan's initially charming Edward Norton gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the ominous as the film gradually changes from a novel of the South to a modern wild western. <br /> <br /> A lovely farmer (Norton) wanders into the city and delights a young woman (Evan Rachel Wood), seemingly rescuing her from a dead-end existence with her moody father with a dizzying romance, but gradually Apparently there is more to this cowboy than you see. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? a real chameleon actor (with the change of facial hair to match) playing a country hick, a slightly suspicious accent, but maybe because he's just trying to play the part without worrying about the accent. It certainly makes it look easy to make all the little nuances adjust while we learn more about Harlan. However, with many small changes, it means that we are never sure where exactly Harlan is coming from, and what seemed like a good Norton performance gradually becomes confusing. Evan Rachel Wood is friendly without ever having much to do besides painting the eyelids in Norton. <br /> <br /> The fall in the Valley seems a slightly erratic tale due to the change of pace and never really making the protagonist's motives clean the audience's sympathy for the characters remain uncertain. Should we like this wanderer or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events, it is still unclear. This ambiguity is to the detriment of the film, as if the writer could not decide what kind of story they wanted to tell and settle for a little marijuana. If the film had stayed one or the other, it might have been a solid movie, but what we have left is a mess. Fans of the old-fashioned romance will appreciate a part of the movie, but they will be baffled by the somber tone. Fans Norton Completers aside (or fans of the lush backdrop of the San Fernando Valley), give this a miss.
