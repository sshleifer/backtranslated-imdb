Director F. W. Murnau wisely took the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of the Island's native life in the Southern Seas. The documentary style works great in the first half of the movie. The landscapes are beautiful and the activities of the everyday life of the islanders are interesting to watch. The film loses strength, however, as it begins to focus more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The plot never gets so interesting, despite being treated well by Murnau. It won an Oscar for best cinematography, although the award probably should have been for the best scenario. You can not really credit the DP for being able to shoot in such a beautiful location.
