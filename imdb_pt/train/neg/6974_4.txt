Blue ape is actually mentioned in the movie, but not in any way that makes any sense possible. At one point, some children are wandering through the deeper levels, exploring. <br /> <br /> They begin to discuss what they will find down there and one of them (a girl) says she thinks they will find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. Totally inconsequential to the story, the only sad connection to the title, and no idea why she'd think she'd find a blue monkey in the basement of a hospital. <br /> I'm ashamed to have remembered him, but someone had to remember, I suppose!
