Interesting idea and plot that did not work well. <br /> <br /> When you see the movie, you may feel as dissatisfied with the ending as I do. I really did not know who to cheer for the movie, Taye Diggs looked bored as the detective, the rest of the characters look so unidimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If victim Alicia (Mia Kirschner) had been more of a cool girl, we could have really enjoyed watching the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice. The problem was that she was as malicious as the other girls, going from a sweet girl to conniving cokehead opportunist. I can not understand the moral message of this movie, and as a detective and thriller story, it does not work.
