I read the book a few times and this movie does not follow exactly as it should. I could leave this slide, after all it's a movie. However, I have serious issues with setting the movie. No one seemed to mention that this film and the book on which it is based are based on actual events that occurred in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city that this movie should be based on. First of all, the "small" town that is spoken as scenery is the third largest city in the state. With a population of about 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second, the scenario for the movie is wrong. Grand Island is in the Platte River Valley. That is very flat with few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but I was angry to see my hometown being treated so badly. This was a real event. Great parts of the city were wiped out. In the book, they talk about riding a bike from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I think you could if you do not mind a 15 mile ride each way.
