This movie has no plot or focus. Yes, it's supposed to be a stupid, silly comedy, but the writers have no idea what the movie was. Even the title does not accompany the film. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something. The characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them! The roommate's character (from That's 70's Show) was the only person who deserved to be watched. She was hilarious and stole all the scenes she was in. Others need to make sure that their college degrees are in progress, as they will need a different career path.
