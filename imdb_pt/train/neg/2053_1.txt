Why do they insist on making re-making of great movies like "High Noon" "From Here to Eternity" and this one? <br /> <br /> Why do they think the color is more captivating to the viewer than the black and white? <br /> <br /> Why did Robert insist on wearing that doped and wide-tipped baseball cap? ... that made him look like Jim Varney. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone spend? four hours suffering from it? <br /> <br /> Watch the original. So you will not have to wonder why.
