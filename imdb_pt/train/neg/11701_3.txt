Just one more example of why Stepehn King's books should not be turned into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined in her adaptation of the book to the screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat, always on-the-diet lawyer who "accidentally" kills an old gypsy. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he leaves, although the accident was some kind of guilt, since he was not paying attention while driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman puts a curse on the three of us, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and leaner each day. Although the film continued with the book, most of the time, and had its typical King ending, the performance was forced and it seemed forced. We went from one scene to another without much in the middle, as a sort of act of reading in a play. King himself made a special guest appearance on the film (as Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that the authors should look exactly like this: authors. Leave acting to the actors. Not that anyone in this movie was that good. I saw the main characters in the movies where they were much better.
