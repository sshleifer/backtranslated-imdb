When will the injury stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas song. They continue to make movies with the same story, falling on each other in an attempt to make the movie better than the rest, but unfortunately they do not, since this is not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy thinking. As if people learned. The numerous different versions of this movie prove it does not.
