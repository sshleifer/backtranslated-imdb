I just watched. A couple of laughs, but nothing to write. Jason Lee seemed to be enjoying himself. The (long) DVD gag reel consists almost exclusively of him having attacks of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to be hitting a clock, but again, her character should be a stick in the mud, so "well done," I guess? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles' father (hilarious), in 10 things I hate about you is funny here as well. He's great, but the best aspect of this movie was the cast of Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours watching her fold her clothes, and I feel like I just did.
