Goremeister fans Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they are getting this movie to their usual buckets of blood being poured as there is precious little bloodletting in this film. Instead, Lewis decides to try to tell the bizarre story, relying on special bargaining effects on a budget that probably could have been doubled if the cast had lost its pockets for a day. Strangely, though cheap and very poorly represented (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), the total extravaganza of the plot holds the attention throughout. Imagine what this movie could have been on a decent budget! Overall, this makes the likes of champagne have a beer budget.
