I should love this movie. the acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the film always seemed very banal. the film makes working-class people look low and cheap. The fact that the daughter was ashamed of her mother and her daughter not being above her always made me a bit uncomfortable. Barbara Stanwyck as the mother adores her daughter, but the daughter forgoes a love of mothers to find happiness with her well to make the family of the parents. I wonder how many others who saw this movie feel that way. Again, the acting was very good and worth seeing. I really do not like the story line. just a personal preference. thank you
