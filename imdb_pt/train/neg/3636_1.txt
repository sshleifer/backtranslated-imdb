I am very open to foreign films and I like to think that I understand what they are trying to accomplish, although some things are lost in the translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film were boring. I always thought of how interesting it would be to make a movie that would only show a typical day or time period that really did not make sense. Now that I've seen a movie like that, I will not think about those lines anymore. There are shades about society, racism and some desire ... but South Park has it. And when I watch South Park it really moves me to feel an emotion. The closest thing I felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn I felt after the first five minutes. I rate the typical movie seven or above, because I love most every movie. I gave this movie one.
