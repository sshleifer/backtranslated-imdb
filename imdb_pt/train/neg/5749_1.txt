This is certainly one of the worst movies ever made. Each scene is painful. You will moan with the fragile attempts of humor, the odd camera work, sexism and racism, the ridiculous plot, the acting of wood. Poor Joan Bennett; she is the only one in the movie that is not an embarrassment. In everything, terrible.
