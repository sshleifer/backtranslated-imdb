My first clue as to how bad that would be when the video case said it was from the people who brought us the Blair Witch Project, which was a masterpiece compared to this piece of crap. The performance was in the caliber of an Oklahoma production in 6th grade and the plot, as it was, is predictable, boring and futile. 85% of the script is four words and countless variations on them. Mother F seems to be the favorite of "writers" because it is used constantly. It must have taken all 10 minutes to write this script in some dive on the last call. Thank God, I rented it and was able to get through most of it in rapid advance. Do not waste your time or money on this.
