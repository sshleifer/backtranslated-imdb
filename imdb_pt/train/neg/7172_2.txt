A good cast and they do their best with what they get, but the story does not make sense, the characters' actions are inexplicable, and there are many moments of unintentional humor, such as when a man is killed being punched with pieces of a phonograph record or when they pick up the drunken witch and hit her on the head with a bottle and she takes her hostage and leaves. The scene in which the two witches and their victim (played by the same actress) are in the house together sets up a routine of 3 Stooges, and the plot raises the question: if the witch wants to own the soul of that other woman, why not? does she just do that instead of leading these people in this elaborate pursuit? Not to be missed is Christopher Walkin's glasses and his automotive explanation of life after death (paraphrased): "The ancient Egyptians - they materialized materialists. They expected the body to last forever, like a used car you've filled. the Druids, They knew you could not drive in the afterlife. You had to go out and walk. " There is? The end is absolutely indecipherable. Looks like they just got out of the movie.
