It's very unfortunate when such a movie is made. A lot of work and money has been put into a movie that is amateur at best. <br /> <br /> The issue drags on, there are obvious mistakes that could have been easily fixed in a second take, and the soundtrack is unimaginative. Much more could have been done with this movie on video. I think they ran out of time, or video tape. <br /> <br /> Hand shots have a distinct amateur feel to them.
