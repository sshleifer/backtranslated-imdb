SMALL SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I just sat up late and watched this movie, mostly because I liked it and rated some of Singleton's earlier work as "Boyz n the hood." However, I have to say that this was a big disappointment and is all I hate about coined, clich√©d, so-called "message" movies. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly poor, (pop stars and models DO NOT necessarily make good actors ... take note), the difficult situations to swallow, (rape victim becomes lesbian at night? .. Please!), but worst of all, it reinforces every stereotype you can imagine. In the second half of the movie, it has become a cartoon in its characterization, causing you to lose any empathy you may have for your one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> Not once is a valid point about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it ends up only sensationalising the results of these problems. His message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion. As for the conclusion of the films, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and slightly offensive. For a movie called "Higher Learning," I have to say that all I've learned is to avoid seeing it again. <br /> <br /> If you want a true comment on some of the themes that this movie completely fails to elaborate on then go sign up for "American History X" ... unless you're just watching for Tyra Banks, then go hire a life.
