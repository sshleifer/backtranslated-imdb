Does this movie suck !! Horrible acting, horrible plot, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible !! Nothing rescuing here, even for the most stubborn horror fans! A mad killer chases students into a college. People are dead in the hallways, but still, is the class still going on? After the 4th body, I would think they could allow the students a few days apart! I LAUGHED A LOT. This is as bad as it gets people. This film should be shown as a means of torture for criminals. You've been warned!
