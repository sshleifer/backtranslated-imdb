WHITE WHITES Hold on, why could not they have dressed like Black Girls, oh yes, they would not look different at all. Can someone give me a Wayans movie where they did not dress like women? Do not Be A Menace does not count, Jack White and Michael Costanza wrote that (the other members of Norton Trio acted as directors). <br /> <br /> In White Chicks, there are never any jokes. It's just the Wayans acting like girls for 2 hours. There are no settings, no punchlines and no laughter. There's a lot of "I think I'm going to play some Time Crisis 3." At least for me there was (5 times to be exact). <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talented), Kim, Rakeesha, George W. and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies. It's just hurting the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * of ****
