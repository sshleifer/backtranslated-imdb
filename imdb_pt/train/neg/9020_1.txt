I mistakenly kept myself up late last night watching this thing. About the only thing I could say well about this horrible movie is that it could be used by movie schools to show how not to make a movie. No proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure if they were characters. The set-ups were fake and futile, and the overuse of split screens was wasted, since sometimes they could not synchronize with alternate shots. If I could give a zero or negative score I would. Unfortunately, neither is it worth the time for some laughs. <br /> <br /> It's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I waste my time thinking about it.
