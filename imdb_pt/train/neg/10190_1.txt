After watching this in the episode of MST3K, I have to imagine how many movies this movie borrows. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point I was really hoping that Cris Makepease would call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any clue about how many holes there are in the plot. such as the fact that although gas is not available, there is a lot at abandoned gas stations, and the stations are located close enough to maintain an F1 racing car traveling all over the country.
