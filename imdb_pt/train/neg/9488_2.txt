I've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time, and while that's not the worst of the group, it's certainly in the bottom half. The script starts at OK. A young doctor goes to a hospital as a trainee, hoping that he will go to a better job for him and his future wife. Cute, huh? The movie goes straight to the bathroom when you realize something is killing patients. It turns out that there is a demon in the basement who is harvesting people's souls. It's the job of 1 doctor, 1 nurse and 1 security guard across the hospital staff to drag that mental patient down, do a ritual that involves just cutting off the tongue and then allowing the haunted house of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of special effects of cheese. At this point the movie looks so ridiculously stupid, I was begging for it to end. There was still an hour to go. It looked like a half-hour "Tales From the Crypt" episode that somehow stretched into an hour and a half crap-fest. From Tiny Lister making his best portrayal of John Coffey (The Green Mile) to Tracy Scoggins playing the stereotypical and fragile Nurse Ratchet, this film fails at every possible level. I gave this 2 stars for only two reasons. 1) Your fianc√© is very hot, she relieved the pain a bit at the end and 2) The movie really does look OK, much better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal-mart quality home cameras. <br /> <br /> In the end, avoid this bullshit even if you have the Blockbuster movie (which I do, and I still felt cheated). As a boozy bonus, you and your friends take a dose every time Matt Stasi shakes his head as he talks. You'll be drunk 15 minutes in the movie.
