I was very excited when the series premiered in 2005. The premise was very simple and appealing: each episode would be a one-hour mini-movie directed by a famous and noted horror director. So when I finally saw them, it was a little disappointing. Some good episodes arose from that first season, but after all, it was a mixed bag. Assign him to the learning curve, and realized that second season would be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was in a shock. At least the first season had some good stories here and there. The second season (with the exception of "The Black Cat" starring the excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a complete and total loss for me. The episode "Sounds Like" may well be the worst thing I've watched on TV in the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes are not much better. I really hope Season 3 turns this on next year, but I'm not holding my breath.
