The film opens on Julian Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten drooling blood in his mouth waiting for where he holds her, about two feet above him. That was so provocative, and I thought, "Here we go! A good vampire movie!" <br /> <br /> And then he died. This was literally the only scene that captured any part of the imagination. It was slow, bluntly drivel afterwards. I was very disappointed, because my previous experience with the performance of Sands was quite pleasant. However, this attempt was obviously misdirected and the script left much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Even the questionable performance of Julian Sands could not begin to save this already submerged barge from a movie. <br /> <br /> The rate is 1.1 / 10 of ... <br /> The Devil :.
