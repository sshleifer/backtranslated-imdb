First of all I really liked Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2. This movie was total rubbish. I could not bear to watch. The plot was a joke, the acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombie 3 has nothing to do with Zombie 2 is even more a joke. <br /> <br /> We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE AGRICULTURAL AGENT PLAYING People BACK TO LIFE. Anyway, this movie is not worth the $ 1.00 value to rent it. I really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this was awful. If Zombie 3 is an indicator of how zombies 4 and 5 are going to be, I think I'll skip them. <br /> <br /> Zombie 2 is an amazing trick.
