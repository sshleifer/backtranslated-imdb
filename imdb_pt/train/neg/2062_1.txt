I read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic junk and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that someone did not think this terribly unfunny set up was not the heyday of humor in the 70's or even in any other era! If this is not the least funny set of comedy I've ever seen, it's going to happen until that happens. Half the skits had already been made (and infinitely better) by bands like Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I said that a good piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this movie, still not get close to summarize just how stupid and sloppy this 75-minute waste is. Seminal comedy? Only in the world where seminal really means semen. Eschatological humor? Only in a world where the scat is really feces. Precursor jokes? Only if by that we mean that this is a manual how not to do comedy. Breasts and vagabonds and the strange beaver. Well ... if you're a pubic boy with at least one free hand and you have not found out that Playboy exists. Give it a go because it was in the early 70's? No way. There was a sketch comedy coming back at least ten years earlier. The only way I could even forgive this movie even if it is done is if it were under the scope of a gun. Retro? Difficultly. Sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be groundbreaking in some circles (and actually may have been funny), but this is actually very sad. What kept me going for the entire 75 minutes? Pure belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny sketch for the end. I gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to patients with insomnia or coma ... or maybe people suffering from locking ... their jaws finally open in disbelief.
