Of course, "Flatley" is no longer exactly the ideal name for a dancer, but I think Michael is really pushing the ironic envelope with this new title: "Feet of Flames" <br /> <br /> One really can not resist recommending Desenex Foot Spray for the flatley to retire (and clearly, sick). <br /> <br /> I must add that, much like twisted London cheer (by review below), I'm also excited about this being his last live performance. <br /> <br /> "Indicating that it may be his last live performance, Flatley is applauded by an enthusiastic London crowd." ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide
