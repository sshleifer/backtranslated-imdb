Hooper is not funny, not paced fast, not romantic and not informative. There is no real drama. You'd think a movie about the world's biggest stunt would have some drama, there was a try, but it did not seem real. Without character study, with no lessons learned, it did not even seem like the actors were actually having fun, they were just trying to act like they were having fun. There's no reason to watch it unless you enjoy looking at Burt and want to get a casual glimpse of Sally. Prancer, the horse, was beautiful and did what he should do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this film. Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and a waste of time
