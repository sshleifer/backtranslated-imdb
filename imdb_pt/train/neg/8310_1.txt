Another vast conspiracy film that tries to blame the US government and the Armed Forces (especially the Army) for all disasters since the Great Flood. Anyone who has already served time in the US military can see how this movie is fake. Uniforms, equipment, sets and mannerisms are wrong. (And, of course, all top officials are corrupt criminals or total idiots). Sassy propaganda, with no attempt at objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been refuted in recent years. Uses all the clich√©s, rumors and urban legends of the Gulf - all are presented as gospel. (The truth is that no one knows for sure why some GW veterans are sick and others are healthy like horses.) PS This is nothing new. The war is not fun and I know World War II, Korean and Vietnam veterans with some very serious diseases as well. (And the government has a responsibility to take care of them all.) Sensational films like this will not solve the problem!
