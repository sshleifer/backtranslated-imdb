This absolute rubbish is based so closely on Friday the 13th grade that it's practically a carbon copy, accepted as an Australian movie with people who can not act. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time a boy was accidentally burned during the filming of a music video on Lake Eildon. Now, a few years later, the boy grew up and took revenge on those who come to the lake to film a video clip. It's clich√© and a waste of time and money, watch it just out of curiosity, or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn how NOT (not being able to act). The lead role Alan Dale used to star in the television soap opera Neighbors, but ended up in The X Files - how did this happen?
