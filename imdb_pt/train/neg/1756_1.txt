In the background, for years (as it was reported), this televised meeting of two of the most beloved characters in the sitcom story began badly - and went down straight from there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper), meet in New York after a long distancing and refresh each other's lives. What a new concept! But sad to relate, nothing worth talking about (let alone making a movie about) happened to any of them in the years to follow. So instead the script is content to throw off an old plot device after another (most having to do with older women in the workplace), completely missing out on the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show be a winner. The support cast is instantly forgettable, the mood is nonexistent, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper had together disappeared. Moore supposedly stopped this project for years, waiting for "just the right script" before committing himself. If this was what she considered "right," what the hell were they she refused? It is not the age of the characters who do this (for time inevitably advances), but the almost complete lack of imagination associated with blatant disrespect for the elements that made the series work. At one point this was planned as a pilot, but obviously did not generate any interest among potential sponsors. Or for that matter, among potential audiences. Quickly and mercifully forgotten, the film is a farce and an insult to a classic.
