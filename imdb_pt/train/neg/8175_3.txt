The mood of this movie is very good and captures the feel of the 80's as well with some good performances. <br /> <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The script runs from the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird, where I hoped it was intended to be nervous. The characters are totally dramatized and unbelievable and full of right-wing clich√©s that the writer probably watched a panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie has no real story. It fills in all the right "artistic" boxes, but nothing happens and in the end you wonder what the point was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
