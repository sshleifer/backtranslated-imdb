I grew up in the theatrical version of 'Superman II' ('S2T') and as a kid, I loved it more than Part I, since it not only contained more Superman and three Superman type villains, how did it start with a bang? ? the best transformations from Clark Kent to Superman and rescue scenes. The children no longer had to wait impatiently for Superman to appear on the screen, as in part I. Now, as an adult, I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T (See: my review). I've always heard of the back end. story about how they prematurely and unjustifiably dismissed the original's director, Richard Donner of Part II. (It must have been a rarity at the time to shoot two separate films simultaneously, now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 and 3, for example). Unfortunately, after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut (or, "S2RD") I still can not fully recommend it. Gone, it was the great scene of change of the Superman, all the rescue of Paris, as was the wonderful recapitulation of part I in the opening of S2T. In fact, they all wrote the words: "Formerly in Superman ??" in S2RD. The special effects were not great either in Part I or S2T, but in S2RD, they were almost totally laughable ?? like Lois falling from the window of the Daily Planet. I'll admit, some new scenes ran and some that took off were welcome exits, like any scene in the "honeymoon suite". Overall, if you grew up in S2T like I did, and loved it as a kid? As I do not do as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD as it is almost a new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: it was also the strange amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with the same ending as 'me'. This is not just a lazy and not original copout, it does not make sense because Clark would return to that restaurant if those events had never happened. And will he continue to "go back in time" for each confrontation?
