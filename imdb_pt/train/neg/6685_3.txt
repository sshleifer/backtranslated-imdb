Although the film takes place at an "Ivy League" college, it was actually filmed entirely in northern Arizona, mostly at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was involved in the theater department and most of the extras in the film are then members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely ridiculous scene in this movie (if you know your geography of Arizona) that shows several cast members riding a college bike to a creek. We NAU'ers know that the campus and said creek (actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles away, and while the trip there is all downhill, it would be literally impossible to ride a bike back up that same road!
