The name Nick Stahl, the young cast and the attractive VHS cover made me buy and watch this movie, hoping to see a good teen movie. More sucks! Is the script full of clich√©s, the dialogues and the performances are terrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, horrible ?? in short, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, dark humor, just an absolutely boring story with shameful plots. The film begins with six characters, actually three couples, together as a group of friends, but in fact very nasty people who seem to be enemies, playing a ridiculous nonsense game called "Taboo", and with each of them writing yes or not for certain taboo problems. That's it: no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationship. Then there is an ellipse for a year later, and the same group is gathered at a New Year's party, insulting each other in a very sordid way. But the plot and twists are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre, and unbelievable that they do not deserve any additional lines in my review. One advice only: do not waste your time or money on this rubbish, you will surely regret it. My vote is a (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo Playing With The Murderer" ("Tabu Playing With The Murderer")
