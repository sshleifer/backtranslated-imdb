At least it is not full of violence or nonsense. Nor is it too full of thought or a soft plot. This story had some potential but the director seems to have lost the green spot. The story is disjointed and goes off in strange, unfinished directions. I also do not believe the principal has spent much time in a golf club. Some of the representations are absurd. It's not very engaging.
