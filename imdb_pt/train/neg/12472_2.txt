Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon. Add some cute animals, some terrible puns and a pair of skates, and you'll come across an almost exact replica of that movie. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this when I was younger; I made my mother rent it in the video store about 5 times. The story itself is not so bad, is that any Marxist who attended would certainly have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> If you do not like America, you will not like this movie.
