Why else would he do this to me? <br /> <br /> Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies. Or even decent movies. I've seen Lois and Clark, I'm aware of how ... "good" Dean Cain is. <br /> <br /> Obviously this is going to be a cheese movie, and every movie has its special way of making you scratch your head. I'm not going to call these spoilers, since you can not really screw this movie up any more than it already is. <br /> <br /> To begin with ... why is this a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> How come a scientist is from Chicago and that other scientist is from LA and none of them could be more European from the east if he tried? How difficult would it have been to get an American actor, or just change the state sheet that the movie gives us to say that these people are not American? <br /> <br /> Why are there two occasions when the movie gives us a slug line? We stayed at the heliport and then in the cafeteria the next day. And so this is it, who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cared about that even when they mentioned it, but I guess that's beside the point. <br /> <br /> Does a movie really look better if you can see it through multiple split screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> That dragon can certainly walk down the aisle ... over ... and more ... and more ... and more ... <br /> <br /> Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history? It was straight from scooby doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... say, do you want to have dinner? Of course, but not some Chinese place .... with the dragon in the name !! AH HA HA HA !! HAHA HA !! HAHA HA! I used to be Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> Fade to black <br /> <br /> Oh my God, it made me shudder, it was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But never be afraid .. even though the whole building exploded ... and no one was alive ... For some reason, there is a second unmanned, unmanned lab that survived very well, so they can make a sequence. Live for all of us. <br /> <br />
