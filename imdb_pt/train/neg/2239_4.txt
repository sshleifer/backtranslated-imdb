The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest and most beautiful examples of "posh totty" committed to celluloid. From his era and laia, only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close. What happened to actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure and none of this is left to the imagination here. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the film is very poor and being of its time, very cheaply done. The song that covers the opening credits seems to last forever and is terrifying.
