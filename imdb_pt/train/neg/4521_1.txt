The entire Biker Movie genre has to be made from the worst movies ever made. This offers a lot of fighting, generous amounts of blood, bikers fighting against Indians and a favela that explodes and knocks down one shack at a time. The acting is beyond the terrible. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point he was in some great studio productions, and then he just disappeared. This movie really blows, but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it's good to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a little pointless for watching!
