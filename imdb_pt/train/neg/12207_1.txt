I remember that I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, had a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo in it. I was really happy when I bought this very cheap film. I put it on my VCR and I started: Dude, this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words throughout the film (except for the terrible sentimental speech at the end), and has the same expression on his face all the way. And this stupid love thing in between, it's so incredibly predictable. I just went through the whole thing quickly and changed the movie for something else.
