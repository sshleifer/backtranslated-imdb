With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie, you think this is not going to go wrong. But what can I say? This was a terrible fault. The film is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young man, not to mention the cute hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is incredibly disconnected and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this movie does not prove that. <br /> <br /> That song about "Arabella Cinderella" is pretty cool, but that's it. I only recommend this movie to people who like to watch a movie of extreme novelty, this is almost the definition of one. I think this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of its definitive experimentalism and all the unconventionality, the problem is that the quality is completely shot and the writing, not to mention the direction, is so over there. Peter Sellers in particular is very cheeky, he goes from Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career, to stupid movies like this and Magic Christian, which was very similar to this one in context and style, but this movie had some funny moments. This is nonsense, and I'm saddened by someone as fantastic as Peter Sellers have been in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.
