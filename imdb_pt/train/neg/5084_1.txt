I've seen this movie twice. I can not believe that Pintilie made a fantasy film. I'm also a film / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. This is no longer Romania, but I see that the events are happening in the same period with the incident of September 11. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing profound, nothing hidden. Only empty images. <br /> <br /> What most Romanians do not know, this movie is for French viewers, not for us. They really believe that this is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I really do not know if we can call this movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we have this image in Europe. That was a reality, but it is not anymore. A good friend of mine from the British embassy said, "You have no idea of ​​the way the Romanians have traveled since Ceausescu."
