First some background; I am English and have lived in London all my life. I've been to many games at 'The Den' and most other clubs in London. I am familiar with the type of person who goes into vandalism and I know exactly how they act and how they talk. I have to say that this is a bad and bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I've ever seen. I spent most of the film shrinking with shame. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out some things. <br /> <br /> (a) People just do not talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took all the slang too far and made it look stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see on Green Street are parody-like. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded like 'English' or 'cockney' like Osama Bin Laden. He's from the north of Newcastle and I'm impressed that any of the other actors could keep a straight face next to him - as we're going to take him seriously. Why they did not pick up just someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done a 'bang job' myself, hehe. c) Mr. Frodo. I mean, how can I take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the butt of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans? He would be dead. That simple. Honestly (as a Brit), it was hard to watch this movie. I'm sure this movie is going to rock here in the UK. It can do a little better in the states because Americans just will not know (or care) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this absurd. Yes, these firms exist, but it's all extremely underground and quiet, and on a much smaller scale. The film only gets a 2 of me because they actually filmed some of that in London. Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and hope everyone does not notice.
