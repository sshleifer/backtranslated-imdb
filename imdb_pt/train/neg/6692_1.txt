During a sleepless night, I was going through the canals and found this embarrassment of a movie. What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> If this is life after "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, it's no wonder she has not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take it? Function? It's pathetic! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I called the movie near the end so I did not get much of the plot. But this must have been the best part. This college nerd boy brings home this domineering girl ... this scene is straight from comic books - or cheap porn movies. She calls her mother an anal retentive and kisses her father. "Oh, I did not expect a tongue!" Great lines! <br /> <br /> After that, I had to see how it ended. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, this hell bitch has a hell of a past, so the SWAT team is walking around. top. And yes ... they surround you! And yes yes! The boy blows her brain !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is a must-see TV. <br /> <br />
