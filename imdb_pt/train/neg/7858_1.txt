I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for such "horror" movies, but they should at least hire some appropriate actors. The sergeant is especially guilty of using his monotonous bulldozer on every line he has. But let's face it, the lines are not really important. There is not really a recognizable plot, so most of the writing involves the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other bad language in place of the appropriate dialogue. The 'story' as it is, is composed mostly of seemingly random blood and death, with a couple of 'surprises' that happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what will happen. to happen. Not only that, but there are several screaming plot holes and continuity errors (why are they going there? He did not have a gun? He was not dead?), So make the whole movie look like it had been made. reduced by the several hours that would be needed to repair them. <br /> <br /> Another film that simply depends on blood and blood rather than any real cinematic experience.
