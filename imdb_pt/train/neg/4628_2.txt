Misty Ayers had a steaming body, and that's all about this movie. Pure exploration film. I started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times they did the orchestral music loop. And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. Case in point: casually walking in a room and saying "Hello" was marked with the chase music of a Roman epic. I wonder why this movie stayed on the shelf for 11 years before it was released. What I learned from this movie: Women's low-rise panties existed in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is of Misty taking off and wearing her clothes (except bra and panties, unfortunately). Also includes horrendous dubbing, leading to a "Look Out! Godzirra!" It is made.
