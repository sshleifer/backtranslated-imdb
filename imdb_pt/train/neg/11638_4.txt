Blood of the Damned Blood of the Damned is the third installment of Gabriel Knight's games, a series of adventure games about scriptwriter / paranormal detective Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his companion, Grace, were asked by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks of the so-called "nocturnal visitors." When Prince James's son is kidnapped, Gabriel pursues the night visitors of Rennes le Ch창teau, where he begins to gather a mystery related to the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite marketing, this game is not about vampires. . Vampires have a symbolic appearance in the game, but they never command the center of the stage, as do the hounfor voodoo in "Sins of the Fathers" or the werewolves in "The Beast Within." Gabriel and Grace do not try to discover the true nature of vampires, nor do they search for vampires. Although vampires kill three people during the game, their victims are chosen randomly and have nothing to do with the main plot. <br /> <br /> Much of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight. plots was in the relations that Gabriel formed with the villains. Through these relationships, the player could not help sympathizing with the villain and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster. However, in "Blood of the Sacred," Gabriel's only interaction with the villain is through a single interview, which does nothing to please the villain to the player. <br /> <br /> The roles that Gabriel and Grace play in this mystery are quite futile. Gabriel spends time snooping on the identities of members of a group of tourists staying at his hotel, but what he discovers is only a red herring. Grace spends her time researching the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau, but all her research becomes superfluous by the presence of a disconcerting ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> The actions of this bewildering ally and his polar opposite - the vampire leader - are unbearable. The ally leaves clues about the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau in broad daylight and hopes that Grace (and not the other treasure hunters of the tourist group) will find them. However, he could have revealed the mystery to Grace in its entirety on day 1 instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for another 48 hours. And in the end, he simply tells Grace the mystery in its entirety anyway. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the vampire leader fails to reach the goals of centuries of intriguing because he decides to abstain from action for two days after kidnapping the child. The only reason given for his decision to postpone the action is that he wants to savor his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the Holy Grail. The kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted, replaced by a race against the Vatican to unravel the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau. Since Gabriel is depicted more than once as reluctantly Catholic, this conflict would have many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> In short, the game was a disappointing installment of the series, despite an improved interface and return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight.
