Rex Reed once said about a movie ("Julia and Julia" to be specific) that seemed to have been made through pomegranate juice. I remembered this as I snorted through the Purple Butterfly. This one seemed to be shot through gauze. <br /> <br /> The story was boring and it was not helped that, for large portions of scenes, the faces of the actors were literally out of focus or only in focus after long periods of exposure. Time. <br /> <br /> In addition, everyone looked the same, so it was difficult to distinguish between the characters. I call it the "Dead Poets Society" syndrome. <br /> <br /> There was no one to worry about, no one to be interested in dramatically, and the film did not bring any historical light on a very interesting period of time and a set of circumstances. <br /> <br /> A total disappointment.
