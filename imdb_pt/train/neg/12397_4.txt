I read somewhere where this movie was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir, "Criss Cross." I found the latter to be disappointing, but it was still better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a "neo-noir" since it is modern and in color, two things the purists would have it disqualified for the noir movie status. <br /> <br /> The biggest negative for this, however, was not cinematography (which was fine), but the messy plot. Hey, some of the Dashiell Hammett stories of the 1940s were similar, but I did not care about any of them either. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by putting flashbacks in the story that looked like every three minutes. No wonder it was that story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that, with the 45-minute mark, there is so much confusion that no one else cares. I know I did not.
