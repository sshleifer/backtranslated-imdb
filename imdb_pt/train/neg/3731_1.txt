I was raised in a "very Christian" home from birth. I was saved before seeing this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a group of young people in my church. This movie was very disturbing. I saw it when I was 12 and literally had nightmares about it for years. I used to stay up in bed and hear the sounds of my mother's steps upstairs. If I did not hear his footsteps, I would sneak up to make sure she had not been snatched away. I used to pray every night for salvation because I was afraid Jesus would forget me. This is definitely not something I will show my children until they are much older if they are. It took me years to get rid of the fear this movie gave me.
