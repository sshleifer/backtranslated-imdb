This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was watching this movie with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there was not a single nice character. I could get more entertainment by watching the static. I gave this movie 1 just because the scale did not go into negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
