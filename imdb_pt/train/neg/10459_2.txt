Incoherent, unclear script, bad script, bad photography and direction ... all obviously was an ill-designed first effort to produce commercial films by the good people of TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has had great success in the past, helping to bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But "The Omega Code" is an unfortunate mistake. As a Christian who supports TBN and much of its programming and who loved "China Cry", I still find it impossible to recommend this movie to anyone. They do very well with your ministry, but this is not an example of this. Do not waste your money ... go rent "China Cry" instead.
