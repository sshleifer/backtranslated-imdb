Belmondo is a tough cop. He goes after a big drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, usually a big villain - see "Sharky's Machine" but here he is clearly dubbed, and because of that he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the most flashy places in Paris and Marseille, asks for some names, knocks on some people, picks up the names, goes to the strangest places, asks for more names, beats more people, etc. The whole movie is punched after punch. after the punch. It seems that the people who did it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry." Belmondo, who was 50 here, does some good acrobatics in the beginning; In addition to these, "Le Marginal" is a violent, episodic, banal, superficial and forgettable police film. (* 1/2)
