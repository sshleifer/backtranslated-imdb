There is no decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can get anywhere. The guy playing Sebastian sucks too. He does not even look like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are terrible too. <br /> <br /> So the dialogue sucks too. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (about to have a trio): If you can not beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who said you can not beat them? <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> The ending contradicts the whole plot of the original. In the first film, it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian have never had sex. One reason why Sebastian wanted both Kathryn and the fact that she was played by Sarah Michelle Gellar was that she was "the only girl he could not have and that killed him." She was a tease who liked to play with him. The fact that she had never given him increased her desire. So in this P.O., implies that he can have it along with a girl next door. What? And we do not even see sex either. It is implicit, making it not only stupid, meaningless and contradictory, but also useless. <br /> <br /> And at first, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser. Even if he won the bet, it collapsed his chances. Then, in this excrement, he loses and falls in love. So it does not spoil "losers", just complete losers? Another thing: it is stated that Sebastian has never fallen in love, so how do you call the thing with Virgin Girl? <br /> <br /> So, in the end, the virgin girl is suddenly revealed as Kathryn's lesbian lover. (dun dun dun) and, as I said, they enter a trio off the screen. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other contradictions in the plot. Did the writer ever see the first film? A 5 year old can point his things out. After the trio, Sebastian has sex with the virgin blonde, corrupting his innocent mind in the back of a limo, while Kathryn and Virgin Girl transformed the Evil Lesbian into Lame. Shadow Plot Twist sit in the front, listen and grin wickedly at the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> Watching Sebastian become the hole he was at first could have made an interesting movie. I think all that was needed to make little Sebastian was a trio with two hot girls. Interesting.
