To be as honest as possible, The Devil's Toy (or Blood Vest or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters or ????) is a complete hassle. Does the film have a good premise behind it? the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the help and assistance of a group of women dressed in black ?? but the execution is horrible. There are great moments of screen time when literally nothing happens. Characters just hang around with nothing to do. There is no mystery, no suspense, no plot points to worry about. The acting is simply abysmal. Most of the acting involves a group of women who seem below average dancing nude while looking at the camera. They do it over and over again. And the little plot that exists seems to have been planned for more naked women to show themselves naked so they can participate in the dance. While it is not as bad or useless as the dance or plot in something like Orgy of the Dead, it comes close.
