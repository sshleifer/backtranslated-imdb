"I just saw this movie last night and I do not think I'll ever think the same about any of the actors involved, because that movie is going to be in the back of my mind." <br /> <br /> The statement can be considered a good thing or a bad thing. I mean, every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of "A Few Good Men," which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I'll think of "Tinseltown," which is a very bad thing. <br /> <br /> I caught it thinking that it might be something smart or at least make me laughing and with Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought at least it would not be bad. You could say the movie was made with a budget the size of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly.), But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. WRONG. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT funny or fun in any sense of the two words. It is there and lasts 84 minutes slow. <br /> <br /> The characters are paper thin. You almost do not care about NONE of the characters, and since leaders are two Hollywood writers struggling with a dream that is all two writers struggling with a dream they wrote this needs to let you know about them. Okay, the two REAL writers know all about their own versions on screen, so they imagine the same happens to the public. They do not even think about character development except by trying to tie the story back to "Gilligan's Island." <br /> <br /> The plot is not original. Two guys live in a storage center, where one of them stores a bed, and there are twenty other people living there as well. The rest of the story is invented and stupid. Have you seen "Favorite Lampoon National Mortal Sins"? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a television writer who can not find a good story to make a TV movie, so he creates one. Now replace the television screenwriter with a screenwriter, turn Mantegna into annoying actors half his age, and take the comedy out and you'll have that movie. <br /> <br /> The actors try. Kristy Swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie. It's still hot, but it would help if she really starred in a movie instead of constantly doing CAMEOS. As for everyone else, I do not think it was the actors' fault because they have BAD material. <br /> <br /> Go watch the National Lampoon movie, but stay away from that movie.
