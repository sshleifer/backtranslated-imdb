First of all, this is a low budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low. I suppose most people who look at the information for this movie just wanted a bloodfest, and essentially that's all it is. <br /> <br /> Plot? There really is none. It's basically Saw, but in China and much worse. Fused? There is none, period. Special effects? Absolutely horrible in my opinion ... There were cuts and the blood was often unbelievable because of quantities, splashes, colors, textures, etc. <br /> <br /> I believe the purpose of this film should be brutal shock film. Now he had great potential on a larger budget, but bad scripts, bad dialogues, horrible acting, what looked like video footage from camcorders, and simply "raw blood," made this movie really horrible. <br /> <br /> Are movies worth having a chance against some comments, even "b-rate" movies deserve some opportunities (blood trails, for example, was the most recent I saw against comments that paid off ), but that was just awful. I hope people who are considering this movie read my review and decide against it. <br /> <br /> I am all for brutality and shock, but overall unrealism and truly horrible acting create a terrible experience. Save your time / money and risk something else, you will not be disappointed.
