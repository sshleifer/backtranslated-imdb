This movie is a waste of time and money. For the whole hour and a half, I kept hoping it would get better and never do it again. It was slow, the plot jumped, it was not scary or interesting, and really never was anything. The credits during the introduction were long and drawn out, basically like the rest of the film (long and drawn out). Numerous parts of the plot made no sense. Several times during the movie I had thought that maybe I had "zoned" because of the incongruity of the plot, however, my companion had the same problem and assured me that I did not "zone out" of boredom, but it was in fact the movie. I've actually never posted on a movie before and have been actively looking for movies on IMDb for many years. So the fact that I'm really taking the time to write something should talk a lot about how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it.
