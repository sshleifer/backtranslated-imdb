The funniest scene in this movie is probably when our rescuers receive their medals and plaques and other ornaments. So the basic idea is that the police outnumber these gangsters by a million to one, but they are powerless because the villains' guns are a little bigger. I think the police ammunition was just rejected. They decided to film this documentary-style movie with fake interviews and everything and seriously, what's wrong with these guys? They're talking like they're armed with rolled-up newspapers. Okay, I'll admit, it's probably still dangerous to be in the fire line, even when the situation is too much to your advantage, but do not go crazy. And why did it take 44 minutes to sort things out anyway? I'd say it's a long time when you've surrounded them and you're allowed to shoot. They are like ten feet away, they have achieved absolutely nothing. So they buy bigger weapons to increase their heroism. And then yes, there it is, one of the cops really hits someone. Bullet was probably diverted by a light pole or something. I laughed, I think.
