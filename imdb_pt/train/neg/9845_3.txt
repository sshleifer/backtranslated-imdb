! POSSIBLE LOVER SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> As I watched the first half of GUILTY AS SIN I could not believe it was made in 1993 because he played like a clone JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas from the mid 80's. It starts with a murder and is left to the public to meditate "Is he guilty or innocent and goes to bed with his lawyer?", But in the middle of the film shows his credentials in the early 1990s turning into a " pursued by his client "-type film that ends in a ridiculous manner, and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous end in this regard. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by Sidney Lumet the same man who brought us the all-time classic court drama ANGRY MEN 12
