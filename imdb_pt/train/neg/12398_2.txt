Look, it's the third one, so you already know it's bad. And "Maniac Cop" was not good enough to secure the second installment, so you know it's even worse. But how much worse? Terrible, approaching horrible God. When Maniac Cop goes on a kill, a reporter exclaims, "What happened here can only be described as a black rainbow of death." <br /> <br /> 1.- Rainbows are not black and can never be. 2 - Rainbows are harmless and can never inflict pain or death. 3- A news reporter, a valuable one for your agency, may find another way to describe the consequences of a killing. "A black rainbow of death" is not the ONLY way to describe the given situation. <br /> <br /> That's what you are for.
