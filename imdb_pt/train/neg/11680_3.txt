This movie had a lot of potential - a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget. I'm not sure where everything went wrong, but each of those elements was wasted. The story hit nothing, the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a waste of very boring, meaningless film. I hated it. Judging by the other votes, I am in the minority here and it must be some kind of aberration. However, I thought this movie was terrible. I had high hopes, but I was very disappointed. One particular disappointment was the character of Jody Foster. A very arrogant "fixer" of the type makes a good idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and got nothing. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - fun, but nothing new.
