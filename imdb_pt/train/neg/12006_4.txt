Okay, the director remakes LOVE REALLY Director Nikhil Advani after debuting with KHNH makes his second half and waits <br /> <br /> He makes a 3:30 hour + movie that loses with patience, tempo.etc The viewer seems to be a 3 hour sleep watching this movie <br /> <br /> OK, they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Anil-Juhi compelling, but boring, the TV sitcoms do not show these stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Govinda-Shannon, which is funny and works well. <br /> <br /> We have the story of Akshaye-Ayesha again believable, but it gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and in this boring comedy too. <br /> <br /> We have the story of Salman-Priyanka, which is the worst, not just terms of acting, does not make any sense <br /> <br /> We have the story of Sohail-Isha to make you laugh and the trick works sometimes thanks to the boredom set by most other stories <br /> The story of John-Vidya is a good story in every respect <br /> <br /> But when all the stories The film's climax in Salman-Priyanka's story Nikhil Advani's behavior is good in places, some stories are well-treated but weak in places Music (SEL) is good, but a lot of songs Cinematography is cool, whole story is given a different look, texture and works <br /> <br /> Actors Govinda rocks, after a comeback from resignation with BB he really makes you laugh and love him In this film, despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor acts well, although he seems and out of shape and tired John stands out on his part, Akshaye Khanna struggles to change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is very exaggerated and Isha has no business Anjana Suknani is dismissed <br /> < > Priyanka and Salman deserve a prize for this movie that you're shocked? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not just act, he just talks like he's sleeping and that false accent, oh Priyanka god, such pattern you feel like throwing something at her, she gets better at the end Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is fine Shannon is fine
