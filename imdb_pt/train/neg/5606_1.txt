I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. I think he protests too much. The whole thing sounded as if the author was trying to convince himself! He publishes profane literature (written from the same time period, but not connected to the Bible) several times, but I can think of at least three references from the top of my head that give historical accuracy to the events contained in the Bible. Anyone can twist the dice and prove what they want, but that's not true. Customs change, definitions of words change over time (look at English and German, where it is obviously an ordinary root), nothing remains the same, it is always growing and changing. The Bible has many different translations, but the King James version is the one I found to be the best when it comes to any type of research. In the King James Version, you will notice certain words written in italics. These words were added by the translators and can be discarded and the average of the entire verse changes. Writings of the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without numerical verses. These writings look like a long word and the translators added all of the above. For example, how would you read this: God, do you read how God is nowhere or do you read how God is here now? Same sequence of letters two completely different meanings. That is why many Bible researchers use a 'Lexicon' to assist them in translation, as it provides a translation of the word into the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew word, depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. It is also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic, you can prove that God exists, but you can not prove that He does not exist! In the end, I love hearing people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the Almighty. Talk about the ego! Putting the podium away, God bless Maegi
