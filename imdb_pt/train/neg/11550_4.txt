I knew I was going to see a low-budget movie, but I expected a lot more from a Alex Cox movie. The acting of the two main men was terrible, especially the white guy. The girl should have won an Oscar in comparison to those two. This movie was filled with what I think would be internal jokes for people in the film industry and some other jokes that I really understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without those moments of laughter, I would have given this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox, who did all the 1980s classics? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were some questions I had after the movie was over. Why did the Mexican go to the other guy's house in the beginning? What did your daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job? Why was she breaking her own things when she was mad at him? I think I should have gone to Q & A after the movie, but I did not want to wake up at 10 in the morning.
