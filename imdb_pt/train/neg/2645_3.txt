The final pairing of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete failure. The script is weak and poorly presented. The movie simply has no life in it. Eddy and MacDonald would have been better just doing a filmed concert for their finale. There is nothing wrong with your singing, it is all the more in this turkey that is overcooked.
