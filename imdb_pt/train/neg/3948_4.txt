This is not the nastie video, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in Britain. It's 75% a replay of The Boogeyman, and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever that was. <br /> <br /> I was initially confused because I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) might have been different. Lacey, but she was someone troublesome by psychic visions of a bogeyman resembling that of the first film. The fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. After seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address, Annie, her psychiatrist and a parapsychology student who looks a lot like the guy. in the cheap and commercial novels of butter, go to the house and, sure enough, it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later, a murder happens exactly as she described it. Of course, we have no idea who this boocutrix woman is or why she was murdered. <br /> <br /> Then the film changes to a reprise of the bogeyman story with some extra scenes that we did not see in the original. Remarkably, the bogeyman is shown unlike the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes have been cut, but 90% are there. Why repeat this movie? They found the footage in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know, and although the psychologist tells Annie that she is cured, we all know that the bogeyman will never die.
