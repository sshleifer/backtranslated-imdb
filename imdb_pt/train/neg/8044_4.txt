Well, I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I pulled it off the dusty shelf to watch it again and I must say, I really think this movie is good. This movie caught the attention as the bootleg I know what you did last summer 3, much like Final Stab was to scream 4, and well this movie is not so bad. I mean it had flaws and of course it would be ridiculous to release it in theaters, but still for a midnight popcorn movie, this movie is not at all bad. There are some scares and some very hot women I could add. In addition, it shows the new muscular look of Joey Lawrence, although obviously even if he has not won any major role of Hollywood ... I feel bad for the man, he had a career in the early 1990's and with flower , some Disney movies and the everlasting Lawrence brothers show ... Joey Lawrence was a little active on the scene scene, but as in a 360 degree turnaround, his career went south just making low budget movies like This one. <br /> <br /> The movie also puts you off guard, makes you think among the team, there really is a secret that someone knows, only to be disappointed at the end to discover the secret. He also plays out who the killer is, I had an idea, but I still do not think the killer was who he was, but his motives combined with the secret was a big disappointment. Now, was there a secret that was released? This movie could have been one of the best movies. But I'm also a sucker for college subjects and also in college went to spring break in a mansion-sized beach house similar to the one there, so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie. <br /> <br /> so slasher flick. Good for a midnight movie.
