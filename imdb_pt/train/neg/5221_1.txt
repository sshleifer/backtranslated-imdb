Hello I'm from Denmark, and one day I was having a movie night with my friends. One brought this film with him "Russian terminator" and it was extremely awful. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to move quickly just by stopping at some laughable "highlights" or I must say "lowlights" in the film. I was really surprised to discover that this film was produced here in my homeland, Denmark ... which must have been the biggest mistake this country has ever made.
