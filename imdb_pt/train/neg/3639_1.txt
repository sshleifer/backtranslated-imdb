This movie is a drug from the beginning until (especially) the end. You probably do not get worse, acting, plot, photography, camera work, etc. everything is bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But that's what makes him a 'great' watch, it will give you more than good laughs. The worse, the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what so many people were thinking about doing this movie. A serious Viking movie? The story is ridiculous, more like a comedy in disguise, kind of like the Mafia, also meaningless, but very funny. <br /> <br /> And look at the end of the movie ... um.
