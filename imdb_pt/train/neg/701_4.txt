During the Christmas holidays, a group of college friends lags behind to help prepare the dorms to be demolished and replaced with apartment buildings. To make work a little harder, a murderous psychopath is using the dorm halls, attacking the group in various violent ways. Registered as one of the 74 'listed by the UK in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation built before the first screening. The term 'nasty video' recalls some images of some great explicit violence, violence, sex, etc.: All the things a horror fan dreams of. So, after hearing all this information, I looked at Pranks (alt. Title) expecting a sleazy slasher experience. . . and it was what it tried to be, but it failed completely. Visually, the movie is not great. Cinematography, gore (except for some scenes) and general direction fail. It just is not pleasant to watch. The non-original script is missing and often plays random things for no real reason (such as opening kill). There are some cool death scenes, including a beautiful face (which can be seen on the poster), but that's a good thing. The acting is really bad, the story seems unimportant, the killer is not cool or scary, and suffers the biggest mistake any horror movie should ever avoid: it's a bit annoying. Overall, for a movie made by some UCLA film students for $ 90,000 (which would be more than double that today), the dormitory that dripped blood is not a total mess. It has some good things and is quite watchable. . . But as a film slasher looking to be at the level of movies like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . simply can not compare. Do not expect too much, and you can at least have fun. I hate to say that, but this is one of the few movies I've seen that would be better with a remake. . . and yet they go after great works like Black Christmas. Oh well. . Gore: There are some brutally legal killings, and the blood is fine for you. <br /> <br /> most of it. . . but nothing special. In addition, they exhibited some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> Sex / nudity: There is a nasty nudity (for me), but not much. <br /> - Legal Assassin (s): Nah. The killer's final monolog (s) made him / her not very cool. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: A scare or two, but nothing very effective. <br /> <br /> Mystery: I suppose, yes, but I just do not care enough, and it's as obvious as the nose on the killer's face. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Farce <br /> <br /> -AP3-
