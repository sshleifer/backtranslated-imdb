The original book of this was created in the 1950s, but this will not suit the TV series because most people watch the 1930s style. Ironically, the tube train near the end was a 1950's painted train to look like a 1930s train, so Underground can also play in that game. Hanging the plot in a plot on the March Jarrow was weak, but the 1950s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them, so I suppose that making them think about the poverty of the demonstrators is the same thing . All the material about Japp having to serve for himself was weak too, but they had to put something to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and make it a better and longer show. It is obvious that this episode is a victim of style over content.
