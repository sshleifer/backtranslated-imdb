WOW! I did not know anyone would do this movie! it's horrible! I wrote 5 things that can tell you why you do not want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Number 1: "It's the biggest rave ever," where's the rave? I could only see some people dancing around ... <br /> <br /> 2. When they're on the rave, they can only see blood everywhere, with no people, two ruined tents and a stage ... And what do they do? they drink! <br /> <br /> 3. the worst actors I've ever seen! the captain and his crew .. awful! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the people is firing an ordinary gun, it fires almost 30 times without reloading! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that all the people in the world could fight like pros! must be a new thing .. <br /> <br /> I wonder what the producer was thinking! "this is going to be a great success, it's going to be a classic" ... of course you do not see this movie, it's a matter of time. My eyes are still bleeding!
