This movie has some of the most incredible cars I've ever seen in a movie, and definitely the hottest women, but I have to say it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot, and if you read it with a bit of inflection, you have the acting too. <br /> <br /> Beginning, bringing characters, hot woman singing (obvious lip sync). Music agent or producer enters, thinks she's amazing asks her to run. She turns around, lots of bad memories. Flash for war hero, back from the war, has several fights and becomes film hero with the attitude that he is better than all. Get off in fast exotic car. The brother runs and then dies. Hero to avenge death, cut off obtaining weapons from friend. (You've never seen this friend before or since, but you seem to really care about him.) Are you sure you want to do this? Yes; I mean, are you sure? Yes, give me arms; Are you really right? Yes; OK, I guess I can not talk about you, be careful, man, I love you. <br /> <br /> Now he's going to blow up his uncles home who owned his brother's car. He finds a woman, decides to rescue her, she leaves, and he does not finish killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Oh yeah, we need to play one more scene with bad people coming in to hit people who do not really care, but maybe that adds a little plot. The race is not so exciting, of course it ends with two cars racing, and one that should win generates an amazing end. <br /> <br /> OK, I just saved you $ 7.00. You can send all your money to me because I should have given you the same amount of pleasure that this movie does. Do not get me wrong, the cars are amazing, and Nadija is beautiful, but it's really a horrible movie.
