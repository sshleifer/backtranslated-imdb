Forgive me for stating the obvious, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course, there are extremes within these two broad categories. Movies like The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars fit snugly into the good category. At the other end of the spectrum, there are those movies that simply do not deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally, however, someone produces a truly pitiful film. A movie that should be touted as a demonstration of how horrible a movie can be. A movie that is more than bad. One such movie is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> Briefly, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally malign shipowner. Of course, there is an American hero on board, complete with the chiseled jaw and the sculpted chest, which saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that deepens new depths. Everything is bad. The acting, the direction and the so-called plot are breathtaking. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unhappy viewer. Even an American spectator would be annoyed by his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that annoyed me about this movie. . However, its stupider conclusion than dumb should serve as an appropriate example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and are in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. . You're in the company of the hero holding a bomb. Said hero launches the bomb for you and dives to the sea. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would throw the bomb as much as I could at sea. Not this guy. He watches while our hero swims and then tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate results (for him). Enough said. Such a death would merit a mention on the Darwin Awards website and could also be an appropriate conclusion to the life of the production team.
