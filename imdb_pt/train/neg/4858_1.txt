Why in the world would someone make this garbage film? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were stupid enough, but that takes the cake to the worst of the trilogy (maybe all time). Todd Sheets is still the director, but he is no longer the screenwriter, which is neither negative nor positive, considering that he is as untalented as the guy who wrote this. Writing is very dependent on the f-word, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times in nausea. The acting is on par with the last two Bloodbath films, so of course it's one of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last two, but still look wonderful. The plot became very complicated for its own sake, and it was about a government experience that went awry and zombies being produced. Also featured is the mutant cryogenically frozen zombie and the school kids who know how to travel back in time, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the movie goes outtakes, which is strange, because this whole movie is an outtake. Just watch this to make fun of it, because if you get into it with a serious mind, you can kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 min.
