This is possibly one of the worst giant killing animal movies I've ever seen. It follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment that went awry and a giant crocodile with a rapidly growing chemical escapes.

Everything about this movie is unoriginal and constantly exudes "clich√©" minute after minute. Why are there always two drunken hunters after nightfall who separate? In addition, there is always a guy and a girl who share an obvious love interest while in life-threatening situations.
