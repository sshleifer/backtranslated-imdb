Just good old fool. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not stupid good like Killer Tomatoes, or Ed Wood movies, this is probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen. Giving this movie a golden turkey is an insult to turkeys. Calling this donkey movie is offensive even to dumb people. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and art, we'd better start World War 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show afterwards. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult for my only braincell off .... <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie if you are suicidal.
