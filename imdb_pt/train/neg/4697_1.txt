Okay, I saw the preview of this stupid movie. First off the film is so posed and not real, they are all acting. They can not sing. They are very full of themselves. It's awful. Yes kids like 8 to 10 can enjoy it but it is really stupid. I mean, they say their manager is a kid. And there the record label is fake. It's stupid. I do not see that. <br /> <br /> As for the setting and direction, it's not too bad. It's a cute documentary, but it documents a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> Just watch this if you do not like very good music. Besides, it's very tacky. It's not even good taste. I hate being so mean ... but that's really a piece of crap.
