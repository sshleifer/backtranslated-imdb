First, let me say that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; That's why I was curious to check it out, its debut role. No argument that his talent is apparent and his performance excellent. I think I can also see how professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that's where this movie fails. <br /> <br /> Halfway down, I found myself thinking, "How much longer do we have to watch a bored movie?" girl from the market, stop around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise? It seemed to last forever! <br /> <br /> So, I thought, maybe this is one of those films where the director tries to rock the public in a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event. No such luck. The film continues the story bland, boring and monotonous to the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this because I'm an addict in action. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I expect to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies. Depressing! <br /> <br /> I do not understand how anyone could like this movie. Zero entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
