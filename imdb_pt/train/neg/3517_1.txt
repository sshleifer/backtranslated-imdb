I do not know who wrote the screenplay for this movie, but from the first moment I got angry. Of all the possible decisions they could make in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do criminals act stupidly, even though they managed to get a huge sum of money from a bank and get away with it? Why does not the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot Stallone, get the money and run off with the girl as a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I would give this movie 5 points per nice action and great landscape scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I can only give this film 1 point ...
