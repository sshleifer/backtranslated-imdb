I can not help but recognize the filmmaking skills above Haneke's average. For example, I appreciate your persistence in settings not worthy of natural light as a powerful way of forcing a strong sense of realism. However, in relation to the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still a need to pathologize relationships or feelings of domination-submission (and / or BDSM practices). The main character's problem with his mother is incredibly current, as is the alienation and incomprehension felt by Walter (I am not talking about the frustration of a lover who is not loved in the same way, which is understandable, I mean he looks for her as if she were crazy, or as if he were a monk, come on!). I mean D / s is not something new in the world and I think it's a little silly to treat it as if it were something "weird" or pathological; it is not. In general, the films that deal with this subject are long overdue. <br /> <br /> So for me, I feel that this film ends up being a pretty programmatic film, preoccupied with psychoanalytic theories far outdated (is not it almost embarrassing?), and this does not really relate to lives and experiences of the real life of those involved in D / s relationships (personal experience, forums, chat rooms, even recent academic studies will show this).
