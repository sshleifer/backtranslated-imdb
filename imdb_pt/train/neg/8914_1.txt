I had to stop watching this movie (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious moviegoers) twenty minutes because it was mediocre and boring enough to inspire yawning, not to mention that I was almost crying out at the $ 3.99 wasted on Blockbuster . . Joanna Pacula's acting and her terribly borrowed Slavic accent are terrible enough to make one of them clench her teeth. I knew two hours would be two hours more. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of remarkably few talents. While we are on the subject of talent, Breuer's arrogant assistant seems to have been taken from a troupe of local actors. She clearly did not learn her craft. In fact, she's really awful. All the public scenes seemed staged, with the extras moving mechanically on their best Sunday. Turning this movie off was much more satisfying than turning it on. Do not rent this terrible movie. You will regret spending your money.
