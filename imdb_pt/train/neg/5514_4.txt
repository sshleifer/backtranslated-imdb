I do not know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry's drawings is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan, Jerry leaves Tom back for an adventure in New York, and as far as I know, this definitely suffers from the lack of cats! As magical as Jerry's exploration of the Big Apple may be to the other T & J fans who commented here on IMDb, I could not wait for this self-indulgent garbage to run out, so I was able to watch the next cartoon on my DVD. In fact, the only part of the whole episode that I really liked was when Jerry almost "buys the farm," hanging precariously on the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet above a busy street .
