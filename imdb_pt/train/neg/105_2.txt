There are tons of beautiful women in this movie. But unfortunately, this movie is nude free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. A story in this movie takes place in 1971. So why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you may know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it's the most ghastly effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if someone messed up the work on this, but there was no 3D, only double vision blurs. I have not had the same problem with other company 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Of course, the 3D in these was also bad, but with them I could see a 3D effect look. <br /> <br /> And this thing is a big ball of nothing. <br /> <br /> And whoever it is? women was the one who played the daughter of the lady who eats the ears, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In the movies too. It looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
