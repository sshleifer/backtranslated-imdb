Joe Don Baker is a good actor in small roles here and there ... he was well on Goldeneye and made a good Bond villain in The Living Daylights and appeared in several other films. One thing he can not do is take a movie as the protagonist, which he is in this extremely bad revenge film that goes on in Malta. Joe Don's partner is dead, so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys make the plane land in Malta and the killer flees. The rest of the movie is watching Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don being taken into custody several times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being stopped and so on. The movie is very bad and you will not find exactly the character of Joe Don. You will be surprised how often Joe Don the hero is taken out by a punch and how incompetent he proves to be. The most important part of the film happens when Joe Don chases the killer across Malta with the killer in a priest's cloak and then they get on boats and chase them around Malta. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.
