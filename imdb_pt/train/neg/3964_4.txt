Despite all the hype about this movie, I kept an open mind about what I would eventually think. And although a bit slow at times, the first 90% of the film is very good, with more than a few frightened "old times" that make them nervous and restless. I really found cinematography excellent in many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, is at its climax. The end of the movie and the ending are what appears to be MILES APART of your body. The plot falls flat in his face with an illogical conclusion, and the answer I sought most - what REALLY happened to Emma? - has not been clarified! The logic for negative energy was ridiculous at best, and in the end I felt very much mistaken. What could have been an excellent horror movie ended up being haunted by a terrible ending.
