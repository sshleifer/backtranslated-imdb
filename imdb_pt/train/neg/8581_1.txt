This apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing! Rachel Griffiths must have needed the money. The film must have been done on a very low budget because the lighting was non-existent. I made a promise if someday I see Pete Postlesumthing or another commit suicide. I would be happy to know if there was 1) a plot or 2) a script. My biggest regret is that I wasted my time watching this crap.
