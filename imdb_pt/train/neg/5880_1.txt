The movie starts slowly when we get to the movies, we think it looked pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we were all bored and wondering what kind of movie we came to see, I do not like this movie and would not recommend to anyone, the best part of night was when the alarm and the lights came back because the project broke because we thought we could all go home. this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen that we were bored or minds and most people in the movies actually RAN out the doors in the end because it was so crap. I'm surprised no one left earlier. If you go see this, make sure something to keep you busy, even better. Do not go see him.
