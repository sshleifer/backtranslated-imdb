I've been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show. I had everything ready to record all the episodes because I thought I could actually learn some good things. I probably could if I could get through Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I'm sure a lot of this is staged to look like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewers. It does not work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called Nagging with Rachelle. <br /> <br /> As Ed is a great source of information, maybe a second show that is really serious about the environment would be a good idea. It is not necessary to do things for some of us. <br /> <br /> I do not record episodes or watch the show, but let me know if a really green show might be in progress.
