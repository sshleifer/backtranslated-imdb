Repetitive music, annoying narration, terrible cinematic effects. Half the plot seemed centered around the value of shock and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the kind of crowd that teased people to start a fight. <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes was in the movie "Deleted Scenes" section, the one in which she is in the principle office with her mother. I do not understand why they cut it. The film seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and Domino talking about the sororities would have been one of the highlights of the film. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of MTV, and completely unnecessary or useful for a movie. Accelerating the film just to go through many things and turning the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used. It's as if the directors were wanting to use all those extra scenes they did not want to throw away. <br /> <br /> Another movie with Jerry Springer? That should have told me not to watch it from the preview. <br /> <br /> A popular movie for the public "in."
