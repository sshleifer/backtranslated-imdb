The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three great movies and actually started making a name for herself. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the public liked most here. Two of these things were singing and dancing. Another was a short and interesting film that kept people's attention and took their minds off the Depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's hit movies. <br /> <br /> This movie did not get any of the above, despite the presence of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a great director on Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are many pieces of talcs here that become simply boring, and many discussions between a Lombard and Cooper sour. On top of that, you did not get the normal end of well-being, which is what the public wants. I think they learned after that movie.
