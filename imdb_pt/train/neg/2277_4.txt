'The Vampire Bat' is definitely of interest, being one of the oldest horror movies of the 1930s, but taken in isolation, everything is a bit shocking for any genuine compliment. <br /> <br /> The film is in a European village sometime in the 19th century, where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by local suspects. There is a feeling very similar to that of James Whale's Frankenstein, and this is aggravated by the introduction of Dr. Niemann's character from Lionel Atwill, complete with his misconceptions of scientific advancement. <br /> <br /> The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring for having suspected falling into a bat-dweller village simpleton Herman (Dwight Frye), thus providing the excuse for a crowd holding the torch for go on the hustle - as if they needed one. <br /> <br /> This is one of a trio of the first horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starred (also 'Doctor X' and 'The Wax Museum Mystery') and as their other collaborations, film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to traditional thriller elements. Taken in context, however, 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and derivative. <br /> <br /> All that's left is an imitation of low-grade Frankenstein, with vampire elements purely a device to fool Dracula's fans. But for the title, the film would fight to be considered a horror and it's worth noting that director Frank Strayer was making the films "Blondie" a few years later.
