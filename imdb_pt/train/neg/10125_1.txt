... that would be what you got. <br /> <br /> Words alone can not describe how bad this is. If you are having trouble sleeping, do so and I guarantee you will be out in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowery was a great actor in the 1940s - but he's calling here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery was folded out of the camera's reach because his belt was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than an imagined boy - in fact, he's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for Lowery to kick start so he can wear the cape. Driving a Batmobile It looks like it came out of the Honest Al's Used Car lot below the label price - the Dynamic Duo did not go to great lengths to hide the fact that it's Bruce Wayne's car that they are directing - in fact, is noticed by several characters the series. <br /> <br /> The acting is wooden - the sets are cheap - the dialogue is horrible and if there was even a script they were following, I'm sure he would read along the lines of "Batman Says Something here "because it certainly looks like they are making it up. Batman's utility belt is made of fine fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets - in a scene when The Batman needs a full size torch so the producers shrink once the scene starts - never to be seen again. His hood is so bad he can not even see it and his ears look more like an Easter bunny than anything that looks like a bat. <br /> <br /> In a scene (I'm not making this up.Batman replaces the counterfeited radioactive money that will explode in flames the second it is exposed to the air as a reward for some hoods.It is radioactive, Well, unfortunately villains open the package in a cardboard warehouse - we know it's a cardboard warehouse because Batman walks in and pushes those boxes that seem to weigh about six ounces in the hoods to knock them down - and soon the whole place burns to the ground.Thanks Batman! In another scene after the Batmobile is deactivated, Batman signals to a driver who is passing in the middle of nowhere and Get your car - letting the man defend himself and telling him not to worry because if Batman crushes the car, the police will surely give him another one! orte a lot for the driver who probably died of exposure trying to get back to Gotham City. <br /> <br /> There is a weary subplot with Lois Lane's clone Vicki Vale, who is convinced that Bruce Wayne is Batman. - she may have noticed the Batmobile parked outside Bruce's house - or maybe she saw Batman and Robin walking up and down in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Everything about this series is bad - and everyone but the youngest in the audience will want to make a toast on the screen. If you are looking for a bad movie, you will not be able to reach a better brand - if you want entertainment, try the Burton Batman movies, the Adam West Batman TV series or the previous Lewis Wilson Batman series.
