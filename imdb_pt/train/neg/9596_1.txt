It simply is no use trying to glorify any part of this movie. It was direct rubbish. At first you may think that you are in a visually stunning cinematic piece ... and then you are hit with a big sack of FAIL! The fight is just martial, acting is teetering on the parade, and the music is not worth describing. There is just enough history to create an excuse for this movie to have been made. The decisions the characters make and the way they deal with situations are weak, and they have done nothing but frustrate me. I think the only reason this movie came up was to act as a bit of fan service using Yumiko Shaku.
