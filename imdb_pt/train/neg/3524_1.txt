This is one of the worst cases of film criticism I have seen in a long time. It's so horrible that I do not know where to start, not even if it's worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I'm sorry for 'Sly' as he puts on a decent performance on his part. But this plot ... Oh dear, oh dear. I particularly love the path near the end as he manages to snap from the foot of a mountain to the top while the helicopter is on its way. An ascent of one or two days takes you to five minutes! I could go on: but it's not worth it. Besides the grim opening (that even five years would be able to predict the result), the rest is silly. Sorry, but this is as bad as making movies.
