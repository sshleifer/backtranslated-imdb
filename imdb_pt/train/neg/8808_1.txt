"ASTONISHING" Screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must be referring to the fact that such a disgusting crap was thrown. The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have an illness that forces them to become cannibals, and murder innocent people just to stay alive. His skin peels throughout the film, we also see severed legs, heads, etc., which are as convincing as a fuzzy Halloween felt set. There's a lot of talk about it, a bit of human cooking and a weird zombie hunter who imprisons those who suffer from the disease in his closet tied to a chair, before stabbing them on the head, cutting them into pieces ... <br /> <br /> You get the picture. Since there is no acting talent on display, and the blood is ridiculously unrealistic, what is the point of all this confusion? Again looking at the video box, the guy responsible for it is an "underground worship director". Would that be like those strange religious cults where they brainwash you to think in a way when clearly the opposite is true? Because that's the only possible reason I can imagine for anyone getting pleasure by watching this tax write-off. So in the same paragraph, it compares to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it. Now you're just being silly. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of that cult. Do they pocket their salary? Do they allow you to see other family members? Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson's movies until you think he's the best director since A. Hitchcock? Say ... that sounds like a special Panorama beer to me. And say hello to the Los Angeles Times critic when you get back to your colony, right? 0/10
