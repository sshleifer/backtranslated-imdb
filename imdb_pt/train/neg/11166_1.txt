I'm sure that deep in the recesses of Jack Blacks, the character Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious, but it is not. One might say that Jacks are having a whale once in a while playing a Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a fighter, but this movie is a total failure in almost every department. <br /> <br /> Just stayed there for most of the movie thinking "This is to be funny" and "This is the guy from Tenacious D, right?". The truth is that this movie has nothing to offer. IN ABSOLUTE! It's a lousy script with bad characters and a really naff acting and direction. You watch endless moments when you think something funny is about to happen, but it just does not happen. I was bored with 10 minutes of idiocy, but, sure enough, it would be better. This did not happened. 90 minutes later, I could barely avoid an aneurysm, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> It's like, remember years ago, when you saw something with your favorite actor, even some of your early pap from before they were famous, and you'd be really embarrassed to say that the actor was really into such plop plop. Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's previous films as Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny, but come on, man. If you do it to us again, Jack, I'll have to go over there and hammer your knees or something. At the very least, give him a serious talk for. <br /> <br /> I know it's a clich√©, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for so many reasons ....
