Okay, I got the horrible performance. I passed on the fact that Lil Kim was blowing some guns and his arms or hands were not moving, I passed the tissues, I passed the colored contacts. <br /> <br /> That's what killed it for me: In the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun get up and then Lil Kim gets up to end the hostilities, saying, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. Let's leave here for a hot second." I'm a fan of the Western movie genre, and I've never heard anyone speak of this slang in any of Clint Eastwood's movies. <br /> <br /> If anyone thinks that this movie deserves more than one note, please tell me another movie that is worse than Gang of Roses. <br /> <br /> I'm finished.
