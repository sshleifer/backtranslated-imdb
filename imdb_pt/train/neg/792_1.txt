Thanks to the BBC for this show. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated going out, talking to new people, and I had an overwhelming feeling that people hated me. However, after watching an episode of 4 Non Blondes, my luck started to change. After episode 2, I started applying for new jobs, wearing trendy clothes and felt talented. When the series was over, I ran the sales department at work, beat a lot of women, and often won the karaoke competition on the spot. If you've ever had a crisis of confidence and do not know where to go, take a trip to Poundland and get the DVD, it's only 99p.
