I expected this movie to play with great anticipation. Assuming it would be more accurately portrayed as the movie "The Christmas Box," based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent lots of emails to friends and family asking them to attend this program, hoping they would better understand a small part of my "new" life. After seeing this movie, I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only son in November 2003 and REALLY knew the pain, I hoped that this movie could enlighten parents who "think" that they understand the sadness of a father who has lost a child. This film was a very light film and the foolishness of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face of the parents who buried a child. It was very unrealistic from start to finish. I got a few calls after the movie, each calling it the same, "This was so out of the mark and made it seem like before long you're back on the road and listening to music on the radio and life is back." bullfighter! Of course the director and Keaton never lost a child because neither would have made the film so off target. I think it's Hollywood.
