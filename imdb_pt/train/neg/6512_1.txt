Not affiliated with any kind of film, and with a healthy appreciation of documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry at myself for bothering to go through the full length of the "20 dates." I will not waste your time with the plot, you can read other comments. However, I will say that Berkowitz's account of Woody Allen's style was extremely irritating. You also want him to quit coffee or take some tranquilizers. And it is potentially self-evident to Berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea as parts of it detail his attempts to finance the documentary. Forgive me for disguising insults as compliments, but I will credit Berkowitz for having the skills to persuade some idiot to fund that horrible piece of shit. I appreciate the boundaries and intentions of the film here, but even when it comes to the standards that Berkowitz sets for himself, he shoots and loses on all levels. To conclude, I am sure many of these comrades did not feel comfortable leaving with a sound shaker and therefore I question the film's sense of authenticity. Hey Myles, I loved your movie the first time I saw you ... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or was a movie directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
