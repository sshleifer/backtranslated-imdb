Totally forgettable. Especially because of poor performance. This is the first movie I saw with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he's been around since the late 90's. I thought he was a newcomer since his acting was so bland. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I have seen her do well in other films, she has given Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the type of actress who will give the character an emotional and ardent personality as Diane Keaton would be able to do, but it was very strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode. It seemed that, quite simply, there was simply not a very good chemistry between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton also felt it. She's a fantastic actress, but she seemed a bit overdone in this movie. It seemed she just wanted to start the movie as fast as possible. I would not blame her.
