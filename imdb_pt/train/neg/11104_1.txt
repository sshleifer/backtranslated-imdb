I'm not one of those people who only go online after I watch a movie and I decide to call it the worst movie ever made. If you doubt me, please look at my other comments. However, for the first time, I saw a movie so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it even ended. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and the most horrible horror movies were good. However, there is not a single good thing I can say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically non-existent. If someone who reads my review spends his money to see it, he can discern what the plot may be, but I advise you that a penny would be worth more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. <br /> <br /> The two leaders are attractive, but that's all there is. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to spoil a movie for anyone, but I invite anyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before it loses a penny in it . I'll tell you anything. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies, I love horror and I love inventive new movies. I even love porn horror stuff like Hostel (which some reviewers claimed that was like, but obviously they only thought so because Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2). But this may be the # 1 stupid, stupid, stupid movie you've ever done. <br /> <br /> And before you disregard this criticism, this is coming from someone who not only watched the ENTIRE premiere of House of the Dead. , but actually bought a copy of it.
