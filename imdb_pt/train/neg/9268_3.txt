*** SPOILERS *** As a double-play combination of Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chan's evil, we have in "Omen IV" the evil seed of the late AntiChrist Damien Thorn. Terrorizing her parents, her schoolmates, her neighbors, and finally the whole world as she was called Delia York, Asia Vieila. After being given to a "deserving" couple, the Yorks Karen & Gene, Fay Grant and Michael Woods, by the San Francisco Orphanage of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Little Delia wasted no time in making her peasants feel. scratching her mother at a party at home. Later, Delia was almost killed by a runaway truck just to save herself for this "devil's dog" named Ryder. Going to school Delia takes care of the local bully by getting the big guy to get wet in front of all his classmates. Later, when her father threatens the Yorks with a lawsuit, she has her head cut off in a self-induced traffic accident! Delia is someone you never play with if you know what's good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dalia's father, Gene, becomes a big man in town on his own, or so he thinks, when elected to congress. a champion of clean air and green trees instead of letting the boys of smoke and concrete take over the neighborhood with their eyes now in the White House itself! Her spoiled and strange daughter, Delia, had anything to do with Gene's sudden good fortune? <br /> <br /> Only later, when Jo, Ann Hearen, is hired as Delia's nanny, that the truth is about her, strange and evil. powers. Jo a New Age type realizes that Delia is a little strange, after turning all her white crystals into black, and calls her New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to come and check her. Noah is so upset about what he sees in the Delia Kirilian color vibes, all black and blue with a little pinch of red, which makes him so bad that he almost crashed into Delia's mother's car. <br /> <br /> On a trip to a psychic festival by Jo Delia turns the whole event into a scene from hell to the place, through mental telepathy, on fire and raising everyone there to rush to hide, including poor Noah who was at the festival and ended up with a broken leg. The shaken and shaken Guru was so shaken by all the experience that later left the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan desert. <br /> <br /> Jo herself is later expelled, with the help of sweet and cuddly pet Ryder, from a second-story window to her death because she knew and talked too much. It is when Karen is pregnant again that she finally decides to find out the truth about Delia's true parents. It is when she and we, in the audience, come face to face with the truth. She's not just the dreaded Antichrist of Revelation, she's his twin sister! His brother, the Antichrist, is about to step in as his younger brother, the unborn Alexander York! <br /> <br /> Three times it was more than enough for the Antichrist to return to earth to bring Armageddon. The movie going public was already getting a little tired of it and its evil adventures. With a really unnecessary room since Daimen Thorn, the original Antichrist, was dead and buried for years. It was put in the usual place, without anyone believing that little Delia is "Thee" AntiChrist, until it was almost too late to stop her in her mortal rounds of destroying the entire human race. The film is as bad as it is also very long, 97 minutes for a horror movie that could have told you that the story is only 80 minutes. Having a private detective Earl Knight, Apprentice Mchael, and later a former Catholic nun Yvonne, Megan Lehch and now healer of the Felichy faith in the film, just to be killed, did not help the plot either. It only prolonged the suffering of those who watched the film. You can see the surprising ending arriving as soon as the movie "Omen IV" began, with the bases being released for Delia's eventual takeover of the civilized and uncivilized world. What was a surprise was Delia doing so with a little help from friends.
