Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai," or "Big Problem in Little China," or "Conan the Barbarian," which are horrible movies that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations, The Golden Child is simply bad. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is not impractical, and there are a few funny moments. But here Eddy Murphy's "reverse attitude" only deflates any sense of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are foolish enough to cause more damage to that tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are more ridiculed than attracted. <br /> <br /> Without the feeling that something is at stake, or that the characters face a real danger, why should we care? <br /> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - big fans of Eddy Murphy who can not contain themselves <br /> <br /> - I can not think of anyone else <br /> < > <br /> I'm going to give this movie a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
