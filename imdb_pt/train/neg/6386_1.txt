I really wanted to like this movie, but it was simply impossible. The performance was ultra-hammy, the plot was boring and the tempo was SLOW, soooo slow. All the while sitting at the movies I wanted the movie to end. Twenty minutes into movies and I'm praying for an ending. Of course some of the visuals were cool, but come on, I mean really! And for a movie about a guy tuning magic instruments, there was not much music to speak. The music there was boring and boring. There was loud and strident sound sometimes too, those were also annoying. Mostly this movie got me bored and scared me at the same time. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's over. I need to go see "Tideland" and wash that bad taste out of my mouth.
