Elizabeth Taylor could never act at all and she was just your usual annoying, untalented in this movie. That was before she got so fat, but she still looked very small and chubby. Rock Hudson was just like Bick Benedict, but clearly an actor with more reach as William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to grumble his way through a movie. The whole movie is incredibly slow and continues for a long time. The actors were all very young and light and none of them aged convincingly due to poor makeup. Hudson looked ridiculous just being camped out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
