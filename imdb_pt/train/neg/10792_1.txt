this movie offers nothing but the most idiotic conversations possible. In fact, I probably could not imagine how a movie would be meaningless, as the dialogues could be synthetic up to an hour ago, but then again, I saw this video. in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script, it is expected to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor, perhaps, but this movie does not have them all. You heard me, you do not have all of them. There is not a single point I like about this movie, none. I hate that. I'm sure someone else will do that, too. the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts about nudity and other things, but still up to nudity. I do not know how, but I endured watching this thing for an hour or so, and I definitely recommend you do not do that. The worst movie I've seen in my entire life. if someone offers you to watch, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
