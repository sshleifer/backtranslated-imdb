With a story and script that seems to have been written by a high school student, "The Art of Seduction" can not provide the romantic and sophisticated experience that tries to present itself. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both the masculine and the feminine are swing singles (or in the case of the female lead, engaged), but "The Art of Seduction" does not even try. Dodging a frank examination of the personalities of these two characters, 'The Art of Seduction' avoids anything of substance to a base lean and stereotype. <br /> <br /> "The Art of Seduction" is insulting - insulting its characters, insulting men and women and insulting the expectations of its viewers. It takes the wonderful and wonderful people that we all know and performs their painful interactions while waiting for us to idolize them. Ji-wan is an immature, spoiled and manipulative bitch. The viewer is expected to enjoy and forgive her failures because she is beautiful. Min-jun, well, he's exactly the same. They are not nice people. The "humor" in this film revolves mainly around the bizarre attempts of Ji-wan and Min-jun to excel in the honorable art of lying and manipulating. No character development occurs, and we never learn because Ji-wan and Min-jun are like this. You are simply expected to take them as they are, and do not ask questions - they are cute !, and that is all that matters. The copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in the critics of the scene of the cinema azn can take it to the superficiality of the Art of Seduction. <br /> <br /> If you are still in high school, you liked Grease, or you are a victim of yellow fever, you may like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the "Romance" tag, this is not a very good date movie.
