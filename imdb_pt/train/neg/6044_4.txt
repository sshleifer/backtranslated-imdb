A well put together in the serial killer genre that unfortunately gets bogged down in its own pretense to be really rewarding. Willem Dafoe is excellent as a NYC detective trying to track down what appears to be an imitator using the same assassination techniques related to Renaissance art used in a series of murders he solved years earlier. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's junior partner and they have very good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters appear to conveniently associate the two cases together. Clea Duval is friends with a previous victim and Peter Stormare is a kind of art dealer / mentor for Dafoe ... this is a bit difficult to accept, although Stormare, of course, is never boring. The ending of the film is particularly disappointing. Look quickly at Deborah Harry as the nearest neighbor to Dafoe.
