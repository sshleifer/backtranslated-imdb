This movie "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and absolutely pointless. It really makes me shudder to think that there are people who like to watch. Without revealing the story, it is a boy's reaction to his newborn sister, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout this film, the viewer is subject to some of the most perplexing childish behaviors imaginable. Adding insult to injury, until the end of this movie there is absolutely no real result except the fruition of pure evil in the hands of a child no less, who has outgrown a whole group of adult donkeys. There is no redemption, no justice served, and a whole group of adults who are not clever enough to see what is going on around them. Frankly, I did not enjoy watching this movie. It was extremely unsettling. Even for those who like horror movies, this movie may be too much. Despite the fact that this film was well represented, the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in the waiting room of a dentist in anticipation of some painful dental procedure.
