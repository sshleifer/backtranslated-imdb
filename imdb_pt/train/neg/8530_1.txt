"Her Card Lover" is Norma Shearer's latest film. She left the theater and, I think, joined the MGM Board of Directors. That was a good move on her part. "Her Hairboard Lover" was fake and boring in parts. It was obvious that there were only a handful of actors to talk to, so they had a lot of dialogue to talk about to keep that turkey afloat. <br /> <br /> The story was a good idea about a wealthy woman (Norma Shearer) hiring a man (Robert Taylor) to leave his playboy bride (George Sanders) jealous. I'm surprised that the director, George Cukor, has not cut many of the talisman scenes between Shearer and Taylor. Cukor served Mrs. Shearer very well in "The Women," but not in this movie. <br /> <br /> The best performance of the film was given by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylor's career, he was given his best comedy roles in this film and "When Ladies Meet" in 1941. In 1942 he gave his best comedy performance in "Her Cardboard Lover" and until then his best dramatic performance in "Johnny Eager." He had a busy year. I think of all the MGM actors, Mr. Taylor has worked with all major and minor actresses on the lot. In addition, MGM gave Mr. Taylor all kinds of movies to do - most of them were successful. That's why MGM kept it for 25 years. <br /> <br /> Mr. George Sanders was very good as a socialite leap. He played a similar role, eight years later, in "All About Eve," for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role. As for Mrs. Shearer, this was one of her worst performances, she was not funny and dramatic enough for this comedy. It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939, "The Women", and gave her better performance. It was obvious she was too old looking for her younger leaders in "Her Cardboard Lover." Besides, it did not help that some of his clothes were horrible. <br /> <br /> Pity she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together, the superb "Escape." The same comments about this movie can be told from another film, "Personal Property" that Mr. Taylor did in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was very annoying, annoying and the actress looked old. Harlow looked ill throughout the film and no one in Hollywood noticed that she should see a doctor, so in 1937 she died at age 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and getting better roles.
