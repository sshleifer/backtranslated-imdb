This movie is not the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and that's a pity, because the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I'm not denying the talent of Barbra Streisand. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I'm not familiar with Kris Kristofferson's other work and therefore I can not judge him. However, this movie leaves much to be desired. It is paced slowly, has free nudity and foul language, and can be very difficult to sit on. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a big fan of rock, so it's only natural that I would like Judy Garland's version better. Watch the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris and judge for yourself.
