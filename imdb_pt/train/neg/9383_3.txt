VERY BAD MOVIE ........ and I mean VERY BAD ... The plot is predictable, and it's absolutely tacky, the creativity of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason why I do not I gave the movie is a plus ... this is def a movie that one can def pay for not watching ..... I feel while watching the movie, the idea behind the movie was interesting for that kind of clich√©. ... binging country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah, but I feel it could have been at least a little better if it was not so tacky, very poorly portrayed from idea to screen, I think. The plot is a bit predictable at times, tho the dance I can say AT TIMES, it's very good, The battle dance break twist was good ..... IF u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and do your own dialogue might be a 5 ... lol
