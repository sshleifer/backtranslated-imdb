This is a review of 'Freddy Mercury The Untold Story', theater version, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the most boring, uninspired and tedious biographical documentaries I have ever seen. If the movie I watched at a movie was originally released on TV, I would beg their producers and distributors not to fool a paying audience with the false promise of a documentary worthy of cinema. Even as a TV documentary, the sentimental piano solos accompanying the interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in the hotel rooms and the pompous pseudo-literary narration sounded truer of a somnambulist infomercial. The only redeeming aspects of this "The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury" - or, uhm, was "The Untold Story of Princess Diana" are the original concert, video and TV footage - Freddy Mercury and Queen. Witness interviews with irrelevant eyewitnesses with insights such as "He was a free spirit" (actually ... I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man ...) downplayed Freddy's testimonials, by Brian May or Montserrat Cabal that cast new and tender light on the complex life and character of Mercury. And ... what about the segments of Harry Potter boarding school? Like the interview with the first girl-crush ("... who now works at a travel agency") and the members of Freddy's first band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? Vital milestones of her personal life, her sexuality, her artistic style and growth, Queen, the band remains unexplored. These filmmakers do not ask a unique and provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research on the subject, instead of delivering a tedious assortment of politely clean and vastly empty commentaries on an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend that does not deserve to be remembered by this History Channel biography that his grandparents can doze off on a Sunday night.
