I look around at the video store still in a state of shock as Steven Seagal with his bad action movie history may still have 3 movies on the shelves in less than a year. The attack force is the third no less promised entry by first time on Sci Fi Genre for our ever widening Seagal.Visions of bad movie entertainment shone before my naive eyes. Unfortunately, this is not the case a bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come. Seagal recovered a little with Trashy - but fun Shadow Man the last time we saw him. However, the attacking force has to be your worst movie ever! Do not argue with Kill, Ticker or Black Dawn personnel. Bottom of septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says this is Steven Seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word Taste. Seagal is yet another agent / I'm a disgusting supreme once again called Lawson wants revenge for the death of his team that leads him to a nefarious plot to deliver a really bad drug to the innocent public. To mention the dealers are not at all here. <br /> <br /> All production to direct to the acting is poor.This film was filmed in the dark? It has to be the most badly lit movie since Howling 2. The action is bad and very badly made. <br /> <br /> Producers have also decided, foolishly, to do what fans most hate: stunt double after stuntman and horribly dubbed Steven Seagal. show little enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> Although it has been said that Attack Force was not the movie that Stevie signed (originally Harvester) and certainly has to be better than Attack force. The adulteration of production did not make it more coherent and made Seagal appear worse. I feel bad for Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal as they will be judged forever by the ill-advised production re-shoots. <br /> <br /> So, that leaves Seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess. But after seeing how bad Attack Force is over, do we really want him to make another movie?
