There was not really much history in this movie. He relied vaguely on the events of the first film of the Lion King. Supposedly it is how Timon and Pumba met through their solitude. But there is not much more than that. <br /> <br /> It mixes some scenes from the original, so it's ab-libs about how this movie has changed a bit. But still, is that it? I was waiting for something a little more. Instead, all I have to show is an empty plot with little explanation. <br /> <br /> I think if you want to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe, then that's it. But in addition, it does little justice to the animators. Disney really should stop these direct productions for video. It was really annoying and could have used Jason Statham. "D-"
