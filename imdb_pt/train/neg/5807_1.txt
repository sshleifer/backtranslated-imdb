Do not bother with this movie, it's bad when judged on its own merits, but when compared to the 1972 original (which is a classic) it's pretty bad. And BTW, someone commented that the 1972 film is bad when compared to the book. This is silly, movies should never be judged against the books from where they are taken. They are two completely different art forms (as if this needed to be pointed out, but it seems so). If you used this criterion for all the movies, then "2001" would be a drug, just like "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
