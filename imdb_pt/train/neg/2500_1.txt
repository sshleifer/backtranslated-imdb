Van Dien must shrink with shame at the memory of this ridiculously poor movie, as well as all the individuals involved. To be honest, I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that I watched from start to finish. The production values ​​are somewhere between the original series of 'Crossroads' and 'Prisoner Cell Block H'. Most five-year-olds would be able to come up with a more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. As for acting performances, if you can imagine the dirtiest porn movie you've ever seen - one of those in which the action is complemented with an endless 'story' to explain how some old blond boiler peroxide has gotten spit on - Played by a couple of mustaches - you will have some idea of ​​the standard of performance in 'Maiden Voyage'. Worse still, you can not even advance to the sex scenes because there are none. A horribly awful movie.
