Being an independent filmmaker and a big fan of Edward D. Wood Jr., I bought this documentary believing that this would finally account for how Ed Wood was talented and brilliant. <br /> <br /> What I received was a disappointing, self-centered, conflicting, contradictory compilation of bitter self-aggrandizers. <br /> <br /> Where people remember Ed Wood Jr. do people really remember the guy's second cousin with the duct tape he knew someone who was on Plan Nine From Outer Space? <br /> <br /> It seems that the minute there's a renewed interest in Ed Wood, these people get out of Wood's work! Just to sneer at someone who really gave them a chance when no one else would! After 50 years, I would have suggested that many of these people should leave aside the fact that they did not receive the $ 75 they were promised! <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. In fact, that was all he lived for. You can laugh when you watch Ed's movies, but somehow you're aware that you're laughing with him, not with him. <br /> <br /> But, I disagree ... Back to the movie in hand. If you're expecting a movie about Edward D. Wood Jr., you will not be able to get it here. If you want a movie about old bitter actors, this is the movie for you!
