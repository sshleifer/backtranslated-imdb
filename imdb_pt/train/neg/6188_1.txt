This is by far the worst Jane Eyre adaptation I have ever seen. It is uncertain whether script writer has ever read Bronte's book. George C Scott is ridiculous and fumbling like Rochester - when not just simply acting angry. Susannah York has the oldest 1970's hairstyle I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters hardly talk to each other, so that the rich joke enjoyed in the book that is the basis of their deep intellectual and lasting love is gone. The ending is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent the Timothy Dalton version. It's so true to the book, it's like having the novel read aloud to you. Dalton is excellent as Rochester. G. C. Scott is laughable.
