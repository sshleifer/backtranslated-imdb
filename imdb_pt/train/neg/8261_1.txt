I was eager to watch this movie and then realized that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was flooded with unnecessary profanity. Now I'm not a Puritan at all, but shouting obscenities at each other does not make a good movie. Ewan Bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world right now (testifies to his performance in God of Life of Stuff) and his "Cockney" accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many more of these movies "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" we have to suffer before the filmmakers realize that the word f, the word etc. does not replace the appropriate dialogue.
