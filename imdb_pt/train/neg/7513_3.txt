What can I say? I think I have to write "spoiler alert" and then "reveal" they used the word F very much in this movie - as in every two sentences. I did not like that movie at all - lots of tips on sexual perversions, avoidance, and cheating. And that oath was totally out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of those points are for the sexy movements of Mira Sorvino on the dance floor.
