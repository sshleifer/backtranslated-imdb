I liked the first movie, but this is an example textbook of a sequel that would have been best left on the drawing board. The general idea in the first film was, if not great, at least very interesting. This sequel tries to build on the idea and characters of the first film, and although Christopher Walken is still good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly becomes a little ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these movies, then take the first movie and forget the sequences, they can take all the joy out of the original.
