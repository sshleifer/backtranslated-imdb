The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium, are fine: you see a real chaos on the set, a producer on the verge of a nervous breakdown, the cool was the director (Mickey Rourke), the moody star, etc. . You've seen everything before, but it's well done. BUT THEN! The rest of the time the movie just repeats itself: the same ten minutes repeatedly. Without climax, without dramatic development, without good performance, not even bad acting, just continues and continues. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his fucked career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. In total, that makes 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
