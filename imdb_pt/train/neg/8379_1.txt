As some of the other reviewers mentioned earlier, I would like to know the idiot who actually read the screenplay and said, "Yeah, that's it.This is the next movie we're going to do the green light !!" And whoever this person is, he must have his head examined for real brain activity. Because who is responsible for actually handing out money to do this after reading the script, well, I'd love to give you my email address and maybe you'd like to just give a little more money. This movie is atrocious in every way. <br /> <br /> Wayans are funny, at least they can be. They made some good movies and had some amazingly funny performances along the way. But here, not only does the premise defies all logic, not only acting is terrible, not only is the whole movie offensive from start to finish, not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find but they really want you to pay to see this movie. Maybe if it was for free ... naaah, it would still be a waste of time. Generally I'd be inclined to write a long, detailed review of why this movie is so bad, but suffice it to say let my brevity speak. This is the lowest common denominator film and is as infallible as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0 / 10. Make my list of the ten worst films ever!
