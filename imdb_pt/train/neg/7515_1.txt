Sucks. That's all I have to say about that excuse for a movie. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. I mean, what the hell were they thinking? The idiots involved should never be allowed to make other movies. The acting was so bad that it even failed to entertain on a bad level. The attempt at a "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt so bad about the women involved. This movie sucks! Sucks! Sucks! <br /> <br /> I heard rumors of a sequel. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everything
