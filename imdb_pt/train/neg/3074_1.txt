Even for cocaine tied to the 80's, that's pathetic. I do not understand why anyone would want to waste celluloid, time, effort, money and brain cells from the public to do such nonsense. If you're going to make a comedy, make it funny. If you want to shoot trash like this, save it for yourself. If you're going to cast it as a joke like this: NO !!! I mean, it was a joke, right? Someone please tell me this was a joke. please.
