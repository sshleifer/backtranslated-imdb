"Dahmer" is an interesting film, although I did not use "horror" or "suspense" to describe it. It's more of a smaller character study that seems strangely sympathetic to the killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner plays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", well interpreted by Artel Kay√†ru. Rodney is almost the most interesting character: in love with Dahmer and having escaped an attack, he returns to Dahmer by sex and survives a second attack. <br /> <br /> I think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray Dahmer's formative years as events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into Dahmer's belief that he could create sex zombies for his victims. <br /> <br /> roles are well played, but the story is lean.
