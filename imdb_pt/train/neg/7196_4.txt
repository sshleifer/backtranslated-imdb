Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 Minutes PG Classified By Blake French : The new Disney film "Inspector Gadget" is about a cop named John who survives a major accident and is saved by a state-of-the-art experimental operation that turns him into a robotic agent with tools and gadgets of all kinds embedded in his body when he says "Go Go", just to be called Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The structure of the film is very similar to the body formation of the Inspector Gadget. himself. It's noisy, fragmented, energetic and consists of a bunch of half-hearted contraptions put together to do something that does not have much in common with anything else present. The film is basically a series of action sequences that are kind of glued to characters and an uneven story that only children between 6 and 9 could enjoy. <br /> <br /> The police officer who is dramatically reinvented is played by Matthew Broderick, who until "Inspector Gadget" was in a hit series with films like "Election." His character becomes Inspector Gadget after a meeting with the heavy-handed villain in the movie called Claw. He is played by Rupert Everett, who has already suffered a catastrophe this year with William Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream". <br /> <br /> There is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as a lot of scenes involving parts of the wacky body of the Inspector Gadget and elements of the mechanism. Has Gadget and Claw drooling over the attractive character Brenda, played by Joely Fisher, both for his looks and his knowledge of a specific invention made by his late father, who was previously killed by Claw. The competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many events in the film. Also an important character is the Gadget Mobil, a car that is designed for the Inspector Gadget itself. It is voiced by D.L. Hughly from the comedy comedy "The Hughly's". <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" is a movie that I found very bad. I know, I'm not exactly the target audience for filmmakers, but even my ten-year-old relative found the film the way he did. The film is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. I've never found myself caring about the characters. There is no development of humor beyond a few opening credits, unlike the much worse 1997 movie, "Mr. Magoo," which he opened using clips from the original drawing. Is asking too much the same sort of thing in this comedy - which is rarely funny and hardly convincing? The overall design of the production is nothing more than a mess of incomplete jokes and consists of a joke: the goofy goofy of Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In movies like this, the audience craves boundaries - something to help understand what can happen and what can not. In "Inspector Gadget" there are no such boundaries. This is truly nothing more than a party time for the actors, who in the long run had a great time. I remember another lack of comedy released a couple of years ago called "Blankman", which contained lots of props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun with all the gadgets and accessories, but also lacked something necessary for each film: audience participation. <br /> <br /> One character I found being left out is very much the daughter of Gadgets, who by the end of the movie, I still have no idea what her name was. It is used only as a plot device and I question how it was used to promote the plot as well. Because her presence does not bring anything relevant or productive to the film. We never know your reactions to father's operation or accidents. So this is someone who could have been completely out of it and would not have affected the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to say that "Inspector Gadget" is a terrible and insufficient excuse. for children's comedy. And believe it or not, I find myself comparing this movie to the recent years of violent and very anti-youthful action image "Blade". I am stating again that I had a lot more film in which nothing happened than that in which everything happens. "Inspector Gadget" had so much to do at the same time that it literally made me dizzy. <br /> <br />
