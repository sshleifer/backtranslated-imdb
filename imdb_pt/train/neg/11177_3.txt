In what seemed to be the longest 1 hour and 35 I've had to endure in a long time, Al Pacino delivers accurate performance for sure. It's not your usual typecasting, which was cool. But his character was simply pathetic. Someone pays off when he stumbles forgetting commitments as we realize that Hollywood's social life has drained him of his vital energy. But in this movie we needed someone to like. And for some reason, each character in the photo said "I do not know why I like you, Eli" for the character of Al Pacino and I could not even come close to liking him. <br /> <br /> Other actors played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on TV or in previous films. And Kim Basinger was not even in the movie long enough to make a performance of any kind. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie had no time. Most scenes never take the story forward, but only collect facts about characters that later came into play in an anti-climax finale. It had potential except for reluctance to rely on history. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the film? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz want you to believe "Once Hollywood has you, you can not leave." Okay, right! And that's why so many people get fired in Hollywood.
