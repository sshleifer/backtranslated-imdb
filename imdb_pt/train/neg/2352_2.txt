Raw, sometimes coarse - to me is the sum of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - Page 3. He has no point of view - just superficial, funny like stereotypes. What is the film about?? It is about denouncing a clan of people (so-called types) who are so busy in socializing and progressing in their profiles in life - that they do not have time for anything else. And you are in it or out of it. Is there no press to report daily incidents? Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and it is only a supplement; perhaps an artist to check who is who and what is what. Do not mix both. And then there is power play - that would happen in all walks of life. So what did you say at the end of it all - nothing - just a few rough jokes together in a different direction from the movie.
