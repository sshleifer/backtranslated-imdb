the costumes, the dialogue, the historical precision are terrible. For example, - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene. The tie was accurate (as I might say), but that kind of knot broke the person's neck. Mrs. Dash is left hanging at the end of the rope with no harmful effects until the rope was tossed. That kind of did not strangle the person, killed her at the end of the fall. <br /> <br /> And just before stealing a bank (in a flashback), they stop in the street for a group hug - with their bandanas hiding their faces - that would have been obvious to people on the street. <br /> <br /> The poor edit - which is a drums underneath that shirt and it is obvious, the clip of the "long journey" shows them walking from one side to the other, then reverses the film. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that they kept the scene with the horse taking crap - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie sucked.
