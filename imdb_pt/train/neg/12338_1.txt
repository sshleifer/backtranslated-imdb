I saw this movie originally at the movies when I was 10 years old. Even at this age, the 'humor' was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence. <br /> <br /> In the past, whenever I saw Ed Begley Jr. or Jeff Goldblum I would shrink and begin to feel very uncomfortable and even a little sad. Until I remember the existence of this movie today, I did not know why I felt like this. Apparently I blocked my memory of this movie, but my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained. Apparently I forgot that I saw this movie, but subconsciously I fight the pieces of my soul that had been stolen, that is, EATEN by the creators of this inhuman work. <br /> <br /> I was not brave enough to try to watch it. as an adult. I imagine that as part of the healing process, I should probably face this fear of childhood so that I can * truly * put it back. Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis may not be a bad idea.
