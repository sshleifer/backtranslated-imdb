Never see this movie. <br /> <br /> He tries to be a spoof in suspense / suspense movies of the 1950s and 1960s, but all that happens is to make you want very much even if you were watching one of them and not him. <br /> <br /> It's very lame. A spoof has to have some aspect that has some quality superior to it. This movie does not look that way. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... just do not watch.
