Another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved story of children, La Bete (1975), also known as The Beast, tries to imagine (in a very stupid way and that may seem offensive and disturbing, but in reality a little silly and comical), the What really happened between Beauty and the Beast? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look very deeply into this film. I would not go so far as to say that it is a serious and obscure exploration of subjects like sexual frustration, desire, achievement or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I would not even say it's an erotic horror movie. It's more of a parody of every genre he touches or mentions, though he has some shocking moments in every department that will surely linger in his memory. <br /> <br /> The long (too long) scene between a young aristocrat. woman and the supposedly creepy, but the most laughable I've ever seen in the movie creature with truly stunning ... well anatomy, is set for Scarlatti's clavichord music and is hysterical. My husband and I laughed loudly at the exaggerated details of the meeting. The moral of the scene is: beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is: who is the target audience for the film? For an erotic image, it is very verbose; for an art film - there are many scenes of pure madness and I would say an abrupt end. IMO, the creator of the film, did not mean it would be a serious drama. As a parody of art house / horror / erotica, it's funny and certainly original. Have a good laugh and try not to look for any deep meaning. This story of Curious Beauties and Lush Beasts is certainly not recommended to co-watch with children. The opening scene that may shock an unsuspecting spectator far more than the infamous bestiality scene can be successfully used on the Discovery channel for the show as "In the World of Animals - Mating Habits and Horse Rituals."
