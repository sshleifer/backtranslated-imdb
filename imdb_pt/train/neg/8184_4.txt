This is almost like two movies - one literate and engaging, the other stupid and cliche. It's really a shame that all the problems have not been solved by writing, but considering how fast most B-films have been written and produced, this is not very unusual. It's a shame, however, as this could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First the good. The film is original and involves wrapping codes from World War II. This is very fascinating and I enjoyed watching the protagonist (Lee Bowman) go through his steps as a master at breaking the code. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film were very good. But now, to bad, the film just spent a lot of time and lost steam in about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as the "crazy girlfriend" should be classified as one of the most talked about and distracted roles in film history! For every smart move made by Bowman, the idiot Rogers then stepped in to ruin things as a kind of wrong "comic relief". If his role had been intelligently written, the film in general would have improved immensely! Instead, looking at it, it's hard to understand how we actually won WWII !!
