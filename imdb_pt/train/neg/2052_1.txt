This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great movie. Nothing new or original is added beyond Perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest. It lacks the documentary of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. Also painfully missing the Quincy Jones soundtrack which added a lot to the original movie. I can not understand any high ratings for this. Is very bad. Why does someone waste time or money doing crap like that and why did I waste time watching?
