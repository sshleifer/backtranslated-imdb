Well. This was not a surprise. many people will say that this is bloody. but they are all talking "shiztz" this movie is very slow. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy who makes a mix to not feel pain, he calls "my son", there are some bloody scenes, but I found them kind of weak. you can also skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene which was surprisingly impressive and disgusting. There are some really stupid scenes in that. and they dub the hits and beat up with stupid fake tapas sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. keep looking for injured dogs. <br /> <br /> Check this out if you want the final scene of 20 to 10 minutes that is not yet so amazing and has a random scene from the guy trying to like raping his mother. is weird.
