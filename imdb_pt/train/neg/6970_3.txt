Now, it would be kind of clich√© if I started with the title, so I'll wait for it. First, this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wandering through the labs and breaking bottles. So I realized this, this is a movie with a message, that message is hitting kids and things like that will not happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant insecticide monster growing and causing a bit of chaos before dying in the typical fashion "kill the monster indirectly". Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... there's nothing blue about him or any Simian of any kind. Now it seems like I've been fooled or something. The image on the cover had a giant bug / crab / idiot / thing at the front chasing some screaming nurses. That happened, but I wanted monkeys! having just enjoyed EXTREME PRIMATA a few nights before (half drunk in the mind of Cognac from Cask and Creame you) I was in the mood for more style of monkey abductions from the 80's. Not much of it. If you like snowboarding monkeys or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you like mistakes and good reasons to hit the kids, rent this.
