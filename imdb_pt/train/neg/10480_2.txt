It has a great name, but that's it and you will not get more than that for your money, in fact the first 30-40mins of the movie you might find funny, but after that the story goes from one side to another with no reason at all. and you just can not understand what is happening until the action is over. <br /> <br /> And yet the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I do not think the way he does could be called anything but overacting !! .... period. The little boy playing as his son has no sense of acting and I believe it was just a favor he made or something, because he had no idea what he was doing. <br /> <br /> For some reason, while casting they thought that when they released comedians, they could do it, but they did not! and sometimes the cheap humor without taste is so bad that I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> But I hope it's as bad as it sounds. To get people to accept these DVDs for the taste buds, they will have to offer some food, this can work. Maka
