This movie is horrible. I did not laugh so much in a movie that was unintentionally funny in a long time. Leno should have stayed up late at night and tv. The cars in the movie were cool, but the movie itself is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. is pathetic, the acting is horrible and the plot could have been written by a 4 year old. do not get me wrong, jay leno is hilarious, but not in that movie!
