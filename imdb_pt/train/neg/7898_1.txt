When I saw this movie, I did not believe my eyes. Where those hilarious creatures, garbage muppets with big pointed teeth, really wanted to be scary? Or where they designed to have a good laugh (I sincerely hope so). If you watch closely, you may even see the strings operating them (better, dragging them across the screen). The set was pretty funny than scary and I had fun watching the movie because I was impressed by their overall inability to have only a good part. It's a big joke from start to finish and I believe this movie belongs to a new category: so unbelievable that you will laugh from start to finish. (I will not even try to comment on the acting or all other things)
