This film is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a Catholic school, watching as RAWANDAN's genocide unfolds around him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief explanation of the history and rivalry of the past. Rawanda. Then it jumps into the story as told through the eyes of a young idealist "NEW-EAT," a young teacher who does not take life or situation very seriously. As he and the driver approach a road block, he plays with his drivers. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can not identify himself as being of the right tribe for the soldiers, they will be killed. And this is how he treats the history of unfolding chaos and unfolds around him. Suddenly you realize that all Rawandan (including your driver) are involved and that European soldiers and tourists can not and will not help. The media cameras can not stop the machetes, and there are many militiamen wielding machetes also firing. the title comes from the captain of the armies saying that he will shoot the dogs by eating the corpses around his complex, but will not shoot the men of the Militia who are killing the people around the complex. Especially since they still have not fired at the soldiers. Finally he notices the desperation of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his chair to one of the victims, runs away with the tail between his legs instead of facing immanent death with the school children. He promised not to leave behind. <br /> <br /> It is more a study of character, and a time to come to Jesus for a character, than a story about the genocide in "RAWANDA." This movie did not take place in RAWANDA, could have occurred any of the holes of the Genocidal hell happening around the world at any moment.
