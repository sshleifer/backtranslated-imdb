I gave it more than 1 because I found there were some moral lessons in this story and this sparked some thought and comment from my wife and me. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess that I left feeling that I had been beaten on the head with God this, God who and Christ is our material of savior. The film and the story did not need it. If, like me, you are a recovering Catholic or Christian, avoid the one that will make you nauseous. The film did a good job demonstrating the fine line between being a good citizen and how one could become a possible pursuer focused on what it could have been.
