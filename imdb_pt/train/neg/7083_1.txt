My husband rented it from a video store thinking it was suspense. He never reads the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Well, it would be funny if the thing was watchable. It just is not. The same thing over and over again, without intrigue, and where did they find the leader? The protagonist, Michael Des Barres, is not even good-looking, especially for this role he is given. In addition, sexual harassment at work is something, if you want to see, rent "Disclosure" from Michael Crichton. At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who is usually assisted, plays an embarrassing scene here. There are also lighting effects cheaper than your webcam at home. Do not waste time renting this. 0/10.
