Heavy moralism. Writers using characters like mouthpieces to speak for themselves. Predictable and slow plot points (say five times faster). The imitation of a Britney Spears child. This movie has all the signs of a rejection from Lifetime Special. <br /> <br /> I honestly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set out to create a thought-provoking and emotional film about a difficult subject, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, the one that is a criminal, by definition, is not necessarily a bad human being, and that there may be extenuating circumstances, especially when one puts the welfare of a child first. However, its seriousness ends up being channeled into preacher dialogue and banal situations planted to take the plot forward. Decent production values ​​and the interesting use of documentary-style camera footage are not enough to achieve their goal when script and acting fall. <br /> <br /> Logic is often compromised to create tension: Soid first attempts to blackmail Pablo to participate in his documentary in exchange for helping them escape, and then at the same time basically tells him not to trust because it does not help them out of altruism. Well, duh. And for a man on the run, Pablo is heavily influenced by a tantrum. Cristina's well-being is so important to him that he is fleeing from capture and detention or deportation to her, but he is willing to risk everything to appease her when she does not want to go to Mexico. Right. Speak above overly permissive parenting. Third, when Charlie, Pablo's employer, gives the phone to Detective Bright, she is remarkably unprofessional, especially given her seniority - did she really think she was persuasive? Oh, yes, I would have surrendered myself. CCH Pounder's detective Wims could clean the floor with her. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I would like to list the things I liked. I liked the dwarf. And I liked the fact that the dwarf was called Sexy. There is cross-dressing, always a plus; young cross-dressing, no less! Harry is infinitely more handsome than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the movie has to be when Cristina kicks the Not-So-Bright Detective. I also find it interesting that in a minority cast (which I really appreciate, by the way), the black character is the racist. Too bad it is simply thrown out there and no longer exploited. <br /> <br /> There is a distinctive and unconventional punctuation, but it is non-contextually non-specific, not improving mood or tension in any scene except the pitiful and distressing lament. every time the main character is distressed, as if he thinks his acting is not enough: "If you're not sure, he's upset, and we have the musical clues to prove it." <br /> <br /> The spoken dialogue and cliché results in a depressing lack of subtext; everything has to be explained in dialogue, even when the language of the body was ready until then, transmitting very well. For example, every passionate speech that Pablo makes, and Mme. Knight regret that his son does not go crawl in bed with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> 'Daddy, tell me about mama again' - how naughty, blatant introduction introducing the generic dead wife! (She is always the most beautiful woman the widower has ever seen, the most gentle she has ever known.) Why can not we see a man cry for a woman like Shakespeare? like the story that would touch me. <br /> <br /> The police are always literally one step behind them, and it gives many scenes the feel of a French farce out of place. and Lightning are so out of shape and easily cheated (he certainly is not fast as lightning, and she, well, I do not feel the need to spell things out.) Some guy crawling along a small child overtaking a police officer of bike, complete with the male motorcyclist choosing a fight, but after being slaughtered by a child? To quote Margaret Cho, this is so sad.Would we see this in 'Cops'? Hackneyed and over- the-top god ex machina: as an employer, you really r would you state to check your green card just because it can quote the author of the inspiring proverb on a poster behind your desk? <br /> <br /> In addition, several scenes, including previous ones, threaten to turn into pornography: 'Well, I will do you this favor as long as you do something for yourself. I ... "I can almost hear the coconut palm bow. <br /> <br /> When parents see the filming of Pablo's remorse, the beating of the bereaved mother is more real than the film feels.Unfortunately this is diminished by the fact that she seems completely influenced by her emotional speech until she goes ballistic.A more ambivalent look would be more convincing here. <br /> <br /> I am constantly impressed by stupidity of the main character doing things because of the plot: holding a convenience store without a mask, visiting the grave of the dead girl, and why did not the mother recognize her face from the moment she saw him before she left? . "<br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this totally unnecessary, somewhat gratuitous, scene with Soid and the artificially upgraded bartender? <br /> < > Speaking of unnecessary traits that have never gotten anywhere, the Lightning is saying that the skeptical Detective Bright must be a Scorpio, shows how little he really knows about the occult. And I do not think that believing in fate is qualifying as a voodoo mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> In the end, when Bright holds Pablo as he dies - wait, why does she care now? His character is as inconsistent as Soid's. What, does she have to shoot him just because she said 'Stop, or am I going to shoot'? (She cared a lot about her integrity so far.) He was unarmed. There was no need for lethal force. What's wrong with tossing his leg to immobilize him? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina's infant acceptance of her mother's death gave Dr. Knight peace for the death of her daughter-so forced. And the artifice of the family whose son was killed becoming Cristina's new family ... It annoys her that she can be a "substitute" for her little girl. It is also unreal that a white couple receives the Latin daughter of the man who killed his own daughter. I am not saying that there are no generous and loving people who do this. I'm just saying the characters here are never developed enough for me to believe they would do it. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another critic of the IMDb has said that it is clear that as a woman she has been moved. by sappy scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that do not become sentimental in a fabricated way. Co-writer, co-director, co-star Nebot said he wore many hats during this production. Many cooks can ruin the broth, but a cook alone can end up making a special after school. In conclusion, the title of this film has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret, helplessness and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again.
