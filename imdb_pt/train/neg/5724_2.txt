I agree with the last reviewer that this movie had terrible acting. Yes, there was a lot of blood and some nudity. But it was overshadowed by a slow, pointless plot and a stupid ending. Where should this be filmed anyway: a Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? Hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing that instead. A technical nuisance I had with the DVD is that if you turn off the subtitles in Spanish, they return after a few scenes and then you need to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Also, do not waste your time on the deleted scenes because there is no audio and it just looks like footage from tourists.
