Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to get into serious television news. When a job he asked for goes wrong, he gets fired. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) says sayonara too. Arriving home, Tim is surprised to find that his home has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from Mars! Calling him Uncle Martin, Tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on Earth. But, Martin gets in trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry room and more. The lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees an opportunity to make time with Tim, but the course of true love does not go well in this case either. Soon everyone on television is chasing Tim, hoping for a story about a real alien. What is a man to do? For those who loved the old television show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this movie is not worth tying the proverbial boots. It's really undeniably terrible, with no plot and a reliance on supposed special effects that fall as well. Daniels is just like the Terran, but Lloyd is just as terrible as the alien, overcoming a storm. The rest of the cast is appropriate, as are the costumes, set and production details. Even if your kids see the cover and beg for this movie, convince them to choose another movie in the store. Rest assured, children and adults will find this film a colossal hole, so opt for a night at the museum or around the world in 80 days.
