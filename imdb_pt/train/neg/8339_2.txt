This movie just goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought ... mmmmm, it might be kind of cool to do this, but it just goes on, and eventually you do not know what's going on. The protagonist is a good actress and played her role well, and the psychopath is scary, but after a while you do not care what happens, because the movie just creeps. It's a pity, really, this could have been so much better. <br /> <br /> I would say that the female protagonist and psychopath will have a good career ahead of them, but will they remember this movie, for making them known, or for being the movie they regret doing.
