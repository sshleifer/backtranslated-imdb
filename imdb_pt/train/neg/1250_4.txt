I have to admit that this "re-imagining" of the original 1968 movie was a big disappointment. Especially when taken into consideration that this is a Tim Burton movie. He is definitely one of the most original and, I would say, great directors that Hollywood has produced. <br /> <br /> I personally am a big fan of his work, but something obviously went wrong with his latest movie, The Planet. of the monkeys. I really liked the original movie. When it first came out, people were expecting just one more science fiction movie of Cheezie 70, but one very surprise proved that the theory was wrong. In fact, he had a clear message. An obvious anti-war message. Fear of the Cold War, where it was leading the world and the fear of using nuclear weapons, played a big role in the filmmakers' minds. These reasons made the film surpass all expectations and became an instant classic. Although, the new movie, the "re-making" or whatever, does not leave us anything. No message, no ideal behind it. It's just another big blockbuster in the summer. <br /> <br /> Visually, Tim Burton does not disappoint you. The dark and scary settings were great and of course the makeup was great. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not enough to keep people interested in a movie. There has to be an exciting plot or plot. In this film the plot is highly uninteresting and is extremely poorly thought out. The script is very lame and full of gaps. It seems that this movie was written in a great hurry. The explanation for why the monkeys where they were, and why the ruled ones of the planet were indeed very stupid and proved the ignorance of the writers. <br /> <br /> He raised many questions, which did not have reasonable answers. For example; Why did the monkeys speak English? Because there were other species of monkeys than the chimpanzees on the planet (since there were only chimpanzees in the spaceship that fell on the planet). Where the hell did all these humans come from? How have some chimpanzees managed to evolve into a huge increase in all kinds of monkeys in just a few thousand years? (I mean it took a few million years to evolve from monkey to man!) <br /> <br /> And finally, the bad end was just a dumb plan. It was probably just released because the original movie came to an end, so they felt the audience was expecting the same kind of ending. The ending also raises many questions, which I know, do not have clever answers. Theid learned to work on the spacecraft? Which was powerless, and learned to fly back in time and take the unique hand of the earth?, And, what did he do, procreate with all women? And let's say that would happen, I doubt the story would remain the same, how Washington would be built exactly as it is today! (I mean, will not there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?) <br /> <br /> Well, just to say something positive about the movie. Some of the cast were great. The character of Helen Bonham Carter was interesting and well-acted, as for Tim Roth as Theid. It was very good, a bit detailed in some points of the movie. Michael Clark Duncan was fine, too. I was not happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not much of an actor, and plays a very male character without color. Very unbelievable and nothing compared to Heston's character in the original. And the main female character had no motive or place in the film. She has just been chosen for the looks. He hardly said a word throughout the film. Well, I guess in the future, when people think about Planet of the Apes, they'll think about the original. The latest will be soon forgotten.
