One of the most annoying slashers of all time .. If you can even call it that. I would not have seen it if it was some kind of porn movie, which I completely remember. The fact that you are watching a small group of middle-aged people in the forest is really unbearable. They did these kinds of teen movies, so who did they really want when they were doing this festival of sleep? My favorite part of this movie is cover art and it's the only reason I chose to look for this movie, which happened to be part of a Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack .. and after seeing the other movies in this 50's package, you I will realize that it does not belong anywhere else. So, if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods, I'd recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
