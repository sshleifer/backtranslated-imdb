Jewish reporter Justin Timberlake (as Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is intrigued when a defendant whispers "thank you" to education officer LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) as he leaves the witness stand. In the opening sequences of this film, you get the explanation. You will see devilish detective Dylan McDermott (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decide NOT to assassinate Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles). The Edison City cops are so corrupt that they shoot their suspects, steal their money and smell their drug. If he wants to impress his girlfriend (here, called "Pussy") or win a Pulitzer, the city's corruption does NOT fit the noble Timberlake. Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, which reaches both unexpected scope and life-threatening levels of risk. Writer / director David J. Burke keeps the film above water, but only briefly. LL Cool J wins Timberlake in the "pop star to movie star" (also known as progressive rapper to actor) contest. McDermott enjoys his role. Lending seriousness to the process are wisely supporting the actors Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (as Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. means First Response Assault and Tactical, but it is more important to know that "Edison (Force)" stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. <br /> <br /> Edison (17/9/05) David J.
