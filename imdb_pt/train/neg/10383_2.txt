This may be one of the most enjoyable movies of all time if you do not take it seriously. It's a bit dated and the effects are lame, but it's so nice. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. Oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It's unbelievably bad. And the ending, which was cabled throughout the movie, is horribly incredible. Predictable but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in its place. Do not give this movie a chance and you'll love it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she looks naked. Her daughter is not worth much, but she is attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give a 7. Did I mention that there are giant crabs?
