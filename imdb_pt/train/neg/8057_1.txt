What is wrong with this movie? Many and many things. The issue goes a long way to looking good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer while also providing you with a powerful headache. The plot is confusing and obviously prolonged from what began as a short film (story or film). The plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story, and this is just stretched painfully until it reaches the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They get thinner. In the end, the plot is so thin that you might even miss it if you're not paying attention, which is hard to do when watching this movie. The acting is not at all impressive. The characters are poorly written and bland, uninteresting. One of the worst things that is wrong with this movie is that apparently whoever was in charge of the soundtrack / soundtrack had no idea what the movie was, or what it was meant to be (not that I blame it, I could not too find it out). As a result, half the song in the movie does not fit the scenes. Besides, what about all the sex tones between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Of course, this was to attract young males, but it was done so cheaply. And the first scene had something to do with the rest of the movie? At any conceivable level? Not at all? The two scary guys did not seem to have anything to do with the movie, they were just there to have some chase scenes. I doubt anyone would really enjoy such a poorly-mounted film and such a shameless and horrible Hollywood attempt at a somewhat interesting idea. But I digress. I recommend this to underserved teens who do not care about very bad terror, as long as there is some sex and blood in it (although this may only be true for Killer Cut, which I have seen). 1/10
