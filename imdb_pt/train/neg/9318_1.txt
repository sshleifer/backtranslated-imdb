This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Once again I made the mistake of buying the film because the synapse on the back looked cool and the cover looked really cool too (After buying this and the movie "Malevolence" which I reviewed here too, I learned my lesson). I love horror movies that happen in the forest, in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly occurs in the woods of Texas, but was probably filmed in the director's yard. The production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely the worst. The story has nothing to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other mom and pop stores that buy used DVDs and would not even use it. It's so horrible that poor and miserable excuse for a movie. I've seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example), but that definitely takes the cake. I do not think there was a movie worse than "Troll 2". Boy was I wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free, but even yours, unless you throw it away, which is what I'm about to do !!!!
