Strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such a flat and uninspired conversation. If a story is as personal as it was supposed to be for Sally Potter, would not you expect a little passion to appear in your performance? Her acting was completely detached and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which should have been ardent, given the nature of the dance, were, on the contrary, awkward and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story about a movie can be intimidating, and as such, Sally Potter would have been wise in allowing a better actor to take on the task instead of letting her passion fall victim to her own shyness.
