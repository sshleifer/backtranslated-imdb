We have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this film. Basically, the dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some strange old fart named Neweyes (which I needed after watching this movie). Apparently, Neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he must grant the desire of children that the dinosaurs be brought to modern times to be seen by all for blatant exploitation. Dinosaurs eat these things that make them smarter (Too bad the writers do not). By the way, does it seem strange that, of ALL the wishes of the children in the world, Neweyes grants the desire to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why not grant children's wishes to end hunger? Disease? War? I mean, come here! Neweyes has nothing better to do with all this power he has? Finally, when dinosaurs reach modern times, they begin to sing, dance and destroy chaos (basically the kind of thing you can see on a bad trip to LSD where else you could see a T-Rex playing golf and jumping in a balloon? of the Spider-Man?). They end up at the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) makes the children who made friends with the dinosaurs sign a blank contract. Because? Why would the children sign a blank contract? Screweyes says if the dinosaurs get some ... "Brain-Drain" That he'll let the kids go. The dinosaurs, instead of destroying the evil member Screweyes, yield and agree with its terms. What?! This is stupid! They could have just threatened him, made him quit the contract, eat, and then go out with the kids. I think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad, which is a moot point when dinosaurs finally escape and a lot of crows surround Screweyes and apparently eat it completely. Ah yes, this is not violent! We're back does not make sense, it's not fun, it's stupid, it's stupid, poorly written and contains some of the biggest holes ever made in movies. Even for a child's movie ... this is bad.
