!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> You would think that a story involving Archie Gray Owl - an Englishman posing as a red Indian - would have an enormous amount of humor involved. In fact, I would say that the only way to treat a film like this, in which a remarkable man runs counter to the credulous public, is to treat him as a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough commits something like a crime, making GRAY OWL a serious drama. Worse, he also made an extremely terrible film. Pierce Brosnan does not have the necessary charisma for the title role and the romantic subplot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau) has no on-screen chemistry. But to be fair to the cast, they did not help with the script that fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he is a Native American. The producers and writers made the big mistake of having the center of the film around the plot of Archie being an English - That's why I wrote "Possible spoiler", which in fact is not revealed until the end of the movie that character title is English but it is obvious that everyone who watched this movie knew that beforehand therefore there is absolutely no surprise involved. <br /> <br /> Yes I agree with everyone that the scenery is beautiful and that it has a deep ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first major environmentalist of the twentieth century, if truth be told. And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and possibly the two towers, if you want to classify it as a green message), there really was not a great ecological movie. In fact, most environmentally conscious films are a drug, and that includes GRAY OWL, a film that, unsurprisingly, had a serious problem finding a distributor.
