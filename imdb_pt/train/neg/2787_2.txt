By the story of the numbers of the Kid (Prince), a singer, on the way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apolonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife-beating father (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-defeating behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a theater in 1984. I was not a big fan of Prince, but I liked the three great songs in this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry ". The concert scenes in this movie are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately this is a VERY small portion of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is blatantly obvious and has been made many times - and much better too. The subplots are, to put well, badly treated. The love triangle between The Boy, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I really felt insulted. His wife beating the father is necessary for the story, but the scenes are so mismanaged (in acting and directing) that I could not believe it. The script is terrible - terrible dialogue and some really painful "comedy" routines. And there are tons of misogyny here - the boy's mother being beaten; The kid hits Appolonia and (no motive) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Also the characters of Williams and Princes treat women in a horrible way constantly. <br /> <br /> The acting is where this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but without an actor. And Prince is (quite easily) the worst actor I've ever seen. His blank face and wooden dialogue are so bad I could not believe it. This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes, but there are not really many. "Dramatic" scenes are so misinterpreted and manipulated that they make this film a difficult task. They should have made it just a concert movie. I give it 2 - just for the song.
