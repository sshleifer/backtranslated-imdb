I really liked ZB1. Really, I did. I have no problem with low budget movies, and I've been enjoying movies with worse production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing, check out 'wiseguys vs. zombies' if you're interested). In fact, I prefer low budget zombie movies because I suspect Hollywood directors do not understand what the zombies are about. <br /> <br /> But the ZB3 was so bad. He was retarded. I do not want to bother to be worthy of my criticism. I want my 90 minutes back, etc. Except it actually only took ~ 80 minutes because in the middle of the way I put in 1.4X fast. <br /> <br /> Ok, here are some reviews. <br /> 1. The pace was terrible. Everyone was talking about monologues. Even when someone had only a single line, working the camera, editing and inserting a handful of F-bombs into each sentence made the line look like a monologue. At first I was excited about the 90 minute time compared to ZB1's 70 minutes, but there were actually fewer 'events' on ZB3. It's all talking. <br /> <br /> 2. The bloody effects became more stupid. Just glop rubbed around people's tummy. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exposure, there really was not a plot. And the exhibition is really epic! I will not ruin it if you will watch. (Do not watch.) But then, it's just a bunch of idiot characters walking around and fighting for ~ 80 minutes. or less, if you prefer.
