The best I can say about this movie is that it was sometimes fun, and that was a proper time killer. Unfortunately, this movie is also so annoying that I wanted to slap these characters. This is the kind of movie that is so sweet it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but things get very tiring when the dialogue is so nauseating. When the two protagonists are not together on the screen, this really is not bad, but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to each other.
