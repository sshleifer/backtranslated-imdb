I had to watch this at school. And to summarize ... <br /> <br /> Talented actors, unsigned script and a director without talent. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. Do not watch the movie. Do not bother yourself. You will be so disappointed. My teacher said it should be good. How wrong she was. She even slept a little. The actors in the movie were bad. The best actor there was the old man and that does not mean much. It has a horrible plot with terrible characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say that it made no sense. The script was emotionless and confusing. There were points in the film when I furrowed my eyebrows and said, "What?" There were also many loose loops and entanglement holes. It was just awful.
