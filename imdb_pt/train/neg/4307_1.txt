Apparently meant to be a thriller from a movie ends up being almost laughable. This led me to exclaim "Oh my God!" more than once in the complicated plot plans that were just silly. <br /> <br /> Fancy or absurd places only by novelty or dramatic and improbable, almost impossible situations, human reactions and circumstances are too much to be understood as to why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to figure out how bad a picture can be, then you will want to see this. Otherwise, take some time to see a little paint dry for a more productive time investment! <br /> <br /> (That a film released in 2003 is already being shown on TV in July 2003 can give an indication of the quality of the film)
