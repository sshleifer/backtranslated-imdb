This movie was very promising. I was very excited about this movie. In the end, it was ridiculous at best, painful at worst. The acting styles varied from really, really, plans (the angels, the wife and the daughter) to the super animation (the character of Casper). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience, rather than real people trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the "bug" scene. It's practically an insult to the public's ability to figure things out. In defense of this scene, however, the biggest laugh of the entire film. I had read that they spent a lot of money traveling to various places abroad. Too bad they did not make use of it. I did not feel like I had been transported to exotic locations. Anyone could insert images of the Colosseum in Rome. However, to end on a positive note, I thought the sets were very good. I really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers. It's my opinion (and that's all) that if the SCHMALTZ factor had been much lower and the ACTION factor had increased a lot, that movie would have been good.
