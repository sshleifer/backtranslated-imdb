This is the kind of thing that only now thrills movie readers. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will let you know that the Real Men do not see anything from the Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if Truffaut had something to say here. The camera-as-voyeur motive was nothing new. Do we all forget De Sica's "Bicycle Thief"? Or anything about Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> So all we got was the extended metaphor of the young man like Truffaut, who spends all his free time "spoiling his eyes" on the cinema, which destroys school discipline and is accused. of plagiarism (the many petty thefts) and, ultimately, escapes the limits of society to make "his own film." Sorry ... I've been there, I've done this many times for this to matter.
