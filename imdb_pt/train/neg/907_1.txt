I wrote a review of this movie later after buying it on DVD and getting extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch it again after reading some of the comments made since then. Being a film student and making similar budgeted movies (ie no budget, filmed in digi cam), I stick to my original comments. This is a non-budget (and not particularly good) student project, released on video / dvd to look like an award-winning movie (if you read the cover). So, deceving the public into thinking it is something it is not. I want my money back under the description of trades! Complete trash!
