Forbidden Siren is based on the game Siren 2 Playstation 2 (so many 2s). As most video games turned out movies, I would say most do not translate into a different medium very well. And that, too, is painful. <br /> <br /> There is a long prologue that explains and defines the premise of the story, and the mysterious island in which a writer (Leo Morimoto) and his sons, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) Come and move. The villagers do not seem very friendly, and soon, good advice is given about the siren on the island, to stay home when the siren starts ringing. <br /> <br /> Natural and slowly, things start to go and our brothers go on a mission to find out exactly what is happening on this hostile island with their strange inhabitants. But in fact, you will not mind what is happening, as folklore and fairy tales are introduced to further drive the plot mad. What was really pushing her into the realm of bad comedy are her unintentionally misplaced-out-of-the-norm moments that only provoked lazy laughter into her sheer stupidity until it was explained much later. It's one thing to try to appear and present something clever, but another thing is to do it convincingly and with gaps covered. <br /> <br /> Despite having less than 90 minutes - I think it's a horror movie phenomenon having this as a benchmark runtime - it gives almost two hours of experience with its slow development to tell you what it wants. Things start to pick up in the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case of a little too late. <br /> <br /> What saves the movie is how it changes course and its revelation in the end. Again, this is a common device used to try to elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a bit extra, hoping to impress the audience. It happened quite satisfactorily, but leaves a bad taste as you will feel a bit cheated. There are two ways in which a turnaround will make you feel - either elevate the movie to a memorable level, or provide that sense of hypocrisy. Unfortunately the Forbidden Mermaid belonged more to the latter. <br /> <br /> The saving grace will be your cinematography with the use of light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be so explicit - still not worth it, so it is best to avoid this.
