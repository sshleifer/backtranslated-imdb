Do not spend your money or your time on this unfortunate piece of film under the guise of cinematography. When every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same performances dated from the past and have not evolved in their careers, leaves much to be said. I was expecting something better from award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The view that others may have of the Puerto Ricans will be irreversibly distorted by garbage like the Maldeamores. A rough word at a particular point in a movie can be used to emphasize a particular point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context (see Elsa and Fred, for example), but it should not permeate the plot. The film is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this movie.
