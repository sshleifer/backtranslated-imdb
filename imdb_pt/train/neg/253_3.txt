The premise of the film was explained and if you got here you do not make me pretend to be a movie critic. With that said, my take on the film is pretty low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike, but this happens in the category of his not-so-good work along with DOA 2 and 3, and a few others (many). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have a free pass because it is a Takashi movie and nothing that Takashi does may be wrong. This is a high school approach to filmmaking. For the rest of us we will find and hour and a half of a child screaming for no real reason completely boring (and yes, this takes the film), the rhythm of the movie almost reaching levels of rigomortis, and the acting ... well ... hmmm . <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Takashi, you will see him regardless of your interest. It lacks any originality (see endless history) or any character development of the main character in the face of a conflict that is not very superficial. As has already been pointed out, this is the first film in which Miike was credited as co-writer, but that does not mean much as not what we expect to be Miike's personality. on the screen. All we got was some of Miike's shots about the director of photography. <br /> <br /> The movie had the potential to be grandiose. The premise is not difficult to perform. But it seemed to have been thrown to the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that if you are joining the Miike, go with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then film in his works such as Harpa, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.
