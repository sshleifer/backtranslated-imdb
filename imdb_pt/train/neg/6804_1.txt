This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot seemed intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the last film, it somehow worked much better. The plot was drawn up in the worst possible way. Just some of the terrible moments of the movie, The stewardess is standing in the open door of a 747 flying and trying to close the door without being sucked in by the winds of 250 miles per hour ?? Subsequently, the aircraft lands a few miles from 8000 feet, this is impossible, even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When on the track (perfectly straight, of course) she is instructed to pull the tabs, HUH !! Come on the flaps are there to secure the lift at low speeds, while on the track you use the reverse thrust on the engines and gives maximum power! I can keep talking about small and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my answer would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
