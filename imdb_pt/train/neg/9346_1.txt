This movie was a yawn of credits, it's boring to the point of boredom and the acting is wood and blistering! Admittedly this was director Richard Jobson directing the premiere, but who on earth ignited a script as undeveloped as this? It looks like another government project down the drain (Scottish Screen is credited with surprise, surprise). I almost fell asleep three times and unfortunately my review will have to be more restrained than that. Please, Mr. Jobsson, what you've done before driving this film sedative, come back to it!
