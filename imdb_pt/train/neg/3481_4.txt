May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say this, but anyone experienced enough to read this will probably discover every plot from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that I liked. I did not hate this in the midst of some movies that insult his wit, but everything seemed very predictable on his way to the happy ending. There were funny bits along the way to make sure, but few were original. At least he did not go to the gutter. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks cool, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are, in fact, the only redeeming feature. All the others are a cardboard clipping, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who must have done it as a favor to someone else. <br /> <br /> In all, they are harmless, but not inspiring, 90 minutes.
