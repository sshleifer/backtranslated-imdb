I would give this film 5 instead of 3 if it was at least in time ... When I first saw it was exactly what you could expect from work that is based not on the artistic skills of the directors but on the idealist or I would rather say habits idiots from our government (from Kazakhstan) ... It's a shame, because 'Qazaqfil'm' was filming good movies when he was not honored by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but was actually ran by him. Movies like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. But after Aimanov's death, production of quality films declined almost drastically in 10 years, with few films produced. However, in the late 1980's 'Assa' was shot, it was a film about the first organized crime groups in the big country, a year later Mr Rashid Nugmanov filmed another film with the co-staring of the same actor / singer V .Tsoy At that time, he was already a Soviet / Russian rock legend - the movie called 'Igla' (The Needle or something) was completely new, somebody called that resurrection period or a new Kazakh movie wave. Unfortunately nowadays we do not have quality films, our directors record films about French and Japanese financial support and therefore the films are not for the public, but for professional critics, some of them have a price at international film festivals copyright. very few of them become products of business assets ... And, again, they return to our "nomads." Such films generally unpopular because of vast aspects. The same effects were with Nikita Mikhalkov's "Sibirski Cyrilnik" on the Russian czars, which were also filmed in parities with foreign partners, I think they were French or maybe British. Nobdy liked it, even in Russian public, became as a main theme of a comedians and comedy shows like 'KVN'. In my humble opinion
