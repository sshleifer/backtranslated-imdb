As a movie fan, White Noise was an absolute disappointment, as cinematographer the cinematography was very good, well lit, good camera work, reasonable direction. But as a movie, it looks as predictable as all the other horror movies that the market has been flooding lately. Although it has a bit of the "cold factor", the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) does not seem believable. This movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences, but it went ahead with them. The acting was far from impressing the main character did not portray any emotion, like many recent suspense / horror films. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not a movie that I will buy on DVD and I would not recommend that anyone rush to see it.
