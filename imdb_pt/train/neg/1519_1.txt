I only lasted 15 minutes before self-preservation pulled me out of the drooling blank-eyed stubble that this film easily induced and spurred me screaming back to the video store armed for the bear. <br /> <br /> To say that the movie was bad would be a missed opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the main keys on my keyboard (just to keep those comments clean). <br /> <br /> One to be avoided. <br /> <br />
