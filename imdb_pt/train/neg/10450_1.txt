This movie was the worst movie I've seen since "Date Movie". I was laughing the whole movie instead of being scared. It was funny how the snakes searched for a particular section of the passenger's body to attack, for example, the eye, the tongue, the butt, the breast. If we have seen a national geographic channel, we know that snakes do not stand in the body once they bite. For each particular scene, the snakes bit the passengers and stayed in the body biting the person. I believe the producer did not study his information about snakes and their behavior. I can not believe I lost my money in this movie. So I would not recommend this movie trust just wait until you are at the dollar theater or rent it.
