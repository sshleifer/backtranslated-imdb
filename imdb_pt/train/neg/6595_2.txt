I put this movie in the hotel room to entertain my kids the morning we were leaving to go home because I had stored all their toys. (Toddlers do not like to watch "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View.") My four-year-old found a funny scene, but I was told the rest was "too silly." This is a four year year, guys. Anyone over the age of nine, for example, will want to kill their television instead of letting it manifest. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie is bad is like saying that the Holocaust was a small mistake. There are no words to how ridiculous and absolutely terrible this "movie" really is. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically dull. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at the wickedness of the movie makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with some strange fake accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun, as far as I could tell), but all the characters are terrible. I did not watch a real Laurel and Hardy movie, but I know they had to be a lot better than that. What's the point of ruining a classic comic book pair with ... this? <br /> <br /> In short: junk. Avoid at all costs, unless you have some Bronson Pinchot fetish. 2/10
