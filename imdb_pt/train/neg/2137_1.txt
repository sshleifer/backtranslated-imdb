Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrible. It's hard to believe that anyone other than John Cusack would have invested money in it. With a series of anti-military / anti-war movies already being destroyed at the box office, it is almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would like to be associated with this screenplay. At first, it might have seemed like a politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (s) again. But only about 90 seconds after the movie, it becomes obvious that this is an untalented attempt at DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I liked so many Cusacks movies that I thought I would risk watching the DVD of that movie. I must say I do not know if Cusack is sensible enough for me to watch another movie starring him again, unless someone else can guarantee that. Cusack seems to be so irreparably hampered by his hatred for George Bush and the war in Iraq that he is willing to commit career suicide. Tom Cruise has never been close to being that far. Not even close.
