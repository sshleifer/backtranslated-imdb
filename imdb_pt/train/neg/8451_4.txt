I have to admit I enjoyed the first half of the Sleepers. It seemed good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge were interesting and moving. A top hollywood movie. But ... No one has mentioned this until now (at least in the last 20 comments), when he got to court scenes and Brat Pitt's character followed his plan to rescue his two friends, who are justly accused of murder, I felt mistaken. This movie insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning spoilers !! <br /> <br /> Why did anyone accept their false alibi, witnessed by the priest? If these two guys were with him, why should not they tell it during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were the judge or jury member, would you believe it? Is it wise to give the murderers motive? <br /> <br /> Sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and it pisses me off. This movie had great potential. 4/10
