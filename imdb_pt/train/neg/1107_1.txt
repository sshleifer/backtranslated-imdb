I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "Wonderful! This is going to be great!" I was so wrong. The story was all spoiled. Actually, I still do not get it. It seems to me that all the characters liked drinking, smoking (opium?) And having sex. Not that these are not good movie qualities, but please! Where was the story? I did finish the movie and yes, it was to the end, but by then the movie was almost finished. Rent it if you really want it. Just do not trust the back of the box.
