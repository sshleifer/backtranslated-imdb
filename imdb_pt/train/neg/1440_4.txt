Swayze does not make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; who grew up as my final hero in such films as the 1952 "Scaramouche", the 1952 Prisoner of Zenda and the 1950 King Solomon Mines; Patrick Swayze fails completely. Even Alan Quatermain's portrayal of Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was very good in a big flop. Also Alison Doody does not have the grace of Deborah Kerr in the lead role, and last but not least, the impressive Syriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very difficult for anyone to fill their shoes! For someone who was disappointed with the version of Richard Chamberlain in 1985, I recommend now if you can not get your hand on the version of the granger.
