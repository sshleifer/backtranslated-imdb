I see it on the science fiction channel now. It's so awful I can not stop watching! I'm a cameraman and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for someone associated with this movie. Some of the camera jobs are good. Most are very questionable. There are some decent actors in the film. Too bad they are surrounded by what must have been related to the director. That's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! The music was a bit better than acting. If you stick around to watch this I hope it is because there was absolutely no other option! The sequel (yes sequel) is coming now ... I think I'll skip this! Jason
