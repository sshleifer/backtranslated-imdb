This movie has to be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the film fools the public into thinking that perhaps there is hope. The plot of the movie is laughable at best, with the acting so poor you just have to shrink. The title "Zombie Nation" implies a treasure trove of zombies when, in fact, there are six in total. This can not be categorized as a horror movie due to the introduction of the cheesy music of the 80s when the zombies attack. The zombies really speak and act like humans in the movie, with the only difference being the makeup that looks like a La Roux video. If you have the chance to buy this movie, do it and save the copy.
