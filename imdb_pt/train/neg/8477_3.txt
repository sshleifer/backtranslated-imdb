I personally hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotyped, and the idea was a steal from "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly." <br /> <br /> The main character is a sulky girl who is sent to a place where she does not belong. The whole place hates her, and to make things worse, there's a hot guy who apparently does not like her (well, the whole school does not support you). Surprisingly, she finds a way to fit in and make everyone like her, and makes the guy fall madly in love with her. Then comes the choice, where she must choose between figure skating and hockey. She chooses to hockey, then she goes to the national figure skating and gets to be part of the Olympic team. No real surprise there. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was so predictable that you knew what would happen before you even saw it. It was so horrible that I almost threw up, and when I finished watching, I had a terrible headache and the urge to kill myself for watching that crap. Do not watch unless you're under ten, or really like bad tween movies.
