Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a psychiatric institution (even though she killed six people) and taken to the middle house Hope Bartholomew. Once there, she immediately falls back into her insane criminal ways and kills who gets between her and her food. MOLY SAGRADA! This movie sucks! You know you're in trouble when open credits start and are just credits from the first movie, apparently filmed on a TV screen. Nick Millard (under his pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel ten years later and on a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique style does not translate well into video. Seriously, I made home movies with more production value than that. And Millard tries to pull out a silent night, Deadly Night 2, filling half the runtime with footage from the first movie (which seems to have been taken from a VHS copy). Alden is again as good as Ethel, but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this crap. I mean, at least the first movie tried. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if at all possible), unstable camera work, awful audio and editing that seem to have been made with two connected VCRs. Avoid this at all costs!
