Some very interesting camera work and a story with a lot of potential. But this never comes together as anything more than a graduate student's thesis at film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. Fist, there is not a single nice character, not even a villain we can admire for his daring. Second, the whole performance is horrible - even veteran Willem DaFoe. Ham is so plentiful here, you feel like you're on a picnic - but one of those miserable company employee picnics where you drink a lot of cheap beer and get the hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat a hot dog barely past and vomit. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm being a bit rough with a young director who can still go places - like I said, camera work is very good. But I feel cheated - the synopsis of this movie suggests that we are going to watch a "modern western", and the DVD packaging has pictures that suggest that too - but no one really connected with the movie. do seems to know that this is the kind of movie they should be doing. <br /> <br /> This betrayal is what hurts; but even without that, the truth is that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed by the actors, the story is hopelessly confusing, and ultimately we just do not care. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD in half. but the rental company did not give me my money back. <br /> <br /> Now, it really hurts.
