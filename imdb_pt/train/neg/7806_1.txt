Poor Michael Madsen; he must be kicking himself to know what people have discovered about this horrible movie. I really can not think of anything worse than I've ever seen except amateur porn. It's so bad, and it's all here; wood acting, bad script, bad moral ending, you hate it and it's in this movie. <br /> <br /> My question is: "Who the hell put $$$ in this piece of doggy doo? At least we could have seen Michael's sister, Virginia, naked in a scene, but I do not think even that I'd save that damn thing ... <br /> <br /> For a cool guy who made some exceptional movies, I want to know what crazy church sponsored this piece of crapola.
