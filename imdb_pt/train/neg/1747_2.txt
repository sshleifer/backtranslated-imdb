It starts with a good grade just to quickly falter and lower expectations. <br /> <br /> The characters of Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) are not properly built before Mac's boss decides to pick him up with three stewardesses. . Rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations that sometimes seem forced. Over the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought he was wasted in the role of a moody cook. Akshay Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very bad still stumbles on furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only saving grace in the film. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is funny at times, but in all DUDs (the songs are boring) and a great discouragement, if you are waiting for some healthy entertainment and comedy.
