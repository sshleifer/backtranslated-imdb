Tierney is a tough, authentic guy, but this normally competent RKO movie flaw impairs its impact on every turn. The script is as plausible as OJ Simpson in a ten commandment dinner. Just count the times that Tierney's incredible car buddies swallow one ragged excuse after another for their evasive and violent deeds. The old clich√© about this "happening only in the movies" applies here in swords. Then there's the guy who plays the lookout, who seems to have come out of a drunken WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static sets of a room also do not help, nor does Feist's obvious lack of sensitivity to the material. Then add one last car chase without imagination and payment, and the results are quite simple. In fact, the film only appears in the scenes of the season, where tough cops uncover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney's career has never really consolidated. I understand that this was due in large part to the fact that he was as big a guy off-screen as in one of the others. Its chilled way and clarity of emotion reminds me in Lee Marvin's time on his toughest tough guy. Anyway, this project may have worked as a radio piece, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.
