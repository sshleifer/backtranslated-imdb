I could not even watch this movie until the end. I can not comment on the story because I did not watch the whole movie and the reason I could not watch it was because of the 'actors'. First of all, most of the time they just looked tough and I'm sure their scripts were in their hands off the board - but that's a minor problem. The main issue I have with the actors is not really their fault ... it's whoever the cast of this movie is! Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought throwing people with almost 30 years to play with teenagers would come out fashionably with the new wave? I can not watch a movie where one of the first lines, of a grown man older than me, is "I'm 17!" How can anyone take this seriously ????? Do not be a victim of this movie, go out for a 90 minute stroll and you will get much more than this movie could give.
