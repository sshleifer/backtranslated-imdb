After reading the first 5 comments about the IMDb, I was very enthusiastic about this movie. But it's really a horrible movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is suspense cheap), acting is at the top of the story, oh boy, what story? <br /> <br /> The story does not seem to go in one direction, first they catch the alien (after 7 years! they finally succeed), so they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (why the hell did they catch that?). So the girlfriend who is acting is the most exaggerated, wants to get away from this madness, and suddenly she does not, then again, she does and then she does not. So they come to the conclusion that killing the alien would kill the entire human race (and remember, in all those years, no other humans have seen these permanently established aliens) and what do they do? They torture and explode a lot of aliens into pieces. <br /> <br /> This is my first criticism of IMDb, I am a very lazy person who does not write very soon, so listen to my warning: move is not worth your time, do not watch this movie.
