"The house of the spirits" is horrible. I live in South America, in a country that has suffered a military dictatorship like the one the film tries to describe, and although everyone knows that movies may be far from reality, this particular movie treats viewers as ignorant and stupid. Things are not as simple and linear as they appear here, and of course the political process is much more complicated and interesting than the plot in "The House ...". If you can not show this complexity on the screen, it's best not to make a movie. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in the movies, without so many commonplaces. In some parts, I felt that Carmen Miranda may appear inside parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things, you should be not only careful, but respectful of the intelligence of your audience.
