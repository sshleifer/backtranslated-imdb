This almost horror movie follows a young girl when she returns to her childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell her family home and meet old friends. She thinks one of them, the village priestess's daughter, drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Already the bonds between the dead and the living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Unlike the horror films J, the suspense does not grow, the result does not seem excessively threatening and the end borders on the absurd. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a simple white rice baked a little long so that it is bordering the pasta. Sometimes you take this in poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too much. You end up eating because you need to with the meal because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice but almost spoils the meal because of the lack of tacky and gooey taste of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
