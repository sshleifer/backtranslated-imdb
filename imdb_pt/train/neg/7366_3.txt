What the F * @ # was this what I just watched? Steven STOP !! Please! This movie is insatiable and silly. In a bizarre game of action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now struggling (obviously) wishing-for-them-to-be vampires "like" superhuman force creatures. OK? Oh, and their eyes flicker in an inhuman way? Wow!! Even in this film, however, to stifle Seagals's ego-to-have-the-last-punch-and-not-a-can-kick-my-a-bit, it is somehow that they are. However, all ordinary humans are being crushed around him. Come on, I can understand the bully in the big mouth neighborhood or drug dealer, but these people are superhuman. Oh, and understand this, Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues, because apparently he and his colleagues in the movie think he's Wolverine! Oh my GO ... And worse than all of this! Yes, there is one worse than that. He has a voice that changes to the voice in the middle of the sentence while we are looking at his face. They obviously do not sound like him and I think he might be one of the other actors in the movie. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always watched a movie through to the end. This is an all time low even for his direct to Steven video films. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Two Thumbs Down! Qualities of redemption? Well, I think so, I'll be fair in that regard. At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses. The women all were very attractive IMO. Still, and I said still, it does not pay off the blatant X-Men, Underworld, (insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here) boot! Director, writer, producer, ALL should be bansihed and exiled from the cinema business. I think I feel the way most people feel about Blood Rayne (and almost every other Uwe Boll picture) about this movie. That's all my $ 1.00 in this movie. See if you dare.
