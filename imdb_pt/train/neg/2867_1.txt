I was lying in my bed with a very bad cold or the flu or whatever. I think maybe I would kill some time watching some horror movies that my mother bought for me a while ago. I wish I had never chosen this movie! After I watched, I felt even sicker and wanted to vomit. Afterwords (when I got better of course) did some research on Dennis L. Rader and noticed that Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real. I hope no one ever watches this movie but if they do not eat it or you will feel the way I felt after I watched it. I think you would have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3. At least this movie had better reviews on this site.
