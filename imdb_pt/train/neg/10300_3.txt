I'm a fan of artistic movies, but unfortunately I have to report this movie to be pretentious nonsense. Agonizingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, let's say, try. Even after bad movies, I feel I've learned something or enjoyed some aspect, but there was nothing to enjoy. The premise was not unattractive, but the film begins and ends there. The acting was good, although the characters were completely boring. For the protagonist aiming at such an audacious goal, it is very empty. Feather. I usually like non-formal movies, but the lack of formulas should not be confused with zero content.
