My original review of this movie was simply the written word 2000 times. Although this criticism was very accurate, I felt that my criticism should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the lead actress; her facial expression does not change once in this movie, she does not show fear, happiness or depression. Her body language skills are practically all about throwing her eyes to the left and right and it seems she does not know Jack. She is a bark without emotion that I think has too much botox. His lack of facial expression through the film is surpassed, however, by the regrettable love affair with the lead actor, who seems to come out of nowhere and makes them kiss on a beach and fall in love within a few hours of meeting each other . The lead actor, whose hair demands more attention than he, was mediocre at best and did not make me feel like I was genuinely in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that heads the hideous performance is the direction, plot and inaccuracies in the plot. I've seen ads for tampons with more structure than this movie. The development is not of character, they just seem to say and do things that I could never believe a real person would do. <br /> <br /> This movie would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap on purpose, like snakes on a plane, but it was trying very hard to be a serious action movie that I could not even laugh at. I believe I now have a brain tumor to watch this movie and think of all the different ways I could have used this budget and CG team to create something far superior. If I bought this on DVD, I would burn the DVD in pieces, burn it and then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for good measure. Do not watch this movie!
