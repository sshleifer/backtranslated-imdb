The fire of Saint Elmo has no influence on life after university (for most ordinary people, anyway). Why was this garbage made? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I'm really sorry the actors have to deal with such a terrible script. There are some talented young actors in this "movie" who have done a good job elsewhere. It must have been just a joke to them all on the set. <br /> <br /> I really found this "movie" insulting to my intelligence. The only joy I received from this was the hope that Sir John Hughes would have a good old laugh when he saw a showing of the same year that his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake I made while watching this because you like 80s movies. It's really offensive to the genre.
