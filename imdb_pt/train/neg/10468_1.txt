I did not know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. This was a truly horrible movie. The script, direction and acting were equally bad. The story was silly and stupid. The director might have made a clever and thought-provoking film, but he did not. I squirmed in my place for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the focus of the movie? Where was anything in this movie? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was poorly made and a waste of my money. I do not see this movie.
