Why did I never see or hear about this junk movie before? It's in my alley with a ridiculous betrayal, a laughable plot, and an irresistible 80's cheeseburger atmosphere prowling it. For some reason, no one is really interested, the staff and students of an elite Catholic university are massacred by an unknown psychopath. Newly hired teacher Julie Parker becomes involved when all the people with whom she has contact end up dead or behave strangely. This movie is hilariously bad! There is absolutely no logic or coherence and each character is equally meaningless to others. For example, there is a dead girl and her body thrown into a container. Then, for no reason, the story suddenly advances for three weeks, but the murdered girl is never mentioned or even lost. Not even her boyfriend! The acting is regrettable and there is not even a bit of nudity to enjoy. The killer's revelation is pretty funny because the creators really seemed convinced it was an original twist ... It's not, folks! "Splatter University" is easily one of the worst horror-turkeys of all time.
