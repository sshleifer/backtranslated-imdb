I do not usually go out of my way to write reviews, but for that I had to, just to alert anyone who might think that, seeing this, they will see a comedy. That does not come close. Although the premise (color change / genre / anything) is bad enough (and has been made better, often before), the actual transformation of two blacks into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever presented on screen . It would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white. However, the Wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you may have guessed, they fail completely. I've seen drag queens without makeup make women more convincing than these two do with the best special effects and make-up people Hollywood can provide. It's terrible. Add to the mix a basketball player built as a building, terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this movie reaches a new personal record. And I like bad movies! Avoid like the plague.
