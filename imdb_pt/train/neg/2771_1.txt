The film should be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the storyteller simply does not hold water. Something was definitely missing. In my opinion, people must have a reason why they observe it beyond the historical glimpse of the past. The accuracy of the story is not what we look for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film just does not have any substance. The only way to make this movie right was to somehow make changes in that it was some kind of legend rather than just a story. And a legend will have certain elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It is called the central theme. <br /> <br /> The movie can not answer, why would I watch anyway? At least some strange Legendary Flying Elephants, psychic king, or eccentric king as "The King and I" would have been adorable, something would have added greatly to the appeal of the films. I guess there was appeal beyond a simple vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once you get the call, history is the next thing we focus on. In terms of marketing, we call it "must see." Upon hearing the title of the film, people would say, "Oh, I need to see it." Now, where's the appeal at Kingmaker? Why not just redo the title and call it: "How not to be a king?" and make a black comedy of old Siamese times, in the style of "Dr. Strangelove." That would have been much more interesting. Narrative experiences of how the weaknesses of the king of the first people would have made the film extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Most movies today have this "must see" appeal, like Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they do not have familiar characters, a few other films like The Island have had an appeal when the advertisement asks, "Do you still believe there's an island?" <br /> <br /> Or for the movie, entitled "How NOT to Be a King," you may ask the question, "So, do you still want to be a king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
