The play is not great to begin with, and the decision to transfer it to the film does not favor - especially since Peploe does not decide how she wants to deal with the theatrical origins of the material (we get occasional looks from an observer theater audience, etc.). ) and decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is meant to remind you that you are watching a movie, whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very bad movie of a director who is overloaded by her material.
