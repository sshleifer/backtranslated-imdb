"Damsel in Distress" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's best musicals. But even the bad films of Astaire have always had some good times. In "Damsel," Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (Joan Fontaine, 19), a handsome English heiress who jumps into the back of a taxi he is taking to escape a crowd of admirers. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from his family's country home, but soon discovers that the house staff is making bets in which the suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the rude boy, each take turns helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to ensure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> Musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful and annoying. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless and annoying scenes of (a) Fred dating Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert plotting against them and with each other. <br /> <br /> The house butler and boy are especially annoying. They are one-dimensional characters of the villain, the kind of person you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster bridesmaid in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little in her favor, in terms of character, plus her beautiful face and handsome smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are together for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his secretary. The duo adds an extremely necessary chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she's also boring at times. <br /> <br /> The direction of George Stevens' film is not well made. Sometimes cinematography is horrible and out of focus. There are a series of outdoor scenes in extremely cloudy streets, to try to convince the public that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, George and Ira Gershwin's songs are great and have become classic music standards. And of course the dance in the film is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and her choreographer, Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But the musical and dance numbers are misused and poorly staged. Sometimes the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers appear randomly inserted in the winding plot. (At one point, the butler leaves the mansion and enters a solo operetta for no clear reason.) The numbers include:  "I'm dancing and I can not bother now" - Fred dances well in a traffic-filled foggy street from London. He makes a great "whirl of cane" with a rolled umbrella - but the number ends very early when Fred jumps on a two-story bus that passes by. (On the Broadway musical, "Crazy For You," Harry Groener made a much better version of that number with a group of chorus players.) "Put Me To The Test" - Fred, George and Gracie do a trio of tap-dancing in an English cottage. George and Gracie combine with Fred step by step, but the number ends badly with everyone kicking each other for no reason. <br /> <br /> "Stiff Upper Lip" - In a fun amusement park house, Fred, George and Gracie have fun dancing on the spinning floor, turning the barrel and the mirrors of the Fun house. It's the best number in the movie, but sometimes it gets a bit repetitive. <br /> <br /> "Things are getting better" - Fred and Joan Fontaine do their dance number together in the movie, poking around the back woods of the country's stately estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer. <br /> <br /> "A foggy day in the city of London" - Fred wanders through the misty grounds of the mansion at night, singing about the foggy day. when he met Joan in London. At times, it seems that he is not sure where to go in the fog - much like the musical number itself. "Good work if you can" - A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the mansion, Fred is dragged into a chorus of tied-faced singers who are singing this song at random. Each time Fred joins, the other singers look at him as if they want to leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with that song in "Crazy For You").  "Drum Dance Number" - As Fred and Joan are fleeing, Fred has to stop and make one last number tapping while beating a group of drums. As usual, it's a great number of dancing. But there is absolutely no need for this except to prolong the film. <br /> <br /> The most planned moment of the film comes when Fred decides to jump off a tall stone counter at the country estate to prove his love. to Joan Fontaine. When he jumps off the porch, he finds a trapeze conveniently placed - that's right, a trapeze - hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth having on DVD just for the dance numbers but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >> FF button lets you scroll through the other boring scenes in the movie to get to the dance numbers.
