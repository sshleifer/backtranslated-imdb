This movie is a huge steaming pile. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why anyone felt that the Garland / Mason version needed to be redone, or why Striesand would have been the first choice to star. <br /> <br /> For this question, I have no idea why our (gay-American) people tend to regard Striesand as some kind of treasure. At least in my opinion, she had reached the peak professionally with Funny Girl and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the Judy classic, or even the original (a great movie by itself), but please, please skip this stinkpot!
