This movie begins to present an idea somehow original, but it became a great frustration later. What's the deal having an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a clich√© plot? The film itself is very unbelievable. I'd like to know exactly how someone walks into a clinic, gets a nurse's outfit, kills a doctor, takes a patient in his bed, puts it in his Chevy truck, and leaves? I guess no one could answer that question, so they just jumped into the other scene hiding those little details. The performances are simply bad. The villain is just another "annoying mad antagonist," with no depth, totally linear character. After 20 minutes of film, most of the scenes are unbelievable, it looked like they were put there just because of the 90 minutes since they were totally unnecessary. Does a doctor see a woman clearly under heavy medication, are you denied to examine her, expelled from the house, and just quiet? The final scene made me laugh, only Mickey Mouse could make it more out of the reality. I'm giving 2 out of 10 for the first let's say 10 minutes of film.
