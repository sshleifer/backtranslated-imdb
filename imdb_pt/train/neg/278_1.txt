I'm trying to imagine the tone of Dark Angel. "I'm thinking of the Matrix, I'm thinking of Bladerunner, I'm thinking that the girl who plays Faith in Angel, wearing a shiny black leather - or some girl like her, just leave it with us.Just - get it! it's not just any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just a few high bangs and a sexy shiny black leather mounted on a big throbbing bike. "Fanboys dig high and hot bangs in shiny black leather covering big throbbing bikes, right? <br /> <br /> Bright, shallow, dark, stereotyped, without passion, tedious, monotonous, stupid, humorless, disconnected, not competent. Anime live action without any action, or even any life. SF the way Joe Fanboy really does. :(
