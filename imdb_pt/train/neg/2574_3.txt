I know movies should not necessarily mirror reality, but this one got on my nerves. It perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. The "psycho mom" thing has been done many times before (and usually done better) and much of the rest of the plot is also exaggerated. The acting was not horrible, but nothing spectacular. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the highlights: Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you can ignore the false psychoanalytic part of it, just as a person must suspend reality / judgment while watching many films, then this movie may be tolerable. If you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I spent my time watching.
