Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt to imagine Scooby-Doo and company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is raucous and does not sound like something he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of Scooby show. They also changed the clothes and the classic way of walking from the original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what they're still doing with the villain's angle, but it's certainly not following the path. formula used in any of Scooby's previous shows. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like that, but it's not really Scooby-Doo-like animation. But the strange animation used for other WB shows has grown in me; this may also be worth it. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look - once - if you can handle Shaggy's lack of adequate voice. That's enough to convince someone to enjoy the show properly. Besides, I'm trying not to be an inflexible and inflexible fan. Evolve or die, as the saying goes. Let's see how it goes after two more episodes - until then I will have a much more solid opinion.
