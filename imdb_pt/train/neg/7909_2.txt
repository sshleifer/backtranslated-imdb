Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> this movie wins 7 out of 10. It has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in years. not only was the acting incredibly bad, as the plot (if you can call it that) was just as bad. Of course everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during the moment. This, however, is not the case. There is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the two main actors. Unfortunately it was a waste of my time and certainly a waste of my money. <br /> <br /> and 2 of simply trying
