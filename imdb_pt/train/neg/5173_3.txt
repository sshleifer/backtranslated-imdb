When I saw this in a store, I thought it looked very nice and original. Like Wolfs Creek meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and I mean it cost only three pounds (about $ 6). To be honest, I do not think it was worth it. It seemed the directors - the 'butcher brothers' could not decide whether they wanted to make an artistic kind of terror or a bloody slasher. Horror. It ended with a sadistic hour and 15 minutes with all the characters being one-dimensional and you could not care less about what happened to them, but to try to make the audience care about the characters, they added a useless monologue at the end. and the beginning of the movie that to be perfectly honest was not necessary. <br /> <br /> The only good part really was the middle / end - I will not ruin everything for you. But that was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> In general, a clock without meaning. It looked like a two-hour movie, but it was actually only 75 minutes. If you want an artistic film, do not bother. If you want a horror movie - do not bother - The movie moves so slowly that nothing happens.
