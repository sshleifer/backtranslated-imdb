The Nutcracker has always been a troublesome ballet. It bears little resemblance to the original story of ETA Hoffman on which it is based. <br /> <br /> In ballet, history is essentially finished in the second half, when Clara (or Marie, in this version) travels to the Kingdom. of Sweets to watch a series of character dances. <br /> <br /> There is an endless variety of theatrical productions that reinterpret the story in countless ways (not always successfully) to make up for the ballet's faint libretto. <br /> <br /> Balanchine's version has no sense of drama or history (despite the fact that there is so much drama and mystery in Tchaikovsky's wonderful first-act music). The result is a completely forgettable Christmas party in the first half, where almost nothing happens and where even the dance (what little there is) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> The pantomime over-action, particularly of Drosselmeier, who may seem passable on stage, just seems silly filmed for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things are not much better when we get to the Kingdom of Candy (Act II on stage version). While there are some choreographic highlights, most choreography is bland and uninspired. That certainly is not vintage Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I always felt that he had less success as a creator of narrative ballet. Watching this cinematic version of his theatrical production of The Nutcracker only reaffirmed this view.
