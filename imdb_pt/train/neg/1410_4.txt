A still-famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not filmed for four years. When he is invited to participate in a new project, he asks the director's clumsy cousin to drop him off in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to research the work of a small supermarket manager. He sees the beautiful Spanish box Scarlet (Paz Vega) and he draws with his skill. His driver never comes back to get him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor. But first she has a job interview for the post of secretary at a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared; so they spend the afternoon together having a nice time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the useless "10 items or less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget movie does not seem to have a plot, and is backed by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and, in fact, nothing happens over the course of 82 minutes. The open and ambiguous conclusion is simply ridiculous, with the Morgan Freeman character returning to his world of silver spoon and telling the simple worker they would never see each other again. Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy her perfect world with her family? Or was it a clash of classes, and does he realize that his upscale neighborhood would not be suitable for a simple worker of the lower classes? My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "An Astro in My Life" ("A Star in My Life")
