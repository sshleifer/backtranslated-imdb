There are only two movies that I would give a 1/10 to this stink and "The man who fell to the ground." I remember seeing the protocol in a theater in the early 80's when I was in high school. The script insults the intelligence of anyone (including a high school student). He completely lost me with the "hillarious" joke of someone being shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn must be charming, but she looks kind of insipid and dumb. Then there are offensive stereotypes about the Arabs, followed by Goldie conquering everyone for gushing populist dribbling. The performance was terrible, including that of Goldie Hawn. I could not bear to see another movie where she was even IMO, she redeemed herself in Everyone says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put any effort into writing the script. Worse.
