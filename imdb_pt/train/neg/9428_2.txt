I usually do not have time to make comments that few people will read about movies that few summer. However, in this case, I feel I should caution all those who may consider wasting time on this. I just watched it five minutes ago. This is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, a plot is non-existent and the production values ​​are, at best, levels of poverty. I know even a low-budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only one thing that could have saved this movie for the purposes of any horror fan - more gore and slashing on the screen! The overall three times this occurs is off screen. While effective and reasonably disturbing when this happens - especially the final scene - it just is not enough. The film is too long for its minimal content, also for heavy dialogue and therefore almost impossible to see. What happens? To summarize everything, with three quarters to spare, three teenage girls, irresponsibly and conscientiously, drive through a secluded area where more than 20 girls were kidnapped and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks, and they are taken to an old flat house, inhabited by three crazy people - one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three end up being killed, one by one, off the screen, after what seems like an eternity of nonsense, a slow-paced absurdity. Like I said, the only things worth watching, even once, are the murders. Please do not buy or rent just for this, and do not be fooled like I was by the misleading description of the art box and the movie. Save your money and your time.
