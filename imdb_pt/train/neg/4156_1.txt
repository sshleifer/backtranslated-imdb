Yes, this movie is bad. Worst of all is that it takes no advantage of its own title !! In the movie WHOLE, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. Also, we're never sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One could argue that they were trying to "soften" or make it "realistic", but it ends up being boring. More than half of this movie happens in a car. The scenes that happen anywhere else are not too much to brag about. Also, there is no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what actually happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I will say that for a film with low production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with an original score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /> <br /> I'm all for independent films, but it seems like this was never planned for a mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "Worse than the Scarecrow Slayer."
