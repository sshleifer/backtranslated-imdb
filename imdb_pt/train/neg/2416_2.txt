2 stars, and I'm being generous. (smaller spoilers) Look, this is a low-budget zombie movie at Oakland Gangland. As the plot goes, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive-by. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie: what zombies?! All "zombies" growls (which does not sound even remotely scary) and trickle red blood from their mouths! No scary eyes, no decaying flesh, just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the entire movie, so it's not as if the whole "hood" were plagued with zombies or anything, are just a few, and it's contained in no time. <br /> <br /> The acting really is so bad that it's hilarious. No one can act in this movie (except maybe one of the gang members) and it seems like a lot of friends got together, decided to climb their family and made a movie over a weekend. <br /> <br /> Final Note: Since when do doctors wear training suits? Skip this one, please!
