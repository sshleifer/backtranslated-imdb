SICK. really means so incredibly bad I killed myself. There was absolutely no performance to speak. The best part of all the production was the artwork on the front cover. The budget for this movie was enough. The filming was sub sesame street. The production looks like that of underground footage for the Mafia hits. The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable that you should move on to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book out there for this movie, I'm sure it's better. I would avoid this at all costs. I liked the intimate scenes that made the whole movie worth it. just kidding.
