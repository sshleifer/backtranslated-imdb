This was a popular movie, probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character that silences all the talkers, etc. Funny is that you probably could not make a movie with this title if you replaced anyone but "white" like anything else would be considered racist by PC police. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good, if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main colleague, Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> Snipes had many funny lines, providing a lot of humor. The bad part of the movie - which does not bother many people - is the extreme desecration here and the sloppiness of all the characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean and cool people in this movie. For this reason, I can not honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or to those who are offended with much
