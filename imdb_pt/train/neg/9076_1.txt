This was certainly the dumbest, most crude and repulsive film I've seen in a while. I was tempted to turn off the VCR, but, as in the fascination I witnessed in a terrible car accident, I literally found it COMPULSELY HATEABLE in every conceivable way and carried it to the end. I am by no means a prude who objects to the comic portrait of the sexual antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, There's something about Mary, both American Pie movies, and even the notorious Freddy Got Fingered which I found very enjoyable in its own raw terms. Mamie Van Doren's sponge bath is the most horrifying appearance of naked geriatrics since The Shining. Untoldly edited and filmed, with incredibly annoying performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended, without the benefit of having made me laugh once. The only useful purpose for the film is as a didactic example of how not to make a gross image. Oh, and it would also serve well as a lawn fertilizer.
