In a summer that also prided itself on disgusting smugglers like Snakes on a Plane and The Da Vinci Code, that's a pretty bold statement. But I still do it anyway. Superman Returns, like King Kong 6 months ago, is too long, hyper-indulgent, and CGI to the eye. My God, this thing is making my head. <br /> <br /> Richard Donner had the idea of ​​'keeping real' for his 2 rides. And I think his approach to special and optical effects is the most appropriate. Brian Singer bombards us with so much CGI that it really takes you out of the story and constantly remembers that you're watching a wannabe blockbuster who thinks the only way to impress an audience is to spend $ 250 million (a totally irresponsible amount of money). ) about unpleasant visual effects that do not match the hype. We have seen everything and have been everywhere the CGI can take us. There is no real atmosphere or involvement in it. And for a movie that's 95% made of that crap ... well, you figure it out. <br /> <br /> I've read so many fanboys reviews about how the movie has' soul 'or' soul 'a human heart' or 'loving moments of character.' "We've had sullen superheroes screaming Silently "you would love me if you knew who I am" dozens of times in recent years and SR offers absolutely nothing new in that regard. America's land mass was already made in the first movie! And well ... this is your lot! It's amazing that they managed to extract this garbage for 2.5 painful hours! But Brandon Routh has the on-screen persona of a mahogany hat, Kate Bosworth is completely unconvincing as a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, James Marsden is 250% wood as usual and Kevin Spacey really needs to fire his agent or where some better judgment. The only cast member I enjoyed was the lovely Parker Posey. But I like strange girls. <br /> <br /> Every year, movies like this get bigger and more bombastic. Very soon we will have $ 300 million movies. The studios need to realize that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up. For all the money that Warner spent on this pile of shit, for all the features this movie cost to make ... was it worth it? In my opinion, certainly not! This junk put me Superman for life!
