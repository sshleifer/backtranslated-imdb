I spent eight years directing cinemas in the 80's and 90's. This was by far the worst movie I've ever shown to audiences. One thing that made him so bad was that he ventured to try to be a great inspirational film. Even the great Gregory Peck could not save this horrible piece of idiot from being much less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis, in a non-terrorist role at the outset, clearly demonstrated that she had not yet learned to act (she's still trying, but it's not getting much better). <br /> <br /> And here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament will never happen just because it makes kids afraid to play league baseball! Even the shows on Nick and the Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe in that drug. <br /> <br /> This is not worth the time you would spend watching it on cable. Not worth the price of a movie rental; your dollar would be better spent on an extra packet of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you chose (because it can only be better than that).
