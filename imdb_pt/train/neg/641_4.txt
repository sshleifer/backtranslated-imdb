To my knowledge, the Largo winch was a famous Belgian comic strip (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a kind of James Bond without spy life! So when I had to choose a movie for a 5 year old kid, I got him because the kid was already a big James Bond fan! <br /> <br /> But right after the opening credits, I have heavy doubts: when American movies offer an incredible start here, no action and a hot sex scene ?? So, the story gets very complicated with financial movements? I thought I had lost the boy. <br /> <br /> But strangely, he had been caught by the Largo, and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was it the excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship that Largo has with his father? The story of the multiple box in which the friends are the bandits, the bandits are the friends? The exotic places of Honk-Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /> <br /> I do not know, but he really cares about Largo ("will he get up?") and we enjoy our moment.
