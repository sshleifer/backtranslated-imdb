I got this DVD from the Dollar Store. The DVD was in the rack from $ 2 to $ 1, but as Michael Madsen had, I thought that since I'd never seen the movie, I bought it anyway. <br /> <br /> I must say that I did not. I do not like the movie. The film played more like a documentary or a religion ad than anything else. I discovered that the use of flashbacks by the director did not contribute to the story. I'd rather see the story line in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not throw it away as one of the other commentators, but it may take a while until I consider watching this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since it was the premiere of Michael Madsen's movie, maybe it might have some archival value at some future date.
