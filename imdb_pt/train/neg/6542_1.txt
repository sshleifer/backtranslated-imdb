The person who wrote the brilliant review of this misconceived project must be related to the writer / director / star - or is it really the same person who defies rational thinking that this film would be appealing to anyone who was not attached to a circle tightly woven inside. How about now? You want to make a movie - tell a story; entertain; draw me with living characters. Of course, you can do it artistically without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. However, do not approach elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the public is in a continuous struggle to capture tiny narrative threads. If I want to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread, make the concrete fabric easier to buy.
