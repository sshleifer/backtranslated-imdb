This film is based on John Fante's novel. Could someone tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this beautiful book should be adapted in this way. If you want to do a romantic and melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, then how could you make a connection with Ask The Dust? "And if you wanted to do that story in a movie, then why would you want to do a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek?" I did not understand. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the story is poorly made, and if you read the book and liked it, I'm pretty sure you will not like what Towne did with it. . <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie you might find the cast, the acting poor and the film a little overdone. But you expect the best. I really expected a lot during this movie. I really wanted it to be good. But it only gets worse, and it's that simple: whether you read Fantes' novel or not, this is not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with poor performance, lack of structure and - of course - many naked butt photos of Colin Farells. <br /> <br /> I could complain a lot more about this movie, but why waste my time. I saw that. It's all right. I had to see it because I really like the book and I was curious. And I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is for Colin's little mustache at the end of the movie. So sweet ... If he had used it all the time, I'd give it 2/10.
