Completing the 1929-30 release schedule "Our Gang", "A Tough Winter" features two stories. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, alone on a winter day, decide to do something. Little Wheezer relays the instructions to Mary Ann from a radio program. The problem: Wheezer relays information from different programs and Mary Ann ends up putting soap into the mix! Funny moments happen when the rest of the class appears to pull the caramel - and end up staying all over the house! <br /> <br /> The second plot deals with Stepin Fetchit, a Gang's neighbor / do-well, and his interactions with the Gang. <br /> <br /> "A Tough Winter," to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available in home video. The reason for this is the characterization Stepin Fetchit, which shows a clever, cunning and slow character. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit "skilful comic" and used the entry "Our Gang" to pilot a Fetchit comedy series that has never seen the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film was filed. <br /> <br /> While there are some funny moments with both Fetchit and the idiot, "A Tough Winter" is hard work. sinuous effort. If a positive came out of this movie, it was that Hal Roach Studios grew up confident and experienced in making talkies. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film partly paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 films "Our Gang." <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
