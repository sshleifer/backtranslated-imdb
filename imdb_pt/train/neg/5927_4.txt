I'm a very politically clean guy, so when I say sexist I really mean that this has reduced the female lead guest, Dr. Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. Despite all his brilliance and self-control, nothing more than a big and jealous irrational baby. You've gotten the plot now, after your technical partner, Marvik, also a rejected lover, fills you up when he tries to kill the Medusan. , Ambassador Kollos, out of an envious rage, but glimpsed first in his place. (You think he might have just walked into the room with his eyes closed and moved the box, very easy), it takes the Enterprise to an unseaworthy space outside the galaxy before the boys could subdue it. Well, the ship is stuck in limbo, at which point they could have gone to the good doctor-interlocutor and discussed it. "Spock has to make a mind merge with Medusan so we can get home. I mean, how do you want to stay until you run out of supplies and die?" But the lady of the true Star Trek fashion is a jealous monster who complains and groans when the idea is approached, even when her Medusan idol told her to shut up and go along with them. So the beetch out of spite mess the Spock mingled, making him forget to put the visor on, which makes Spock go crazy. Kirk, of course, discovered how much she was and shamed her to fix Spock with her superior telepathic powers. Of course, in the end the Lady and Medusan leave and everything is forgiven. You almost wish that the President of the Star Galactica Battle appears to release the witch from an airlock for his destructive blow. But in Star Trek land, ladies can be totally irrational and cruel, but at the same time, supposedly, there is sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist.
