A Christmas story is a classic holiday and my favorite movie. So of course, I was thrilled when this movie came out in 1994. I saw the opening day and was prepared to have fun. I Left Revolted And Digusted. The anticipation that Rang True in a Christmas story is curiously missing out on this mess. A red Ryder BB Gun is better to get than a Chinese top. And it's not very funny at all. Charles Grodin is good, but the buck stops. In short: 1 star. Do not bother yourself.
