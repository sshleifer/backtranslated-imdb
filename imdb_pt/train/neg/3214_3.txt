First of all, I'd like to tell you that I like comics, anime, animations, and the like. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I will be objective. To start the story, fine. It follows the story line of comics as far as I'm familiar with them. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be so much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and keep the original cartoon-style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightning, you can tell that the film is made about 10 years ago and more. It looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, for example - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks so much better! In addition, the talents of voice do nothing extraordinary, the music is nothing special. So, after all - lack atmosphere. I watched, but I can not say I really liked it. It just does not catch you. There's a lot of blood and violence, but that does not impress me. It may be shocking to someone who has never seen more adult-oriented animations and see animated blood for the first time (is anyone around?), But I do not think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add a bit of nudity and temper it. The puppies around Lucifer were pretty good, and hell, we got Lady Death herself! There are few sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all - the movie is not that bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Fire and Ice or Ralph Bakshi's Wizards. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
