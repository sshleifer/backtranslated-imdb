Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I'm happy to see any of their movies. Basically, a man in a horned factory is the room to break, and soon Ollie cracks with all the honking noises. He's resting at home with Stan by his side, needing silence, and the Doctor's phones (James Finlayson) to say he's coming to check Ollie. After realizing that the plumbing and electricity are in the way of a cross-eyed repairman, the doctor checks up and, after some tests, he recommends drinking goat's milk and taking some sea air in the ocean. After Stan practices trumpet, hanging from the window by telephone wire and a car accident, he and Ollie arrive at a quay to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat, and Stan brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the front page of the paper says that Killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) has escaped, and he enters the boys' boat while they sleep, and the goat chews through the boat rope, heading for the sea. In the morning, they see their location, and the Killer leaves for something to eat, and he sees Stan and Ollie making fake food, eg. rope for spaghetti, cheese soap, belt for bacon, sponge for meatballs and forces them to eat it. When Ollie starts to choke on something, Stan blows the trumpet to help, and Ollie's anger causes him to kill the Assassin, and continues until the police arrive, only to have Ollie's anger putting them in jail as well. There were the fewest moments of comedy, but it's not a great black and white movie. "Well, here's another cool mess you got me into!" was number 60 in 100 Years, 100 Quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 in The Comedians' Comedian. OK!
