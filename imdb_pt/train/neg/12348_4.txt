This movie is very much like "Flashdance", you know the dance movie with Jennifer Beals. This movie is probably the most annoying movie I've ever seen since it's not bad enough to be funny. "GI Jane" is a lot better than that movie, but that does not say much. Here Demi Moore transpires a lot and there's loud music and we get to see her fight and everything, but it's certainly not very engaging. I really think the idea behind the film is interesting, but the script is very clich√© and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, like I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
