Put blame on executive producer Wes Craven and Weinsteins financiers for this big budget failure: an update on "Dracula," with a condescending verbal jab in Bram Stoker (who probably would not like his name on this thing anyway and nothing too much for the rest of us except for slasher and gore bumps.Christopher Plummer seems breathless like Van Helsing in the modern day - not just a descendant of Van Helsing, but the real thing, he continues with leeches obtained from the corpse of Count Dracula, which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing's vault and taken to New Orleans.This is exactly what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well produced but without a single original idea (except for multi- racial), is both repulsive and lazy, and after about an hour begins to repeat itself.
