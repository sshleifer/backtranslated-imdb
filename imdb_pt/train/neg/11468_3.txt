I do not know who got the idea that orcas walk around killing people and beating and destroying things for revenge, but my god is absurd. Orcas are definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes them be ... it's silly. Orcas are extremely intelligent, do not get me wrong, but I very much doubt that they know and understand a concept like revenge. So I have to say that all I got out of this movie was the entertainment of how absurd it was. So I was at least a little amused by that. Personally, I recommend going and seeing Jaws if you are wanting to see a kind of Human-Matador-Human movie. But if you're like me and want to laugh at something so far from realism, then I'd say go ahead. : D
