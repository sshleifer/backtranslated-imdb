The rural family drama - perhaps with a nod to "Ordinary People" - concerns a boy who retracts after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting accident. Despite the pessimistic subject (given the ruthless treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story that are worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and reluctance of adult characters to take care of the situation make the film a stunting experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the film is almost a small reunion of "The Natural". Too bad that this project did not get the talent needed behind the camera to really take an exciting and memorable photo. * 1/2 of ****
