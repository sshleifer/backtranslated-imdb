This focuses on non-ironic notions of facing guilt. <br /> <br /> Merrill rebukes the disturbed boy to stop his 'whining' about Rennie's death. Old style real men in action, here. <br /> <br /> The model airplane and the car accident must have been impressive on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The narrative itself, despite the flashback sequences, plays in a straight line - all the narrators are trusted by us (regardless of the "truth" or "untruth" of the dialogue), so there is no play with the viewer on the narrative structure. This would become a basic model for future recounts, such as "Fearless." <br /> <br /> So all we have left is individual performance, and at that level, it's best for Wynn's joke, a virtual man show.
