This is a little better than the first. It still depends a lot on your mood, which basically goes on to say that Bond's old movies were not realistic. This wears off after so many parodies. The girls were more interesting in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is a tremendous amount of total gross humor. I hope one day the real comedy comes back.
