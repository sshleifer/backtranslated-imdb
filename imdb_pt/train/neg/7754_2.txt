Spoilers will be on it. The movie could have been better if they had a different script, director and CGI provider. Not too sure? The movie has a man starting his own theme park ... err ... zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs ... err ... and Sabreeths is called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I do not care about the robberies, because there are no original ideas for this kind of movie, but this one just patted his face, and even the "dark head of the creature in the design." The Sabretooths, which are not sabretooths according to Mr. Primal Park, are quite addicted, but the crowning achievement is what I call "Sloggy". Because, after discarding a big cat, a hero relaxes a little because there is only one left. He enters the strange face of the food that says, Nah, we made three, the third is a monster that creeps with the front feet. Great, groovy. A group of college students is also on the island for a hunt, there test to get their frat clicks or sort (I always thought I needed a short nickname). Of the living, only one completed his task, so I had fun with it. Ah yes, the compulsion of the "Evil Capitalist Must Die" is in effect with not one but two of them! Mr. Primal Park's death is the most laughable thing you'll see in one of these movies, like the jars of a statue of loose saber teeth (Courtesy of Sloggy), shrinks a few sizes and impales the man down the throat. If I had just run away so easy. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
