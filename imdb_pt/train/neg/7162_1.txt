This movie takes what could have been a good idea, a mummified witch of 2000 years and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry. They will stay with her Nan and Uncle. The uncle discovered a 2000 year old witch preserved in peat. He revives her and she takes the form of Nora. It can not be conventionally killed (more is worth it). Nora, however, works a way to do it. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror movie that was made on the cheap. It's a huge mess. I have to wonder why anyone would want to make such a bad movie. I'm tempted to learn witchcraft to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL THE COSTS
