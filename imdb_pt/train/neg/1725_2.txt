- The movie starts with a meteor hitting a lake. Unbeknownst to locals, a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake. The meteor warms the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed it, the egg hides releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the community. <br /> <br /> What an absolute rubbish. It's not that I care about the stop-motion clay dinosaur, it's all about the movie that bothers me. The acting is atrocious. The dialogue is totally ridiculous. The comic relief is anything but comical. The logic is non-existent. Any similarity between the "scientists" in this film and a real scientist is mere coincidence. I could continue for an eternity in the bad aspects of this movie, but you get it. I feel it's safe enough to call this "MST3K Worthy" disaster.
