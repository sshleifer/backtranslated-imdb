Often voted for China's biggest movie of all time by Chinese critics as well as Chinese cinema enthusiasts from abroad, and frankly I do not understand any of this. What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable, directed and acted smoothly, with a complete megera for a protagonist. Wei Wei (does not laugh) is that shrew, a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband (Yu Shi) in recent years. It is after World War II, and they live with her husband's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated house with little money (the man was wealthy when they married). Along comes the husband's old best friend (Wei Li), who also used to be his wife's boyfriend when they were teenagers. She considers escaping from her husband with this man, while the husband practically remains indifferent, thinking that he can involve his little sister with his friend. This is the set-up, and it's not going anywhere you would not expect. I actually saw the remake, directed by the director of Blue Kite Zhuangzhuang Tian. It lasts half an hour longer, and it's kind of annoying, too, but at least it was cute. This supposed classic is intolerable.
