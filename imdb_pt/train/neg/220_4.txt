"The Crush" is a delightful 40-year movie for the first two-thirds or more as it tries to be a Brit "Sex and the City." <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the turn of the new trophy piece whose character is not very detailed (come to think of it we have not seen so much physical flesh from it as well and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of). <br /> <br /> They certainly make a lot more of a younger / older woman thing than was done the opposite in any version of "Sabrina" (neither movie I like) or Douglas / Zeta-Jones or Dion / Svengali nuptials. <br /> <br /> Surrounding Andie MacDowell as ex-pat, otherwise, are welcome family members of British dramas and comedies such as Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The plot twists to the end I feel very deus ex machina. But it was not until the credits appeared at the end that I realized what really could be wrong. As in "Sex and the City," the screenwriter / director is a man, here Scot John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a screenplay about three gay men, probably about them dating to their lovers. and at work (the characters are a school principal, a police officer and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting film. The film's tentative title was "The Fedor Club," which would have made its parallels with the "Broken Hearts Club" even more obvious. <br /> <br /> (originally written 4/6/2002)
