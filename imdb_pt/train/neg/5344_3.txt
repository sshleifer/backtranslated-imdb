You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (besides the songs), well, your manager Simon Fuller (also the band's manager) makes the same mistake by putting S Club (another of my favorite bands) on his own movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley McIntosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) Basically they ask their boss some time, they continue, and while there they are they see themselves on TV! Three of them trade, and vice versa, they discover that they are clones made by a greedy scientist, and the other half gets into trouble. Also starring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This movie may have more of a plot than the Spice Girls movie, but beyond the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin '" and "Never Had A Dream Come True" is not a reason to see this movie. Not long after the band split up forever. Suitable!
