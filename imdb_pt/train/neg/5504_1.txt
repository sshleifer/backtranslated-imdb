There is no possible reason why I should understand why this movie has already been made. <br /> <br /> Why should Hollywood continue with a horrible update from one classic after another? (Cases in question: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - horrible!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, whom I usually like, was so miserably misunderstood in that role. Your manic portrait of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so unspeakably unpleasant to be almost criminal. His rancorous speeches, groans, grimaces, and histrionics give us no reason to care for his character except as a 1-dimensional cartoon character. The director must have thought that quick moves, glaring dialogues, and "an outlet". "The slapper had some resemblance to comedy. Apparently he told ALL ACTORS to act as if they had red ants in their pants. I think the writer used "It's a Crazy World, Crazy, Crazy and Crazy" as an example of a good comedy script. As manic as this 1963 classic is, it is far superior to that claptrap - in fact - suddenly looks pretty good by comparison. <br /> <br /> What is sadder about this movie is that it must have been apparently written to appeal to small children. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure <br /> <br /> If they had to redo "My Favorite Martian", why did not they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not include "zero" as a rating for your readers, this is the only assessment that comes to mind in describing this farce. <br /> <br /> A good thing came from this movie, the actors and the team were paid - I guess.
