In the first 20 minutes, every possible cliché was made public by the writer and director. There was the principal investigator of the NTSB with tortured family life; the politically tortured NTSB board member played by [I can kill ANY TV], Ted McGinley; the tortured father of a victim of the accident; and the tortuous, sloppy ambulance solicitor. <br /> <br /> Hollywood still has no idea of ​​the fragility of aircraft. The crashed plane was a 737 and was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the plane was intact, and the debris field had no wings or engines. Most people should have come out in the light of how many people survived that plane that was crushed in Iowa after it lost its hydraulics. Most of this TV plane was not even burned. <br /> <br /> I remembered the scene in "Air Force One," where the 747 reaches the water and then jumps as if it were made of inch-thick steel. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad it was impossible to watch. Even my wife, who accepts more than I, was commenting on technical flaws. What struck me was how this POS could be done. Are the producers of these things so accustomed to cliches that they can not even recognize them? Someone read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million dollars making it real. I wanted to be the guy's next engagement. I have the title of a wonderful bridge in New York that I would sell cheaply.
