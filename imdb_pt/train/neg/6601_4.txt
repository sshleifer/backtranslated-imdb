I can see why the purists of Laurel and Hardy may feel offended by this rather gentle "reenactment," but this film would be a great way to introduce children to the classic pleasures of L & H. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain are reasonably acquitted of comedy duo and there's a reasonably good cast of support. I liked.
