Amelia and Michael are a couple who are cheating on each other. Amelia has a longtime lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who does not satisfy him. The two burned with their infidelity, but managed to connect to each other in the end. <br /> <br /> There is not much to do this. The direction is direct and dramatic, which is good, the acting is sincere, but the story leaves a little to be desired. Why exactly do we care about these two people? It's a bit difficult to see how this story stands out from any other story of infidelity except that it is much simpler and does not seek meaning in it (a welcoming change of pace, if anything). <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's possible that I do not connect to these stories because I've never tried them. But I have noticed that the blocking in these narratives is typically the same, ie a couple talking while avoiding eye contact pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc. The good thing about short films is that they provide a bit more space by trying something different, and I would like to see a different take. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
