I'm not going to sift through the obvious peterbogdanovichiana flaws of the TLPS. Instead, I'll take a look at the positive aspects of this overdone pigment pigment in a film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich has managed to make a film that can be supported in its entirety. This fact, by itself, puts the movie on top and all the way to the top of his lame filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich had shown how some generous lucky people can be surprisingly generous, sharing the fabulous body and breasts of Cybill Shepherd (his then-gallon) with his male audience - not just one but two occasions. Brave! The unquestionable highlights of this film siesta party. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS has just one scene without stereotypical country music scribbling in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in the Deep South of the United States (as if it were not obvious), so he hammered that point and so on ...) How is that an advantage, you ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally stops massaging your weary ear, you begin to experience a strange joy: "The movie is finally over!" It is pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives all women who look like the hope of Cloris Leachman. I hope they, too, can one day get a much younger and maybe even handsome boyfriend. <br /> <br /> 5. The biography of Cloris Leachman (which I realize is not technically part of the TLPS) gives hope to all women who look like this, that they may one day win a beauty pageant Miss Chicago. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury.) <br /> <br /> (Do you think I'm playing with Cloris having won a beauty pageant, huh? Well, check out his biography and then we'll see Who laughs for 6. The film was filmed in black and white, sparing us from the sight of Cloris Leachman's face in its original non-glory.
