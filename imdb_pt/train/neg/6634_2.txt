The first look on the cover of this photo looks like a good rock n roll movie. But do not let the cover fool you, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The plot is just awful, and so is the acting. Pure and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about a roadie, it's just a fine love story, so terrible that you see through it. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and that's why I give 2 out of 10. If it were not for the song, it would be 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a horrible actor (at least he was in 1980), and the girl who plays the groupie is not nor beautiful This movie was a big disappointment to me because it makes many good promises.
