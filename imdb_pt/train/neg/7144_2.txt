It was almost worth sitting through all this horrible "movie", just to know that I will never be able to experience something as bad as this again. Acting - 0, script - 0, fight scenes - 0, male lead - 0 (eight cheddar bob as a gentle war hero who gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is beautiful and not a terrible actress) . This is the criterion I used to calculate the average for a two. I lost count, but I believe the movie clich√©, never, is in this movie. When the driver who allegedly killed his father miraculously appears at the end to run against her, out of nowhere cemented the previous statement. In addition, it only appears for no reason. It was never mentioned before. I do not know what else to say here. Just watch when you get on TV in a couple of years. At least so, some will be edited for commercials.
