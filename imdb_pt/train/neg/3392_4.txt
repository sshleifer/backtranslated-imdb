What about Indonesian musical films? I have never seen Indonesian musical films like those made in Bollywood. They lose the spirit of history and just a lot of 'what they call' poetic lines. <br /> <br /> This story about the love of two children who are separated and then meet again after a few years of change has no special remarks. It's a simple story plot (but it's pretty focused though) with 'intended to be' musical story lines here and there. Confused characters who must be saved by brilliant acting are neglected. The lead actress may try to live the character, but it's the best she could do, trying. As for the cast, I do not feel the need to put a Bali student in this story and of course, they are not the only unnecessary characters. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is, why would I want to watch it? This movie? Maybe because of the sleeves ...
