The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" film - the first being "Brother Carl" by Susan Sontag (which was made in Sweden with Swedish actors, no less!) The results? Oscar Wilde said the best in reference to Dickens's "The Old Curiosity Shop": "It would take a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at Little Nell's death." Almost the same thing here. "Interiors" are filled with solemnly intoned howls. ("I'm scared of my anger." Looking at the middle distance: "I do not like who I'm becoming.") Bergman's direction citations (to use a polite term) are close to parody. The incredibly self-involved family keeps reminding us how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangling. ("I read a poem of yours the other day.") I was in - I do not know - The New Yorker. "" Oh, that was an old poem, I reworked it. ") Far from caring for these people, I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialogue is just like the funny stuff in Allen's previous films - only he directs his actors to make them honest. Not having gotten into the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copying all his dictates, intonations and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing substitute (as well as Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity). The basic plot - dysfunctional family with a discreetly domineering mother - seems to have been lifted more or less from Bergman's "Winter Light," the basic familiar melodrama full of existential angst. Everything appears in the visual and auditory tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the immense surf that surpasses the people who walk on the beach. etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Allen's "serious" later films are less embarrassing, but also much less fun. I'll get "Interiors". Woody rarely made a funny movie.
