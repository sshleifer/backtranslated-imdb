SEX WISH was actually released (minus ten minutes, ahem, "extreme" footage) here in the UK in the early days of the video boom, and caused a tabloid storm in a cup of tea when it was supposed to have inspired a murder case. Strangely enough, the newspapers brushed this ultra-disturbing movement under the rug in their rush to get the comparatively innocuous tastes of tinned cannons, and the film was forgotten as a result. I grabbed the chance to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the duration of the movie with my jaw on the floor. It's not politically as bad as totally insane, a triple X in Michael Winner's DEATH WISH (the middle title that would give the game with regard to inspiration?) With hardcore sex and some really nasty violence thrown into an already boozy brew of the years seventy sleaze. If you do not consider yourself scrupulous, it may force you to think again. When the SEX WANTS to end, you will want to scrub your clean eyes with disinfectant and take a long hot bath to clean yourself. If any movie really deserves the slogan "it's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie", this is it. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or lowlights) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim while masturbating over her, the mustache that steals the scene from Harry Reems, the impotent young black couple who is forced to screw in front the sword-slayer (they would have won the Oscar for their totally dependable performances if the Academy went insane) before the man is castrated by his problems, and by a shockingly slippery direction that threatens to raise the case above his obvious home origins of grinding. Do not say I did not warn you. If you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will prove you very, very wrong.
