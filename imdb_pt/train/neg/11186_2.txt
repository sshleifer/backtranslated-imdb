I wanted to watch this movie, but one bizarre and ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut up. The character does not seem to react to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger is walking one night (through a graveyard, I believe) when he is attacked by spirits, which he drives away. Once past this ordeal, he quietly walks away and meets a friend who saw everything. When asked about what happened, he says gently "attacked by demons, nothing serious" as if this were only a little more exciting than a flat tire. <br /> <br /> I turn it off when they ask something. a demon or something, I stopped caring - a question. The answer can only be rented from someone with the energy of his death, and the priest watches over what appears to be a vague annoyance when a man is hanged and hanged and they ask his question about the dying and dying body. <br /> 0 of stars ****.
