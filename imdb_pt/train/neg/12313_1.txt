This may or may not be the worst movie Steve Martin ever made, but it certainly was far from his best. Obviously, he did the crap for the paycheck. Dreck thus certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man. What he does not seem to understand is that when people watch a Steve Martin movie, they expect to have fun, not bored with tears. It's sad that he dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I do not understand why talented people can not understand the fact that people do not want to see them in bad movies. If you're going to call a comedy movie then it must be funny. That was not it. Shame on the US military for allowing themselves to be associated with this pabulum as well. Full Metal Jacket had more laughter than this miserable excuse for a "service comedy." Sure enough, Phil Silvers is rolling in his grave.
