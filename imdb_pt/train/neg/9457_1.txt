Almost everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. It has reached a point where you realize that his trick has not changed since the SNL days, over ten years ago. He is making the same jokes of consciousness flow and the same voices. Your cat is painfully bland. He tries very hard. He's a strange Type A comedian, not the cool cat he should be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The scenarios are unbelievably ugly - and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (The cardboard cutouts for the back buildings would have made more sense than building a whole neighborhood and the main street.) Alec Balwin tries to make a funny impression of Big Santini, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. There is even a time of inadequate cheesecake with the fake celebrity Paris Hilton - it stays in the head simply because it's supposed to be a Dr. Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all costs, folks. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they do Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams. So we'll have the comedy-starring trilogy of horror movies).
