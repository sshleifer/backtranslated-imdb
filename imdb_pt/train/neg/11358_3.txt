When I saw this trailer on TV, I was surprised. In May of 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was shown in a 4-D attraction (you know, the lure that the seats move). I believe the version I saw was an abbreviated version (15 min.) And also re-created to add motion effects. It was a cute movie ... but that was it. It was educational and told about the first mission, but the ending of a walk in CGI space seemed a little ... well ... banal. I was not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this movie to any parent who wanted to inform their kids in a fun way about the first moonwalk. I'll say, the characters' actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute. So, all in all, I would say, if you want to bring the younger kids ... go ahead. But if you're wanting to take your older kids, take them to another movie ... they'll thank you.
