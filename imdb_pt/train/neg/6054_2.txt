I'm not sure if Carpenter is willing to raise questions about abortion, and make the really heavy and obvious point that a woman should be allowed to have an abortion if Satan is the father, but he continues to crawl. Ron Perlman is laughable. The baby is really stupid, basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it. You may well see the material on the costume of Satan. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of history and 55 minutes of boredom. Very very bad. And the ending is just ridiculous. After learning that your baby is dead, the devil destroys the abortion clinic and kills everyone in a huge, bloody, bloody commotion? NOT! He just lowers his head and leaves the room. Terrible.
