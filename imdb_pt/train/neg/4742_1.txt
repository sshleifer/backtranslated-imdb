Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and I laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, the popular girl with hot jock boyfriend and imprisoned friends who is determined to be the Queen Homecoming. She must save the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts. Shin teaches you the skills of a snake, tiger, etc., and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture. but the acting and the cast were horrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedic actress and I can not see her playing a serious role. It was a funny laugh to watch her cry over Shin. Shin could not act, and everything was totally unbelievable. I watched this movie and tried to think of something like that, and the thing I created was the Power Rangers. This movie is so fake and the acrobatics were so Power Ranger-esquire that it was just tacky and stupid. The characters were not pleasant and I simply could not bear to watch. Disney really needs time to make some decent movies. High School Musical is the only film that deserves to be on the Disney Channel, along with other films such as Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Weep, & Stuck in the Suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like joking action and joking, you will like this movie.
