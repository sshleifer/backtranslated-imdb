The film lacks credibility with helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s. The only part of the film in which you could believe was that Germany would like to know where the landing would be. We do not know at the moment that the British captured all the spies, but even if they did not, they would not have let a wander around as if to reassure the Germans that the landing would be at Calais. It's not an important thing that makes the movie not work. It's the culmination of all the wrong things that make the movie fail. Bad direction, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (all) combine to make the movie fail. Generally spies should disappear into the wood. The suspense comes with the spy wondering whether the information they have is valid or not and worries about being detected. In that the game ended from the beginning. This spy was making everything but spying. Your only chance to get something that has some credibility and instill some suspense might be to read the book.
