What a horrible movie! For some reason, scientific labs and outposts always have a team of filthy, dirty, and malicious misanthropes living indoors. These people who supposedly work together on complicated scientific projects do not seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a CGI Dragon. Spoilers: An extra-nasty scientist whose main ability to act is "malicious" and "the sinister look" cloned a dragon. While the lab was supposed to work with this sort of thing, the other scientists are shocked because apparently they were far behind in their experiments and were caught with their pants down. The rest of the story is like THE THING, or Ten Little Indians, where the staff is hunted down and killed when they try to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat the Dragon. The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most CGI special effects cheap. Hardly looks better than a cartoon, and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see interesting details in the Dragon's body. All it looks like is a gray bubble. The acting is less than horrible. These scientists act like a bunch of children who can not agree to anything, and this makes it easier for the Dragon to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is no better than any cast of unknown actors in this movie. He seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast. This movie is very, very atrocious. The acting is bad. The story is dumb. The CGI is very cheap and amateurish. There's nothing praiseworthy about this movie, it's not even a good time killer to look at while doing chores or other work.
