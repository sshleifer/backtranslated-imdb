(Review in English, since Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I saw this film with extremely low expectations, and unfortunately I can inform you that the film did not live up to them. As much as I loved to see Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen again, writers should have realized early in the script that seven people falling in the water are not original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, the ones that are not, are simply boring. I smiled like three times throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The placement of Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) funny, because not just a great saying board; "Findus made it happen!" <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 does not need to be seen in the movies or on DVD, just expect it to be aired on TV, so do not delay too long.
