My friends and I rented that movie last night and had one of the best laughs in a while. The movie should not be funny, but it is so ridiculous and lacks any realism. First, Phillippe (I forget how his character is called and I do not really care) uses his regular employee ID to get through all the security terminals. Not only is this pathetic, but it gets overtaken when his enormous efforts culminate in finding the very scary Lego-room, which hosts the supercomputers. This is funny. The tense atmosphere that we must experience is completely spoiled by the childlike looking room. The end, like everything else, is very very tacky, especially when the bandit's lawyer appears "on time." Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to make fun, definitely see.
