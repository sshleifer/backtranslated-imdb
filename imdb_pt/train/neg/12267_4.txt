speaking just like a movie, I really did not like it. not because there was no FX or because we had a single booth as the setting for the whole movie, actually that's what made me watch. <br /> <br /> I did not like it because the acting was obscure, your "friends" are all happy and go crazy, but you have no idea why; then they take on separate roles, one is the believer, the other is the antagonist, but they never make the point! Also, the lighting was terrible and I'm just mentioning technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I think the movie might have just had an "ok, I'm outta here!" of some characters. like the lady who does not want to hear her version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> About the story itself, everyone is free to write about what they want, and the story is proof of good writing and imagination. I credit the author of the book so it's my 4/10. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, listen to the man's story, believe it or not, just do not spend all the time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says, and at the same time moving and making jokes like you do not believe in it. <br /> <br /> Consistency. Thank you for reading;)
