First of all I just want to say that I love this show !!! But this episode ... this episode mocks the whole show. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they tried to achieve with this episode, but they successfully created the WORST episode of the entire series. There is no plot, everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... sucks. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer some of the remaining issues in the game. .... For example, "how furlings look like" by creating this stupidity "earlier in ..." ...... is simply embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Of course the writers are running around with ideas and this is really bad.
