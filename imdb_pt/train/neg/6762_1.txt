This is the kind of film that everyone involved should be ashamed of. Bad direction, exaggerated acting and a plot that has no meaning beyond showing violence. I thought when I first saw that it would perhaps be a satire of the media and how it shows violence, but it is not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver Stone makes his worst direction ever. From scenes in which the face of Woody Harrelson turns out to be without apparent motive or the performance of Robert Downey Jr as Wayne Gale, who is a reporter who seems totally crazy, this movie is simply a mess.
