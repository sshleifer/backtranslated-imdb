I've been on AFI's list of 100 best comedies, and I must say this is really one of the worst. Not just the 90 movies on the list that I've seen, but from any movie I've ever seen. Drunks are funny sometimes, Dudley is not. Liza almost made it worth it, but unfortunately ... just go see Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughing and drinking is funny? I recommend almost ANY other movie about 100 AFI best comedies for more laughs than that. If you want to see a funniest "drunk," try The Thin Man. More fun movie in general, any film of the Marx Brothers will kill (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).
