I rented this on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious of seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not take a look. <br /> <br /> Well, my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget that he has ever participated in such a shame of a movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently, if your script and dialogues are terrible, even good actors can not save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who flood this movie. Many non-native speakers of English play parts of native English speakers by reading the lines of a script that should have been discarded and not turned into film. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is horrible and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a bad school play. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch just to enjoy other better movies. That's why I gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves.
