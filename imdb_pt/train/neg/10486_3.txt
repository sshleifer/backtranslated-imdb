My main comment about this movie is how did Zwick get credible actors to work on that film? Stunning cast ?? even for the supporting characters, none of them really helps this movie. I have to admit, though, that Tom Hank's cameo was almost worth it ?? What was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best appearance of the movie was Joe Isuzu - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with the existence of a Pink Lady, is headed toward Vegas, motel by motel, launching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens when Corbett's character is on his way to Las Vegas to deliver a suit of Elvis to his ex-wife soon prompted by more extortion. While the two make their way, they have several misunderstandings with Elvis impersonators who are on their way to an Elvis impersonation convention in Las Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to trace what they think is a serial killer of Elvis impersonator. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean that the movie was good. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie, imagine that you are back in the first grade ?? when the lines of history and continuity are not really important. It's so much nicer to just see beautiful Basinger in her Pink Lady outfit, instead of wondering why what she's doing does not make much sense. The movie tries hard, but ends up getting too short. Ultimately, it is full of ideas that theoretically could have been funny, but in practice, they were not so funny. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst, but you might think that you feel like leaving the building by watching 1 ???? Do not say I did not warn you!
