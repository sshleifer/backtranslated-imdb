I think everyone was very disappointed with this science fiction movie. On the one hand, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what's supposed to be a classic. I found it annoying, disgusting and ridiculous. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Almost everyone at Imdb says it sucks and it's a boy, they're right! If you have not, avoid it. He's a snorer. 1 out of 10.
