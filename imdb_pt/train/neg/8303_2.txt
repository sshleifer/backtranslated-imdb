Since its release in 1983, "A Christmas Story," the story told by Jean Shepherd of his alter ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. "My Summer Story," however, still has Shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely nothing of charm, and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is basically a mixture of mediocre stories and simply not very interesting, which include country neighbors and battle tops. Charles Grodin, who I usually like, is extremely unlikely in the role of the father (more properly manipulated by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never seems to be anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor replacement for Ralphie, and the younger brother is almost forgotten here. Only the mother seems to have any value here and maybe because she sends a movie manager with a sauce boat when he pushes his luck too far with angry housewives on "free night out." <br /> <br /> Stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched as fine paper. It may appeal to the extremely unscrupulous, but as a sequel to "A Christmas Story," it is very poor and not worth the time of most people. 2 out of 10.
