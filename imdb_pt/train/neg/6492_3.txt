I was not sure what to expect from a genre Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, but considering the actors involved, I thought I'd take a look. The tone of the film seemed clumsy, passing fragments of each genre, but I never felt balanced, so I gave up trying, and I focused on the cinematography and individual performances that I thought were good overall considering each character. had little depth because of the nature of the story (will not give anything here). I have to say that I felt much longer than its execution time of 96 minutes, and not in a good way. In the end, I was looking for a closure, some measure of satisfaction, but it did not become the smart or ingenious piece that I hoped it was. I think Tony mistakenly thought that what he did at the end of the movie gave us this ... but it was a tragic mistake to try to validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill-conceived conclusion. Ultimately, I feel cheated. IMO, it would have been better to let it go without the "end" as a work of art ... only. Or ... I may have missed the point completely :)
