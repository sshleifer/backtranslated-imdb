Contrary to my principles, let me first come to a conclusion, because I have just seen this piece of "art", and I am still under strong impressions. The reader is asked to excuse my strongest vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is absolutely horrible, and I would never bother writing a single word about it, were it not for the fact that "44 Minutes" made me sick to death, which rarely happens to me. The fact that I pay for it does not exactly make me feel better, as does the fact that the movie deserves the high rating here. <br /> <br /> So, what's wrong with the movie? It has a fashionable title - "44 Minutes". First we think of "15 Minutes," which is by the way a much better but still bad movie in my book, and in fact the two can be compared to some extent. But, luckily, the things they share are their worst characteristics. Both feature Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who with his strong Russian accent obviously meets popular expectations and prejudices. Their goal is to appeal to the Cold War mind. Oh, we miss the good old days. Now, I do not imply that he is a bad actor, I am still to judge his true performance, but he is simply not a real individual here, he is more like an archetype. How one can still enter into such things is completely beyond my comprehension. We can recognize modern American xenophobia here. The point in the film when Taktarov explains to his companion that the Romanians are not German, and that they are in America is really laughable. Should we assume that the miserable duo's greatest desire is to become "true" Americans? <br /> <br /> So there's the media issue. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. The director should have made us feel the rhythm of the supposed 44 minutes. Instead, he bored us with interviews throughout the film, such as on a cheap TV show, trying to reinvent the wheel. In 15 minutes the media question is central. The point is presented in a way that a teacher addresses an obtuse student but deserves a separate comment, we are now concentrating on 44 Minutes. So I've been trying to pinpoint the purpose of this movie. What is it? To give good time to the public? To glorify weapons? To glorify the police? To portray violence? Oh, yes, the officer gives the Bible to the juvenile delinquent. Why should you promote peace and understanding after all? I do not think so, but do not ask me. I just know I did not like any of it. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I admit, I'm a big fan. I hoped he was a bright spot, but I was wrong. It's not his fault though. <br /> <br /> As a final note, comparing "firepower" to "will power" at the end of the film was one of the worst lines I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> To sum up, the scale 1-10, I give a pure, unadulterated 1.
