What an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no award is made for "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or improved sound. <br /> <br /> Facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange monotonous cadence that sounds the same in the middle of a battle or chatting around a campfire. <br /> <br /> I kind of saw these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, and not really something to have fun with. It is quite long and in some places bland. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that, given the lack of any plot development, I also do not think it's too educational. <br /> <br /> It's also hard to notice any story of the film dialogue - it would be a good idea to read a little about the story so you can understand the context of what is happening, as for some reason the director did not care to inform the public why Che's band was moving the way they did - as a result, there seems to be groups sneaking through the forest for no particular reason and being shot. <br /> <br /> I would love to give this movie more stars by somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character, but somehow all the characters were still strangers to me in the end. The stars he gets are realism and show the difficulties of guerrilla warfare.
