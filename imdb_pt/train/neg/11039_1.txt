All the funny things that happen on this sitcom are based on the main character Jim being a bad parent, a bad husband or usually just enormously selfish. How can this be funny? Of course a character on a sitcom has to be flawed, but Jim's character is flawed in an extremely unfriendly way. <br /> <br /> And why this? My guess is it's because "he should get better." Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and he has the opportunities to do it. But he chooses not to. It is a conscious choice that he makes, when he chooses not to play with his children, does not go shopping because he does not want to buy "lady products" and is a choice he makes when he leaves his relatives. <br /> <br /> The other characters seem to be just in the series, so Jim may have someone to be an idiot. If Cheryl's character was a real person, she would have abandoned him years ago and would not have been deadbeat for 8 years. But, unfortunately, she is only a catalyst for the extreme selfishness of Jim's middle class.
