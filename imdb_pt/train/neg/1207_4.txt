Kim Basinger plays Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband who gets into trouble while at the local mall doing some last-minute Christmas shopping. After putting a hateful note hastily scrawled on a piece of paper and shoving the paper into the windshield of a car that occupied two parking spaces, she discovers that the owners of the car are the Rainbow Coilition of villains composed of a white guy, a Mexican, a Chinese, and a Negro. They confront her about the ticket, protect a defenseless security, and the pursuit continues. During the course of the film, Della will hunt the hunter as she releases her inner Bronson. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a little suspense a bit tense. The acting was good enough (except for a few scenes, the "Why God, why?") It was a little dignified, but it's somewhat undone, due to the fact that the villains Della pursues later are stupidly mind-numbing. did not have the intellect of a given villain "Alone at Home," perhaps their eventual defeat was something to savor instead of the meh reaction he evokes. The unbelievable factor I am willing to ignore, since both the director and one of the producers were part of bringing "Shoot em up" to the screen (a movie that, while playing credibility through the window, was immensely entertaining.) This movie, although never reaching the heights of this film, was good in its own rights. /> <br /> My notes: C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Comments with writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; 25 minutes and a half 'Making-of'; a trailer and two TV spots for this movie, and trailer for Lower Learning
