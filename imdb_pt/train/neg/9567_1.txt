It happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it happened with another Wargames classic from the 80s ... :( Why, oh why, oh, why Hollywood will never learn it? .. They can not be redone ... They suck .... We all hate them ...! Those of you who have not seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, go rent / buy now .... !! The hardware may look dated, the special effects are not new millennium, but still beats those hands of garbage down .... <br /> <br /> For those of us who lived the 80's when hacking was sexy, the Internet was something mysterious and their disks came as a variety of 8 "floppy, well, now we have the wisdom to avoid this movie as a thermonuclear war! Never before has a "good chess game" seemed the best option ....
