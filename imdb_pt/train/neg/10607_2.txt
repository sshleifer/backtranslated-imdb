Jean Claude Van Damme tries to rescue his career making the continuation of the Universal Soldier. But did this movie save you? I think he's going to hell after he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we see the inside of a facility, where you can see the movie thug. Scary, eh? But not as scary as acting (the details are following). <br /> <br /> So we see Van Damme with a black girl (does not remember the name ... well, does not matter anyway), trying to escape some muscular men. Of course they are the new universal soldiers. More muscels, less brain (just like the movie). After a while, Van Damme fights Goldberg, but the "mission" is aborted. It was just a test (is this movie a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme works for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (Whoever saw the first movie might think that this is the most non-logical thing Van Dammes could do). But it's a sequel. And a "story" has to come. Oh, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the "history". <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes, a supercomputer hears a conversation about turning it off and leaving the project. Of course the cube gets angry and activates all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes the installation, but the computer sends some soldiers to hunt him down (wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he's the best (seriously?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, which has always been a silly phrase for the public before being robbed. Funny? Yeah, just like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After some "story", Van Damme tries to rescue his daughter (from his wife - the reporter in the first film). He arrives at a final show where Van Damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (please see for yourself. It's too funny to say). <br /> <br /> You will see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So do not watch. But if you do, keep a sixpack with you!
