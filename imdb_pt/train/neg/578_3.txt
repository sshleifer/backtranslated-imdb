This is not a good movie. The acting is incredibly rigid and unconvincing. The movie does not seem to know if it's going for a true horror approach or whether it's going to camp and the kitsch route. I have never seen the first film, but this one does not stand on its own merits, there are several untouchable twists and the viewer is never warned about the importance of female vampire leadership. Not worth the effort to watch
