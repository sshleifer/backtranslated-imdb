(Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): Report of the disaster of the Titanic is the first filmed version of this so announced event. Disaster replication is not bad, but the drama around it is sometimes silly, poorly represented and very much like novel. The story is very much like the latest Oscar winner except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late. Good for nostalgic purposes only and to get an idea of ​​what James Cameron was competing against (just ??) in his recreation.
