Less than 10 minutes into this movie I wanted it to end as it was painful. This whole "horror" movie was about a group of whining whores doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Do not let positive reviews fool you, as this is really a terrible movie and you really should not watch it. <br /> <br /> The movie plot had the potential to be something great, but that just does not happen. A group of five teenage girls are coming home one night when they find themselves being chased by a crazed motorist who wants to kill them. Two minutes into the movie, and the characters are already arguing and that does not stop. All we have for 90 minutes is a lot of girls crying, crying, screaming, "acting" and arguing. None of the dialogues are even remotely interesting either, so you can not really get to know these characters or enjoy them. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and I was shocked to discover that these characters were meant to be teenagers. None of these women seemed to be less than 20 years old, and one of them appeared to be almost 30 years old. At least take people who look their age. Neither of them gave any even remotely decent performances, and it looked like they were either picked out on the street or friends of the director with no acting skills. The "actress" who played the killer exaggerated, but she at least showed something that the other girls did not do - a bit of talent. <br /> <br /> The characters do not help, because these girls are a bunch of idiot whores. That's all I can say about them, and it did not help that they all survived. If I have to go into details, in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car hit a lot. A girl hurts and is complaining ... four of them are not wearing seat belts ... what do you expect? One of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer ... and all of you are conveniently "too hurt" to help? Be that as it may. <br /> <br /> The filming of the film is absolutely terrible. I do not care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut, the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera went out, rocked and brushed against an "actress" was horrible. It was also grainy, and sometimes you could not hear what the characters were saying (not that it was worth listening to). Supposedly the killer car in the movie (which was supposedly hit, even though we've only heard the crash) is actually the director's car in real life. No wonder they have not shown the car being hit! This movie is so cheap, they can not even show a car getting a little scratched. Oh, I have to mention the soundtrack too ... if that's what it was. It was horrible ... sad one second, then hard rock in the other. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Five Across The Eyes looks like a terrible home movie filmed in the middle of the street at night with a bunch of stupid girls yelling and arguing for 90 minutes. It does not help when the script sucks, the scares / tension / suspense and (hardly any gore to compensate for that) are absent, the acting is terrible and the quality of the footage and the filming are horrendous. <br /> This was a horrible low budget movie. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
