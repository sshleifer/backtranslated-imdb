She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this movie shows why she is also a perennial nominated for Razzie. Making such a bad movie should be an indication that she needs money. She could make announcements about why you should not talk on the phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a crowded mall. <br /> <br /> Susan Montford should continue to produce (Shoot 'em Up) as she is not very good as a writer / director. <br /> <br /> She is approached by four bad guys in the parking lot of the mall, and the first thing they do is to say they have a gun. What does she do? She starts pushing them and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something. She manages to run away, but gets lost in the woods after hitting. Why did not she run to someone's house? We have four armed thugs chasing after a lady with a toolbox. Of course, your guns are no match for your key. There is! Of course, she also has an iron tire and a screwdriver. Those poor thugs. <br /> <br /> Now, she's home for Christmas - and she brought a gun!
