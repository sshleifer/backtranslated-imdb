In the autobiographical tale of adulthood "Romulus, My Father," Eric Bana, famous for "Munich", plays an impoverished German immigrant struggling to raise his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee) in rural Australia in the 1960s. obstacle to family stability and happiness is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who blatantly violates his marriage vows to shamefully living with other men. Despite his highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to grant him a divorce, masotically torturing himself in the vain hope that one day he will return to him. It is, unfortunately, the good and kind Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turbulence - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the film (Raimond Gaita later became an author). <br /> <br /> Although I admire "Romulus, My Father" for what he is trying to do, I can not honestly say that I liked it because the film has great performances and serious intentions. , these simply are not enough to counteract the somber story and the funeral rhythm that leave the public as desperate and depressed as the people on the screen. A serious drama of a slice of life is one thing, but this incessant immobility in adultery, insanity and multiple suicides (not to mention attempted suicide) is something else again.
