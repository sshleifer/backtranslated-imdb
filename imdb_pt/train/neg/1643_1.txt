"Whipped" is one of the most terrible films of all time. It's an odious junk that forced me to stay in the movies more than any other 2000 movie, other than perhaps "The Grinch." It is not, as people call it, an insightful portrayal of modern relationships. That would be a little movie called "High Fidelity." Considering that the film was honest and friendly, "Whipped" is a hostile, cynical and misanthropic film poison. Avoid this like so many pests, unless you want to see how a "comedy" can really be bad.
