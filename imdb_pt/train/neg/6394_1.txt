This movie was bad. This movie was awful. The acting was bad. The setting was not realistic. The story was absurd: a comet that appears once in ages is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning, everyone, except a few people, was turned to dust by radiation from the comet. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but people have been turned into dust. No bones, nothing. This is ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people, but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Better yet, the comet has turned some people into monsters that eat zombie flesh. Your makeup would not look scary to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scares me the most ... and they should look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were the survivors. The people who were surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared the zombie-gift and death. How can steel block the radiation from a comet that supposedly incinerates people? <br /> <br /> Equally insulting is the horror music of the 60s playing in parts of the movie, or the 80's hair stone that is useless. the movie and makes you want to film your television. The most stupid part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would plunder the day after an apocalypse with mutants eating meat running everywhere? There were four five-minute horror scenes throughout the film, and most of them were dreams. Between these scenes, there is an unsophisticated dialogue that makes South Park look smart. The silence between elemental dialogue was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. I do not see this movie, ever.
