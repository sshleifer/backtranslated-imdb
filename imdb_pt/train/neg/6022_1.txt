I'm getting a little tired of people who abuse the name of God to perpetuate their own intolerant view of the world. Well, I do not discount the idea of ​​Armageddon, or the coming of the anti-Christ, I reject the idea that only certain people who live truly good (They seem to be mostly white Christian children) will go to Heaven while the rest of us must suffer through a millennium of Hell on Earth, just because we have not been good enough. God can be a judge, but I do not think He will measure every level of goodness. Give the Creator some credit.
