I saw the director "Woman on the Beach" and could not understand the good for great reviews. This movie is very much like that, two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamics and even less interest for any other person. Like your other movies, you have to want to listen to empty dialogues, go through very little and be enchanted with understated, understated characters. If you think you can enjoy this movie, do not let my review stop you. I like minimalism in films, but I feel that the films of Tsai Ming-Liang are far superior. He has a great actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There's nothing here. I wish IU liked it, but I do not like it. Oh well.
