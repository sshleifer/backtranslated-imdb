Yes right. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off. It was terribly annoying and consisted mostly of people walking randomly through the hills with no apparent direction. Then the hero comes on the scene. Born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. Obviously white. He was not even close to being Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely disturbing, and history did not help the cause at all. Strange battle sequences and lame dialogue. There's an hour and forty-five minutes, and in the end I was trying to eat my own face. I watched this because the people at the video store where I work are always asking me if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It's something like this: ahem. I would recommend another movie, maybe one that is fun. "
