A good idea, poorly implemented. While this could sum up 99% of the films on the SciFi channel, this really applies here. I love movies where a good background story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all the major actors, so this could have been great. However, despite some good acting, this movie fails due to the poor writing and direction of Bill Platt. <br /> <br /> Another comment made it a point to know where you are going so that you can get there. This movie does not. It is organized so casually that you know the words "second draft" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is a scene that is totally unnecessary and can be removed without anyone noticing. This scene begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to another and never have missed the senseless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This movie also had a strange habit of explaining some details while explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the whole "plot" in the front. He also had the habit of aborting a fight early on, probably just because they could not afford it. There are also some ridiculously bad scenes in which the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed "toxic adhesives" (seriously, what is that?). is a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she is well. She gets out of her "Roswell" personality a few times and makes a good tough girl (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he has done since playing Q in ST: TNG, so it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> In all, I gave this movie a 4/10 grade.
