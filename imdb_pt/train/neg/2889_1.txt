The case is the best part of the movie but just not worth the purchase price. I hoped a "Based on True Story" movie would only see a home video scene of poorly filmed clips tied together with pathetic scenes of killing scenes and scenes unrelated to it. Video scenes have had numerous setbacks that were probably used to extend the length of the feature rather than effects. I started this review even before I was in the middle of the movie and waited until it ended just in case of a better ending, but, low and behold, it only got worse. If I could mark it lower, it would have been a negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one.
