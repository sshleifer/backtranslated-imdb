In fact, it's basically the same movie. And they could not even hit the timeline of events. Maybe it was intentional because of laziness or not caring. Anyway, this thing is a real woofer. It did not even deserve to be called the movie. I saw it as a second feature called on the disc containing the original The Boogeyman.i thought my head would explode, and I ask you to run so far in the opposite direction of this thing, if you should be cursed with the misfortune of scouring his way. It should come with a warning label such as: Warning - Can cause your IQ to drop several points if you are within your neighborhood. For me, there is no doubt that this thing is 0/10
