AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut her best scenes. In the scenes she's in, she's just a zombie. She is involved in a sub-plot that is similar to a sub-plot in "Get Carter," but she handles the better sub-plot in "Get Carter." (I blame the director) The director's homage to Hitchcock was corny. (It's the scene where Ryan Philippe's character realizes he may not trust Tim Robbin's character, at least I think it's a tribute to Hitchcock.) The DVD shows scenes that have been cut. your instincts and do not listen to the test audiences.
