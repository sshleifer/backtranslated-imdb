Nathan Detroit performs illegal craps games for high roller gamblers in New York, but the battery is on and he can not find a safe place. He bets on the chronic player Sky Masterson that Sky can not make a primitive missionary, Sarah Brown, go out to dinner with him. Sky takes the challenge, but the two men have some surprises in store. <br /> <br /> This is one of those MGM expensive musicals in bright colors, with big sets, loud music, great roles. and performances to combine; Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing, which I do not like. My main problem with this kind of movie is simply music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but the songs from the Broadway show on swing time with endless trumpet flutes pah-pah-tah-dah at the end of each room bar are not my cup of tea. This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a few stories by Damon Runyon), and while the plot is quite affable, the songs are weak. Blaine's two numbers, for example, are identical, unnecessary, do not push the plot and scratch the ears (and they're also blatantly misogynist if that kind of thing bothers you). There are only two memorable songs, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you might expect) and Sit Down, you are Rockin 'The Boat (well played by Kaye) but you have to sit for two hours to get for them. The great asset of the film is a young Brando who makes a thoughtful and relaxed presentation; he also sings very well and even dances a bit, and is balanced with the ever-interesting Simmons. The sequence in which the two escape to Havana at night is a welcome respite from all the noise, agitation and murder of Noo Yawk's vowels. Musical fans can dig this, but in my opinion, a musical has to do something more than just film the show on stage.
