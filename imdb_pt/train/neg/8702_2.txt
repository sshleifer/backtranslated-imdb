This is one of the most foolish movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch! I should have waited, after seeing the first two, but I still get sucked into those types of movies with the idea of ​​"Maybe they got it right this time." No - not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? What about special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what SFX is going through in this movie, at one point a soldier is shooting at a "Raptor" while running down a corridor. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently engraved on it running around. Bad bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> What about acting? If that's how you can call. There is a character who, I suppose, is supposed to be from the south. However, after living in the south for six years, I have never heard that way of speaking. Maybe he has some kind of strange disability - the inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does not do anything that requires him to have that accent - so there was no reason for the actor to try to make one. <br /> <br /> And the plot? It's pretty basic - the Raptors escape, people with guns must hunt them down. I'm beginning to wonder why the dinosaurs in these films always seem to run into the nearest tunnel system ... would not they be on the outside hunting for prey? Well, at least they have the good sense to appear very little in the movie that supposedly revolves around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - Let's say you're in a building and you know there's man eating birds of prey running around. Would you decide to take the time to discuss who is better - Army or Navy? And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to solve this? How about the silly idea that they have to track down the kidnappers - divided into groups of two. Have they ever watched horror movies (or at least one episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the dumbest films out there. Lose yourself unless you want to moan through a movie.
