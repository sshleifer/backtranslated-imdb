How, in the name of all that is sacred, has this film already been distributed? It looks like it was shot on someone's cell phone and takes the scenario of the girl's victim screaming into new depths. They literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no characters and not much action. Just screaming and screaming more. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and hurried over to see if anything happened. No - except for screaming, of course. Odd as it sounds, the act of going through it quickly shows another problem - there is no camera work to speak. Each shot looks like any other shot - medium distance, one angle, no glare, no glare, full. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad, it's good. It's just bad.
