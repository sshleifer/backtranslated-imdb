Usually, I do not like revenge movies ... PERIOD. But Double Impact has little more than its typical revenge plot premise. You see, DI has action, precision, exotic locations (ie, Hong Kong), impressive armed battles and enough martial arts to satisfy your unarmed combat desires. Like all revenge movies, there are villains who would love to play outside a glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has none of the sensationalist slaps that stifle the elitist, racist, and venomous social stereotypes and plot that invaded "Eye for Eye" and "Death Wish 2." <br /> <br /> But in Double Impact is as transparent as saran wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a mafia squad connected to a family friend in financial trouble or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation of why the boys were speaking in French accent is appalling. It was not the watery plot that made this movie bad, but the use of clich√© lines and other film moves (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really got worse. But still Double Impact is still watchable. But why shitty movies like this have villains (for example, that greedy British guy who killed Chad and Alex's parents and that lethal lesbian redheaded girl) would you love to hate with the fiber of your being?
