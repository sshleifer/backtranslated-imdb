What happens when you give a free man enough money to hold you in the running and watch him squirm? The homeless respond to no one. They do not have mortgages, rent payments or idiot bosses. The homeless need not worry about the IRS, performance appraisals, or credit card payments. But give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car, and suddenly they need to worry about getting into the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying for insurance in their car, and working for someone else. They have the chance to be "productive citizens." This movie was as exploratory as a movie can be. It is a way for the rich and the middle class to "see what happens when you try to help the poor." and justifies capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why not a movie that asks, "What happens when you take away everything a rich man has?"
