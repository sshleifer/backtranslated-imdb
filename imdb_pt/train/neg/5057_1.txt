Very outdated movie with horrible dialogues, full of clich√©s and rude and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk exercise constantly. A pseudo "good movie". It does not take time to discover just how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is totally boring, full of histrionics and hysterical exchanges. The sound is awful. The camera moves are unimaginative as well as character building. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting pictures. The actors smoke constantly and we see ads of beer drinks. Very cheap indeed. (an exception: the cool and simple way Ned Beattie plays the killer).
