This movie does not have much to do with its predecessor "Robot Jox". This should also be the reason why its more common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternative name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". "Robot Jox" was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a good premise of giant robots fighting each other in the near future. This concept was abandoned for this movie and instead presents a totally dull story which, moreover, is not very original or cleverly written. A shame, he tried to be very different from his predecessor, because maybe this could have been a more fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Like "Robot Jox", this is a B movie, but with such a big difference it's not very good. Perhaps this also happened with the fact that "Robot Jox" was made during the '80s, when B movies still had a certain charm and class, even though the film was released in 1990. This really can not be said about this movie. It's just lame, poorly done, poor looking and not exciting enough. It also has an ending that lets you think 'Is this it? That is all? '. <br /> <br /> What is the movie that your story is missing is really good clear main plot line. Maybe a good main villain had been a good idea and a few other things, such as a real point for the story, some nice main action or characters. <br /> <br /> Seriously, what were they thinking when they chose the actors? for this movie. All of them are simply not nice in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character who behaves as if he were a gift from God to the woman and Mr. Perfect who could compete with anyone . Were not they simply able to get the actors from the first movie? <br /> <br /> For a futuristic movie, with the concept of having great battle droids, this movie is certainly missing out on its action. If they had put more and more action into the movie, at least the movie would have been more fun to watch. Instead, we now have a movie that can not impress basically in every way imaginable. <br /> <br /> It's best to watch an episode of "Powerful Morphin 'Power Rangers," for a little more action and sympathy. <br /> 3/10
