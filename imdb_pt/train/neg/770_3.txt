Strange Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives at the studio of antiques collector Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious friend and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, dominates Jack and ties him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000.00 for each to protect him in a negotiation of the antique "Spanish Judges" with a rich and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid friend Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend who believes she is from Mars, to make up the support team. However, Jack crosses the collector and then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> The low budget "Spanish Judges" is a film with a reasonable script, with a horrible conclusion that misses a good cast. Valeria Golino is surprisingly beautiful, but along with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they can not save the stupid story. Also, the scenes that should be funny unfortunately do not work, and in fact they are silly and not funny. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "All For Money"
