Remembering the dirty details of this insidiously insipid "movie" is like digging the chest cavity with a rusty, salty spoon. Maybe "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) has been a little predictable, but this pathetic excuse for a movie is just one of the most blatant marketing offerings I've ever heard of. A boy fighting spies / terrorists when he's home alone in a suburb of Chicago with chicken pox? Ridiculous! Why did this movie have to be done? I am the kind of person who believes that even terrible movies are not a waste of time, but learning experiences. However, this is really a waste of time. It should be avoided at all costs.
