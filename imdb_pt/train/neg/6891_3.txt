It starts very well, good introduction and build for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same mold as the main protagonist of American Pie and Loser without the supporting cast or groundbreaking plot that made the Pie films more a commercial success. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest - Heder's performance was very poor. Keaton, Daniels, and Faris did their best, but they did not have a substantial plot or script to go deeper. The film continues without rhythm or a clear and logical plot justifying its size. <br /> <br /> The end is almost predictable. as they come - so predictable I marked the box of spoilers for this line. <br /> <br /> My advice: avoid at all costs unless you really do not have anything else to do / hear or watch and even then you will feel that the producers cheated you in an hour and a half of your life.
