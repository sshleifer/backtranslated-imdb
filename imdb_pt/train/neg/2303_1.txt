Except people seemingly buy this crap! As programs like "Moral Orel" have shown, even if you have tried to do the most outrageous and exaggerated parody of evangelism you could imagine, it would not come close to the joy of the show. It's hard to say what's going on when you're watching. Is it a news program? A talk show? Who knows!? They start reporting on various international news, but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by a strange, troll-like little man with a forehead larger than his whole face, grunting and laughing, and generally being scary. Pat Robertson does not seem to be such a bad guy at first. He just seems like a senile but harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who asked for a murder, who befriended and offered help to not one, but two murderous dictators, who illegally used donation money to administer diamond mines, who SUPPORTED forced abortions in China and which regularly implies that Caucasians (male caucasians straight in particular) are superior to all other races. Even so, this would all be funny, except that he apparently has a fan base big enough to keep his little show up in the air 40 years later (or that, or enough money to bribe some TV's that do not give a shit about what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, should be watching and holding on to every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is, people still hear him. I do not know if it's funny or scary. I think a healthy mix of both.
