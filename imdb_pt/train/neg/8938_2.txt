I still can not believe how bad this movie was. If I were not a masochist, I do not know if I would have survived the exhibition. It seems like it cost about $ 1000 to make, but it was not the money that knocked them out. The acting was horrible - not only bad, 3rd graders could have read the lines better. Second, the only other reason to watch this kind of film is the skin, and this is extremely insufficient in this film. We could not even see the most attractive girls in the chandelier. <br /> <br /> Ahh well, better luck next time huh?
