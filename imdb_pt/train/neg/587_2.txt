This film differs from the mediocre documentaries "wonder of the human body" bravely, albeit in a bizarre way, choosing to provoke disgust in the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes on a gigantic 15-foot spine as teenager squeezes pus and fluids out of it. In another, the camera is semi-submerged in a swamp of half-digested and acidic food from the stomach, while parts of a pasta salad fall from the esophagus and spread into the slime. In a final tour de force, the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing stroll through a forest of ... adolescent armpit hairs. Unfortunately, I'm not doing any of this. Watch this movie if you must, but: Bring your sack of vomit and do not eat pasta salad beforehand.
