I noticed that the previous reviewer (who seems to still be in school) gave this film a very good review and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer did not see the much better BBC 1989 adaptation of this classic novel. The biggest problem I had with this version (1999) was the cast of Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy who gained fame after appearing in the TV miniseries "The Choir". I can only assume he was cast for the role of Tom Long with the strength of his excellent performance in "The Choir". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "The Chorus" had grown up in a loud and lumpy youth by the time "Tom's Midnight Garden" was filmed and as such Anthony can not convince as a student Tom. It is very difficult to imagine that Tom (played by Anthony) would make friends with Hatty, who is much younger. In the 1989 version of the BBC, Tom and Hatty are much closer and the development of their friendship is much more convincing. For a 1999 film, even the special effects fail to convince and are no noticeable improvement in the TV effects of 1989. The cast and acting of this version are inferior to the previous adaptation and all throughout the film was a lacking version of glow of a true classic. As a final remark, I would like to point out that the VHS of the BBC version of 1989 reaches over £ 20.00 second hand, while a new DVD of this version can be purchased for less than £ 5.00, should I say more?
