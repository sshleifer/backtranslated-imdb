I was hoping this movie was at least watchable. The plot was weak to say the least. I was expecting a lot more considering the cast (I wonder if any of them will include that in their CVs?). At least I did not pay to rent it. The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the film is complete and complete PANTS.
