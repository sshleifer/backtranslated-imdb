Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. When has Hollywood ever made a blockbuster movie that attacked the Republicans? Why do not they learn? Dixie puppies do not. These Leftists live in their own elite bubble interacting with each other; oblivious to the fact that most of America is much more correct than it is. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are non-partisan and rarely political. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd Cheney's imitation was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would have thought that Cussack could have made better movies. <br /> <br /> It was not funny.
