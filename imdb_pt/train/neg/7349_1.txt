Polyester was John Water's first film I saw, and I must say it was also the "worst movie" I've ever seen up to that point. Water's talent group included several people. I certainly worked for food and was willing to say the lines that Waters wrote. Every thing about the film is terrible, acting, camera, editing, and the story about a woman played by 300 pounds of Divine transvestites was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> That said, I have to recommend this movie because it's very funny, and you will not believe the crap that happens to poor Francine. Your child releases the solvents and steps on the woman's feet in the grocery store. Your daughter is the bitchiest bitch in town. Her husband is an asshole of a pornographer who does everything to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine. <br /> <br /> Francine's only friend is played by Edith Massey, possibly the worst actress of all time. Edith looks and looks like she's reading the lines on a card and has never seen the screenplay before filming. <br /> <br /> Despite all the difficulties of Francine, Waters prepares a fabulous Hollywood ending and everyone (who survives) lives happily ever after.
