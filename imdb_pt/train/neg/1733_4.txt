SAPS NO MAR <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> /> Suffering from 'hornophobia', Ollie embarks on a 'restful' boat trip, but he and Stan mingle with a convicted fugitive (Rychard Cramer). The chaos begins. <br /> <br /> This feature-length comedy - an OK entry that, however, fades as a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best work - marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. In its episodic structure, the film culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after The Boys are taken hostage by villain Cramer (who shoots a gull to prove how tough he is!). The jokes are cool, but lacking in inspiration, perhaps due to the recruitment of actor and director Gordon Douglas, previously responsible for Ollie's first solo work in the sound era (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work here does not have a measure of pzazz . Fair, but nothing special. L & H goers, Charlie Hall and James Finlayson, make guest appearances.
