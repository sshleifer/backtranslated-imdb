This film was so poorly written, directed and acted it is unbelievable. It should be redone with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is the acting. You have Jennifer Beals, on the one hand, who is polite, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who is regretfully a mischievous and dissonant person in that particular play. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are terrible as the slave who owns (and holds) a couple, though both usually work well. The actors (and director) should not have tried to make accents - they are inconsistent and unbelievable. Far better to have concentrated on doing a good job in real English. The cast is ridiculous. Why are the offspring of an "African" trader (so less socially desirable for the gens de couleur society) scaled with very light-skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel has pronounced African characteristics, including an obviously "blond" ? It's as if the casting directors did not bother to read the script they were pitching and chose the appropriate actors from a large group of extremely talented and physically diverse color actors. It is so strange! This could be a great movie and should be redone, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and qualified actors. There are a lot of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would make an appropriate cast, a good script and a decent direction.
