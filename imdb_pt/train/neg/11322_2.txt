There is a word for this kind of movie, and that word is "silly." He was an idiot when it came to a VHS rental, and now it's a drivel in satellite re-releases. <br /> <br /> I could fool you because there are 2 moderately well-known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, reasonable soundtrack and a beautiful landscape in Monument Valley. <br/> <br/> She also has a curly-haired woman who fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If that's what you want from a movie, then maybe that will keep you happy. <br /> <br /> It's still silly, though.
