Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a disciple of Satan / serial killer who owns "First Power": even after being captured by Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he is able to move his spirit of body to body and continue to kill at will. With the help of the attractive medium Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, half-sister of Melanie G.) he tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept probably had a few possibilities, I think, but ultimately "The First Power" suffers from routine screenplays and movie making. This is nothing we have not seen before, sometimes done better. There is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. More to the point, it's not very exciting and certainly not scary. Phillips is hard to sell as a stereotype of cynical and tough cop, and Griffith does not seem to be pushing hard; The best cast member is probably the prominent Kober, doing his best to be extremely scary. <br /> <br /> The climax is pretty silly and the end very weak. <br /> <br /> It's not really acceptable enough to evaluate as a medium movie of its kind, therefore: <br /> <br /> 4/10
