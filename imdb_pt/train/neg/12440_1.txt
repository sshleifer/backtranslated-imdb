This is the worst brain crap, ultra cheap, stupid, silly, nonsense I've ever seen, an unbelievable crap of instant cult status among bizarre fans. If you think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... let me tell you, it looks like "Citizen Kane" compared to that. Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars." Â¿Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's really bad, actually. But if you're looking for that kind of incredible movies, it's for you! I am a fan of American International for so many glorious horror films, the Price-Corman-Poe saga and some great things about blaxploitation, but with "Star Creatures" they go down to level Z. Of course, my 1 of 10 works in reverse if you like watching bad movies for fun (the guy who plays an Indian boss is great) so have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
