Of Jess Franco's three titles to find the way to the official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars), this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a terribly monotonous jungle tremblester, animated only slightly by one <br /> <br /> Beautiful blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford, who is kidnapped by a gang of implacable hijackers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a group of kidnappers. wild tribe worshiping the "god of the devil" hiding in the jungle (a large, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the heart of female nesting sacrifices). Employee Laura's agent to deliver a $ 6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his veteran friend in Vietnam travel to the island, but find trouble when the crooks attempt a double cross. During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the natives of the island, who offer her to their god. <br /> <br /> Franco directs his usual style of numbness and carries that laughable effort with his usual awful brands: crap, obscure cinematography, fast zooms, numerous claw shots, out of focus images, terrible sound effects, and editing with fist of soot. The result is a terrible mess that is a real struggle to sit from start to finish (I took a few sessions to finish the thing), and even Buchfellner's vision in all its natural glory is not enough to make me revisit this movie in a hurry.
