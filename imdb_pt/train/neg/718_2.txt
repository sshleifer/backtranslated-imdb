The main reason why people still care about "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O." is that he presents Peter Sellers in a second position. But watching this movie to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. Sellers plays Amphibulos, a vaguely reptilian Prime Minister of the island of Gaillardia, formerly a British colony, now home to many Russians. excavators during the height of the Cold War. Amphibulos wants to play both against the UK and Soviet interests against each other for an easy profit, "all very friendly and all our cards under the table". Terry-Thomas is the title character, a lazy British diplomat eager to show Gaillardia that Britain has not forgotten them, all appearances to the contrary. <br /> <br /> A positive comment here reads: "The reason why this movie is considered average because comedy is underestimated." I would say that the reason "Carlton-Browne" is considered below average because the comedy is non-existent. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening that establishes the two unique forces of the film, a nice Terry-Thomas and the complete scandal of John Addison, things quickly diminish in a series of slow burns and mistaken jokes. Carlton-Browne's low opinion by her boss and Gaillardia Dark (which no one can find on a map) is milked to the death. When we actually got to the island (after a series of jokes on the air), the expectations are very low. <br /> <br /> They are still very tall. The island itself, which seems to exist in Latin America or in the Mediterranean, is so pathetic that its guard of honor faints at the airport, and the review bench falls apart in the middle of a parade. The army is apparently still pulled by horses, allowing another clinging and lame gag by an announcer with sharp notes: "In war, the army uses many horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers never get to the center of the stage even when re on the island of their character. The plot is taken over by Ian Bannen as King Loris, who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after the murder of his father. Bannen is annoying and does his part as direct as it is written. Usually that would make him the likely target for the theft of scenes by Sellers, but stuck behind a thick accent and greasy mustache, Sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him much happier in two other films made that same year . The rat that roared "and" I'm fine, Jack. "Strange that this movie, like" Jack, "was a production of the Boulting Brothers, with Roy Boulting here acting as co-director next door Jeffrey Dell.Generally Boulting films combine perverse social satire with anything comedy, but here there are only fey blows in any direction.Affibulos works his English vibe mutilated by all its worth ("This man is like, say, the bull in the ship Chinese ") while Carlton-Browne is generally mistreated by her superior much more than she seems to deserve. <br /> <br /> The weaker and more prolonged element of the film is Loris's novel with Ilyena. played by Luciana Paluzzi but is not a cousin. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a staged revolution whose surprise will surprise no one, and a bit of Carlton-Browne's final action that seems to literally end the coffin Apparently he lives to see another day, but the film of the same name is strictly DOA.
