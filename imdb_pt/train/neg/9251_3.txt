This film is, despite its "independent" status, a stupid Hollywood version of a nauseating relationship between mother and daughter. It was not so bad at first, but somewhere during the course of the movie - by the time the daughter comes out with that guy, I think - it turns into a cheesey mother-daughter collage film. I'm sorry, but I do not know of any mom who has that kind of relationship with her daughter ... probably better this way, though.
