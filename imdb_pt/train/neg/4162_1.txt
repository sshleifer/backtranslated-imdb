If you really liked the 2002 Resident Evil movie then you should just watch it instead of losing 2 hours and it will never come back. I can not believe anyone commented that this movie is just a cheap out of RE. First, a "special" command force is the only defense for an installation with a computer array that has an AI and a holographic projection. And this "Hive" rip-off has a number of pitfalls that inevitably kill one team member at a time. There is even a chess reference in the code names, which was in the RE dialog. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, the "Rook", the enemy of the film, is a kind of bio-creature, with a lot of color suggesting necrotic tissue, with many cyborg components as a super mutant of RE. So it's a finger flicker for Richard Taylor for claiming any credit for that story. <br /> <br /> They are not the same movie, obviously, but the writer got the idea of ​​watching Resident Evil, I think.
