I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. And I read all of my 3rd and 5th grade classes during my last 18 years of teaching. Supposedly a movie was made in the past, but I could never locate it. Well, my students and I were very excited when we learned that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book to the screen. <br /> <br /> As I watched the movie, I had the greatest of hopes. As the film continued, I became increasingly discouraged. They had spoiled everything! I've never been so disappointed by a favorite book-to-film adaptation. I understand that movies can not stay strictly in a book, but they do not have to change things because of it! Most, if not all, book exits were totally unnecessary! <br /> <br /> I kept my opinion in the first place and just heard my students discuss the movie. Well, it was not just me. Almost everyone felt the same way - cheating on the great story that Madeline L'Engle so cleverly created! <br /> <br /> Why, they wondered, did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the movie Star Wars? Why could not Calvin's hair be red? Why Mrs. Who did not have the proper "witch" outfit was so smart in her name? Basically, we all wonder - why did almost every detail have to be changed? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make. I'm still waiting for this movie. This was A Wrinkle in Time just in the broadest of senses. I'll write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the task!
