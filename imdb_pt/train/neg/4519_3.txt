Three Stooges - Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film to star in the Stooges and it's very bad. It makes the three stops around the world in a DAZE (from 1963) looks like a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The Stooges are janitors at a rocket site. They get on a rocket and go to Venus. They find some things there, including a talking unicorn that they call "Uni", which they bring back to Earth with them. "Uni" talks like a nice, normal person - "Oh, hello.How are you? Beautiful planet here.I hope you like it." Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Very few jokes and many of the scenes simply continue <br /> <br /> The Stooges arrive back from space and the movie ends until The story goes on, but no one told the filmmakers for the photo continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing happens.The Stooges leave the party and then the movie is almost over. <br /> <br /> Highlight of the film - the end where the Stooges they sing a little song on their journey Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies Brutal Another writer mentioned the good musical score The only song I noticed was two classic songs - I'LL TAKE ROMANCE and THEN GO BACK TO THE SONG AGAIN, both played at the party.And this is really the highlight of the picture - music from old Columbia movies. and high was cool. <br /> <br /> Horrible - a new VHS video from the 99 Cents Only store.
