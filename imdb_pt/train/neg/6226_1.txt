I cringed through this movie. First of all, the stupid plot has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood tried to create a kind of comedy car chase movie. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Do not take anything about this movie to be precise. The name Parsons in the title and theft of his body is used only as a springboard for a low-budget chase film, a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from Parsons' legacy and his fan base. Gram's father had long since died in 1973, the other global characters are fictitious, none of this has anything to do with Grams' life or death. <br /> <br /> If you are a Gram fan, I advise you not to watch this movie. I wish I had not. It is distressing to see something special be treated like this dishonorable fodder. I would swear I could hear Gram turning his grave while the movie was passing. If you are not familiar with the life and legacy of Gram, do not take anything in this movie as being representative of Gram. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram were alive and watching this movie, he would kill himself. Then again, maybe he was afraid to wonder if this movie would turn out.
