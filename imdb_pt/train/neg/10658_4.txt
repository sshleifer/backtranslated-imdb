On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five of us (remember, three of us, unconditional Kamal fans) of us came to a unanimous verdict; VV was a solid piece of crap and thanks to the film we were going to have a nice Monday. Not to mention, we swear to stay out of theaters for next year. <br /> <br /> I do not blame Kamal here because he kind of missed a tip in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something like: "Tamizh Cinema'a Photography, Editing'the namba munnera'na maadri Script, Direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of Photography and Editing, but hardly improved, when "While you're watching VV, these words sound very true. Now, here are the Top 10 Reasons to Hate This Movie: <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj 2. Harris Jeyaraj 3. Harris Jeyaraj I barely hold myself back from using expletives here, but the fact is that HJ has mastered the good talent of ruining all his recent films (remember 'Anniyan', 'Ghajini ') with the dissonant cacophony, it counts as background music. The next time I have a tympanic transplant, he's paying for it. <br /> <br /> 4. Songs Neither songs help move the narration of the space movie / temporarily, nor do you sit down and take notice The movie seems to be made from quat very long songs with some n scenes between them. <br /> <br /> 5. A short gone too far. VV at best is suitable to be a tale, not a "suspense" of 2 hours. To use a clich√© here, like the Energizer bunny, it goes on and on; only in this case you do not want to. The back of a movie seems like a major obstacle. <br /> <br /> 6. Pairing Kamal-Jothika Two ice cubes wiped together could have produced more sparks than this lead pairing. There's no reason for you to hope they do it together. In fact, every time they get together in the second half of the movie, they annoy the narration well. I hate to say that, but the 10-minute romance of Kamalini Mukerjhee does more than Kamal and Jothika achieve in this film, in addition to 'Thenali'. <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Haasan's accent, Kamal, has this pretentious accent that no one speaks of in India or the USA; and is not new either. He has been doing since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It is simply on the nerve. Imagine what this can cause when your talent for using this strange accent finds footage on location in the US. He does not leave him on Immigration, he offers doses of advice to his men (confused TN Cops of Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in Kamanglish caste ("What we have here is simply bad police work"), of course with nauseating effect. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are some directors you expect to be on a certain scale. Gautam fails us a lot with some bad performance in the Common Sense Department. That D.C.P in his senses would find his love interest in the streets to discuss subjects like commitment and after the life! The scene inside the theater was so bad, toward the climax; we could hear the people behind us challenging the hero's IQ. "He's stupid, can not he just use his siren or lights?" (On a busy Madras road, Kamal-the-cop-on-the-police-Jeep chases a guy on a bike like any ordinary guy!). "Can not he just use his gun?" ("The guy on a bike" starts walking and we have a fully equipped Kamal in chase for a considerable amount of time). I'm not voting for the latter, but I'm just trying to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore and Violence If I wanted to watch women being raped, their throats ripped, more women being raped and thrown in the shrubs with excruciating authenticity, I would sit at home and would rather watch a "Police Report "or" Kuttram. " The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story, not overwhelm it! At some point in the line, Gautum seems confused about what the extensions are (rapes, murders) and what the mainstay is! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double dose of Espresso could not get the pain out of the head.
