This is the most ridiculous and laughable thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where to begin .... Plot (the little there is): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant. Clay was secretly engaged to his mother's PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. The night they secretly marry, it turns out that a heart donor with the same rare type of blood is found. Go and calculate the chances of that! Once on the operating table, Clay discovers the anesthesia is not working, and he can feel everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately clay seems to be able to filter the pain of a razor-sharp razor cut open his chest by simply focusing on his memories of Samantha, who are told that he is doing it through a voice -over irritating that never seems to stop. <br /> <br /> If you do not fall into laughter yet, you will certainly begin when you see the surgical scenes. <br /> <br /> How could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by a surgeon, a nurse, an attending physician, and a drunken anesthetist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was being pulled. not to mention medical behavior which is too absurd to be taken seriously ... surgery room is not yet kept sterile ... people are pretty much able to simply get in and out of the room without even having washed up .. During the operation, the viewer hears Clay's thoughts, neither of which is too fascinating. Ah ... but here it is ... the doctors are trying to kill you to get his money. Believing him to be unconscious, villains speak freely. Shit! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least there is no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who has four malpractice lawsuits that work against him is performing the big heart surgery. Not even Clay's overprotective mother seems able to verify his status. The only one interested in keeping up to date is Samantha ... but, oh, no ... it could be sweet Sam to get into it ... You'll quickly find out through some Scooby Doo dialogue ... <br /> < > in the end it would not even matter whether or not clay underwent anesthesia consciousness because the end would have come out the same way in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the sense that the director / writer is trying to make fun of patients who have been victims of anesthesia awareness, maybe there's some stupid fun to have ... <br /> < br /> Enjoy ...
