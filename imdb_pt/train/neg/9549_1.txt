I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr. Falken until he watched the movie. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting and, in general, a bad movie. Please do not watch this movie. Rent the original "War Games" if you're feeling nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I also did not like the idea of ​​doubling the plot to overcome the idea of ​​terrorist threat. In the first film W.O.P.R was built because Russia had thousands of warheads aimed at the US. In this movie, the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorists in training before they are a threat. Leaving politics aside, one of the good things about the first film was the fact that even a stupid computer could understand the idea of ​​the meaninglessness of war in the end. None of these perceptions are offered in this film.
