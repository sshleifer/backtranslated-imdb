It is a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth, who specializes in slippery and inconstant alliances, did not first get this concept. He could have helped to highlight the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As the movie is, it's practically a mess (as stated by reviewer Chipe). The main problems are with the direction, cheap budget and bad script. The force is in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept - characters drawn in different directions by conflicting forces. What was needed was someone with enough vision to gather the positive elements, remaking the script into some sort of coherent whole, rather than the mess it is, trying to figure out motives and interactions if you can. In addition, a larger budget could have combined contrasting locations and studio photos, as well as getting locations outside the obvious boundaries of Los Angeles. The real shame lies in the waste of an excellent cast - Hayden, Taylor (before their teeth are covered), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and William Bishop, shortly before their premature deaths. Few films illustrate the importance of an author with more vision than this obscure Westerner, who, in the right hands, could have been much more.
