I would not say this is a * bad * movie. Unfortunately for me, I have the feeling that the more you know about fencing, the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic. I've been fencing since I was 14, and this movie portrays very badly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have some history of fencing), but most of the other actors - especially the students - seem to be lost.
