The people who are praising this film are the real disappointments - I hope at least Leonard sees something good from it, since his life savings were diverted by a manager a few years ago and now he's over 70 years old. . But this movie is just terrible. At first, Leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past, and then, for the next hour and a half, the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements in Leonard's songs. It's so bloody priceless with its infinite close-ups of gifted singers. Cohen's interview is all done in close-ups of lo-fi video and I wanted both to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body! I could not care less about the comments of the artists, especially those boys of the exaggerated ego Edge and Bono. None of the artists in this movie made a song as good as Leonard's, and if you're thinking of seeing it and have any questions, pay attention to them. This would be a PBS acceptable one, perhaps, for a single exhibit. But I will hesitate to get a DVD of that. When the film finally shows Leonard's semi-performative "Tower of Song" is ruined by Bono taking a verse. Even the occasional good performances (Antony, the first number of Rufus, Martha's The Traitor) are spoiled by the context of the rest of this blabla turbid. Forget this, and go buy the latest album from Leonard if you want to pay tribute to him.
