Wonderful cast wasted on useless script. Ten or more adults gather at the summer camp they attended when they were young. Could this happen in a million years? It's just a fantasy and boring. Do they become teenagers again? Do they re-enact their games, games, good times? They may try, but in the end the answer is: No. Is there any intrigue? Any suspense? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. How one can be entertained by this nonsense is beyond me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
