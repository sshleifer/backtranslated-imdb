There are no spoilers here, but I've been a fan since Waking the Dead started, but the last series, of which only 3 participated, is horrible. The stories do not resemble the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last series to fall chin ridiculously. As a BBC license payer, after the show I called the BBC Complaints to pass on my disappointment. I'm amazed that actors of the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did not oppose the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, but they can see that they have lost all direction. It's a good job, it's the last series or the next series can start with the team investigating the death of Santa Claus! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
