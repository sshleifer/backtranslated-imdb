If you like Sly's standard moves involving top action, unbelievable stunts (unbelievable should not be complimentary here), and delayed dialogue; you'll love this steaming pile of mountain goat manure. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought Stalone would be forced in his "days" to yield to smarter people and make an action movie that would put a credible hero in a credible situation where history, scenario and action (credible) would prevail. . I yearn for an action that is at least close enough to reality so you can imagine the fear and emotion that would come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects made at least a ridiculously ridiculous scene. Judge Dredd is only better because you know he's going to the theater to see a comic book turned into a movie. The character, setting, and everything else are beyond compare to anything we can find. Cliffhanger, on the other hand, turns a mountaineering guide into Rambo before you can say "Adrian!"
