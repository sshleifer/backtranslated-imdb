Essentially a man-versus-nature story, this movie has beautiful cinematography, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film never starts. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and then attracted by the farm foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of the late father of owner Peter Finch, whose ghost casts a shroud over the Elephant Walk, which becomes one of the main points of contention between Taylor and Finch. Elephants are determined to resume their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built on its right of way. The beasts are shaken and provide the best moments of action in the image. Taylor and Andrews have some good times as she struggles to remain a faithful wife despite her marital difficulties with Finch.
