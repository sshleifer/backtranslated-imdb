This movie is one of the most terrible I have ever seen. It is not just the terrible dialogue, it never ends. You'll think it's ending, but it's not. How long is 140, 160 minutes? I dont know. I know I'll never watch again. It's as if someone takes a romantic comedy, gets the comedy out, and decides to downplay the romance, leaving us with the pile of crap that got to the screen. But do not believe my word, find out for yourself how terrible this movie is.
