Having liked Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones," my interest was hit, so I tried to sit down with this second-line exit from an investigation into the death of a jockey - but I did not come to an end. Arthur, photographed in a movie magazine, wants the pension from ex-husband William Powell or another marriage chance, but I've never felt for her because the character is just a series of jokes (she's the kind of heroine prone to comical curiosity but once inside a morgue - like all women in those 1930s comedies - she collapses.Will Powell have had a good time working with Miss Arthur, but you would never know the end result; the actor who plays Powell's servant is excruciating, and the pauses for the spectator to laugh are filled with uneasiness.
