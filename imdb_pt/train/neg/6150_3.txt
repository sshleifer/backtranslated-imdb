I saw this movie with the intention of not liking it. I am sure that it is not. It's one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the Oscars: all-movie music in almost every picture, almost without swearing, set for a long time, sepia images, pretentious title, NO SEX, and a genius that explains everything what he thinks and concludes in sfx / cgi so that we (the stupid public) understand it. One thing that amused me, however, is the fact that they spelled THE WRONG NOBEL PRICE! Instead, they call the price of the Nobel (in honor of a real person named Alfred Nobel) "the noble price" ... Jesus! How can one make this mistake in such a large production, supposedly based on a true story? What a farce! What were you and others thinking RON?
