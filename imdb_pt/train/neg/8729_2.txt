This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions around, but that is confusing and disjointed in the execution. Garcia stars as John Berlin, a LA forensic detective who moved to a small California town at the request of a friend of his in the force there. He soon becomes involved in investigating an unresolved murder that leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one believes. The known victim is theoretically blind, which leads to a romance with a blind girl to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind. <br /> <br /> Despite a basically intriguing story, there were many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie, where I found myself thinking, 'How the heck did we end up here? or "how do we find this out?" I found myself confused and disjointed, despite good acting, etc. John Malkovich has a small part in the end as an F.B.I. researcher out to get Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
