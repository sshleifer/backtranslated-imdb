This 30-minute documentary that Bunuel did in the early 1930s on one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, let's admit that, 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring on problems of its own, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, although in all wealth far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain, it was not exactly with the kind of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European-style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the film is this: in one scene, the narrator reprimands that in school, children learn the value of Pi. Teach math to the poor, the horror! The lack of vision of Buñuel is more evident here, without realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor to overcome their situation. What is he proposing? Do children learn exactly what in school? Buñuel does not understand that it is the lack of modern technology that makes them poor compared to other people?
