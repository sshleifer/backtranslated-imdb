* Can anyone tell me WHERE IS COMEDY ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian, (Thomas Haden Church) seems so weak (with him!), and the whole thing is so dumb! <br /> <br /> * They tried to make a live comic book that turned out to be a comic super nightmare and was not even funny? Like the plane scene in the bathroom; was so good with his cinematic imagination, but nothing more ... except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ?? Your relationship with your daughter ??! <br /> <br /> This is really a type of work they did to make money from it but it became a crime when THAT money would be stolen from the very knots that were fooled by such a low art work and one entertainment had absolutely no entertainment. <br /> <br /> Well, it would have been uglier if it was a big production and starring Brando in his career. golden years with a REAL star. <br /> <br /> * Sheen's family here. Just be aware of this! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who has found himself admiring this movie or - Forbidden God - loving! So you should go directly to therapy before it becomes more dangerous and hurt anyone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but the movie is not! And he was not intending to be one here after reading this for sure !! But the main big problem is that no one has ever worked on this thing trying, or wanting, to be a little clever or even good !!! (Sorry, I'm crying now! The movie is torturing is unbelievable!). <br /> <br /> There's a scene where (Brando) hits (Mira Sorvino) for his shoes! That was so realistic! Maybe he was seeing her, so he was punishing himself for being such a mess! <br /> <br /> * For the first time: this could have been better (or worse!). The script, until the train robbery, was cool and I figured they'd escape to have some chase like Smokey and the Bandit, but with (Brando) as the sheriff. In fact, any of these chimeras was very pious of what I watched! <br /> <br /> * Why did not this masterpiece receive any Razzie awards?! Do you want me to believe that there was a smaller movie than that? I do not think so ! It's a situation where the Razzie supervisor must win one for his negligence !! <br /> <br /> * Martin Sheen is here as a guest actor, perhaps for supporting his bankrupt son, but ironically the father was as unsuccessful as his son. ! and why this ?! Good ! Because I hate Martin Sheen, maybe more than I hate comic movies were not as good as their ambition! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comedy movie, NO .. It's a horror! And I hate horror movies, especially those that have been advertised as comics! <br /> <br /> * Name good thing about it? Hmmm! Well, this compared to another movie by Marlon Brando's monsters (The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996) would be close to (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: If you still want to know what the bad, the ugly and the ugly are or are exactly in this movie .. Just do your last prayers and go watch them .. God help you !
