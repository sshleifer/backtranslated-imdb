-can contain spoilers ... but believe me, this movie spoils itself from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I entered this movie with great expectations. It was my fault. I had invested a lot in Steve Carell's record to this day. 40 Year Old Virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... The Office. And I also made the mistake of coming to IMDb and see a rating of 7.5 user before going to the movie. It's always been a good prospect in the past, but something is definitely out lately. The last time I felt so embarrassed and with so much pain in a movie was to watch "Blue Steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> This movie got in the way from beginning to end. The script was clumsy material. Horrible writing around. "Love killer"? "Love is a skill"? Whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that hit the writer (s) of American Beauty ... trying to get too angry. The entire movie was peppered with moments from Three's Company, as the horrible and artificial shower scene. Or the senseless / confused aerobic scene. Or the terrible laundry scene. When you think that something serious and / or real is about to happen, they throw one of those terrible moments. And it happens again and again and again. <br /> <br /> And what about Carell's character? The guy knows a bit of a limp in a bookstore and suddenly he's in love? Let's face it. Their talk sucked. The two of them should have said goodbye after a few minutes. Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune to watch this movie ... Carell's character is trying to say something that is absolutely random and not funny (I think the exact line was "this time when I was a kid" ... it's that ... serious, "but both are laughing so hard that the coffee is about to come out of their noses.The actors themselves seemed to be in pain, wondering why they are being directed to do what they are doing. /> <br /> Back to the thing of the IMDb ... you need to figure out a way to keep the team promoting a movie off this site.I know it is impossible but it is painfully obvious that the first 20 or more ratings / ratings were posted by 12 year olds, or by studio hired minions.Check out the Family Stone rating ... if this is a mid 5 then this absolutely has to be a 2 ... and this is push- it.
