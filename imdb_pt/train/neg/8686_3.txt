I'm marking this as a "spoiler" just because of some of my comments about the content of the program, not for the content itself. <br /> <br /> In reading the comments, it is apparent that those Republicans somehow tolerate the program. , but scorn, while the Democrats seem to delight in its so-called truthfulness. Even a reader (it seems) indicates that he believes that these events happened or could have happened when Bush was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> But as for the content I see, trying to be neutral, is that the group that made this series must really be really hating Bush. In the last 2/2 episode he showed that the show must have been set up long before McCain became the leader of the nomination; because the other former front runners are all featured. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention was the use of add-in cabinets. I thought the series must have been made in Europe, certainly not in the US, because I do not know any homes in the United States that do not have built-in cabinets, and most probably in artists' homes. <br /> <While watching the program, yes, I am surprised by this, and I am amazed to see what a great desire writers must do to do what they can to embarrass our president. Of course there are problems, as most Americans will agree, but this is no reason to be so hateful at public views seen around the world. Perhaps the trend has now been defined by this program and network, so that if Obama or Hillary entered, they would continue to produce and convey the same kind of "humor" about them? <br /> <br /> Just one more comment the comments of a commentator. If there was some kind of change in the 2000 election, according to this writer, he was so certain there would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking on your part. As for the 911 events, I believe he was put into action when Clinton was president, and I can not see how Gore was president, anything would be very different.
