It's a remake of Thing (1982/1951), I think it is, there are so many factors det det films that deny it. <br /> <br /> So the acting is bad, James Spader makes a stargate superlux reenactment of himself, with his mug and his strange thought / moves, but that's about it, the other actors I did not even notice. You do not have the feeling of meeting someone of the main characters. And the evolution of the plot is slow, boring and, I know what's about to happen in 30mins. Score / music is over-elaborated, there are a lot of talented people out there that would score for a coke and a credit, but that's a big crap. Some of the special effects are good if they were made in the early 90's. If you like Slimy Aliens, shivers and emotions, do not do this with this movie. It's a monotonous combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay productions that were really pretty bad. Now that combination would be cool if someone knew what they were doing, and the only ones in that production who knew it was nobody. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen much worse, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are awake on a cold night and just want to look at something, it will pass the time slowly.
