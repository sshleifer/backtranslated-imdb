After realizing the high rating in IMDb, I decided to go see this movie. In addition to this high rating, I intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews. I wanted to go to the theater with a clean record, without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my rating, you can see that I was disappointed. I liked the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also liked how the hotel manager tried to convince him to enter the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary things. <br /> <br /> First chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts credibly. He's scared. I'm encouraged and I think to myself, this is going to be good. The people who made this movie understand that less is more. <br /> <br /> But what happens next was a big disappointment. The subtlety is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach ... Just blow the audience with all the Hollywood tricks in the book and expect something to work. Let's see, a watch radio that connects alone? Well, this is always scary. Objects that move around the room? Well, you can not complain about that. Blood dripping from the walls and sink? Great. Ghosts who commit suicide? Good. Anything else? How about loud noises, tremors, fire, more tremors, messing up the room, more blood, etc., etc. It's all right. And everything was done before. Overestimate our attention deficit by disrupting the public with all sorts of things in rapid succession, and they will not be able to look away. <br /> <br /> Well, it did not work for me. And you know what else? When I go to see a horror movie in a theater, it is typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience screaming in fear at scary moments. But this movie did not have scary moments. The audience was silent and disinterested. I did not feel cold in my spine. Anything. The Illuminated was 100 times what this movie tries to be. <br /> <br /> So who are these people who are saying it's one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry, I just did not get it.
