Wow. I thought this might be tasteless, but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good "car accident" movie: those that are so bad that you can not look away because you want to see how bad they can get. This is really the only reason why I could let the television on - morbid fascination. It was not so much acting, it was just mediocre or a bit worse than you would expect from this cast, but the premise and plot that you should never have seen in the light of day. The script is also moaning. As for cinematography, someone else noticed that they used a device follows "drawing curtains" as in an old TV show from the 50's ... but without irony? At first I thought they should be kidding, but the film takes itself too seriously to have used it in an ironic way. Do not even ask me about the score ... the only high point is the last song, from Morcheeba. I think they wanted to leave people with something for their $ 8 ... happy that I saw on TV !!!!! Just silly! I wonder if that's why Timothy Hutton had trouble finding a lot of work recently. I think if you do not expect too much, and want to watch an irrational thriller, it would be better than spending a night cropping your nails, which is why it deserves a 2.
