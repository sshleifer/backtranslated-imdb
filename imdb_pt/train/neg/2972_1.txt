My teacher recorded this and showed us in Child Care to show how teenage pregnancy affects people. He just demonstrated how teenage pregnancy affects a not properly educated child athlete about how sex works and a whiny, unloved girl who throws fruit when she is angry and could not say she was with the wrong man, even if he used it a sign saying he was like that. I would not be surprised if the baby's father had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's mother (the baby carrier) is a riot. She is oblivious to the fact that her daughter has passed the age of four and is apparently not shocked when people spy on her through the dining room window. Bobby's best friend's name (father) is Dewey, and is an obvious robbery of Sean Penn's character in Ridgemont High's Fast Times. This movie is horrible, simply because none of the characters is believable. Thank God it's only made for TV, limiting the public's chances of viewing it.
