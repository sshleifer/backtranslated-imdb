I thought I read somewhere that this was the last production of the monogram, but whether this is true or not, does not matter, because if it was not then it should have been. It's a bland mortal affair starring John Carradine with a little gray in his hair to look like an older scientist who's experimenting with the help of his young apprentice (Robert Shayne) to bring the dead back to life. Every time their subjects are revived, they appear to have a whitish face like marble as they lie tied to the lab table (big deal). Carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after he is dead, and the mutt gains an unusual ability to traverse walls in a ghostly way (wooooooooohhhh). That's all she wrote. <br /> <br /> For an ultra-cheap monogram quickie, this thing, at least, actually uses a more upscale lab setup than it usually gets. The funniest joke in the movie is that the "older" doctor Carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant Shayne as "m'boy" when in fact Carradine was 40 and Shayne was 45 when they did it!
