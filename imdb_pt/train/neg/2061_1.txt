The only movie I've ever had. Incredible, since I paid for myself and my date and I am very cheap. But my brain could not handle the fall of the dreck anymore, particularly because I could have written a funnier material while tied and gagged. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end this movie offends. Worse, it's not funny. It was not funny, and certainly not funny now. But even worse, this movie represents the beginning of the end of the really clever and sophisticated comedy. It's a really noble line-up and youthful ideas, and ideas have begun an era (which continues to this day), where cheap laughter and sexual innuendo dominates the culture of comedy in the movies. <br /> <br /> The Sex Olympics? What high school kid did not think of that? The beginning of the end.
