Why watch this? There is only one reason and that is for the greatness of John Saxon. I love your acting. My most favorite appearances are on Nightmare On Elm Street, number 1, and 7 as Nancy's father, a police officer, Black Christmas as a police officer, and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a police officer. When I was scouring my local video store, I came across the movie Zombie Death House and quickly threw it back, but before moving on, I realized that John Saxon was not just an actor in this movie, but for the first time I heard of it of a director. That intrigued me (also the cheap $ 9.00 price) and me and I had to have it. Upon arriving home, I realized that this film did not correspond to Saxon's work, not even his performance, which may have been confused by the additional pressures of the direction. But it was not only him that the other actors were also sucked. It looked like everyone had been pulled out of a recent filming of porn and told you that you really need to act. The movie looks even like the quality of 80's porn. I can not in good faith recommend this movie to casual viewers, but if you're a fan of the 80s who lost the culture that came from that era for being born late , or a fan of crappy movies than this is for. Also, if you dig John Saxon like I do.
