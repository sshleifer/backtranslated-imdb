Have the in-laws over the weekend? So this is the movie to hasten your departure, failing to induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from the constant insistence. <br /> <br /> The movie is supposed to be set aboard a luxury cruise ship, which is more old-fashioned car raft; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a dredged cast from the depths of the D celebrity list. An interesting piece of fun is playing "Spot the Villain" when passengers join the ship. You will not be wrong !!!! With a script that sinks faster than a brick, cliches and copious quantities of raspberry jam doubles as blood this movie tries to embrace the genres of suspense, action movie and feast, and at the same time fails to meet any of them. > <br /> A must have, just to laugh at how bad it is.
