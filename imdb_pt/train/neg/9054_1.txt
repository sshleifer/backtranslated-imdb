If you hate redneck accents, you're going to hate this movie. And to make matters worse, you see Patrick Swayze, a man who tries to be a hick. I really can not stand redneck accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was boring in that movie. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How much more hickish this movie can get? The plot was stupid. I'm not usually that moviegoer, but I could not handle this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see the Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... numbers ... I think I'll wrap it up and give it to my grandmother for Christmas. It could just be that I can not stand redneck accents normally, or that I can not stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze was not in it. I did not laugh once in the movie. I laugh at anything stupid usually. If they had shown someone's fingers being crushed, I might have laughed. the fingers of people being crushed by accident always make me laugh.
