To Die For (1989) was just another d.t.v. a feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties. The only notable thing about this feature was the last movie that Duane Jones appeared in. Other than that, there's no reason to watch this vampire movie unless you like pseudo-girl movies disguised as a horror movie. A weary vampire longs for love and seeks out on the back streets of Los Angeles looking for him. Will he succeed or will Vlad only strike again like he did in the last century? <br /> <br /> This movie must have been great because some sequences soon followed. They are so bad they make it look like a classic. I know this is a vampire movie, but the filmmakers might have gotten used to the lighting. <br /> <br /> Not recommended by me because I did not like it. <br /> <br /> Nuff said?
