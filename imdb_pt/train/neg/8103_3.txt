This is possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not care what the critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with the Kundera novel. It's not that it's non-flammable; is like 99% of his work, is pretentious and exaggerated. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters are seen as a navel, and his novels as a whole are misogynist. I read many of his works (even his socialist realist poetry. That was really awful) - I just do not understand what the fuss is about. Features (such as self-absorption) in their novels contribute to the enraging reading. In a movie, all the things I do not like about Kundera have been magnified. Maybe I missed something, but I do not think so. On a side note, I can not believe this is a DVD from the Criterion collection. No way this movie is essential.
