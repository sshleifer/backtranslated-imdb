Me and a friend rented this movie because it looked pretty good. But we were wrong. First of the acting .... wow ... the acting was the worst, the effects were very bad too, it looked like a movie made by a college kid. The plot was very good, but it was done. What most ruined the movies were the actors. The main actor was the worst actor of all time ... it's a shame that I'm calling him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad it was funny ... so if you want a good laughter see this ... but otherwise ... stay away from it. I usually love B movies and such, but this one here ... I do not know how it was even even put on video ... this is the worst I've ever seen .. and I've seen some bad ones.
