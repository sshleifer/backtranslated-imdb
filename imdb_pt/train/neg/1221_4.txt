I remember the days when Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty little face that adorned movies with characters typical of the stupid Blondie, romantic interest, or damsel in distress. But it all changed when she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent film LA Confidential, and I do not think I was the only one who was surprised by her solid performance. However, after that moment, his career did not follow the ideal path. Of course, the prestige she earned from this film made her to participate in moderate-prestige films (such as People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we have never seen her in a substantial character. The film While She Was Out does nothing to put her in this situation; and it is not only that her character is not very tasty, but also that the film is really bad. The script for this movie could not be more hollow and basic. However, Basinger brings some conviction to her character, and this makes this poor movie to earn a few points. This movie is full of cliches and generic villains. Director Susan Montford's work is truly disastrous for many reasons but mostly because the film never gets a good pace and tone. The ending of this movie is extremely ridiculous. I do not recommend it while it was out at all. This movie commits the capital sin of being annoying.
