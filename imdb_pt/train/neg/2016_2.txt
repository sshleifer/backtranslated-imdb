***** Warning: May contain SPOILERS ********* My HUGE problem with this movie is how totally self-centered and self consuming the adulterous woman is !! After having a night with a slimy psychopath, she is being pursued by him. He constantly calls her and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together. He is obviously crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she just thinks he's dangerous to her (and exposing her secret). Not for a second did she have a thought of concern for her husband! Did she even think for a moment that he would be in danger with this psycho? As soon as she realized how mental he was, she should have warned her husband, no matter what the consequences. Maybe there was not a movie, but there really was not one, so what's the difference?
