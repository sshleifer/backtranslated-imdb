This film was a rather strange viewing experience. The film is obviously based on a game. Now, I'm sure that everything in this movie works very well in one play, but in one movie it does not seem very interesting enough to watch. The movie is very 'stagey' and they did not even bother to change some of the dialog boxes to make it more suitable for a movie. Instead, what is presented now is almost literally a re-filming of a play, with exaggerated characters and staged dialogues. For all this, the plot really does not work out and the film becomes an almost complete and obsolete viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It takes a while for you to find out that this is a comedy you watching. At first you think it's a drama you're watching, with quirky characters, but as the movie progresses, you realize that the film is more of a tragic comedy, one that tilts more to the comedy genre than to the dramatic genre . The characters and dialogues are really the things that make this movie a quirky and overdone film that sometimes really becomes unattainable. Of course, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York among others, but they really do not elevate the film to a level of 'watchable' enough. <br /> <br /> The story seems totally disoriented. Basically, the story is about nothing and focuses mainly on the brother / sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is the story? The film looks like a useless and obsolete one that has very little to offer. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to see on stage, but how a movie is not really appropriate and just does not work out. <br /> <br /> The editing is simply awful and even makes up ridiculous bad in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> More was to wait for director J. Lee Thompson, who obviously made much better movies than this, failed, theatrically translated to screen, project. <br /> <br /> It really is not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
