There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are pretty fun. "Criminally Insane 1" was one of those films. So bad it was enjoyable and had re-watch value to it. "Criminally Insane 2" has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me, which is saying a lot, because I'm not the kind of person who says anything is the worst. But trust me, this was completely horrible and running only 1 hour is 1 hour too much. <br /> <br /> The film has a rather incoherent plot but who cares about the story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she is not being fed. Well, you do not see it in this movie, except for all the flashback sequences that come first. The new plot could have been really funny, with Ethel being sent to a middle house and murdering everyone there, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and by that point, you're already asleep. <br /> <br /> The camera work in this movie is simply atrocious. It literally reminds me of something I photographed with my friends when I was 15 years old. Sound quality is something else because you can not understand a word that most characters are saying. To give an example of how bad it is to get into a New York subway and try to understand what is being said about the speakers, this is how this movie sounds. Not that it matters what they're talking about anyway, because the actors are as dry as a piece of wood. <br /> <br /> Now I know that saying that this is the worst movie out there is very hard, but the words may not describe how bad this movie is. If you do not believe me, see for yourself. 1/10
