Well where do I start? I think it's very insulting to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie, and I was hoping this was a brilliant movie, but I was so disappointed! the acting is horrible, the original Annie came out a few years before I was born, I am now 25 years old and Annie is still one of my favorite movies so I was very excited to see Annie 2. The acting was horrible in the movie, some of the characters was it original? very poorly written, directed and acted. This is not a movie that I would like to see again, and any lover of Annie, I recommend that you do not watch this movie because it will only leave you very disappointed. The girls singing are not bad, but they still do not compare to the original
