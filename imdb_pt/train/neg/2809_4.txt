When I look at my college days at Ohio State, there will always be an event that I will remember with fond memories. Channel 23 is the UO local access channel and, up to the last few years, practically reproduced everything that was sent. This included many DIY films from a guy marshmallow making pips and then scanning pictures of them online, to a version of Macbeth starring 8th graders who apparently had just learned how to do abortions. <br /> <br /> However, the king In my opinion, the formation of channel 23 was Midnight Skater. The first time I watched it was around 2 in the morning. I should be studying. Or sleeping. Or watching regular TV. But no, all this is for sissies. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was complete, I do not think any of us believed that a movie had just happened. But sure enough, it was a few nights later, and we had to understand that this movie, in fact, existed. <br /> <br /> I could keep talking about how awful it is, but it's the kind of awful thing that makes life worth living. The plot is disjointed, the acting is terrible, the scar the soul is all but, by God, if there are others watching with you, it is impossible not to have fun watching. It's like the first time you hear "Guts" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You listen, you are disgusted and shaken, but five minutes later, all you want and desire is to have someone else try the abject horror that you just endure. <br /> <br /> In short, Midnight Skater, for all its epic failures, makes for some very late night fun. Also, I desperately want the theme for Midnight Skater. Many compliments to anyone who wrote and sang. Sweet God, I love this song.
