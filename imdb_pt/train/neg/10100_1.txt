I usually support independent art and I try to be very understanding and tolerant ... I try to support everyone because their efforts are worth it ... <br /> <br /> but this film just moves away from all understanding and tolerance limits! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following situation: 1. Think about the REALLY WORSE horror movie you've seen in your life so far. <br /> <br /> 2. think of some great and attractive ART for the movie DVD box ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! you have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br/> Just look if you really have nothing better to do. ANYTHING is better.
