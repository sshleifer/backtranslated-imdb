Not only did they pick up the wrong characters, not only do the voices suck, not only do writers seriously need to have girlfriends, not only are the designs really raw, but it looks like it was created primarily for ages 1 to 6 years. The only episode I've seen of this show that kept me watching was "A Mattter Of Family," because I liked the character Robin. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of Batman The Animated Series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce is friends with Harvey Dent, yes? Throughout a two-episode story, he becomes the unlikely villain, TwoFace. On the "Show" Bruce is Friends with Ethan's face, and over a two-episode story, he becomes the unlikely villain ClayFace. That was just a small example (this may not be true), but in short, this is the worst attempt in a Batman series. And that's saying something.
