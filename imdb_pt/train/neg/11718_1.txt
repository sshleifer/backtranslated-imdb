This is amazing!! .. Yes, someone before me wrote that it was a wasted time to sit and watch this movie .. it is! Do not do it! I'm totally annoyed! I liked Wesley Snipes, and I found it funny that he touched the meaning of his name on a movie. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (at home, of course), but now (soon after) I'm absolutely disappointed! It was his worst movie ever. Inwatchable !! Bad actor-play! Bad cameraman! Bad scenario! .. Just a good think: that wonderful girl! Must be a mannequin for sure! Eeeeh !! .10 MB minimum lines?! I do not want to waste your time to read my opinion! I hope, I was clear and not very stable, because English is not my native method of speaking. So, have time grate, and see good movies, as I try too .. Peace!
