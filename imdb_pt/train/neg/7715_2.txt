Yes, this can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned the crap out of their minds and created the worst Sc-Fi musical of comedy and horror. If there is any performance, it is terrible or far above the limit. Special effects; make your choice ... very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap clich√© is used. Undoubtedly, a fun movie to watch. Worth a pack of six or two cold ones. Point your finger at the radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow almost the size of a tow truck and begin to attack mankind. San Diego is a good place to start. Scientists and a distracted military man must find their way to stop this red menace rolling. This favorite cult features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
