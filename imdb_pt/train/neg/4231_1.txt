I felt compelled to watch this movie all the time, since I had found it in a box and bought it for mine, but I came too often to turn it off and just write the money I had paid for it. If you are a fan of blood and sadism, this movie is good. If there is one thing that the makers of this movie know, it's the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect. If this does not excite you, then stay away. <br /> <br /> This movie is filmed on a home video camera, with elementary school props and terrible actors. It's nicknamed German, but even allowing it, the sound is horrible. This film is as budget as budget, except for the special effects mentioned above. If they had spent a little more money on actors and a real screenplay instead of blood and guts, the film could have been a little more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story is about three men who land on an inhabited island. by an army of tin mask sadists. They are captured and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape. I call it a story in the broadest sense, as it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat, chained by a dialogue full of obscenities. <br /> <br /> There is nothing redeeming about this movie unless you Gore meaningless. Consider yourself warned.
