I can not really say what I think about this movie, it is against the guidelines, I watched many movies, and this has to be the worst yet, extremely low budget, I'm guessing that all the money went into the slaughterhouse scenes because I could have done a better job with an 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys. It was so bad that I just registered to leave a comment, because I had to tell someone, the location of movie rentals was not enough. But this is my 2 cents worth, I suggest lending it to some poor sap who rented it and watched it alone. Because I'm sure I would not waste the money on myself again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope their is not done at the rental location when they will not refund your money .. =)
