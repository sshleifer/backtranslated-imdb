It has to be one of the worst wastes of 35mm films already released to the public, the sequence of the original pseudo-documentary film "The Legend of Boggy Creek", at least fun. Bad script, worst performance, etc., etc. Dawn Wells had to be expecting Gilligan to come and rescue her and take her back to the island just to escape the trap.
