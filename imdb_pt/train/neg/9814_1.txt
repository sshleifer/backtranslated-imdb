This is the kind of movie you regret having put on your VCR. It is a very strange version of the film "Misery (1990)" of Stephen Kings. I can not understand how this movie got a 5.2 rating because it does not have a story, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been released as a short film. instead ... a lot of time is spent on the same thing. And like all bad movies, everything happens at the end of the movie in a period of 10 to 15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> So, before deciding to watch this movie, do not forget to put new batteries on your remote because you're going to do the whole batch of fast-forwarding ... do not worry, you will not miss anything important.
