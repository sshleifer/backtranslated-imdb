Joe's opening line tells everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the Isle of Pathetic Men) and involves Joe Don Baker chasing an Italian mobster. The character of Joe Don is called Geronimo and everything he does in this movie is to shoot people and be arrested repeatedly. Everyone in the movie hates him, just like everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked an earlier photo of Greydon, "Angel's Revenge," because it was a shirne for one-year-old boys. Avoid this movie at all costs !!
