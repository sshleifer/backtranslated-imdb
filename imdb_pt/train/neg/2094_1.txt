I had to endure distress in adolescence, high school and family conflicts for most of the show. I do not really care about high school girls worried about their relationships. I spent my time in hell dealing with these issues and I do not worry about the fictitious teenagers who are going through "lite" versions of the horrors I've endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. There were a few science-fiction seconds at the end of the show. Finally, we see a proto-cylon. It was good, but with a problem. Her red spot on her eye would focus on an object of interest. We all know that Cylon's eyes always scan back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world. The red eye never stops moving back and forth. <br /> <br /> I really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode.
