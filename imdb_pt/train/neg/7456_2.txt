This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's coming. The producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and I want it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. His shrill, rattling, crazy voice starts to get old, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is a lot worse. He falls into a long list of former SNL players who have tried to make movies. Some were brilliant, some failed miserably. There is not much middle ground in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant, and then okay, and then not so funny, and then dead ... so I guess he reaches the whole spectrum in a career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a plague. br
