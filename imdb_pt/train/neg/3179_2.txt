I saw this movie by chance yesterday at a movie theater. I had some hopes for the movie because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book it is based on. The movie starts well, at first seems like a good suspense. Quickly, the film becomes a mess with uninteresting plots, characters that are never perfected and no one in the audience cares (as Marjoke) and a terrible issue. The film disappeared into black pieces that are too long, a confusing chronology that comes and goes and many scenes that simply do not add anything to the story and could easily have been discarded. After suffering with the story, you'll be treated to one of the worst endings I've seen in a long time. It should also be mentioned that the film has many explicit sex scenes that you are probably accustomed to if you watch a lot of Dutch films. It's hard to mention a few good things about this movie. About a third of the audience had already left the movie theater until the middle of the movie and I did not hear a kind word after the movie was over. Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed whatever faith I had left in the Dutch film industry.
