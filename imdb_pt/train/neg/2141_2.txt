I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first one. This movie sucked! The magic of the first was lacking. You can really understand every word the rats say, the animation is bad, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that were never mentioned before and they were terrible, luckily the prince did not have many lines that kept him. to sound stupid. Basically it's like The Lion King 1 1/2, except for their different stories all told by the rats. The reason I'm giving a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the nicest.
