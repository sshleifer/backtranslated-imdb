The point of Wolfe's original novel - indeed, the point of all history - is that things happen because of a carefully calculated sense of convenience. The goal is survival within a particular type of lifestyle. The novel is full of malice. The only relationship that sounds emotionally true is that between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and that's just touched. In addition, everyone is out of it that can get in the way of advertising, power, money or self-aggrandizement. <br /> <br /> Wolfe was criticized for reaching all of the characters and all social segments of New York City in the head. . His response was a denial. After all, he lived in New York and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, just the qualifications one would want on his resume to deny that he did not like New Yorkers. (Wolfe has a PhD in American Studies from Yale and is not a dummy.) These alleged weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. No one was good. And Sherman McCoy went bankrupt, a professional protester for social justice. The film throws it all away and imposes a moral framework on the story that simply does not fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Every event was not only possible but totally believable. Wolfe could have made a great cultural anthropologist - he knows how to get into a system and record its details. <br /> <br /> Yes, any of us could have found us, like Sherman and his lover, the South Bronx, threatened by a pair of black children, and making a refuge after bumping into one of them. This scene is transferred from print to celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after this scene the film does not seem to trust its audience and sometimes becomes frantic in its attempt to enunciate its message, however nebulous the message. <br /> <br /> Sherman may accidentally hit some child and be arrested for it as he is in the novel, but he would not immediately after his release from prison return to his phenomenally expensive condominium, take a shotgun, and start shoot the ceiling with it, as it does in the movee. In what should be a funny scene, ceiling plaster falls on the party guests and they run away, screaming. That simply would not have happened. The film left the unspeakably detailed reality of the novel in the dust. Wolfe's sensitivity, the work he put into capturing the real, was lost. What we have instead is a noisy, fantastic and silly scene that does nothing but wake up the audience. Following are similar empty scenes, screaming for Wolfe's verisimilitude. <br /> <br /> The film also fails, because it imposes much sin and redemption on a fun story of moral nihilism. Here we see "Don Juan in Hell" in the opera. We have received lectures on the redemption of a poet with AIDS. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bank and makes one of these final speeches about how we should all begin to behave again. A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman descends breaking the law with an idiotic grin. The scene sits on the film as a jester's cap on the head of a circus elephant. <br /> <br /> The film not only makes points that are already banal and unoriginal, but exaggerates them, as if the public were unable to absorb subtleties. <br /> <br /> It is not the acting or the direction that is poor. The movie is not bad in these aspects. And the picture is also very good, including two rather spectacular scenes - the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde. It is the script that is completely unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie, approximately, is well in design and execution. It retains some of the small details of the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog is called Marshall. Who the hell would ever name a Marshall dog? He loses his focus almost completely in the second half and overall is not worth watching. Wolfe's capricious and cynical leftism may be offensive to many people, but he has the balls to launch Percepta. Unfortunately, the writers and producers did not have the guts to pick them up, so they took the opportunity to do a fascinating study of New Yorkers.
