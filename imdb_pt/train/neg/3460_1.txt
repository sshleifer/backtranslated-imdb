Oh man, this movie already bites! If you've ever been scared to see a replay of the slasher genre, done as cheaply as possible and more cautious at the same time (friendly to PC, means no nudity, a classic element of horror movies). Every clich√© is retreaded without a sign of self-awareness and acting. Oh, acting redefines the word horror. I should have known better as the direct Dutch translation of the title would have given me the tip.
