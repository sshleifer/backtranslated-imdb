This is an abysmal part of storytelling. It's about an hour in the movie before we get a good idea of ​​what it's supposed to be; the characters often whisper inaudibly; actions often seem to have no relation to each other; no one seems to be concerned about who really murdered the girl; A pair of scary boys swim in waters that look menacing, but nothing happens; the Irishman gets punched in the face of one of his friends for no apparent reason ... continuing would be as boring as the movie itself. The only half-element of entertainment is landscape photography; but anyone could aim a camera in the Australian outback to get memorable photos. General - sad, incoherent, pretentious - and frankly annoying to waste so much of the viewer's time.
