The title should have been the walker. The guy spends 90% of the movie walking. He does not know what he wants or what he is. Go through life stealing people's identity for nothing. He receives no benefit, no money, nothing pretending to be someone else. <br /> <br /> No body was able to understand why he was pretending to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was clear in this movie is that he loves his father and was a good son. But the rest sucked. <br /> <br /> May be director is a loser who would like to be someone else. But what he really should do is get a real job, because after the movie, I do not think he has the chance to become a filmmaker.
