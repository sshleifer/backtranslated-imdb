This is truly terrible: painfully irritating stylized artists squeak and resemble richly incoherent dialogues that take place in scenes that seem to have no purpose, beginning, middle or end, cut together without any apparent narrative or cognitive intent, all at the service of some "history" entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable. What makes it worse is the movie's "styling" claim: Suddenly, a remote-head crane spirals down and, for no apparent reason, there are sudden whips or wobbly parts: all this "style" only serves to almost unbelievably huge design misconception and the almost offensive emptiness of the material. Definitely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
