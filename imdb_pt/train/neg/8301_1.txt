Too bad. Why does someone think this is a good movie and a lot less funny is a true mystery. I like comedies as much as the next man and I loved "A Christmas Story". The fact of having the same director and drawing on the same writer's memories leaves me completely baffled by why this film is such a complete failure on all levels. Charles Grodin is woefully miscast as the father for beginners. On the other hand, it does not seem to have the same rhythm - it simply does not flow well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joy of life that permeated the first film is completely missing here - you just want the movie to end. I would not even recommend this movie to onlookers who liked "A Christmas Story". It's so bad. 1/10
