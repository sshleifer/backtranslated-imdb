I liked Boyle's performance, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Everything was exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke as if they expected their nine-year-old nephew to talk about whether he was pretending to be a tired, stone-heartned cop or an ultra-evil villain. The hoarse voice sounded amateur to me. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and open the music better. And what about all the police torture of 1984? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. This is a big disappointment, because one of the things that makes Borges's stories so good is his minimalism - they are intimately linked, without superfluous details. This movie is just the opposite. I stopped watching after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy from the Yidische Zaitung, or out there. I lost $ 4 renting this, but at least I can get some satisfaction out of writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake.
