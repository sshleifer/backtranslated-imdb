... then they'll have an appropriate place to file that crap. Sorry, not a "mystery" as alleged, it's mumbo-jumbo religious. I waited for the "unimaginable evil" promised to me, but the "evil" in this film would be unimaginable by a five-year-old with learning disabilities. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that they actually managed to find some names of larger actors willing to get involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately my opinion has forever changed on them, and I'll probably avoid anything they do in the future. I'm also a little confused that I now have the name of a writer and the name of the director to memorize, since I will avoid anything they do like the plague from now on. <br /> <br /> It's really unfortunate that all religious fanatics posting here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc., will have their comments posted first. This could lead to more people being deceived, as I was, to believe that this movie was something other than religious preaching. <br /> <br /> Well, it's for the video store that I get my money back for misleading advertising. Too bad they can not give me back the 105 minutes I missed watching it thinking it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural film.
