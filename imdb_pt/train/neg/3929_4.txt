If that's all Watchowski has to offer in terms of a story behind the Matrix, then I really have to question the claims of all fans who believe that movies should register at a deeper level. The second revival, while visually stunning and beautiful, is clich√©d and ridiculous. How many times have we heard the history of humans relying too much on technology, human beings eager to make war, humans basically destroying themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the plot of the second rebirth, does not that make the machines the good guys? Machines are oppressed for generations by their vicious human rulers. They fight back, gain their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful and harmonious coexistence with humans, who reject them in favor of total warfare, which intelligent machines naturally gain. If this is the background story, then we should not be rooting for Neo, we should be rooting for the machines! The humans were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were brave and compelled to be compassionate. Since I do not believe that the Watchowski intend to favor machines over humans, I have to believe that the Second Renaissance was simply a misguided attempt to create a story behind.
