SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas makes his usual handsome tough guy, and his future real life, ex Kathleen Kinmont, is the orgasm of the hot Alexa. OJ Simpson is a detective, coming for his genius public persona gone missing ever since. Translation: filling of cable TV. There is not enough skin to qualify this as a Guilty Pleasure. <br /> <br /> The script has some holes. Best / Worst Time: In a shocking scene, OJ's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ responds that some of the bodies are too hot, or words to that effect. This vague reference to necrophilia is quite offensive; but in light of the murders committed shortly after the release of this film, it is truly terrifying and therefore entertaining in an unintentional and horrible way. I was so frightened that I laughed until the champagne came out of my nose. Now this is guilty pleasure. BC
