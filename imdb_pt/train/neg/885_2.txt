An anthology is always a risky business and I think this undertaking should be commended. There's a lot of talent involved here. A large number of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really appreciate this movie based on the three issues I had. <br /> <br /> First, the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them collide with each other. <br /> <br /> Secondly, several segments seem to me to be underdeveloped. Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. I'm not talking about happy endings here (or even a final period), but they have neither basic development nor solid configurations that appeal to you. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I did not feel New York and its inhabitants were properly portrayed. <br /> <br /> What remains are high-brow shorts that may still be of interest to some but leave the average viewer unsatisfied.
