Do not get me wrong, the film is beautiful, the scenes are impressive and the material is dramatic. However, it was a big disappointment and I really was very angry with what Disney had done. <br /> <br /> The BBC Earth Planet was all that and more. It was subtle. He had a general sense of balance and showed the complete cycle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> The Disney edition of Earth is nothing like that. They tried to make a movie that Americans would talk about. They did it DRAMATIC. They put a musical score above the top to scare us. They did evil predators. They did WALRUSES badly. They showed each encounter as negative. She tried to be full of suspense and success, but at the expense of balance lesson. The film was an hour and a half of negative portrait and only about 10 minutes of positive. <br /> <br /> I am all to prevent the global warning, but this was about the top political and environmental garbage. <br /> <br /> That's another thing, I went to see it on the big screen, but I was disappointed with the quality of the image. It looked better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and get the full picture, go out and buy, rent or borrow the BBC Earth Planet series. It's better lessons, better sound and (if you have Blu-Ray) better picture quality.
