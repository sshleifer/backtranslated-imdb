I thought before starting with this movie that it might be nice, but when I started with it I found it really horrible. They said the film is being made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film is made in India. you can see cars made in India. you can see lars drink bisleri (an Indian watermark), Hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * is really funny and many other things that proof is not filmed in Afghanistan. I guess you should not waste your time watching this movie .. pure waste of time .. I would recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or it may be heart may be a better idea, but do not watch this loss of time
