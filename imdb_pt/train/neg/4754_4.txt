I loved the original. It was brilliant and always will be. Strangely, however, I really expected to see the new version. I'm usually a bit against re-made because there are so many of them, but somehow that intrigued me. I was really enjoying this to begin with. Caine bright, as usual, and Jude Law managing to hold is next to him. It was very clever as it was modernized and was working. What keeps it from being really good is the last seven minutes. It goes completely away from the original so far, in fact, this ceases to be intelligent and just gets annoying. The ending in the original was fantastic! So much tension was built and was incredibly clever! This one? It does not grow in tension, but in frustration, because it seems that they have decided to make the character of Caine a homosexual. It was if they were trying very hard to be different. And then ... BANG! Law is dead. Roll Credits. This movie is worth watching simply for performances, but the last seven minutes really knock it out. What a pity....
