Do not miss 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Women". It's annoyingly episodic script with three patched story lines is ridiculously bad due to predictable writing, horrible acting and even bad music. I found the main character anorexic disturbing to watch every time she was on the screen. She needs fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend the 90 minutes you would spend on this turkey doing something more exciting ... like trimming your toenails. You would have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The only thing left about this movie is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much better than this weary script. She's as impotent as the older guy she courted in the movie. <br /> <br /> THE VISITOR CAUTIONED!
