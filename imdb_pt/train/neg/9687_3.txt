This is a baffling movie. <br /> <br /> Beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown to be degraded by a group of men and women who can only be described as a collection of eccentrics and misfits. Greenaway recognizes his inspiration for Fellini's 8 1/2 movie, but while Fellini is a titan of the world's cinema, Greenaway is not. <br /> <br /> He does not have the lightness of the maestro's touch nor his ability to express feelings and emotions. with clarity of clarity. <br /> <br /> He is pretentious, the movie is divided into chapters with a written introduction for each one, as if the viewer had to be guided to the movie except that the written warnings were only on screen for a few seconds , not enough to be read by the public with the result that they are mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> As for women, only two can be described as lookers, Palmira, played by Polly. Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest flows with ordinariness. Both women and men step back from the harsh light of reality into the dark shades of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Greenaway obviously wants to show that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. The women themselves are depressing as they provide their services in exchange for money. Relations between men and women are downgraded in a business transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no feeling of joy, happiness or love in the film, in fact, there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant: <br /> <br /> The suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son, Philip and Storey Emmental, was played respectively by John Standing and Matthew Delamere. The insensitive indifference of both men that Giaconda is carrying her son, she in fact becomes pregnant twice, the first fetus being aborted and the second time, she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men in a flight book. The two men having sex with a woman who has no legs (the woman half in the title). The bestiality that exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig called Hortense. Father and son sharing women among them. Women enjoying being sexually beaten. The father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Mercifully, none of these scenes are shown sexually, just suggested. <br /> <br /> The suggested degradation of women is such that there is no wonder that the film was booed when it premiered in Cannes. What is most extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it, showing once again that there is no limit to the ingenuity of women and that women will be misled and exploited by men. Greenaway's directing style is pretentious, a triumph of style over substance, a depiction of Cinema as Art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense. Greenaway tries to achieve the sublimity of surrealism, but can only show the banality of human relations.
