Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other films, I find this film particularly annoying. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to Good Old USA at first, banal after a while, and finally annoying. Do not misunderstand me - I'm not anti-American - but it seemed the English were not right and / or needed that brave, oh so clever American visitor to show them the way. It's a "fish out of water" story, but unlike most movies of this type, this time it's the "fish" that has the upper hand. To be fair to me and to the movie, I watched it a few times in a few years and I get the same impression each time. I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and it also produced the same reaction in me and, to my surprise, even my wife - who, for what it's worth, is American - found the attitude "in his face" of the annoying American Crosby. Roosevelt, as she put it.) As for the premise of the film, it's unique enough for its day and the support cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music are also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the William Bendix wig looks awful (imagine Moe of the Three Stooges). <br /> <br /> For me this would be a much nicer picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby, but because he is in almost every scene, it is very difficult to sit in that movie.
