First of all, as a long-time student of the Titanic disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I do not really care about how many awards and accolades the movie has won, but to me it's still an absolutely horrible movie. Cameron had the resources to make a semi-documentary film 'fit' for the disaster, but unfortunately chose to turn it into a romantic porridge. The fact that so many people around the world fall apart just shows, in my opinion, the sad state of taste and common sense that critics and the movie audience have today. Who said that every movie should have a hero and a heroine falling in love? In fact, most of the actual events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster was certainly not one of them. I feel I needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and with as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up in the last sequence where the "dead" lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew that come out in applause. Is this a smart movie? Ask yourself.
