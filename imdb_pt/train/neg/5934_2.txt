I do not consider myself as one of Leonard Cohen's biggest fans. He, however, presents himself as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far the most valuable element of this documentary is listening to Leonard's reflections on his own life and career. Heating and humble. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians featured at the concert did not discuss the nuances of Leonard's musical / literary way. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were the exceptions, although Leonard greatly valued Rufus Wainrights' interpretations of his songs. <br /> <br /> What particularly failed in this documentary was the filmmaker's ability to allow the viewer to see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect with him. Much is said about this, but the viewer is not drawn to the person Leonard Cohen. This flaw is especially evident with interviews with Bono and Edge. They see Leonard as a special icon, but can not translate his exact Leonard Cohen figure. Collaboration with U2 is a scam. The whole live record looks like a rushed job. And just like throughout the film, only Leonard Cohen remains his part and can talk about his part. <br /> <br /> The entire montage and script is very much like an extramural high school project. Using effects such as echo, slow motion, or flash images is poorly placed. Part of the camera's work is discouraging. Some of the score hardly resembles any associations I might have expected. At times it seemed that the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film. Maybe a reference to your use of LSD. <br /> <br /> Some unintentional humor ... at some point, Leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre. Initially he can not remember the name of the genre, until eventually he says it was punk, the punks really got their music. "And I can not forget, I can not forget that I can not forget, but I do not remember who. "
