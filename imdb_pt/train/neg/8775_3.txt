LOC could have been a very well done film about how the Kargil war was fought; had the locals, the budget and the ability to have been the "Rescue of Private Ryan" from India or the "Black Hawk Down." Instead, it looks like a swollen nuisance of 4 hours trying to merge the war movement with the masala movie. Even the war scenes were terribly executed, using the same hill in every battle scene and wasting unnecessary time on casual conversations. Instead of trying to appeal to the Indian public, a better movie would have been an account of what happened in Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even spending time from a militant standpoint (such as "Torah", "Torah", "Torah"). Better yet, I could have used a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, direct and edit the film. Until then, I would like to see someone reissue this film, with only the pertinent parts included, it would make the film more watchable.
