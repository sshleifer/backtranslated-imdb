I was lucky enough to see A Chorus Line when it came to my city .. I was younger then .. but it was a great piece .. so could someone tell me why the hell they had to make a movie out and why Michael Douglas? He did not suit the role .. this movie really sucked BIG time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is do not rent this movie .. save your money for something better like "Cats" ....
