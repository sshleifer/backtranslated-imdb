I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and I realized that, no matter how stupid this movie is, I'll at least watch it kick some ass, right? Wrong. This is a monotonous and tedious mess of useless conversations, half-baked scripts, and nonsensical schemes. There are few action scenes of any kind, less martial arts scenes, and the few that are filmed and edited so poorly that you can not even understand what is happening in the world. The dub is also atrocious, and maybe the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that supposedly presents the Italian mafia ... EXCEPT THEM ALL are Japanese! Avoid like the plague - you would see better martial arts staring out the window of your local pre-school karate class for five minutes.
