You must be joking !!!! Let's consider the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, not just an entry into the "whim of the club of the month" of the actors. Really, unless this serves as an ironic satire on David Mamet - a confused and concise dialogue conveyed alternately in machine gun speed or monotonous tone (think of Ben Stein) - or a dry comedy; this movie has to be in contention for a Rotten Tomato Award --- or worse. <br /> <br /> As if the hard and uncomfortable Posey was not enough, we have the harder and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There is more wood in this film than a toothpicks factory. <br /> <br /> In addition to this already bizarre cast, there are several other roles, all filled with forgettable actors, who seem or sound like fugitives from America's Next Top Model, Don Pardo, or even the boy, who pronounces the word "been" as "bean", which only draws attention to the fact that there is so little to like this movie, we are analyzing his accent to guess whether he is Canadian or not !! I think I laughed in places that should be serious, and I took seriously sections that should be funny. Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alarik Jans' music for Mamet's "The House of Games." If taken as a parody, the movie is almost entertaining; if taken seriously, just a piece of self-conscious drek.
