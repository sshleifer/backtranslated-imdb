I used to have a fascination with drawing in college when it was being done. He had very much the charm of "Get Smart". Although admittedly flawed, it was quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was very interested to see the movie version. That was before I saw it. Later, I wish it had never been done. <br /> <br /> In addition to being miscast all around (who on Earth though Broderick was even close to the role?) He simply did not make the note. <br /> The effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing I liked about the movie; seeing a live-action version of the gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and a treatment that made it funny, charming, or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a crazy drawing with a very light attitude. It was fun. The film was obscure and took itself very seriously. If it had been a big plot or crazed enough to make it look like a "cartoon in the movie," it could have been nice. <br /> <br /> As it exists, it does not deserve to be considered part of the "Legacy Gadget".
