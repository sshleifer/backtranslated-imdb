I have seen many movies in my life, but not many as bad as that. It's a movie that makes fun of fat people, has no real story, has bad actors, is not funny and more. Is this a movie you would like to see? I think not! <br /> <br /> I think the creators of the movie were trying to be original and creative, but it looks like it was made by a 12-year-old with absolutely no cinematic ability. The so-called funny parts are as funny as passing pies on people's faces or breaking the wind. Of course if this is the kind of mood you like, then this is the movie for you !! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie!
