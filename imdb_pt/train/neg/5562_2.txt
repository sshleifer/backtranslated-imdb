This nasty movie has little to recommend it. Dolph Lundgren gives a performance that is better than this screenplay or his other action movies allowed. And there are occasional excerpts from dialogues that suggest the film could provide insight into a bizarre subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. The motivations are obscure or trivial. Most of the acting is insignificant. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the director's unnecessary fascination with focusing on gore is a distraction. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this movie.
