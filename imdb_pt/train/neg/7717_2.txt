When I heard the plot for this movie I simply had to see it, I mean whole cities being exterminated by murderous tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is as funny as it sounds. <br /> <br /> Led by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn who never takes off his clothes from SCUBA and Lieutenant Finletter who has never been portrayed without his parachute behind) 'Attack of the Tomatoes Assassins' is a parody of B-Movies, in particular the Japanese horror of the 1950's. The movie begins with a standard-sized tomato being discovered by women washing in their kitchen before we meet in the middle of a crime scene, since the tomato supposedly murdered this lady, and let me say that it does not get healthier. how the movie progresses To be fair, there are a few funny moments, for example, whenever the Japanese scientist Dr. Nokitofa says that his voice is dubbed with an American accent, or when the masquerade expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomato, can anyone please pass the ketchup? . Also this movie was probably a lot more fun in 1978, with everything so bad that it's a good concept. Unfortunately for 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' films like the series 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' have been released and made much better comedy ever since. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious; there is zero continuity in the edit and it seems genuinely slow and powerless. For a parody movie to work, you need a lot of things going on at the same time, a joke after the end. The singing in the film seems useless and the ads for the furniture store that flicker across the screen are very bizarre, even for this movie. Ultimately, however, you can see why this movie is a cult; I can not see many people being indifferent to this. Unfortunately terrible would be the way I would sum it up.
