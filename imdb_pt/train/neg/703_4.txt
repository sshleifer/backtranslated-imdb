College students, who are cleaning a doomed dorm, are being chased by an elusive killer. <br /> <br /> The dripping dormitory (also known as Pranks) is a mixed bag for horror fans. The film production figures are very low and the story is mostly pretty routine, there's even a bizarre stranger out there looking for a red herring. In fact, much of the development of the story is quite forgettable except for one or two brutal murders. But the film is actually better thanks to its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and to a rather daring and unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> The cast is weak most of the time. Stephen Sachs is the best of the group, since he does a good turn in the character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student. <br /> <br /> Above all this is a standard B slasher effort, but the end is worth being savored and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum. out of ****
