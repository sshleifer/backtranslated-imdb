I love science fiction, I'm fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I figured a movie that combines those three would be at least enjoyable. I could not be more wrong: the story (or, indeed, the lack of it) was completely uninspired and unimaginative - while the imagination is usually the largest component of any science fiction story. The dialogue and acting are even worse than in an ordinary porn movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term "poor performance". Bad acting would not have been such a problem if only "director" Bilal had not been taken so seriously; all the lines sound as if they were poetic, it seems Bilal really thinks he made a work of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry to be found in this piece of garbage, just pretense! This man should really stick with the comics, since he fails on all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually makes watching this movie a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake that even the werewolves in 'Van Helsing' look like actors live! And since half the characters are CGI-animated, it's a problem that the CGI effects look so fake. If the Egyptian Gods really exist, then Bilal is a dead guy, since they will no doubt retaliate horribly with him for the ridiculous way he depicts them in this disastrously bad movie.
