I watched an episode. Yes, I've sat the whole experience miserable, and I have to say, that mark of comedy is one of the worst you'll get. Imagine Peter Griffin, famed for Family Guy. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a woman (admittedly lean and without glasses) except that now he does not have something that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know he's an idiot. Sarah does not have any of the genuine features, none of the acting skills to take out her character. Maybe it's the trivial jokes that make your comedy even lower than your character. Maybe it's the lack of believable leaves. His insensitive and intolerant personality may appeal to insensitive and intolerant people, unlike the mass appeal that the insensitive and intolerant character of Stephen Colbert possesses. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates a boring and boring character. It does not have something that is needed for the satire genre, let alone the whole world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman does not have, is noticeable. And when you do not believe and identify with it, it's no funnier.
