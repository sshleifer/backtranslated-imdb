This probably does not fit the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies, but it's certainly a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of Holiday has made it interesting, but after the first scenes the movie shows that it is bad. production values ​​and stupid plot. I mean, the subgenre was all about an invisible maniac who cuts adolescents for no apparent reason, but that has gone too far. There is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add. <br /> <br /> The clichés are more than boring, the blood is minimal, as is the mystery. <br /> <br /> a rather mediocre slasher entry that should not be hyped even if you have a nastie video label. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed in this overrated piece of junk.
