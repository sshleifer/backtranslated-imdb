I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and was instantly disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see a movie b movie slasher, but I ended up with a fecal issue for my eyes. The performance was similar to watching dry grass. I've seen better acting in a softcore movie ... <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazy killer came out of nowhere puzzled me. How was this a horror movie? <br /> <br /> The production value of this film was laughable at best. There were no frights. It looked like a high school student had a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was all over the place, if any. If you're bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one. There are much better b movies out there.
