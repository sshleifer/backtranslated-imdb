This kind of "inspiring" saccharin is enough to make you sick. He telegraphs his feelings as Earth's biggest light. It removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling, making the choices for it. The big end is swimming in the tearful orchestration that should work as connecting leads in a dead car; I think you would need such a stimulus to feel if you are stupid enough to watch a movie as simple and cheesy as that. Streep shines and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it's just that - a screen, turned on and off like a light. Because I can not for the life of me see how she could find life in such a bad movie. Even though it's based on a real, and inspirational story, I'm sure, the set-up, performance and performances work like a third-rate TV movie or a high school drama.
