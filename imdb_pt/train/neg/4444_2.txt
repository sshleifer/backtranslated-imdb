Dr. K (David H Hickey) has tried to master a formula that would do away with all the ailments and drawbacks, but needs living donors to complete his work. His doctor, brother Richard (Dennis O'Neill), has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips) who is accepted into medical school. Eddie has a girlfriend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas) who is pre-law and plans to attend law school the following fall. She and Eddie rejoin their relationship when Sarah calls her current boyfriend, who also fucks with Walt's lady (Bill Sebastian, Eddie's best friend who recently paid for his girlfriend's silly job). Eddie is accidentally hit by a car and appears at the height of death when Dr. K makes a suggestion to Richard, telling him to "retrieve" Eddie using his secret and illegal methods. When Dr. K applies his serum to Eddie, gruesome results occur. Eddie's face swells huge warts while he also got a taste for human flesh. Many will die so Eddie can feed that uncontrollable appetite he can not kill. Soon he may even pose a threat to his father and his girlfriend ... Eddie's monster must be stopped. <br /> <br /> The horror film typically direct to the video suffers from a severe lack of budget, acting and general talent. . The premise, which seems to be an interesting thriller, fails to deliver even as a zombie movie. Blood is limited with some chewing scenes, but most of the violence occurs off the camera. Using time to move the story can really be boring.
