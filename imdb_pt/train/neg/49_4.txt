A very tacky and boring road movie, with the intention of being modern and modern, shown in editing style and some strange camera angles, resulting only in drowsiness. <br /> <br /> The cast is lost, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worth it is the high-level soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin, very cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Run, if you can, the bad reviews and comments on this movie are totally deserved; it's really pure junk. Of course this has its charm, to watch a movie where everyone would not drop their beer glass if it was on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing to do.
