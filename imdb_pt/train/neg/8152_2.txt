"Do not drink the water" is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on a 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen. It stars Jackie Gleason, the comic book genius behind "The Honeymooners." The director, Howard Morris, appeared in several Mel Brooks (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) comedies and made a mark on animation (the characters he expressed include "Pooh" Gopher, Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) What went wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the premise is taken too seriously to function effectively. Allen's original play was ironic, which is why he worked on Broadway and Allen's remake in 1994. Allen's script and Harvey Bullock beat the premise to death and made many changes to the original game. Making Gleason's wife a head of air in this version when she was a stubborn woman in the original is just one example of why this does not work. <br /> <br /> The acting is not much better. Gleason does the best he can with the material, but he can not save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also an excellent actor, as demonstrated in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain." Your abrasive personality might have worked here, but the bad script does not even give you a chance. What a pity. The wife of Estelle Parsons will drive you crazy after 20 minutes. See how long it will take for you to strangle her. This is also a shame, because she is also an excellent actress, having done two exceptional performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel". None of the other actors do very well either. <br /> Woody Allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) on the tracks. They can hit all the right notes and the movie itself is a comic masterpiece. It's finally on video after a long battle over rights. Quit and find this version. The entire 1969 original is good for cleaning up unwanted guests who surpass their welcome. <br /> <br /> 1/2 of 4 stars
