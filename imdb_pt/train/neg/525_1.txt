I looked at the other comments and was amused to discover that clearly only the people who actually worked on the film had commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, tone it down a bit. "Groundbreaking" is a bit overdone. This is a Boston-based college production that does not even reach the level of most college amateur movies. It's what you'd expect a lot of boys to do. A silly action movie without much creativity. It's very funny if you're willing to mock it. It's not something you'll ever see unless you're a student at Emerson College.
