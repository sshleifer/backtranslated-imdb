As low prices go down, you'll usually find out you get what you pay for, and let me just say that I did not pay much for "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Writer / Director: David R Williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park, surrounded by the vengeful spirit of a murdered serial killer. It is not a bad premise, but executed with a lot of low budget mistakes. The camera work tries to be very cleaver to your audience, constantly using shaky quick-cuts to cover the fact that they really do not have anything bloody or scary to show us. This becomes evident straight away as we are introduced to the so-called killer, and we soon realize that (action) is the scariest thing that is happening ... After a painfully long title sequence, we are brought back to the times modern, the performance remains the same. "Frightworld" generates a very unique cinematography when it shows the scene from inside the amusement house, but with an extremely long time, it can not save the movie from below average indie hell. <br /> <br /> It's a mediocre nudity, but not much for gore, which is generally the saving grace for these types of movies. <br /> <br /> Fans of B-Movies really bad can find something of interest here, otherwise not spend a lot of money.
