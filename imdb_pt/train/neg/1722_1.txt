This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen that is EXTREMELY annoying with lots of boring dialogue and has some VERY annoying characters and a laughable-looking creature. The only reason I saw this piece of crap is because it was on that 8-disc horror set I got. The plot is absurd and totally stupid as is the ending. No blood what so ever, except a few blood marks on the creature, and a couple of wounds of bloody bullets. The acting is terrible! Richard Cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable, plus his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is the comic relief and it was not funny at all! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and also was not funny!. Bob Hyman is decent, but not much more than that. Richard Garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb as usual. Kacey Cobb is so over here and had no chemistry with Richard. Overall, avoid this piece of junk at all costs! BOMB of 5.
