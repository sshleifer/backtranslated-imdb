This was a horrible movie! I gave 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and one second for the beautiful Porsche in the beginning ... Other than that, the story simply was not easy and cars racing through the cities were not so new in 1970. Happyend was probably what bothered me more, I have rarely seen anything so built!
