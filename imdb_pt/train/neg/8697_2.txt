Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terry J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why even bother reviewing this movie? Another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military discover lethal (and very false-looking) prehistoric monsters running around killing people in bloody ways. The original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. This is somewhere between the two, though not related to any of CARNOSAUR's previous films. Rating: 2 out of 10. Rating: R for graphic violence and blood, horrible images and profanity.
