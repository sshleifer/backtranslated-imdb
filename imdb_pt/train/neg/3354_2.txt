It is my opinion that when you decide to make a great movie, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a new point of view. Now Robert Wise, 1963, telling of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel, "The Haunting of the Hill House," is worth the price of admission to this day. Now move on to 1999 and re-make. I shook my head and asked, why? The acting is wood, the story is unrecognizable and the main point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with so many special effects that computers can generate. I had heard that this update was bad; but could not believe it was so bad considering the source material. I was wrong. After seeing this and telling my wife how horrible it was, she said; "Well, they got your money!" She's right, do not let them be yours. If there is no profit in making lousy rewards, they may stop producing them or reach a higher standard that does not insult their audience
