Well well well. As good as John Carpenter's season 1 in "Masters of Horror," that's the complete opposite. He certainly proved that he was still a master of terror with "Cigarette Burns," but "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst I've seen of him. <br /> <br /> It's stupid, totally devoid of frightening atmosphere and tension. is very welcome, despite the run time of less than an hour. The script is absurd, the characters are irritable and unattractive and the conclusion is absurd. <br /> <br /> And to those suckers who actually bought the DVD (one of them being me); Did you see how Carpenter describes the movie? He's really proud of it and talks about it as his best work a long time ago, and he praises the script. And in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious havoc that has reached the final cut, he just says he does not find it essential to correct the mistake and simply let it be there. I'm afraid the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope that I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I want to leave a positive note and mention that the effects of the creatures are incredible, however. Technically speaking, this movie is top notch, with effective lighting schemes and makeup effects.
