I recently saw the Broadway revival of "Blithe Spirit," starring Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson. It's a great production and shows what good actors can do with a piece that is less than perfect. Angela Lansbury is extremely funny as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> It was probably a mistake, then, to check out the film version of the play starring Rex Harrison. The film lacks the energy or laughter of good stage production. "Blithe Spirit" is probably one of those pieces that works best with a live cast in an audience full of people who have come to laugh. Actors can improvise, give hints and nuances to their performance and deliver speeches, and involve the audience on a personal level that you can not get into a movie theater, or with a DVD showing, where the audience is separated from the audience. history of the "Fourth Wall". The story: Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in a house in the hinterland of England. Seeking information for his upcoming book, a book on the supernatural, Charles invites Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, reprizing her paper from London's original production in 1941), a local medium, to her house to conduct a session. Charles believes that spiritualism is a farce, but hopes to catch "the tricks of the trade." But then Madame Arcati brings back the ghost of Elvira (Kaye Hammond), the first wife of Charles, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave, and develops a spit rivalry with Ruth over Charles (complicated by the fact that only Charles can see or hear Elvira). <br /> <br /> On stage, actors can perform performances that invite laughter in this scene. situation. But on screen, the actors of "Blithe Spirit" cross the lines as if they did not know that someone is listening. They murmur lines designed to make laughs on the stage. The performances of Harrison, Cummings and even Kaye Hammond are flat and lifeless. Only Margaret Rutherford seems to have kept her spark and mood like Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> The Oscar-winning visual effects in the film do not impress - not just by today's standards, but by the 1946 standards! They mostly consist of Kaye Hammond walking in fluorescent green clothes and makeup, being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a brilliant ghost. <br /> <br /> The director of photography deserves some credit for creative lighting. But compare the annoying visual effects of "Blithe Spirit" to the really innovative effects of Disney's "Song of the South" - which was eligible for the awards that same year. In "South", humans and animated characters share the screen perfectly for minutes on end. Compared to "South", the Oscar that "Blithe Spirit" received for special effects was completely undeserved. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can only encourage you to watch the Broadway revival with Angela Lansbury before that closes. As for the movie with Rex Harrison, skip it.
