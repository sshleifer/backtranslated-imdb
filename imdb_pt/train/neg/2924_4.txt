There was something here with female leadership having that perfect life she always wanted after the worst possible life, starting as a child prostitute and ending with Eric Roberts. But her past makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain and it destroys him in the end. It seems strange, but I like the position that Dean Cain was at the end and the choice he made. He can not hurt her because he loves her and she is the mother of his son (I think time makes it clear that he is his son and not his brother), but at the same time he can not forgive her for all she did, sleep with his brother (who shows the love and obligation he felt was almost in a way) and then be part of his death. In better hands, this would have been a better movie, but for something I got on late at night, not bad.
