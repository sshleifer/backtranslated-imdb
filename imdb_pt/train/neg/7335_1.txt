This is possibly the worst version of the play I've seen - several times on stage, in addition to the movie. <br /> <br /> A very good idea for the set up - the South American can give a credible background to the extreme reaction around the supposed crime of Hero. <br /> <br /> But the execution! Widdoes is a very educated Beatrice who performs particularly poorly. Waterston, a great actor, is not much better than Benedict. <br /> <br /> The worst performance is in the role of Don John - this makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the damsel to the train track fits the cornerstone of the Dogberry capers and their men - but the acting makes you want to shrink. <br /> <br /> Successful set-ups include the scene in which they deceive Benedict into believing that Beatrice loves him-if the competent actors were superb. But the use of the river and Benedict's approaching visual mood are well-bred. Overall I had to force myself to continue watching, but it certainly did not keep my attention. <br /> <Very disappointing. With regard to the last comments above, I am almost 40 years old. I have been watching Shakespeare productions for over two decades. I may suggest, when trying to defend your friends, that you talk to the play instead of attacking other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in fact. I can presume, however, of your displeasure at youth, that you are old enough, where the educated performance of other times is more to your liking. <br /> <br /> My favorite couple was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage. . Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic artist, can act.
