Was this one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen ?? I really do not know why? Just your mediocre stories about a guy who's about to get married, and he's beginning to like someone else. The story was told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative in all of this. <br /> <br /> I really do not know what was wrong with this movie. Most of the time, when these types of actors come together to make a movie that's been done a million times before, it's really fun. Usually there is little intelligent thing in them that is not in any other. For some reason, it does not hold your attention. You can pick out some funny bits, or smart ideas, but for some reason they are not funny or intelligent in any way? I'd like to know how to explain this, but I do not? Just do not waste your time on this one?
