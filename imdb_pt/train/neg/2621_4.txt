I would not take a child under the age of 8 to see this. With cubs hanging from buildings twisting in dangerous machines and listening to Cruella's scary chuckle, to name a few of the events, there's too much suspense for a young child. <br /> <br /> Live action gives a more sinister feel than the cartoon version and there are some disturbing moments, including a guy who seems to be a transvestite, many tense moments that will worry and may scare little ones children. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the Disney people were thinking, but neither the story nor the acting was of the usual level. The puppies are cute But this movie is unstable at best.
