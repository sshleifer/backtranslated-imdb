Trifling romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the loving relationship that grows between a gracious hippie (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent from Los Angeles in his golden years (William Holden, surprisingly affable within this highly invented arrangement). The script is small, but not without some thoughtful passages; Still, the scenery is so middle-aged clich√© that most of the scenery looks childish. It may have worked much better with different clues: Holden and Lenz do not match well (their stature is so small that it seems to rise above it), making their intimate scenes less hectic than simply uncomfortable. Dated, blurry and romantic, and almost imperceptible. ** in ****
