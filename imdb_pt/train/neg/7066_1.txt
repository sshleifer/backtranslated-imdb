Going into this I was expecting something really good, but after the damage that infiltrated me, I'm happy to think about the strait. It's hard to think the filmmakers (HA!) This was a good movie. the stories, and I use the world freely, are incoherent and make some sense. There are stupid things that happen randomly. the acting, if it can be called acting is horrible I saw mass acting on toy ads! I know it's a low-budget video-bin junk, but even then it's not how they tried it. Will after thinking about it, I feel very sleepy and still # yawws # do, I'm going to lie down. <br /> <br /> WARNING: DO NOT START DRIVING, WALKING, READING OR DOING BEFORE SIGHTING CHILLERS.
