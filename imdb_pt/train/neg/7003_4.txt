(aka: TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME) This sequel seems to have been made to take advantage of the extraordinary European box office success of THE CHALL ME TRINITY, only this time Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy images wanted to take advantage of that in America also. Too bad they did not go very far, as the Hill / Spencer photos had only marginal success here in the U.S., and this tedious movie does not help at all. <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other. Later, they get involved with arms dealers who smuggle weapons out of a monastery, and who mistakenly think they are a pair of federal agents. Everything ends up falling, despite some funny scenes, especially one in which Trinity and Bambino are in a fancy French restaurant and do not know how to behave. And the scenes with the sharks were mildly humorous as well. <br /> <br /> The opening song sung by Gene Roman sounds like a pop song from the early 1970s, similar to Bobby Goldsboro, while the music tracks scattered throughout the film are very good. I'm not sure if I would like to buy the CD soundtrack, but a few others could. <br /> <br /> The film could have taken half an hour and would not have dragged on for so long. . It seems like a lot of scenery is being chewed here. In fact, I lost interest for about 2/3 of the way. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant buzz on the soundtrack and a bad impression that looks like it should have been sent to that big scrap in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step down from the previous movie. . <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
