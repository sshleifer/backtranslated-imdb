This movie is so horrible that it's hard to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the story is so ridiculous. A narrow-minded human can write a better plot! The actors are boring and untalented, maybe they were forced to play in that movie. <br /> <br /> The National Forest camera receptions are the only good ones in this whole movie. I should feel like a person because I paid for that bad image. <br /> <br /> I hope no one makes a sequel or makes a movie look like a plot so much worse :-)
