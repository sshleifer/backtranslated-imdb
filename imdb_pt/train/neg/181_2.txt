Ah, Channel 5 of the local Mexican t.v. Every day at 2:00 am they showcased horror movies from the '70s to the beginning of 2000. It was "Return To Cabin By The Lake," the movie that aired yesterday. Sorry to watch you. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a regularly popular low budget and was well accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh The plot is really stupid in every sense of the word. <br /> <br /> The film at some points seems like a novel because of its absurd dialogues, cinematography and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is: avoid this at all costs. It's a movie that should not be seen by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre movies. <br /> <br /> You've been warned.
