This Hitchcock movie bears little resemblance to his later suspense films and seems much more of a very old-fashioned morality tale. A young couple gets an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. They spend money traveling the world and living a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while the excitement begins to subside and the couple becomes dissipated and meaningless in their existence. However, out of nowhere, when they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything - and end up much happier in the end because they now enjoy life! How strange, silly and lazy movie! Personally, I would like to inherit all this money and find out if that makes me unhappy! <br /> <br /> Production figures are relatively low compared to later productions - a rough movie with poor sound quality and quite amateurish. acting.
