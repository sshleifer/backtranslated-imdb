There is nothing unique about the TV series or the movie. That is a prequel to the TV show, which is not found anywhere else in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynches style disgusting storytelling, and after. <br /> <br /> From the moment the body of a poorly misguided girl appeared on the beach. And being introduced to some of the darkest jerks immoral characters of the Twin Peaks. For the numbing mind, almost pedophilia, disgusting, the film seems to romantically narrate the destruction of a Human Life through some random events. Psychedelic phenomena in the movie Twin Peak: Fire Come Walk with me. <br /> <br /> I watched it all just to make sure I was not missing out on anything. I did not do. It is simply an obvious sexual fetish of a man extended over a long series with a ridiculous pornographic film. Save yourself from the agony of suspense and watch anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story, instead of seducing you into some kind of mental porn movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of criticism and praise as David Lynch is great. Because of his ability to define misery and tragedy and turn it into something wonderful. This is not life imitating art as much as it is a distorted version of art doing its best to inspire meaningless living. Do yourself a favor and avoid this rubbish.
