I really need to watch a good movie soon, because it seems like any other entry or something like that is something I despise. However, my story speaks, I must not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and all this sucks big green banana peels. I never thought I would see a movie as loud as this. Al Pacino is not performing in this movie: he's posing. There are many, many scenes of your character, who is a racing driver, just looking at the camera. He is perfectly horrible. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two must be in a love affair, and there just is not any chemistry. Sydney Pollack directed this movie? There is no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here. Is this the same man I applauded on Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a horrible movie experience. Run, do not walk, away from Bobby Deerfield.
