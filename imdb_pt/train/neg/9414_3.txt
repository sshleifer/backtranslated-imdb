Despite the acclaim on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed, this movie was a disappointment. Yes, it is far more realistic than other wartime films of the period to portray the mud, boredom and frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately one of them walks away, thinking it is all there is in this film. There is no plot and dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war movie needs a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best films of World War II, "Twelve O'Clock High", has little action. But it pays off with crackling dialogue and psychological tension. The exception to "The Story of G.I. Joe" is a brief battle segment (titled "Beleaguered City" on DVD) that takes place in Italy. It is certainly one of the fastest and most convincing combat scenes of any war film. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie is not worth watching just for this highlight. Another turn-off is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who claims to be a "romeo", but comes out of a pervert. On the other hand, the sergeant. Warnicki is a nice man, if I fail. As he tells Captain Walker (Mitchum) when he volunteered for another patrol: "Every step forward is one step closer ... home." But this last step? a patrol too? takes you on the mental edge. Too bad the rest of the movie does not do justice to some otherwise fine touches. As for Pyle's portrait of Meredith ... it's practically in a coma.
