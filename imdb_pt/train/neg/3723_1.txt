The sects that capitalize on this film are well known for their claim to carry the "message" of the Bible without any extra-biblical change or influence. The existence of this film is only due to the fact that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what the born-again branch of Christianity was talking about in the '70s, just look up. word 'rapture' in a dictionary of sects and cults. It's faster than going through this waste of celluloid. Poor erratic sound quality and a script that could easily be written by Jack T Chick (paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those unfamiliar with the Evangelical Scene). You could not really put this in the category 'so bad it's good', so your only audience is one with a collection of pamphlets wishing to branch out or extremely paranoid.
