This movie was a blow to me. I think girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models, housewives or lovers as it seems to be all that they will be portrayed anyway. It's really sad to see the work and life of an artist being so unfairly misinterpreted. Unconsciously (or perhaps should be expected), the entire character of Artemisia and everything she stands for, were reduced to a standard female Hollywood character; a pitiful creature, physically flawless, helpless, displaying none of the character traits that really gave her that place in the history that was being mutilated here. Sadder still, it was to see that a large part of the audience was too ill-mannered in the area to understand the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality. To portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist, someone she has actually accused of raping her even when under torture simply irritates me. If the director had nothing more substantial to say, she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person.
