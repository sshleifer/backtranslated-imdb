The social commentary was greatly exaggerated and the mystery itself is constructed and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were totally unbelievable. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the last decade, which makes him remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> I even had difficulty understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia compared to the opportunities to solve the mysteries he has in England. Can not he go insane with the Australian police? It seems a very artificial plot to wrap you up in a criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> The last episodes of the original series were quite melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on foolishness, and this episode takes this mantle. instead of returning to the focus of series one. Sad.
