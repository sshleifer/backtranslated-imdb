How did this become a blockbuster? Dear God, I do not know where to start because this movie sucked too much. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the performance of some characters. The film was very bright, they should have done something with lighting, for example. making the environment darker. The makeup of certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror movie. That's 2006! People do not scare other people using heavy makeup. Most horror scenes are taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror films. Total theft! That's why I do not watch Tagalog movies. The only reason so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is because of compliance. How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise that instead of the girl leaving the TV, now comes from the next window? No matter how you put it, it still has RIP OFF.
