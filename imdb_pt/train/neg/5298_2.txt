I rented this movie because I was browsing through the horror movies section for those movies that no one heard about and could be a possible gem. I've seen it, and since I've been a fan of violence and blood, I get it. It has received the classification of EM, which means: Extremely Mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was totally for violence and everything, I understood. The warning on the box read: Extreme violence, extreme language and nudity. The "extreme violence" surprised me. The movie turned out to be a very slasher movie. It had one or two bloody scenes, but I've seen worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course the amount of blood in a movie is not all that counts, right? You have plot too. Well, the plot was boring and nothing really special about it. Do not rent. I speak the truth. I can not imagine how anyone could really like it to the point of saying, "I'll rent this again." There were times when you continued, but I will never see the movie again.
