Boy, oh, boy, oh damn, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing in the movie was the joy of the blue screen effects used to create mommy's "invisibility." They seemed to have been filmed on cheap video, and it seems totally unreal, and not even on a good way, where it's so funny that you end up loving the movie ... <br /> <br /> I did NOT end up loving this movie. Attempts at steadicam were really pathetic as well. I mean, hey, if they had a low-budget movie, fine. You can still make a great movie on a low budget. But, a bad movie and a low budget and effects. That makes a bad combination. In this case, such a doomed combination created the crappy film, "Invisible Mom." If you have children, and your children have no taste, maybe they'll wake up to it all.
