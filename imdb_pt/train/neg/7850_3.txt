The remake of Alexandre Aja in The Hills Have Eyes was one of the highlights of 2006. It was not just a remake of a classic horror movie, but it was also very good. So, almost a year later, we're being treated to the continuation of this remake. While original screenwriter Wes Craven is back as a producer and co-scripted, this film does not reach the level set by the original and the remake. A group of military trainees pass by in the desert to check on some scientists and find themselves in conflict with the mutant family of the first film (at least those who remain a few new ones). There is too much blood to be had here. What bothers me in this film is the total lack of characterization. The viewer does not care what happens to any of these people because we can not get into them. Even the mutants had some characterization the last time and this time, nothing. Gore because of blood is useless. There has to be a reason for that to be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what is lately with rape scenes in movies? Here we have one more for no real reason. I hope this is a set of hills that will not be visited again.
