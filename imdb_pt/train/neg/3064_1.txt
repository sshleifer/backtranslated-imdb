The original "Vanishing Point" was a great movie. Subtle motifs, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The remake was terrible. Preachy, obviously obvious; It lost the point of why the original was a classic. The black boot was cool, but even that could not save this movie. Why stay with a white Challenger? I do not think it was the best choice at 71. Some parts of the movie were unintentionally hilarious. Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his "Dream Quest". His Indian friend was standing beside him. Vigo was just wearing his white briefs. I'm sorry - it just looked silly - he scanned the view in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was at the end - after the explosive clash against the bulldosers - the announcer said the impact was 180 km / h. He then mentions that police officers said that his remains were not found because he vaporized, but some people believe he saved and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then it shows coming out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you could not open the car door at 180 mph. Second, the car would not continue to travel straight for 100 yards. with no one to guide you. He would readily roll over 30 times. Third, if you hit the asphalt at 180 mph, you would end up in several soft pieces. No matter, we see him at the end standing with his daughter. All in all, a movie that would insult someone's intelligence.
