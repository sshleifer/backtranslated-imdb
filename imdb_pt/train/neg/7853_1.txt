No plot, bad acting, and useless gore .... <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be a horror movie? There is no fear or suspense, just BOOM BANG GORE, then done. Some types of Marines are in the desert for some weird reason, and are hunted by those mutant animals in the first movie, which was fine, and should have been left like that. <br /> <br /> This is just another excuse for money, and use of senseless violence, as well as the sequences of "Saw". They know that no matter how vile the plot is, and the more cruel they can add, people will see. I miss good suspense horror movies. Come on in Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
