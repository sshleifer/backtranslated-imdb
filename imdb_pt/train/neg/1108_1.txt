A little sad and useless of fluff (bloody but fluffy down). Poorly scripted, with futile and wooden dialogues. You do not care if the characters (actually, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little sense for the whole thing. Perhaps some of the scenarios and scenarios are interesting - the gaps between the tops of all buildings can be true to the way life was lived. The meeting of the structure is unnecessary and disturbing, and the character of Hoppalong Cassidy himself is boring and inept.
