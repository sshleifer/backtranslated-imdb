Since most of the criticisms of this film are from excerpts seen ten years ago, I would like to add a more recent, open film with images of the B-17 bombing in Germany, the film is from Wupter's character (Captain) Wust de Oskar Werner and his advisor running to hide while heading to Hitler's Fuehrer Bunker, once inside, they were interrogated by bunker staff, the film was then cut to one of the many conferences with Albin Skoda giving a decent impression of Adolf Hitler reuniting his official to "Ultimate". Victory "as Werner's character is shown slowly realizing that bunker dwellers are trapped in a fantasy world - some non-bunker events are portrayed, most notable being the flood of the subway system to prevent a Russian advance through them subframe involving a young member of the Flak unit and the difficulty of his family in surviving - this film suffers from a series of detailed inaccuracies that a German film made only 10 years after World War II did not include, the actor who portrayed the uniform of Goebbels (Willy Krause) in the same uniform of Hitler, including the eagle-arm - Goebbels wore a Nazi Party brown uniform with a swastika armband - the SS soldier camouflaged the German army, Hitler's well-documented scene granting the cross of iron for Hitler Youth boy is shown as having taken place inside the bunker (was done outside in the courtyard) and lastly Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a Belgian model 1922 - most accounts agree that it was a Walther PPK A bit of acting also seems totally inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being remarkable, this piece is shown as a cabaret, with an intoxicated wounded soldier (his arm in a splint) maniacally winning the song while a nurse does a striptease / belly dance combination, all by candlelight ... this is really shameful to watch - the most amazing is when the Captain of Werner wins an audience with only Hitler of the Skoda, Hitler is shown like fallen in a wall bank, drugged and delirious, when the personage of Werner begins to question it, Hitler begins to shout, bringing a guard of the SS that mortally wounded Werner's character in the back with a shot - this fabricated scene is not based on any true historical account. Werner's character is then dragged to die in an anteroom while Hitler prepares his own ending, Hitler's farewell is shown, but the suicide is off-screen, the second end of the movie shows Hitler's funeral smoke slowly rising. forming in a ghost face image of the dead Oskar Werner / Hauptmann Wust-this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check more recent films such as the remake of 1973 "Hitler: the last 10 days" or the German film "Downfall" (Der Untergang), if they want a more true explanation of this dramatic story, these last two films are based on reports of eyewitnesses in first person, with "Hitler: the last 10 days" compiled G from the autobiography of Gerhard Boldt as an employee of the Fuehrer Bunker and "Downfall" being made from Hitler's memory, the "Der Letzte Akte" screen was taken from the judge's book. Nuremberg trial, Michael Musmanno "Ten day to die," which is more a compilation of events (many obviously fanciful) than the eyewitness story - it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Roper's account, "The Last Day of Hitler" , has never been turned into film.
