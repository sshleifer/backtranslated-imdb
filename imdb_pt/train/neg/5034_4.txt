I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film, and the few criticisms that there is to be positive. I saw the movie and was quite disappointed. I did not find it very enjoyable at all. It was slow and did not have the entertainment value. Even the murder scenes are mediocre, with actual close-up photos of generic stabbings that do not look anything good. And the supposedly great end is not much, I saw it coming, and then the end seemed clich√©. This movie may not be much mentioned, but the little you get is overrated. I would not recommend this movie.
