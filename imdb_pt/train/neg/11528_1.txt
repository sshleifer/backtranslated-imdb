Who wrote the "cool" post about it must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for backyard wrestling. In fact, this is not even yard wrestling really, it's some guys hitting each other on a trampoline. Each guy has about 45 lbs wet and there is not an ounce of entertainment value in that. It's just some bored kids who even give a bad name, if that's possible. If you want to see some fun backyard wrestling, get Backyard Wrestling a pleasure for the pain. He stars the two biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. They really have been since yarding and if professionally trained as "real" professional fighters. They were cool and improved. I recommend checking out these two guys. MDogg is insane and off the hook. So do not waste your time or your money on this low quality DVD, there are "better" backyard videos out there.
