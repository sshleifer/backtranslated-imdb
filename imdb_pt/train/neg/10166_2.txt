If he wanted to be exact, he should have picked some Frisco natives and not a lot of NY actors who know nothing about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I've lived in SF my whole life, and people here do not talk or act the way these actors did. Everything was super-dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the bay was JT, the Bigga Figga, with his small appearance as a rapper. No shock that he was the only one in the movie who actually dressed like cats here (ie his warrior shirt). Not once did I notice anyone using any Giants or 9ers equipment; instead, he fit them into some SF or Oakland shirts that are not even sold here. HP has no bowling lanes, black and Asian gangs do not wear heads or bracelets in the colors of Africa or China's Olympic team, not every Chinese gangster wears a Yao Ming shirt and tries to sound black while firing on hoops. In addition, while there is now a significant yuppie community that invaded the Mission, all that was shown was a white guy and a self-proclaimed "100% of the West Coast Boriqua". This is not New York! The Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Latinos on the mission are very, very different from what was shown here, which was undoubtedly NY. In addition, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the city. An accurate representation would have shown the drama between HP sets on its own cover, as well as against Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been so much better if Lee had done a little more homework and had a better plot to work with.
