Nobody could like this movie on its merit, but if you have a sense of humor and like schlock movies for its MST3 quality then this is for you. He's up there with "Road House" for his absurd characters, scenarios and plot. Bad writing really got me: "I want you to throw away those guys" instead of "... dust those guys". The F-14s take off from the carrier, but when they start forming, they're F-16s! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal goes back to work for the general who, just minutes before, oversaw a covert "mental cleansing" in Seagal. Segal runs out of bullets and uses a knife to kill the guards. Then, of course, the guards drop their weapons and fight with knives too! The hand grenade is a failure, but it explodes anyway. The small invisible hunt can fly from California to Afghanistan without needing to refuel. Then Segal flies back to California - the longest route, that is, through Europe - although there is a carrier giving you air support 20 minutes away in the Arabian Sea. The CIC on the carrier consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat-screen TVs and pictures of meters and maps on the walls. What a joke!
