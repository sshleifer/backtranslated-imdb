There was a genius played by Shaq. His name was Kazaam, and he was crazy. His rhymes were cheesy, those lines were bad, some stupid boy crying because of his stupid father, bad acting, bad cast, bad special effects, what the next? this movie sucks, Prolly did not earn $ 20 he lives on a stereo, not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp ... <br /> <br /> Yes, you understand, a genius stupid who may not act, in a stupid movie with horrible special effects. Oh, and it's confusing as hell. I'm not even going to continue. Let's say it belongs to the category "it's so bad, it's funny". Watch your friends once and have a good laugh. But do not expect anything spectacular.
