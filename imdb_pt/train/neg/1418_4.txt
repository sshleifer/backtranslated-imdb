I do not know why this conduct was tolerated in the film business! This movie (short) is disgusting (to say the least)! It's a bunch of 5-7 year olds wearing diapers with big clips, acting like adults (and so forth!). However, it is interesting because it is a good example of how "the good old days" may not have been so good! (Thank God we have laws against this kind of material now!) <br /> <br /> {This is a short of the "Shirley Temple Festival"}
