Anurag Basu who co-directed the flop KUCCH TO HAI made his debut in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film was ahead of its time in a way that does not have a different story and that approached more of HAWAS than released 1 week before and fortunately that was better and made a better deal. <br /> <br /> The film starts well, Malika's guilt is well shown at first, although the scene with Emraan-Malika is very coarse / vulgar. <br /> <br /> The scenes between Emraan and Malika are well dealt with and the twist in the tale where Ashmith confronts Emraan is brilliant <br /> <br /> The rhythm moves fast and the viewer is kept on the edge, but the second Emraan's girlfriend track is not totally convincing <br /> <br /> In addition, the police band seems a bit confused <br /> <br /> The ending is also very cinematic <br /> <br /> Directed by Anurag Basu is good The music is a winner, all songs are fabulous The camera work was impressive <br /> Emraan played his naughty tide very well, that was the role that gave him the stardom and despite continuing to play such roles and got bored in this movie he was excellent Ashmith was also good in his role for the first time, He made a good job and one of his only good performance and he looked good too Malika was brilliant in his role especially in the second half but his delivery of the dial sometimes was not up to the mark Unfortunately rarely did she show this potential in other films Raj Jhutsi is fine
