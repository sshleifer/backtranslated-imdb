Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who is evidently trying to target. "A Walk on the Moon" seems to have borrowed from other better movies. The current story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working-class Jews not far from Woodstock. The screen treatment by Pamela Gray does not have much to offer, so it's a riddle why Goldwyn decided to approach this movie as her first attempt at direction. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family is spending some time. at the resort. We see them coming to the small bungalow that will be their temporary home. Marty, the father, comes only for the weekend; he works in what appears to be a small appliance business that mainly fixes televisions. In a few days the first man will walk in space, so the emotion is evident. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz women are left behind. Pearl, Marty's wife and her mother-in-law, Lilian, spend inactive days on the spot until the "blouse seller" arrives. Pearl sails and she finds much more than a shmatte; she also receives the seller. It seems that Pearl and Marty have no sex life. After two children, Pearl, who looks sexy and with a high libido, is ready for extra marital fun. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise for the film, which becomes a soap opera when young daughter Alison decides to play prostitute and go to the nearby Woodstock festival, where, horror of the horrors, she witness her own mother doing with the blouse seller! What is a girl to do? Well, watch out for the grand finale when all the parties are happily gathered by the bed of the little son when he is stung by wasps and the seller comes to apply some home remedy, and dad is called from the city, after knowing about the betrayal of Pearl <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane, she was doing "Unfaithful" later, which is the most chic version of this failure. Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female clients whispering little things to his ears! Liev Schreiber as Marty, the betrayed husband, does not have much to do. Anna Paquin plays the rebel Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unfortunate Nana, who would have liked to stay in town watching her soap operas instead of witnessing firsthand one that is ringing in her own backyard! <br /> <br /> Watch it or snap the DVD on the television when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh or two interesting things about the movie.
