BTK Assassin, Green River Assassin, Zodiac Killer; the man keeps putting absolute rubbish and the ironic thing is that he loves his crap. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a Ulli Lommel movie, but I was so impressed with how everyone thinks his stuff is so horrible. Like the movies I said at the beginning, they are not even equal to six when added together! After reading the reviews I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He's the worst out there. <br /> <br /> The credits would not end when the pathetic movie began and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly mistakenly called. The acting was incredibly horrible and equal to the camera photos. . Editing is easily the worst. This movie made no sense and I could not bear it any longer because it would not end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie. I could not take it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS CRAP!
