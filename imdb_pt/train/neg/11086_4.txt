As far as spaghetti westerns are concerned, I would put This Man Can not Die on the dark side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the glow and flash of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the on-screen charisma needed to do so. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast is not particularly good. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I have not seen before. There simply is not much to get excited about. <br /> <br /> The exception to the cast I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She's the only bright spot in this mediocre movie. Unfortunately, your screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson but instead she is the Melin character.I do not know how anyone could confuse Rosalba Neri with a guy named John Bartha listed in the IMDb credits for the movie.)
