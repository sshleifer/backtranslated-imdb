James Bond in the desert? Well, that's what it looks like: Pierce Brosnan is ultimately best known as Bond in "Tomorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both filmed before this release. Sincerely, the two protagonists of the film are both very bad, with Brosnan turning into the marginally more convincing performance, and with Annie Galipeau (like Pony, the love interest of Gray Owl) having to fight with a careless dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> The two aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But the movie is not about aunts. It's about the forests of the Canadian desert. And while photography can be beautiful, there is no guts to the harsh reality of living in the jungles. Annie Galipeau, like Pony, just can not be convincing, unfortunately, because I really wanted to believe her. She was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old in this movie, and it might have worked, but Richard Attenborough might not have been tough enough with her. He makes her look vulnerable, which of course she is ... but in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is for sure, it looks perfect. But mascara and brow thickener in the desert? It simply does not fit, especially since it only seems to ride on forest trials with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl), and use photos to kiss close-ups. <br /> <br /> I've lived with forest people in the Pacific Northwest, and they just do not look so beautiful and remain so sweet as they struggle for survival. Which brings me to another point: the film does not evoke the period in which it is set: the 1930s. I lay the blame here largely on a screenplay of lack of brilliance that is interested in preaching at the expense of the dramatic arc points plot and those little details that can evoke period through action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script and his latest offer, "Elizabeth the Golden Age," opened three days ago, so I hope there is an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the comments others have posted, but I'm not convinced. Plenty of potential, but mishandled and even perhaps poorly designed. If it had a religious film, it would have been criticized, but because it preaches environmentalism, the film remains a little above criticism, since it is "politically correct." Sorry for all this, I do not buy. A man.
