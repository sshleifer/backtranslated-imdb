Beating the bad guys ... Again is the slogan of this film, it exposes so much truth about it. <br /> <br /> Main One and two, movie classics. Alone at home three and four, a good movie if you are three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as much as it tries to be funny, it's not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He is a very mild actor with soft performances, but it's not entirely his fault, the writing demanded insipid vocabulary and mild expressions. The jokes are copied from the first two with different bandits, and you would have to be blind to think that these chickenpox are real. A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in that you are showing this movie on a rainy day. And to make matters worse, an entirely different cast, go see if you do not believe me, but you'll be sorry.
