That's right, you heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of his books, and I read the whole series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the writer should be shot. <br /> <br /> What right did any filmmaker have to take down a fantastic work of fiction and turn it into a scorn of the mysterious genre? If I ever thought Harry Potter was massacred, then Michael O'Hara proved I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book does a lot more justice. For Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: Do not give up on your daily work.
