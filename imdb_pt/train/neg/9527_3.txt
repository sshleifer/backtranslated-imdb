I've been trying to track down this movie by just researching bad phrases about "teenagers seduce and kill men in their house" and such. I think I first saw parts of this movie when I was about 10 when he was running cable. That made a good impression! It's the kind of movie that children know they should not be watching, and change channels when their parents arrive. When I saw who the cast was, I could not believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. . So again, if you like to see men betraying their wives to be murdered, then this is an interesting movie. Besides, as I recall, there are some very interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the dumbest end of all time, but still ... memorable.
