How many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a Scream-ripoff mask? Bleed's plot is half original, but the film itself is a complete failure. On the one hand, the dialogue is undeveloped, it is tedious and it wastes too much time in trivial details, the acting is bad, etc. I want my money back, this rent is more than a skunk.
