Terry West had a good idea with this movie. He simply did not pass it on. There are numerous shots from the scary school exterior that last forever and probably to fill the movie runtime. Also in this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as usual, but this movie always belongs to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie at the beginning). If the script focused on your interesting character, we would have a movie to watch. She is so beautiful !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's previous (and best) film, "Blood For The Muse," is a special feature. One thing I'd like to say is that this movie looks like someone who is not good at handling a long joke at the end, it looks the same way. So again, just notice this for Ruby LaRocca.
