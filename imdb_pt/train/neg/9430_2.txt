I was also fooled by the packaging. I also fell in love with the bloody packaging and the DVD casing that states that "bereaved fans like every copy were taken off the shelves". Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it was not really all that worth - no fright, and very limited gore. The end was very tacky and did not give the blow that should have. I really do not even know how this became a "Nasty Video" with how sweet it is. The story drags on, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... does not keep the promise. The bonus feature on DVD (the "interview") is very strange, since the director seems very inconsistent and is not there. The lead actress talks about how she's appearing in a Shakespeare production. It's a good laugh.
