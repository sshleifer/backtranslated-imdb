Since the Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was little, I was curious about its sequel. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (a) is a classic animated film with everything of high quality, great score music and targets a general audience. In contrast, Little Mermaid 2 is aimed primarily at young children, because it is spontaneous, reflects a child's perspective, the music is livelier and less dramatic, and the end looks like a recess. <br /> <br /> Little Mermaid 2 begins when baby Melody is introduced alongside Ariel's family. Suddenly, with no visual clue to aid the drama, a giant tentacle catches the baby. I laughed, wait a minute, not funny, the baby is being attacked! Okay, I'll stop laughing. Morgan's crime in broad daylight and its spontaneity, it has eliminated the potential drama since it happened so quickly. Throughout the film, Melody seems superhuman, what I stand for is how most kids figure it out. This quality in Melody's character is clearly brought to the end when she fights against Morgaine without a centimeter of fear on her face. Like the first film, Melody has a lot of Ariel's problems, except the opposite. Queen Ariel ends up being like her father, restricting her from the ocean, while King Triton restricted Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody rebel against their parents. <br /> <br /> The music is moving more emotionally at first. This sequel has a lot of songs but not much orchestral work went into it. It's great for the little ones because it does not take an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The end of the first film was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water. It's definitely more child-friendly, because instead of the end being solemn and letting it explode, that ending leaves you thinking, "It's time for recess!" Ultimately, this movie is fun for kids, so let them have fun.
