This could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this film is nowhere near historically accurate. It starts badly and then it's all from there. We have Hitler's father cursing his own bad luck with the "fact" that he married his niece! They were, in fact, second cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called her father, Alois, "uncle" because Alois had been adopted and brought up by Klara's grandfather and raised as his son, when in fact he was his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and so, as a child, she got into the habit of calling Alois, "Uncle." <br /> <br /> The scene in the trenches where Hitler is ridiculed by his fellow soldiers and decides to knock him down on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all the spectators. We see Hitler chase the dog through the trench, when he reaches the poor thing he starts to assault him for disobeying him. In the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and punish the cowardly little man, but then a grenade falls directly upon his pursuers, and each of them, we are told, is killed immediately. How then, if Hitler was the only person surviving the scene, was this tale of brutality and cowardice counted? Was Hitler himself "bragging" about it? - I do not think like that. <br /> <br /> Then Hitler intimidates and insults a poor, stressed and tired Jewish official to give him an Iron Cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer was a pawnbroker before he fought for the Fatherland and consciously brought some medals from his shop because I am sure that the Iron Crosses were not being distributed as this comic farce shows. All grotesque clichés are here, not least the soothing and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on the little man. If only the producers had kept Ian Kershaw aside. So they might have discovered that Franz Lehar's "Merry Widow" was more likely to float on the Führer's boat than any "Flying Dutchman" from Richard Wagner's cannon! Hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people, but how can he be forgiven for his appalling taste in music? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I'd be in it for hours. <br /> <br /> Give a miss.
