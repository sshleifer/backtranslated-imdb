I suppose it's good and modern to see wonderful things in the absolute void of a movie like this. With the often useless excesses of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions, crude language and trivial sentences. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when employed properly. However, this movie is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take the long scenes without dialogues and dark and scattered scenarios. I am sure they must have some great meaning and insight, because the implicit message is shrouded in perplexity. The acting is poor ... bland and pedestrian ... and features one of the worst crying scenes in the story (at the end of the movie, if you can watch it to the end). The scenery is monotonous, and the ridiculously long final sequence of the girl walking through the arid park is as pleasant as having a torn tooth. I would call this anticlimactic, but since the film did not build any kind of climax ... not even in "erotic" scenes ... it would be false. I'm sure there was a script used during filming, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it could have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this movie offers nothing to interest or surprise ... no great story, no impressive insights, no visual drama, no emotion. In addition to two or three fun moments, this movie is a waste of two hours. A tragically boring and sad movie.
