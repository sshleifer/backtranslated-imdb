Run away from this movie. Even by the standards of movie B, this movie is terrible. It is also insidious in its theme. The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and deserve admiration. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a film that speaks to the underprivileged much better than this movie, see it instead. <br /> <br /> No ordinary kid would do what Trent does. State Troops do not work like they do in this movie, etc. Watching this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold clich√©. Mija is a completely unfriendly prostitute, yes, she had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person that the public can not identify with her. <br /> <br /> Generally, there is one thing for which a movie can be recommended, in this case, there is none. It's such a ridiculous movie it insults the person trying to identify with the main characters. The performance is adequate by the standards of film B and the direction does not present anything new or interesting.
