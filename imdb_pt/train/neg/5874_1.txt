one of the worst movies I've seen so far. Pathetic action scene and very bad acting also do not help. The only good point is the parts of Gary Busey, but that does not raise the film much. lives up to its B movie rankings and passes the flying color test. A waste of my money, though I found it fun to start with its getting annoying after a few clocks. I do not recommend this movie unless you see it for free or a gift. (a gift you can ask for the receipt and send back for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
