First thing first . In this genre film, the first thing you need is good music, and that's where Mr. Shankar and his group fail. <br /> <br /> The music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, there is AJAY DEVGAN, who removed a letter from his spelling, did a good job, but had no use for bad movies like that. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll that is used to amuse audiences, even though she is good to see, but her role in the movie is to dance, in fact she is a member of a rock band and I do not I do not think any rock band has a dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> In nutshell this movie is a piece of crap from a piece of wood. Watch if you want to be cheated.
