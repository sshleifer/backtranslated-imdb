** Possible spoilers ahead ** Gerald Mohr, a busy B movie actor during the forties and fifties, leads an expedition to Mars. Before we get to the Red Planet, we are entertained by a romantic chat between Mohr and the scientist Nora Hayden; doofus resident Jack Kruschen; and the sight of Les Tremayne as another scientist who bears a goatee's beard. The Martian exteriors feature fake scenarios and shades ranging from red to pink - the "Cinemagic" process announced in the ads. Very cool monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect creature, a huge Venus Fly-Trap, and the unforgettable rat / bat / spider. The whole bizarre adventure is remembered by surviving Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. THE RED AND ANGRY PLANET has a number of cult followers, and probably caught most of its fans during the psychedelic sixties.
