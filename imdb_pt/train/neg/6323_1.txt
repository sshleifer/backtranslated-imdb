This movie is a bad memory of my childhood. This is one of those movies that they show to kids on a rainy day at school when you can not go out for recess, and you'd rather be watching anything, anything else. At least it was like that when I was in elementary school. I just remember HATING this movie. I have not seen him for 15 years, and they probably do not wear it on rainy days, but I just want to warn everyone: you'd better use this to put your kids to sleep than to entertain. they. Trust me, choose anything else. Even if the topic is a bit controversial, the plot is so meek and slow that I can not remember anything unless I did not like it so much that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn all of you against it. .
