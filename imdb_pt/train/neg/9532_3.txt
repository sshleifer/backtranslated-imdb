So this guy named George is sitting alone at home on his birthday when two women show up. George's wife is in a hospital taking care of her son, so when his wife is away, George goes into the bubble bath and makes love to the two girls. It's not such a good scene because it really does not show anything. After that, the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house. They make him good breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and he tries to abandon them, but when he gets home the girls are still in his house. The girls are fed up with old George and do not want to cook for them anymore. Both become great psychopaths and use George in their crazy little game. I liked the girls doing what they wanted and spoiling George's house. George was not so good to his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he did not really seem to be serious. George looked like Tom Tucker in Family Guy. I went to the two girls all the time.
