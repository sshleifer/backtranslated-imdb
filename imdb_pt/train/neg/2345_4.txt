I watched Written in the wind starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - Robert Stack was terrible - just awful - he should be a charming millionaire - instead, he came off as an idiot of the word The plot was stupid and exhausted and the 3 "romantics" had no chemistry. Somehow, Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress - though her hobo character was boring - think that Splendor's older sister in The Grass was full of malice and bitterness and charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has all cast overact his way through the dialogue that he felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. I had a special participation of the actor who played the boss in Get Smart
