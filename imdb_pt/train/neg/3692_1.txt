Rajinikanth becomes born again after obtaining a magical power he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> There are several problems with this film that are obvious to the casual audience: the 50-year-old Rajinikanth is still at home with his parents; the neighbor's father thinks he is a convincing "boy" ("vaseekaramaana paiyan"); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the film with his sermons, being the worst as the women of the past years exercised in domestic work - but we must believe that he is not a theist; although he has been well read, he wastes six of his seven powers in a stupid kite; I can go on, but you get it. <br /> <br /> There are god-men, there are gods and there is Rajinikanth. The directory has difficulty fitting Rajinikanth into one of these categories. Initially, Rajinikanth is only Rajinikanth doing what the Tamil heroes do - they face the villains and, although they are the oldest, being courted by the most beautiful girl in the film. Rajinikanth does it well and some of Rajinikanth's trademark styles are really nice - "baba count" is a novelty. What makes this movie unbearable is that those initial few minutes are just a preface to the worst book ever written. Even this preface is punctuated by some comedy that is forced and obvious. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the hero's purpose; we see that the hero faces several obstacles (of the politicians, as usual), but we can not hope for the hero because we do not know what the hero's ultimate goal is. In the end, when everyone wants him to be the leader, the hero makes another of his sermons and walks away to become a hermit. The director offers no solution to the climax scene problem. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rehman's score is really interesting. Either he shows some excerpts of brilliance or he did not bother to invest totally in that movie - who can blame him. There is a scene in which Rajinikanth gets into the van of one of the bad guys and then throws the knife and starts his drool count. The music is very fit for the moment and acts as a catalyst adding more tension. The songs are all mediocre, no one would bother with the songs in this movie after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rating you can give to IMDb. This movie has all the elements that justify its rightful place at the bottom of the IMDb ranking.
