*** REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I will make this review short and sweet. I bought this Best Buy movie because it seemed interested and had some top actors like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad could it be, right? Well, it's too bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, an aspiring journalist who is faced with a case that could lead to corrupt police officers in the Edison Police. LL Cool J is Deed, a police officer within the force of a special force team called F.R.A.T. (First Responder Assault Tactics). He joined an evil cop named "Lazerov" (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed facing some bank robbers, but at night they are arresting some guys using drugs. I do not want to give too much, but things look bad for the guys who use drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes on a test involving Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects a crime and, with Ashford's help, some investigate what makes it ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is all inside the F.R.A.T. The team joins Ashford to try to bring the corrupt police officers to justice. <br /> <br /> You can tell from the beginning that the performance of Freeman and Spacey is pretty mediocre. The only person who gives the best of everything is Dylan McDermott. He is a complete crazy case in this movie and made me a believer. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. It says all the lines in the same way and shows practically the same emotion. He was much better at movies like Deep Blue Sea and Any Given Sunday. The film begins with some legal action, but then drags its feet through the rest of the film. The end is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie. I'm putting it on Ebay this weekend.
