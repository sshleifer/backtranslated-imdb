How sad there is no option to post a mark smaller than 1. I watched this piece of nonsense and could hardly believe what I was watching. Every part of the movie was horrible. Music, acting, direction, history, everything, just everything. I actually saw myself laughing out loud at various points in the movie. I particularly loved the part where our hero is running around the hospital in slow-motion of soft focus and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand, because, ............. well. Just because. Product Placement? Crucifix (crucifix) everywhere. If you are of a Christian persuasion and very easily satisfied, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get out more.
