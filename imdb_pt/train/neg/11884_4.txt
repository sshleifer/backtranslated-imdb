The biggest joke in the world. The biggest and most exclusive internal joke in the world. Emulating the impetuous humor and 'everyone' of office space, this movie drives the appeal of this movie by making humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries who write books. The public is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary and then empathize with the extremely stupid protagonist. <br /> <br /> The entire film is centered on the legal desk, finding free time, listening to music and writing romance while working. These are your goals. You can not imagine slapping it in the face that is for the audience when (about halfway through) they find out that he's had a job that fits all three of these criteria but then delivers! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely remove the public's motivation to empathize with or even find a protagonist who has already thrown away what he is complaining about. <br /> <br /> In addition, great hurdle, the legal insider's mood fails because they must be explicitly explained to the public every time they happen. Without these aspects, the public would not have noticed anything particularly strange. Humor is only effective if it does not need to be fully explained to the public what is funny.
