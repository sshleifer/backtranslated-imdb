I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and I only saw a handful of them (and none of the "Halloween" or "Friday the Thenthte") - but I can enjoy a scary horror movie not because of blood. And I'm sure this is not scary. <br /> <br /> What's so scary about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all his appearances there are distances taken, so there is no surprise in any of these films. (Not that a skull itself is so scary, but ...) <br /> <br /> The plot is about the third cousin of Claus Von Bulow (John Hudson), who marries a look similar to Donna -reed. (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins to see skulls and hear the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks in her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH !!!! I wonder who did it !!!! <br /> <br /> This is the same old plot about a rich kid trying to kill and / or madden his wife. If you want to see a well-made version of this material, try Reversal of Fortune. And BTW, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> The MST was fine, but nothing special; paired with the short "Gumby", however, makes for a good viewing. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "The Skull Screaming"; eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
