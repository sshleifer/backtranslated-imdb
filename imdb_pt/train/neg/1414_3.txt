After watching this movie, I went to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which compared to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read I immediately saw the point of looking. <br /> <br /> This movie was a poor attempt on a similar theme. Curiously, the format of the film is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. "10 Items" takes the viewer along the 1-day timeline of the movie, while "Lost In ...", best planned, seems to extend for a few days. <br /> <br /> Make sure some people will see this because it has Morgan Freeman and you will be disappointed. It seems his best roles these days are supporting roles in big blockbusters, instead of leading roles in films with less than 10 million limited releases and independent films.
