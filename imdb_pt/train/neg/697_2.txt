The two good things about this movie are two unknown celebrities. First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a movie, young and flexible, with looks that still wrap her body around today, steals the beginning, that's all she is, and it's that. She's obviously just starting out because her acting has improved on her upcoming projects. <br /> <br /> Second, the trail of the well-known songwriter Christopher (Chris) Young is what prevents that shit from getting a star ..., I know that one more star is not much, but in the case of movie, it's a lot. <br /> <br /> The rest is just a stupid absurdity of a couple of college students trying to clean a dorm that's due to be demolished, being unleashed one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah ... we all know where this is going. <br /> <br /> Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
