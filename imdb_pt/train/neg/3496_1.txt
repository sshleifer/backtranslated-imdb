I remember my parents not understanding Saturday Night Live when I was 15 years old. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am reaching their age, I still remember and I think I understand many of the things my children love. But that is pathetic. I can not say that I have seen Sarah, except for some apparitions here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see it as something special. But this show is so below what I expected of it. The IMDb article sounded like potential. So, just for that, I started watching the first episode. I hung up on the way. Anything else is better than that. Jokes that target 5-year-olds are featured in a supposed adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is moved to turn it off. I just can not believe that someone actually funded this comedy insult. The only good thing I can say is that there are so many bad jokes deposited here, saving other shows of this embarrassment.
