To the great thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is a maddeningly incoherent film from France that gives so-called "art films" a bad name. The story is about an embittered old man, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who looks in Tahiti for a heart transplant, but besides, I have no idea who the person in the movie was or why they were doing what they were doing making. Without a coherent plot to boast, the movie loses us at first, though I am perfectly willing to admit that there may be SOMEONE out there who really get a deep message from that movie. <br /> <br /> This confusing, snail-like drama lasts two hours and five minutes - though I seriously doubt that anyone with any kind of life is still around the final credits.
