I just saw this movie and did not read the book. The good thing about the movie is that in some parts you keep thinking for a while about the spiritual issue, evolution, synchronicity and your part in the world. <br /> <br /> However, the immersion of the film is easily broken. and there is very little relationship between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book loses much in this film version. The events that supposedly showed the synchronicity occurring are almost unrecognizable. Many reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and still more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose. <br /> <br /> Lighting scenes are visually poor and do not create the best feeling that was supposed to. Do you remember enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? Well, that's nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are poorly executed. There are many scenes that do not really develop the story and also do not help create an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The best actors in this film, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, can not save this. The first two seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters in an attempt to save the movie, and because they were paid more, but this does not work. Most scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does well in his scenes and sells like a villain (as usual), but the script does not help him at all. all. The scene in which he tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him is just a bad script. The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly poorly executed. The flashbacks of the entire movie can not even be commented on. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie has a great waistline, read the book! I have not read, but it's probably a billion times better than that, it has to be. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I had to write my first review on IMDb.
