I just saw this movie on DVD last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that "Me, Robot" polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and spawned many insults and name-calling as well). <br /> <br /> I find this somewhat surprising, since the film is not great (or even good), but also not terrible (or even very bad). What this movie really is is ... depressing. Pressing that the population of movie goers in the US is as poised to absorb new insipid and acclaimed clich√©s as new spectacular works. This film as "retread" written everywhere, from the plot (an uncomfortable blend of Asimov and modern Uber action) to Smith's character (a clever mouth cynic with a titanium backbone) to the special effects ( which borrowed from the Matrix and some others). "I, Robot" is unfortunately quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipid dialogues, and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be the most recent unsuccessful attempt by Hollywood to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has many holes, of all sizes, but I do not think most people attracted to this movie are critical enough to realize. Maybe a blockbuster by today's standards, but a lot of B-movie compared to the real winners.
