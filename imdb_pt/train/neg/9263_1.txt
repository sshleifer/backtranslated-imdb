What was the deal with the clothes? They were all dressed as something out of the late 70's early 80's. The cars were still outdated. The school was outdated. The nuns' outfit was out of date, and the hospital looked like something from the 1940s, with its infirmaries and wooden stairs and things like that. Nothing in the entire movie implied that it occurred in 1991. My mother was laughing, saying "Geeeee-od! WHEN was this movie MADE?" When we pressed "INFO BUTTON" on our remote control, we were sure that 1991 had to be a typo! Has anyone else noticed this? My favorite part, however, was when the woman told her the arrogant and dirty husband on the phone, on the inverted cross in the mirror, and he just said, "Well, look, I have a meeting in Congress. this later. " That line was just classic. JUST LIKE A MAN! My favorite part of the moms was when they gave the "Spawn of the Devil Child" their own Rottweiler. My mother said, "Exactly what the devil's creature needs ... a Rottweiler." She also liked all the people who collapsed in the churches, holding their breasts. His other favorite part was the guy in the school parking lot, driving 5 miles an hour, heading straight for the garbage truck / dump truck / front end loader thing. He had about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he continued, with a vacant, mute look on his face. I mean, how fast can you go in a parking lot at school? Whatever!
