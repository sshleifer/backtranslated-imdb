I'm very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us who saw this to a shield and we all left. We felt personally that it was painfully slow to watch and could not sit through the entire movie. And we really try to keep it. In particular, those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with the alienation of sexual orientation in the described school years did not like or identified with it. :( <br /> <br /> That said, it's great to see that this movie really resonated with a lot of people here in the directories and with the reviewers.This is the beauty of the subjective art form of the movie.
