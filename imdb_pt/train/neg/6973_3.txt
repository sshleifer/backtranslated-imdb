I never knew that this movie existed until I found an old copy on VHS, hidden in my dusty horror cabinet. The title on the box read "Insect" and the illustrations on the back made it clear that it's just another insignificant and poorly produced horror movie of the '80s. They certainly can be entertaining, of course, as long as they do not expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you will not be annoyed to see a gigantic amount of makeup effects. Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy of viewing is below the standard in "Blue Monkey"! The plot is ridiculous and highly non-original, the acting performances are painful to watch and there is a total lack of suspense. Following the ever-popular trend of big-bug movies, "Blue Monkey" deals with a new, unknown insect species that erases doctors and patients from a remote hospital. Manufacturers could not be more elusive about the actual origin of this gigantically over-sized critter! All we know is that it is not from outer space and initially left a tropical plant. Other than that, there is absolutely no explanation as to where this new type of insect comes suddenly! Like I said, have no hope of a smart script. The first half of the movie is fun enough, with a bit of blood and the introduction of some insane characters (a blind lady and 80-year-old alcoholic!), But the second half (when the whole hospital is quarantined) is terribly annoying. It's also near the end that "Blue Monkey" begins to overdo it in old (and better) movies. Approaching the climax, they seem to have run out of budget as well, since the lighting becomes very weak and the guy in the monster suit is not better camouflaged. "Blue Monkey" is worth taking a peek in case you're really bored or if you really want to see all the 80's horror movies of all time. B-cinema fans can recognize John Vernon ("Killer Klowns of the Outer Space", "Curtains") in the small and meaningless role of Roger, in charge of the clinic.
