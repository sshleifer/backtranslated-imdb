What starts as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat obscure security monitoring company turns, almost instantly, into a murder mystery that is unattractive and completely empty. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci try to make this train destroyed, but some things simply are not humanly possible. <br /> <br /> What, for example, causes Gale to suddenly transform from a sweet maternal figure into a drunken shrew in Tommy's parents' home? Why would Heinrich, while admitting to being a sleezebag, want to destroy the business for which he spends his life, stealing and possibly killing his customers? Why the seemingly sensitive Tommy believes that Heinrich could be a killer (based almost entirely on a dream), and even if that were plausible, why would not he go to the police? And why did not Gale sound the alarm when he got home, especially after he scolded him for being out? Of course, all these events are needed for the plot (and I use the term very, very loosely) to unfold. And it could be forgivable if it resulted in a minimum of comedy. But everything from Howie's description of his rape to the coroner's misidentification of Gale, to the last "joke" on Gale and Howie are still dead, is more insipid and pathetic than anything else. <br /> <br /> I checked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers," but there is nothing else I or anyone else can do to ruin this thing that already stinks in the high sky.
