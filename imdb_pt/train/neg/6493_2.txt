Oh dear ... like an Englishman, and a small Welsh part, a fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry ... to this day, I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see that I'm a nobody, that I hoped for something better. So my comments are like 'straw in the wind'. But that's the point, is not it? "I do not have an ax to grind the commercial value of a job." Me, a full member of the big dirty, I'm going to see a movie to be transported to another place. If so, suspend the belief for a brief period. But do not enter into a state of total disbelief. <br /> <br /> If this had happened to an unknown author and director, I would say that this 'production' would have been punished by oblivion. Unfortunately, it is not, and I was wide-eyed and confused. Having seen some of the rave reviews given this work I'm a little worried .... Maybe that's what I try, without prejudice, to see each movie on its own merits. Regardless of the author, director, studio or even the notoriety of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, like many before me: Do not write and direct the same production. It is full of dangers. Movies need to be moderate to maintain a look of credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in the school reports "Could and could do better ..."
