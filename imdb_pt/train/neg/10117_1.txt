Wow. I went to the store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad horror movie and I found this gem. I looked at the cover and thought it just looked like the movie to my mood. I brought it home and put it on. <br /> <br /> This movie was not the movie B Horror I had in mind. That was MUCH worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I have, I did not know that this crap like this existed among men. This movie looked like a 5 year old writer wrote and directed and is being cool about it. <br /> <br /> I'm an aspiring director and this movie made me so crazy that someone out there is actually paying this guy for direct movies. He needs to work in a garbage dump where he belongs. <br /> <br /> Whether you are thinking of renting this or buying it. I'll say the same thing I would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide. "Do not do it, it's not worth it!" I really have nothing good to say about this movie. Do not do it!
