A modern (keeping it sensually fashionable) revamp in Dracula's story (despite keeping with traditional customs) with a rather interesting, if not fully understood, story of the prince of darkness. The first time I tried to watch it, I only managed to get to half, before losing interest. Once again, it starts well (especially scenes with thieves and then encounters with Dracula), but for me, it's less complicated when it comes to New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite recording a paradise in curse, where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yes they cast that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically, he had his moments with few dream visuals, but some kinetic issues and cheap bumps do not help. The confusing script looks pretty silly. Lussier does a polished job that remains quite vitreous, inserting a lot of blood (the makeup is properly achieved) and a lot of "Virgin" propaganda. No, I do not mean virgins, it's the music company, as it goes into innumerable plans and Helsing's daughter works there as well. Oh, this was not an obvious plantation. The soundtrack is a fun choice of rock songs. Now the performances are all over the store, but there are few known faces to identify (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula simply did not leave, since a great presence was not formed. He was simply resplendent by the juicy ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's Brides. The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectfully well. Christopher Plummer takes a grisly turn when Van Helsing and Omar Epps amuse themselves with their role.
