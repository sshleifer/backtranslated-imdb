Everyone seems to be talking about it, and not realizing how the movie was made. The deaf and dumb guy is fine, the loser wins - that's fine, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is the average overall. I think it could be done a lot better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is very predictable for a movie that is not based on a real-life event. I'm sure the film could have been more interesting. The songs are just stuffed, and I had to literally route the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good acting, however. Watchable.
