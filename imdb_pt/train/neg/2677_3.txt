It's a really fancy parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, humor is tacky, and so is acting. But after all it's a soft core movie, which is expected and does not matter because what you really want is sex. Which brings me to the biggest problem of all, there is almost none of it. Which makes you feel like you're watching TV at 3 in the morning and the independent movies are playing and what's on was done by some college kid who's going nowhere in that industry. You spend a lot of time waiting for a real sex scene, often you're thinking that something is going to happen, so it just hangs on. The (maybe two, or one with two parties) that really goes somewhere is very enjoyable though. I personally can not recommend this unless you found it in a bin for a dollar or two. If you like a good movie with a plot and good acting, you do not want it. If you are looking for a good softcore lesbian movie, you also do not want this.
