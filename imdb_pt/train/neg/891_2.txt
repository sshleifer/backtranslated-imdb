Having loved 'Paris, Je T'aime', I highly expected this film and I admit that I went with high expectations, but I was very disappointed for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> Although, I was not expecting a re-make of 'Paris' in New York I was expecting the same structure. What I liked about 'Paris' was the disruption of the neighborhoods. You understood the style of each director and the story they wanted to tell. In 'NY', there is a clear separation of stories, in different points of the film, characters from different stories meet, which left me confused about who I was watching and what exactly was happening. In addition, the change in direction was evident, but confusing, since there was no flow. <br /> Another thing I loved about the Paris movie was the difference in love. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and children, unrequited love, a single middle-aged woman anxious for love, etc., explored so many layers of the complexity of love among humans. 'NY' seemed to want only exaggerated and exaggerated sexuality. There were a few redeemable shorts (the older couple had spent their whole lives together, Julie Christie's short), but overall the movie 'NY' did not conjure up any emotion for me. I did not connect with any of the characters like I did with 'Paris'. I remember watching 'Paris' and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, longing, hope, admiration ... I just had a lot of soul. For me, there was no soul in the NY movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I had gotten into this without having 'Paris' appearing in the back of my brain as a comparison, this movie could have a more favorable response, but as a self-titled re-take of' Paris, Je T'aime 'I was very disappointed.
