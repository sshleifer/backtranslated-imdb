Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town Reverand who is married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but is also a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to escape with his current case, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, in doing so, he begins an amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also on hand like a mad old man who yearns for the good Reverand in a tone of "Misery". It's sad to see a very good cast wasted like this. No less than little John Savage in a horribly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a movie advertised as a "black comedy", you need to bring BOTH elements to that movie. Meanwhile brings the first in spades, unfortunately does not contain any of the latter. Also, you can not emphasize with any of the characters and thus have absolutely no interest in them. Technically it's not a bad movie at all, an extremely forgettable one. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows a little skin <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> Where I've seen: Showtime Showcase
