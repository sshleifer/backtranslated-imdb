This move is as bad as they come. I was however forced to give a 2 for the scenario. There are many great southwestern plans, including many in Monument Valley, one of the most impressive places in the US. It's also, starting with John Ford, one of the most filmed. In fact, a scene with Kris and the girl was filmed at a place called John Ford Point.
