The thing that most viewers will remember is the headache the film caused, because of the camera's overly flashy, unsteady work. I am not against these types of stylistic devices, if they are made as Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh are proof with most of their films, but in that case there was a lot of SHAPE. It seems that the jump cuts and flashes of light that accompanied all the flights over Mexico City and all the important scenes were there to distract you from realizing that the story is very thin and that the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing will end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is inexcusable that its story has been told so many times and with much more depth and character development. This is another disappointing aspect of the film. If I want to watch an action movie at the top, I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify killing the Denzel Washington character and failed to deliver any convincing performance. The first half hour or so nothing happens except that stupid archetypes and clich√©s are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling, it is cut so fast that you do not know what actually happens. So the film does not work at the level of a credible drama / suspense, nor as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some of the totally messy blockbusters of the last few years, but I absolutely can not understand why so many people claim that this movie is something new and so cool. For a video clip, it's too long and for a movie, it has little substance.
