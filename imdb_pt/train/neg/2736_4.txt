The only reason I'm commenting is because I finally figured out why dr. Cox was bald. Although we all probably noticed at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they have shown these episodes in a different order from the one they filmed. The last episode in which our beloved nurse Roberts, who loved Jesus, died and Dr. Cox shaved his head. The must have shown them out of order for some strange reason and forgot that they slipped the continuity. To shame, scrub. They've made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and his hair is wet 2 seconds before the water hits her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show needs to intensify.
