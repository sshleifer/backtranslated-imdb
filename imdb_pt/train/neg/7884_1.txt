Things I learned from "The List". <br /> <br /> A decent director of photography, a hottie who can act and Malcom McDowell could not stop this movie from being sucked. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster will not give you your money back. <br /> <br /> Even when he reads the script and says "Ugh! Really?!", Malcom McDowell still tries. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington desperately needs interpretation classes. <br /> <br /> Hire a writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus also hates me and punished me by making me pay $ 5.50 to see this movie. <br /> <br /> When making a movie, you do not need an ending. Just leave everything unexplained, unresolved and uninteresting enough for the audience to fall asleep BEFORE the end. Genius. <br /> <br /> Any random landlord can heal death just by drawing a cross in a window. Then make friends. <br /> <br /> Your maid can sing you back to life. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington still needs theater classes. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring this movie home. <br /> <br /> Excuses will not be accepted.
