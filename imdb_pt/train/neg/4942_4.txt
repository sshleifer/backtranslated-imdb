Every new line-fall spectacle deserves at least my "3 strikes and you out" policy. I give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh, that is, 3 full episodes. After episode 1, I actually told the TV: "Canceled tomorrow". It was so bad. I've watched the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and still could not manage a smile. Not a laugh, a laugh, a laugh, no facial movement at all. I will continue to punish myself by watching all future episodes because I am convinced that I am clearly missing something in this program. I'm just not "getting" this, but I believe a comedy on a big TV network in prime time, just has to be funny; but there is no laughter from me YET. There's no way ABC's putting the less funny comedy of all time at 8:00 p.m. I know there has to be an inner joke that just is not matched with my brain. I read each of the previous comments, I "understand" the social aspect of it, but, WHERE ARE THE JOKES ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week, until I have a lamp moment and slap me on the head shouting "Eureka."
