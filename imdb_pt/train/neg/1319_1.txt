Probably someone has heard of Alberto Tomba. A former police officer, former champion of the sky and now a TERRIBLE actor. "Alex L'Ariete" was planned to be a "mini serial" TV, but the Italian television itself refused to display the film in its channels. Now it's a ridiculous movie, believe me. The script is simply hilarious (it's supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5-year-old child labor. But what really surprises you is the amateur action: Alberto Tomba, who was not really credible as a police officer, plays a totally silly character: an Italian police officer who specializes in opening doors! ("ram" is "ram"). This super-guy will try to save a young life and beautiful girl (a real "little" Italian TV showgirl, married to the singer Eros Ramazzotti): good, but absolutely inept at acting. Miss this and do yourself a favor. A film that is a shame for the Italian film industry: only John Travolta in Earth Attack approached.
