... did they bother making this movie? Anyone? I do not think like that. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a ripening movie, go rent Summer of '42. This is not the summer of 42. <br /> <br /> When his big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, & Sarsgaard gets more time on the screen, this is his first warning sign And, of course, for such a " artistic, "there are many curses and appearances, just to look" artistic. " <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard made his usual uninteresting cardboard punctuated by moments that should be intense. The intensity is from someone with bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is most famous for his looks and for what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh must hold grudges against her. She misrepresented a Pittsburgh native. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his cardboard-style money. Wow!! Was this your first role after high school graduation? <br /> <br /> So we have this strange triangle. Foster has a crush on Miller, but he's with his boss / girlfriend. He can not take Miller to bed and will not take his boss to bed. Then he comes across Sarsgaard & Miller, and he watches them. <br /> <br /> So, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller understood, a scene that we are "treated" with. in every sloppy detail and moaning. Finally, just to finish, Foster & Sarsgaard succeeded, with Foster in the role of Miller. Now I know how two guys get it (as if that's something I need to know). <br /> <br /> After all this, all that remains is the tragic ending of a character and the retrospective visions of the film. 2. That gets me right in the mouth of my stomach. Oh wait! That was the Calabrian pizza I just ate. <br /> <br /> I'd like to go back to the time that movie took out of my life, please.
