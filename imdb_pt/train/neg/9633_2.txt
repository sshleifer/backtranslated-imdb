The rich and sick Elizabeth Taylor courting the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or is she exaggerating - or, more precisely, exaggerating - as usual? In fact, both are applicable in the wandering and sinuous confusion of director Joseph Losey, called "Boom," aptly titled since the moods in the lush and luxurious setting are almost ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylor's mountain uninvited; she wears it in a samurai tunic complete with saber. Despite being beautiful in widescreen, the image is utterly deadly, a failure that even Liz 'n Dick-philes should avoid (the collective attitude of the stars' what the hell!' With their cinematographic careers of the late 60's hit an ego - Little nadir here). No sense, confusing and maddening, "Boom" is a catastrophe - although screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play "The milk train does not stop here", was said to like him very much! * in ****
