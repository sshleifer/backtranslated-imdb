Personally, while I am able to enjoy really good movies, I also have a weird ability to enjoy a bit more stupid crap. You know, those times when you just want to sit back and watch a horrible action movie to kill time. This is the only movie I remember actually closing in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention of going back to finish it. The plot was so artificial and predictable, I was calling what the next scene would be easily (and I'm usually not very good at it). The actors were horrible, I've seen better acting in high school plays. Even the cuts on the scene were bad, the flow was all wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a parody that forgot the funny thing.
