Ok, during this past thanksgiving break, despite having the whole family together, everyone decided to go see a movie, and as Fred's clause was voted as a majority, that's what we went and we say. To begin with, the film had so many holes that it was pathetic. Simple explanations of why a particular event was happening were nil. example; Who the hell is trying to 'turn off' Santa Claus? Is it some kind of corporation? A small explanation would be kind. <br /> <br /> Second: The film has given you fragile characters who did not give you sympathy for your feelings or actions. example: the little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the elven village. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and I could care less because this movie did not make me care. <br /> <br /> Third: I suppose this should be a family movie? His rank was low in PG only. For a family movie, there were several articles of suggestive talk. It did not bother me, but if I were a parent, I might see a problem. Throughout the film, Paul Giamatti seemed extremely bored with his role, but honestly he was the one who deserved to be seen in the film. Vaughn had some funny moments, but played the same character he has in the last two movies. boy mouth frat. (nothing against Vaughn, he's been good at other movies) <br /> <br /> so this movie gets 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because someone had to struggle to produce, film and release that movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would definitely approve this movie, or if you have to see it, save it for a rainy day location.
