This was a movie about infidelity and revenge. A twin with the "double" connection realizes that something is wrong with his sister. This movie took forever to establish the plot. A plot that has been done many times. The acting was pretty bad most of the time. Once the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins living with an abusive parent. The father seems to favor Ashley, so Laura takes the blame for everything. There is a promise made that girls would never separate, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job at a restaurant where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course nothing good can come of it. The fact that Barry had buzzed was a bad excuse to find a way to track him down. I kept waiting for the movie to improve and there was some resolution somewhere, but that never happened.
