One of my best friends brought this movie during one night with the words "Do you want to watch the worst horror movie ever?" I always enjoy a good laugh with a bad horror movie and I say yes. I expected their typical cheese b slasher, but that was beyond B. This is Z-slasher, the lowest of the bass. With an obviously low budget, extremely poor acting, bad lightning, no plot, so-called 'special effects', shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack make films like House of Wax look like Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing about this is about 15 seconds of one of the characters getting topless - she had some really nice breasts. Most of what I said during this movie was along the lines of 'Wow this is really so bad', 'This is the worst movie ever' and 'I'm not drunk enough for it'. So in conclusion: do not waste your time (or money!).
