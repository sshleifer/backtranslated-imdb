Without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen for a long time. I held on to the end because there certainly must be something here, but no. The plot, when it is not about cliches, ramblings to the point of non-existence; dialogue that should be street is simply banal; characters never develop beyond sketches; The pieces are clich√©s. Worse, considering your co-director, photography is just more or less. <br /> <br /> Comments elsewhere that raise it alongside Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are too far from the truth; The lives of the saints do not have their innovation, much less their depth and shadowing. In short, his craft. A ruthless publisher could probably shorten it to a decent 30-minute short, but, as it stands, it's a sixth-form movie project on a million-pound scale; ramble and swollen with their own pretensions. Which received funding (certainly just because of Rankin's name) while other small films fight for money is depressing for the British film industry.
