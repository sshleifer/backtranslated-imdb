The Lady in Cement is a true course on social anthropology in the late 1960s. Writing, not acting, is at the center of the stage. I said - pure camp! Prepare to be offended if you are a woman or gay. Broad and dame are standardized terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented by what they were in the day (camp-wise). Most lines are discarded, although there are marvelous performances from a few prominent character actors. The action scenes are mundane, but it's fun to see Dan Blocker playing a tough guy who likes to attack tough guys. And Lanie Kazan and Rachel Welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers. It's amazing to note that they were both 28 and Mr. Sinatra was 53. The soundtrack, wait. . . Has there been a score? Well, you got it. Watch with friends who want a good laugh. is full of them.
