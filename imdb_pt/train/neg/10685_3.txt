Predictable, banal and poorly written. Foolishly, I argued that such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit. I think the competition between the actors is so intense these days (and it will only get worse) that you can not choose much more. Early on we were given a hunch that was instrumental to the murder and we had to have rammed our throats ever since. The film had no intrigues, giving us a glimpse of the victim and just one possible reason for the murder. Part of the speech was, frankly, embarrassing! It's hard to believe that anyone would consider, let alone compromise, the expense of tens of millions of dollars to make that gut.
