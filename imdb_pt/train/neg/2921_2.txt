The story concerns a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris), who is hired by his aesthetic queen aunt, similar to Est√©e Lauder. His aunt (by marriage, we presume) is trying to track down his long-lost family in Europe. All they have to do is a photo of a young woman standing next to an ornate music box. The researcher goes to Europe and conducts her research in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scenario is the real thing and is actually shot on the spot (unlike a murder, she wrote where Jessica should be visiting a distant location and Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway, she meets a young man who is also trying to solve a family mystery of their own and they come together to find clues and threaten the bad guys. Dialogue, particularly romantic dialogue, is terrible. I watched this because of the scenery, but the script was so bad that I stayed just to see if it would get worse. That happened. Acting was also turned off. I can see why Mel Harris' career never took off in her early thirties, but she's fit (she looks too old for her co-star). But support players leave directly from the community theater. I also lost count of how many times they say "Budapest" to each other. Yes, it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know, okay? I realized in the middle of the movie that this had to be one of those Harlequin movies and it sure is. I think that says it all.
