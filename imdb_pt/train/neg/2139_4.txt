I really wanted to like this, but in the end, it's a badly made movie with few laughs. <br /> <br /> Politics is in place, it will offend Republicans, but it is what it is designed to do. That alone gives me reason to laugh. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it looks like it was done in a REAL hurry (like about a week). And it contains a stupid subplot about a bimbo singer, who seems to be completely out of the question. <br /> <br /> Turikistan is obviously Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any number of countries with which the US has fought ever since. the 1950s. The mood is a bit gloomy (prosthetic leg amputees made by the Tamerlane corporation), but it's in evidence, especially with corporations profiting from rebuilding ("democracy light"!) <br /> <br /> However, like much satire criticizing the US, it seems terribly heavy and labored. I think it's going against so much bs advertising, so have to beat people in the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer one more nudge, a wink approach - a little subtlety. But that's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway I can watch it again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope "W" is more important.
