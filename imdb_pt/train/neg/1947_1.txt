I'm 17 and I still enjoy most Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I love the movies of the 1990s, and recently we were presented with one of the best direct releases for the Scooby Doo DVD of this decade, Scooby Doo and the King of the Goblins, which I did not expect to be as good as it was. Anyway, go back to Get a Clue! I watched a few episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw, I was not impressed. First of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very well Saturday-morning-black-standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows that I really hate had a little better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, since they added a lot to the old episodes when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated character changes because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superheroes, something they would never have done in the movies or Scooby-Doo. Where are you? exhibition. The melody of the theme was not very good either, I can not remember, and the jokes were lame and artificial. Although I recognize that there is a very talented voice cast, if they had better material, and had not been instructed to sound as different from the original voices as humanly possible, what they did, I might add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was horrible, and I'm not trying to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
