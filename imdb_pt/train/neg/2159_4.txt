Well, it's Robin Hood as "old man" ... just as advertised! That did not sound very hopeful, and unfortunately it was worse than I suspected. <br /> <br /> Robin I can take; a Robin who curls up with a dyer's daughter whom I can credit; but a Robin who does not play very funny games with his only henchman is harder to swallow, and a Robin and * all the cast * who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom. How could anyone leave this labor without going through the scenes? Again and again, A lot of it sounds as if he's struggling with half-understood Shakespeare rather than uttering a salty joke; I hoped in the beginning that it was just a dash of failed comedy in a character clearly meant for the role of comedian, but then began to spread to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Everything you say about Errol Flynn on paper, he had the gift of delivering high-level dialogues as naturally as if he had thought of it in the heat of the moment ... and as this production shows, not so easy sounds! If they were to interpret the characters as insolent chapters, the actors in question should have received the appropriate lines: they sound as if they have no idea how to deal with them. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid. I did not even like the pantomime sheriff for a similar reason; the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered (and in this case written) with a little shove and a wink to the audience. They're out of place, all right - things that ended with the fourth wall - but not so funny. <br /> <br /> This production so promised reminded me of a lame school play. The only actor and character I felt any appreciation of was Guy de Gisbourne, who was the only one who seemed to have some control over (a) credible villainy and (b) credible characterization - but frankly, I would not have said it was a very good augury for the future of the series! At the moment of writing, I will give another chance in the hope that things will improve and diminish a little until next week, with less forced scenario necessary and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue: after all, the episode of opening of "Doctor Who" was not exactly a show-stopper, although it was not as bad as that. But if I do not see improvement after episode 2, I'm afraid the series has almost certainly lost a bystander. <br /> <br /> Which would be a shame because I have a crush on "Robin Hood." "a legend on the screen, from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to the strong confidence of Richard Greene, but this Robin can not stir my blood at all.
