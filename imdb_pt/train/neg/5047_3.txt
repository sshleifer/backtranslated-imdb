I was not really going to comment, but then I realized I had something to say. I saw this movie two days ago and although I do not think it's a complete waste of time (it may have been of money to the producers), it's obvious that it has serious problems. It has very good photography and (little bit) good music. Much has been said about Ana Cristina Oliveira, but, let's be honest, about what? She is not really an actress and balances herself permanently between over-action and lack of absurd performance. His performance is good because there has never been someone like Odete in another movie: crazy? sad? childlike an impostor? nobody knows, comrades. So she's sort of dictating the rules here. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie was also a good example of the problem that most Portuguese films suffer: soundtrack. There is a permanent NO for dubbing and the result is that usual mass of noise coming out of the blue. People in other countries may find Portugal to be the noisiest place. What moved me, however, was that part of the dialogue was dubbed, but it did not necessarily solve the syndrome. Bad dubbing too, I must say. It's strange to watch a movie in which the first thing that strikes me in the first scene, when the first character speaks is: it's dubbed. And all this to say that the film has technical problems. <br /> <br /> It also has script problems. He tries to be classic from the first to the last scene. There was a desperate fear of letting things hang and it shows. The writer was obviously trying to hit everything and he does, but ... show !! All the dialog boxes are very expositive and there is not a single conversation that sounds like a line from a movie. It's all a bit raw and a little unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie is a total mess, I must emphasize. I just think the good parts are so obvious that I'd rather focus on the bad ones. <br /> <br /> The direction brings little to the weak script. All the photos are classic and not innovative, but they are beautiful. A great work by Rui Po√ßas, by the way. <br /> <br /> Now, what I think was the problem, what prevents people from believing in this story and laughing throughout the film, instead of taking it seriously: it interprets the guy that DIES obviously is not an actor. In fact, it's a very important role and I do not see why non-actors are chosen for these parts. This guy is neither an actor nor a good-looking man. Which means that the whole movie rolls down the mountain, since we never believe for a second that this beautiful woman is obsessed with himself that he's gone, and that his handsome lover who survives is really having a bad time overcoming the loss , when we all see that this character is apathy. What a pity. The world is full of beautiful people who are even good seductive lovers. The world is full of good actors who are also cute kids and capable of causing obsession in people after they disappear. The world is full of great movies and also not big movies. Is life!
