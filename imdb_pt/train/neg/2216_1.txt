I'm a film lover B, give me a genetically modified bat and I'm in heaven. These movies are good for making you stop thinking about everything that happens in your world. Even an idiotic B movie usually makes me laugh and I still consider it a good thing. Then there was the Hammerhead, which was so horrible that I had to register on IMDb to be able to warn others. First, there was the science of creating the man-shark, which the film barely touched. To keep viewers interested, they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During a scene of attack the camera left the attack, but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being played by a stage assistant to warn that the attack was bloody and that the person was probably dead (what a fabulous special effects). Coming back to science, I found it very interesting that the guinea pigs were kept naked and the test equipment required that they be monitored through the breast tissue. Anyway, this movie had a bad development, a terrible story, and I'm sorry to say it's a bad acting. Not even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stink.
