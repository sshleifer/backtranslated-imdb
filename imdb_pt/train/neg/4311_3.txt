I watched this movie when it was a young guy full of furious hormones and it was the sexiest movie I've ever seen - or ever seen. It may not have been a great movie. My guess is that it was not. I do not remember much about it, to tell you the truth. I just remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in ANY movie ever did this to me as the incredibly sexy Cathy did in this movie. I have not seen since the first time I watched on TV in the 70's and I do not think I'd like to see it again since I'm sure it would be a disappointment - my hormones are not so violent and I've become more tired to over the years. Still, when I think of the shower scene, I still remember how great it was when I came back. <br /> <br /> Added after: After watching the movie again, I discovered that it is dangerous to return home. What used to be erotic now is very tame. The older, younger woman thing still works for me, not as much as before, probably because I'm no longer 12 years old. That older woman is younger now than I am. In addition, the whole thing's amateurism was not noticed by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> Moral: Sometimes it's better not to revisit the past.
