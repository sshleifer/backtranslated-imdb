It seems like this is the only film that John Saxon ever directed, and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stand in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from beginning to end, and it is bland and wooden, with nothing to it. A Vietnam war hero accepts a job for a mafia boss, befriends his wife and his wife is killed by the mafia boss and the war hero framed and sent to prison, the death row specifically. Now this particular prison has tried prisoners and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then there are all those infected people trapped in prison, some of which are turning into zombies and the rest, who suddenly do not want to be there anymore. That simply goes on and on without anything particularly showing or saying for itself, and I stopped before the end, which seemed like it was coming a few times, but no, apparently it was just starting to take off on a different and equally dull road. If someone watched until the end, they can become a zombie, so do not take a chance. 2 out of 10.
