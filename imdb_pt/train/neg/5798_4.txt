This film is a rather strange mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a film-noir smell for him. It's basically a messy bunch of different genres, of which none really works as it should. <br /> <br /> This film is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be taken more seriously as an actor. He is a former child star who always used to star in happy comic and musical productions early in his career. In this film he chooses a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role is really laughable within the movie. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He is a very childish-looking man. He really was in his 30s already at the time of this movie, but he looks more like a 16 year old boy. I hear him say cat to women and hear hard talk to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he just does not look and does not feel good. He simply is not convincing in his role. <br /> <br /> As the film mixes so many different genres, the story also seems really confusing. Somewhere there is a criminal plot and somewhere there is a romantic plot and another on how to live your dream, but none of this really works because of the confusing approach and manipulation of it all. It's not just an interesting or compelling movie to watch. László Kardos is also a director who made only 10 films in his life despite his career from 1935 until 1957. He must have been a director who had difficulty getting work in the industry and instead, once in a while he went given a smaller script to work with. His films are all unknown and usually are also not of high quality. <br /> <br /> Also we can not forget that this is a 50's movie, but it looks more like a 40's movie, or even one of the 30's. This is clear, mainly due to the fact that this film was filmed in black and white. Overall, 1950s black and white films usually look cheap, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> It is a rather strange sight to see Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and their band performing together in a sequel. It was not the only film in which Armstrong appeared and he used to appear in these types of films, often simply like himself. I think jazz lovers may still enjoy watching this movie because of their music, since there is a fairly present amount in this movie. In fact, the film received an Oscar nomination for best original song. <br /> <br /> A little film and a clumsy exit from Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
