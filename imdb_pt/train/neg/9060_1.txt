Channel surf and picked it up on the logo. It was one of those moments "I have to watch this because it's horribly bad" as the Roadhouse without the joy. The writing is atrocious; completely meaningless and the acting is bad in the mouth. <br /> <br /> There is a low budget, and then there is the abyss that is where this epic should be played and never seen again. I mean, the main characters go to a skiing retreat in some rented house and the house is, well, common, which is no big deal, but they choose to show all the guests running over it like it was the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry but watching 6 guys look at every 10'x10 'boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame. I think they did not learn anything from the Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see the hotel room check scene) ... wow the toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy your whole top so anything goes the routine. If it smells like ... and it looks ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. I believe that since I did not like this film, I am an "obvious enemy" that I can only assume means that I am phobic, which obviously is not true . I decided to do this crazy and crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the movie and not by its mere presence (ie it is refreshing to see ...) <br /> <br /> Of course, it can be refreshing to see, but that does not mean a great movie, just give them a better material to work with and a more precise direction. Actually, I applaud the effort. Frankly, I'd rather hear my catalog of Kitchens of Distinction than watch again.
