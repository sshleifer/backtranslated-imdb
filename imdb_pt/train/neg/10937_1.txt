Every now and then, a movie is so horrible that I feel compelled to warn people. If I work all my days and can save only one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy. <br /> <br /> Where to start my discussion about pain. To begin with, there was a musical assembly every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was a stereotype. We swore face, fat face eating donuts, silly foreign face, etc. The script seemed to be being written while the film was being filmed. The value of the production was so incredibly low that it seemed that I was watching a video presentation of a junior audience. The directors, producers, etc. Have you seen a movie before? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with each new entry. The concept for this movie sounded very funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors? But trust me when I say that, things went wrong, VERY WRONG.
