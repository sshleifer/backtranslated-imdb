IT'S OK. Not bad movie making if it was from an original screenplay. BUT IT IS NOT! <br /> <br /> What part of "in this story there are no women, except for Foulata and Gagoola" introduction by Haggard the producers, directors and writers do not understand? I mean, it's very simple in English. I understood at the age of 10! The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, the unforgiving desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated realm. That should be more than enough for even the most mediocre producers to work. But, nooo, they have to play "romance" on it. Pathetic. Suggestion for all the poor souls who really thought it would be close to the book. Give up. Until an aspiring Peter Jackson shows up and "does it right," you better keep rereading the tome. BTW, there's a sequel book (actually a pre-quel) called Allan's wife. It gives a background to Quatermain's story. It's a little scary but good.
