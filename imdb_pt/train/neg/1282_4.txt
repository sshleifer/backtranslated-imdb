Here's one of those films spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending. Conflicts that stretch for years are resolved within minutes. It would have been much more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis of independent and assertive woman to a complacent woman of the kind she has laid down her whole life. Brent, as usual, is well above his head and then there is the ridiculous situation of Gig Young playing a character called Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and then who appears, but Gig Young, the actor! Worth seeing far below what could have been.
