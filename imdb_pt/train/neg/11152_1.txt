Why bother watching this movie if you have great movies to watch. It is a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad I felt bad for wanting to watch it. Everything about him is bad. Actors were bad. Script was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI EVER. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the film in the strip club. One interesting thing is that there is a character that we wish he would die because he is so stupid that we have enough of him (I do not remember the name but it was the "CHOSEN" boyfriend). /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to see a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0-star hotel
