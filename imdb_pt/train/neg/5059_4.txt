If you want to see a movie about two absolutely unfriendly characters, this is the one. The acting is superb, both from John Cassavetes and the insane paranoid who, as the saying goes, they are REALLY looking to get, and from Peter Falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he seeks redemption. Big mistake, but since they're both amoral mobsters and misogynist bastards, it's hard to decide who to trust least. Only writer / director Elaine May could have gotten away with this. I found it interesting that in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman included in the DVD, he revealed that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the script, that the director was almost impossible to work, that the director of photography had requirements impossible to make, that the crew was constantly annoyed at being made to wait, and so on. This humor of a large dysfunctional family appears clearly on the screen.
