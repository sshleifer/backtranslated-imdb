It is confusing how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it sucks or because, given the collective credentials of the creative team behind him, really should deserve them, but because in all categories was named Prizzi's Honor disappoints. Some would argue that the old Hollywood pioneer, John Huston, had lost him at this point in his career, but I do not buy it. Just the previous year he signed the superb UNDER THE VOLCANO, a dark-set study set in Mexico, which is among the best he has ever done. Prizzi's Honor, on the other hand, a film loaded with star power, good intentions and a decent script proves to be a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The general tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a woman. The hit-man prefigures the quirky crimes that took Hollywood by storm in the early 1990s, but the script is too complicated for its own sake, the motives are out of the ordinary and the story seems uncertain about what it's exactly trying to be: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a gangster saga, and so on. Jack Nicholson (making a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but seems unconvincing coming from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the lead roles seem to be in paycheck, just going through the motions almost wandering around in parts. Anjelica Huston, on the other hand, does better, but her performance is sabotaged by the motivations of her character: she begins the victim of contempt of her fanatic father, proves to be favorable to her ex-husband and becomes a vengeful who wants his head a plate. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film have a decadent quality as it was made in the early 70's and Huston's direction is as uninteresting as everything else. There is a promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized that could have turned into something better, but what is left looks like a movie that no one was really interested in doing.
