A few months ago, I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this movie. The poster insisted that if I gave Flushed Away a chance, I would like that. Basing myself partially on this argument, I agreed to watch the film. 'Flushed Away' has good intentions (at least on Aardman's side) but does not have the strength to put it all together. His best trump card is Captain Rato (played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, should have been the main character in the film instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, tough and interesting, while Roddy spends a lot of her whining screen time. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothered me the most about 'FA' is the repetition of jokes that are not funny to begin with. with. When Roddy squats, the film ensures that he is hit five more times right away. "My name is Shocky," says one of Rita's brothers, who then electrocuted Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap jokes involving pain is on a low plateau all the time. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time complaining about Katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies toward Pixar (a similar movie is a coincidence, five is a steal). but I will say that I am disappointed with Aardman. They can do (and did) much better. Try harder next time.
