I saw this movie in its entirety in the 1960s and 70s, yeah, it's horrible, and could be the progenitor of the popular "Faces of Death" series in the 80s and 90s. Considering the state of the so-called "driver education" on days today, it must be necessary for everyone to prepare to learn how to drive. When you see violent death in all its blood and horror, you certainly (if you have any sensitivity) have a truer perspective on the responsibilities necessary to drive safely, what an instant of neglect or inattention at the wheel can do. I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70's and 80's, and at one point I was assigned to conduct a security class. I found this movie in the company library, I showed in the session, several people were physically sick and had to leave the room! Unbelievably, most of them later said "I never knew a car accident could be so terrible!" This film and another, "RED ASPHALT", are certainly the reality in its most graphic form. I will never forget, I just wish I had found a copy when my kids were attending the "high school driver" in high school!
