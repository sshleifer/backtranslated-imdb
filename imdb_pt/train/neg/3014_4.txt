I recently saw Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was drawn to the film as a photographer because I am a family member and a fan of Burtynsky's work. Although I believe the film does a good job of conveying its message, I could not help but feel that it was made as a belated reflection of Burtynsky's photographs and subsequent popular book. Obviously, one reason for this is the extensive use of photographs with zooms and pans through them. Although this is a good effect when used economically, I felt that 75% of the film was just a still from Burtynsky's book (which I already own). This is probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you own the book or are familiar with his work, maybe you should leave this book behind.
