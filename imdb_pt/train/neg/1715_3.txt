Although it contains facts that are not widely publicized, it is not exactly the truth. They took many liberties in rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that did not meet the facts of their lives in the 1930s. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde and WD in the gang at various times, and these people had so much to do with the facts like those included. Buck and Blanche were persuading Clyde to go straight ahead earlier than the one shooting, and in fact was drawn back to the crime. Some of the events that were portrayed in the light of day occurred at night. Bonnie's wound was much more severe and was never cured properly. It was so bad she had to be carried by someone until it healed, and yet it hardened, so she walked stiffly. Clyde was also limping because while in prison he cut a big toe. I know, I'm being picky, and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual errors in this "TRUE" story, the movie flies too fast from one event to another and appears more like several separate snapshots of their lives. , rather than being a fluent cohesive story. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading a book or watching a documentary if you want to get close to the truth.
