I have a rule of 5 minutes (sometimes I'll leave leway for 10). If a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it probably will not look better. I still have to try out any movie that has challenged that theory. Dan in real life is definitely not an exception. I was watching this turkey and I thought; wow, that's not funny, it's not touching, it's not sad, and I do not like any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The story of a columnist / widower's advice that creates three small daughters, who fits love with his siblings girlfriend. I suppose the slogan would be "advice columnist who could use advice"? I do not know. Dans's character did not strike me as someone qualified to give advice. I think it's the irony? I do not know. He will see his parents, brothers, sisters and their children in some sort of annual retreat of the family, which seems very sweet, and potential for good comedy, plots ... none that ever arise. The central story is basically how he loves this woman but can not have it. Anyone with a wrist will realize that eventually it will catch it, but you have to suffer with painfully bland, banal, network dialogue of life's "love killer" movies to reach the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> It's truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
