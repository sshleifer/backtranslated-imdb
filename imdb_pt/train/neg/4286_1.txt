This is practically the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've seen. I say a lot, because I also saw Soldier, in which he plays the villain ... but from what I hear, it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee movie. This, however, is. And if that is an indication of the quality of such films, I will not see any of the others. Lee is basically acceptable as a martial artist ... as the leader, he is horrible. He fights with random nameless characters every few minutes of the movie, probably because the screenwriter could not figure out how to stretch the film to the minimum time required for a feature film. The villain is the only character with a hint of personality and, besides being certainly insane, he hardly looks like a villain. Most of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time ... or maybe it's the other way around. I can not say for sure ... and I definitely would not watch again to be sure. The effects are not completely horrible ... but they are close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill Hitler. Somehow, the movie spoils this interesting idea as well. The plot is too complicated for your own good. The pace is bad. I can not think of a positive thing to say about this movie ... I really can not. It is simply too stereotypical and meaningless. If I had a time machine, then I could go back and prevent this movie from being made ... no, it does not matter. I only hope that few fragile minds will be exposed to this as much as possible. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to Lee fans, and no one else. If you're looking for a quality movie ... well, that's not it. That's sure. 1/10
