The film version of Sandra Bernhard's off-Broadway show is breathless and pretentious. Sandra pretends hall acts and superstars, but her sense of irony is just very interesting and fun. Her fans will say that she is subtly honest and this may be true. But she is also strident, with unabashed bravado, which is not suitable for such a film. She does not want to be cool - and certainly not willing to make friends - and that will always bother a lot of people. But even if you find it in the middle of the road, your stuff here is seriously missing. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and, although not directed by him, the film has its signature style cold and prominent throughout. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; her strangest touch was to have all of Sandra's inner public seem completely bored-a sentiment that many real viewers are likely to share. * 1/2 of ****
