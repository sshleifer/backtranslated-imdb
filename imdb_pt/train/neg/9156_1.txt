Ben & Arthur COULD was a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, looked at and produced this film. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and left the acting to someone who could act. This is a good example of a person controlling the entire production. there was no one to tell him, "Sam, this is bad, very bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only positive point, but he could have been much better with a good director, and better actors to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and have made this movie (twice). the acting and direction was so bad, this movie was turned into a comedy. You just had to laugh and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> A second good point .... that would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
