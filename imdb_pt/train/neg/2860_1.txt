This movie only has a 1 because you can not give a zero! If you have a weak belly at all, I do not watch. animal rights people you do not want to watch as well. This makes vegetarian people I swear I witnessed this happen! the only legal parts are the case and the fact that it is a true story. It's really too scary for this guy to work on ADT while killing people! Do you still feel safe when you give that little code? I do not! He had access to all codes in Kansas !!!!!! I hated the movie that was not scary, it was mentally scary! Do yourself a favor and do not rent / buy this movie I think it cost about $ 20 to do this INCLUDE your most paid actors !!!!
