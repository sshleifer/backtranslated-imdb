Could this have been interesting? a history of Japan's haunted houses from the point of view of a newly installed American family ?? but falls by surprise due to a simplified treatment and the inadequacy of both cast and director. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the same problem that often meets the popular modern renaissance of such a native fare, that is, the fact that spirits prove to be bad for no real reason other than expected! Also, do not deliver too much in the scares department? Is a giant crab attack just silly? as usually ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him to act in a totally atypical way, like Susan George seducing diplomat / family friend Doug McClure and Edward Albert feeding his daughter with a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> At one point, does an old monk appear in the house to warn Albert of danger if they remain there ?? eventually, it is called to exorcise the premises. However, history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only result of the tense situation properly created? leading to a violent, albeit unintentionally funny, climax in which Albert and McClure, possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, participate in an improvised karate duel to the death! At the end of the day, does this emerge a time-waster innocuous? tolerable in just 88 minutes, but by no means essential viewing.
