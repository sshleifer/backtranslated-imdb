This is not really a proper review since I have not seen most of the film. I stopped watching. The movie is very violent, with drug dealers and street punks, but that's not why I stopped watching. Here was the problem: I watched enough to be introduced to several characters, all of them were not interesting. Everyone was a tedious and despicable psychopath, with no surrounding personality, giving me nothing to wait for. I was not at all curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them. <br /> <br /> If there was even a person of interest, and I did not mean to say good or good person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with that. Watch "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In that film, Gary Oldman's character is a complete lunatic, but he is * very * interesting. Al Pacino may have done a good job on Scarface, but his character simply did not involve me.
