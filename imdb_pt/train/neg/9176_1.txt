You know you're in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives. Everything goes down from there. Unnecessary, "Matrix" - camera work with bullet time influenced. Nonsense cuts for video games. Hard old sea captains and crazy sailors. Ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye. Even the zombies are boring. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for at least one zombie movie "so bad it's good," but that's "so bad that those involved with its creation should be barred from making a movie again." <br /> <br />
