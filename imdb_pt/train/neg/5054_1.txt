We know that firefighters and rescue crews are heroes: an idea few would challenge. Friends and family members of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center may well be moved by this insipid movie turned movie. A sweet, sincere firefighter, but with a smug tongue, remembers what he can from lost colleagues to a numb journalist who turns his fragments into compliments. They ponder the results. He murmurs a little more, she composes another compliment, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> The terrible events that triggered the need for several thousand compliments are extremely sad, but this insipid and arduous dramatization is terribly annoying.
