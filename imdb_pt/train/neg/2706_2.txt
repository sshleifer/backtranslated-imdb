Yes, people are racist. People are even racist in college. That is a good point, and the issue of racism has been addressed many times before in countless films. What distinguishes Higher Learning from the group is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ruthless and predictable way possible, oh yes, it is also in college. <br /> <br /> This film deals with this problem of racism as Frankenstein deals with most problems, he hits the head repeatedly in a brutal and slow. Most characters are caricatured, caricatured (lesbian feminist, angry black man) who respond to situations in the most dramatic and predictable way possible. Instead of challenging stereotypes, this movie is overpopulated with them. Furious blacks feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (a feminist even holds a sign that says "Dead men do not rape." See what I mean?) I do not want to give anything, but in this If someone looks like a loner or a dating rapist, he'll probably behave exactly as you expect . The changes the characters make seem obvious to everyone except the people in the movie. The great turnaround in the plot depends on whether or not violent neo-Nazis act as violent neo-Nazis. I think you're just going to have to watch to find out what happens. Another problem I have with this movie is that it should be "blatant" and "blunt", but they make the Nazis the bad guys. I agree that the Nazis are bad, but that's my point. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad; we are not breaking any new territory here. The Nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930s. The film does not challenge any point of view or make bold statements. It deals only with issues we all know in a clumsy and special way. Being anti-rape, anti-racist, and anti-Nazi is not exactly taking a difficult position on a controversial subject. <br /> <br /> Higher Education is predictable, caricatured, and in a word, stupid. Avoid at all costs.
