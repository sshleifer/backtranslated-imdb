This may sound crazy even to people who remember this show ... But I remembered that as being live-action. I do not think I've ever seen the cartoon. but movie? perhaps. I remember that clearly. The guy was in a middle building like a showroom. He even had his red jacket on. It was dark and he turned into a red car and there was a guy on the second level looking at him. The car / face turned and went through the large showroom window and headed out into the street. And then he started to leave. That's all I remember. I really hope someone else remembers that too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I'm hoping I'm not.
