I love the horror movies of the 80's and I remember when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was taken from our movie theaters, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of them on Fear.net. You Better Watch Out was what I expected from these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was laughable by today's standards, the development of the character very long, but after all, it was fun to laugh out loud! <br /> <br /> The scenes in which he loses, because Santa Claus, or father, is feeling his mother and later, when the mafia is shown torches of light - not lanterns as in the 80s, but real torches ! - really tickled my funny bone. However, the scenes in which he was checking the children in his neighborhood gave me a chilling feeling of a different nature. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these characters were. It took me a while to discover that the main character was the brothers' adorable teddy bear.
