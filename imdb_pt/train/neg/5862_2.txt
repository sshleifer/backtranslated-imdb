Well, to answer a question from a person's "why does no one remember this movie?" is because really, not that many people saw this in 1978 and has not been shown much on TV since then. (If it's on video, that would be news to me!) Even in the era of the sometimes meaningless comedies that were the 70's, movie goers had the ability to avoid this movie. Unless they love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "this" a lot! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was funnier in "Bewitched" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan Rivers at this time of her career was making laughs making vicious jokes about the weightlessness of singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! Also it seems that every name "a little" famous of the time is in the cast. (Most surprising is Doris Roberts after "Everybody Loves Raymond".) <br /> <br /> Anyway, a rather good idea for a plot, a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here. With the help of a friend Cristal, he gets a prostitute to finally lose his virginity, but because she is "on top" instead of him, he gets pregnant! (A commentary on women taking positions of power away from men). <br /> <br /> Crystal's stomach grows, it goes through all the feminine emotions and related feelings. Unfortunately, he is now a socially misunderstood outcast! He is attacked by a mob that wants him to be eliminated (I think). <br /> <br /> He is forced to isolate himself to have his baby ... in a barn. Or, if you like, a manger (God knows where he left off!) It turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! Everything else about this movie is useless and unforgettable, the humor is mid-level or lower. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and some good touching moments and relevant Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of Rabitt Test, it's a big flop! <br /> <br /> I can not believe Roddy McDowell signed on both! (END)
