This is an amateur movie filmed on video, not an "electrifying drama," as the notes on the DVD cover bear falsely. I've seen much better things about graduate film students. Most of the story unfolds with a taxi ride all around Jakarta. This movie could have been made using a single video camera, but there are some sections where two cameras were used and the content was returned later. Editing is extremely difficult. The final editing was probably done with two cameras, jumping the content back and forth rather than a suitable editor. Maybe they did the editing in the cab too? English subtitles were written by someone not fluent in English, for example, "Where are you going now?" To say that the quality of production is on an equal footing with Blair Witch is generous. If you still are not scared, this movie was an ambitious and creative venture with lots of cool and fun images from all over Jakarta.
