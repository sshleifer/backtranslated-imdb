Visually interesting, but falls into the originality department. This boring exercise in technique runs out after the opening battle. Jude Law has the charisma of the toast burned, but in her defense, this movie contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever seen on the big screen. Actually, the script is so bad that it keeps getting you out of the movie and it made me think of work, beads, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream on blue screen. Paltrow is as wood as they can get. This could have been saved by the disgusting dialogue of the movie or by the camp from above. My only complaint about the technique is that the film Black & White (sorry, computer) would help because it seems that Turner colored black and white. Just a big clich√© mess. I'd rather break my femur than sit back in this endurance test.
