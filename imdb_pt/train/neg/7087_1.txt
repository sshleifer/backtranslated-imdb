I usually did not write an online review, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only is this filmed as a series of soaps ("The Young and the Restless" is actually filmed by professionals compared to this), but it also has terrible cuts. It has no action. It's full of useless junk. <br /> <br /> Here's an example: a guy wants to kill the main character as he was fired because of him. So (after a lot of shit) here they are: the guy puts a knife in his throat and says something like "You're dead now." So the lead character says, "If you kill me, you're dead. I told the police that you're threatening me." So the guy (killer) is like (about to cry): "Oh no ... the cops are following me !? !! Oh ... my God." <br /> <br /> Remember: this is just an example. I really can not believe this movie really exists. So if you want to see the worst movie ever ... go ahead, I recommend :)
