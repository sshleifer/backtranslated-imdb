The main reason for writing this review is that I found this "review" of a great and worthy 1972 movie, a horrible movie experience. If I can save someone to watch, I will have done a good thing. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is loaded with talent, and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh gives a ugly, sterile note. He begins filming the film from every possible artistic, distracting and egocentric angle. We see reflections from the stainless steel actors, on security monitors, their head shots from 200 feet up, close-ups of eyes, chins, and so on. The script, by a Nobel Prize winner, features long stretches of nasty homosexual pranks that are being falsified by both parties .... I guess ?? Given the character "twists" how would I know? The characters themselves, so richly drawn in the original, are coarse and unfriendly. The execution time has been reduced by an hour, which is the real problem or the nicest thing the director has done for us. Actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely plausible. Jude Law is more exaggerated than Caine, but as the Producer credited, he must have received the blessing of Branagh. <br /> <br /> In short, I find this ugly to see, an unconvincing shell of an old classic. . Why was it even done ??? The paying public has spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A piece of work vanity that fails every corner.
