On the surface, "Show Me The Money" should have at least completed a full season. You've had the ever-entertaining William Shatner as your host, surrounded by a dozen beautiful hungry legged models collectively called "The One Million Dollar Dancers." You had knowledgeable competitors who had interesting stories to tell about their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia. And you had lots of money! So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was failure. A good gaming program needs at least two of the three things: very simple rules, exciting rhythm, and the ability of the viewer to play at home. The best and most durable have all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM had none. <br /> <br /> The rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time show in history. . Let me try to explain how the game worked, as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> A competitor started with a single word or short phrase followed by the choice letters A, B, C (subtle plug for the network?). Each letter was connected to a separate question, all starting with that word or phrase. Once the competitor chose one of the cards, he could answer that question or pass and select a second letter. If they passed, they were able to see the next question and had the same choice. However, if they passed the second question, they were required to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After they answered and before finding out if the answer was correct, they then had to select one of the 13 dancers. on stage, each with a different amount of money on a parchment by his side. They have revealed their dollar value (ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and depending on whether the competitor responded correctly ... or answered wrong ... that value would be added to or subtracted from their pot. with me so far? In addition, there was a dancer who performed something known as "The Killer Card". If you selected the dancer with the Killer Card and had your question answered, you would be safe and the game would continue. If, however, you were incorrect, you had a final question to answer. If you got the last question wrong, you were out of the game. If you hit then the game continued. <br /> <br /> There was no giving up, no going away with the money earned until you answered six questions correctly or had six questions wrong or you were so far the hole that you could not make enough money to leave again . Got it? OK! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I saw it, was a complete lack of tension, because of the design of the game. A competitor could pass questions they knew they did not know and answer many questions they knew, making the pressure even lower. So they could still find a low dollar value, even after consciously missing out on a question, which meant there was still no "drama." And the fact that they could answer five wrong questions and still have a chance to win was a big mistake. And the pace of the questions was very slow: the questions were often so obvious, it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there were any questions about some of the more common answers. <br /> <br /> The rhythm, the lack of any real tension at any point during the show, and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite Shatner's Terpsichorean talents.
