usually I'm not the type to be scared of horror movies, but this movie is the exception. some way this movie came into my mind !!! is a very simple film, but at the same time extremely effective, it has an excellent atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments, the girls' father coming down the hill is a real highlight. Another seen was the family photo I was not expecting this and I jumped out of my place !!! I would recommend it to everyone to see this movie, with the lights that will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
