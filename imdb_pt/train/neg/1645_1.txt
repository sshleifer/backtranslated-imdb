I watched this movie last night, and I had to put a watch on anyone else who was thinking about watching this movie. In a word - do not do it. I seriously feel that this is something that a scriptwriting student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, that is, all other words were a curse word. I have no problem with profuse curses, as in "Good Will Hunting," as long as it helps to delve deeper into the characters. In this case, it was only hollow play with the attempt to draw an occasional sigh * or laughter from the audience. The three protagonists are all their unique stereotypes, the idiot of the city street, the idiot of the cafeteria and the "I-not-gay-fair-in-touch-with-my-feminine" side a little less than a jerk . You just do not give a damn about any of them! They are all superficial losers and non-losers you WANT to see lost. For those who dare, this movie has some funny moments, the beginning and the end. The toilet / vibrator scene is funny in a slightly sick way "Uh, yeah". Really, I would only recommend this movie to my worst of enemies.
