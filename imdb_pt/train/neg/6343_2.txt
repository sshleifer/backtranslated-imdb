Maybe I'm not a sophisticate. This and Closer are two of the supposedly more cerebral films I've seen recently, and both suffer from exactly the same problem to an excruciating extent. The dialog is false false false. Nothing that comes out of someone's mouth seems remotely believable. Maybe the way this movie is created is what it is supposed to feel, but it was unattainable. It's boring. I left after 20 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I'm staying with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen fix. If I come across this on teevee, I'll turn around and try to find an episode of Quincy.
