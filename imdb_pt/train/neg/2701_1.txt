First of all, yes, I am white, so I try to tread lightly on the always delicate subject of the race ... anyway ... White People Hating Blacks = BAD but Blacks Hating white people = OK (because apparently we deserve this !!) where do I start? I would like to have something good to say about this side movie unintentional comedy scenes: the infamous scene were Ice Cube and co. fight with some really big neo-nazis, really strong, really very angry and scary and win !!! the neo-Nazi, where twice the size :), and the chase! the persecution is invaluable ... This is NOT a film about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not work ... this is a racist film that reaffirms all the cliche stereotypes, the white guy who is mistreated by his black roommate it automatically becomes a skinhead ... it's just horrible that I regret having seen it. <br /> <br /> Save your time and the terrible experience of a poorly written, misrepresented, bland and clearly biased image. you're on the subject, go and rent American History X, now it's a movie
