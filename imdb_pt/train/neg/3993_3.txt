This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but it's not that bad either. In my opinion, the PG13 movies are not scary enough, so I already knew I'd be bored all through the movie. Of course there were scary things going on in the hotel room, but nothing we had all seen before. I do not think I liked it because I thought there were a lot of twists going on; It got old and repetitive. I also did not understand if all the things that Cusack was feeling in the room were real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that have occurred. The movie just creeps and when it finally comes to an end, you want to continue because you're still waiting for someone to tell you about what the movie was. What I liked was the special effects. Besides, there was not much pleasure in it. Maybe it's just me, but I thought this was below average.
