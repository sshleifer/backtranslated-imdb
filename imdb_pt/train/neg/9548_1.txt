I can not believe I watched this hoping for more. It all starts well. This movie pushes the limits of reality so far! At least the first one was a bit unrealistic. He rips out the first film and even mentions the Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. However, it has a good message, ATTENTION TO THE BIG BROTHER !!! The movie just makes it look like Big Brother is a lot bigger than he really is in reality. This was very aggravating. Even the makeup on the actors was completely bad. Some of the performances are very good. Some of the acting is really bad. The script was OK at some points and completely confusing elsewhere. This movie plays with convenience every five minutes. Like I said, I can not believe I saw you waiting for more. I think I'll appear in the original to return to Earth ... Q
