The potential was there. I saw Creep and I thought, 'Oooh, this is getting interesting' several times. However, somehow the interesting plots ended up unexplained or ignored, as if they had never happened. The main character was annoying throughout the movie, and at one point my friend and I shouted that we wanted her to die. There are some genuinely scary / scary moments, but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that simply bothered me. It's one more of those horror movies that come up and intrigue you for a while, but in the end it leaves you frustrated and a bit confused about what the filmmakers were trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of this movie is the bad guy, but when the villain is nicer than the main character, you know he's a loser.
