When many people say it's the "worst movie I've ever seen," they tend to say that pretty much any movie they did not like. However, out of about 700 movies I remember seeing this is one of two that I stopped feeling personally insulted and angry. This is my first review of the film, by the way, and I registered on IMDb just to talk about the wickedness of this movie. I went to see it when I was in theaters (me and my two friends had 3 of 5 people there), and after 15 years I can not remember too many details, but my attitude when leaving the theater is still crystal clear. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler alert --- <br /> <br /> Oh my, where to start. Fat loser left at the altar, goes skiing weekend, meets blonde who cares about him, takes her home to meet the family, they are all cannibals and he is the main dish, pathetic attempt of a dramatic escape, kicks all his butts and flees with his brother's girlfriend, they live happily ever after. To vomit. First of all, the jokes are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be FUNNY and that it was COMEDY. The special effects, the few that exist, look like they were made 15 years earlier. The great dramatic ending was so mushy and misunderstood that it was almost unbearable to watch (it knocks down the whole cannibal family with rakes on the lawn, which stand in the style of Tom and Jerry when they step on them). I'm sure there's much, much more, but I have no intention of seeing you again for an upgrade.
