Renowned writer Mark Redfield (as Edgar Allen Poe) attempts to conquer past vices and start a new life for himself as editor of a magazine in Baltimore, Maryland. However, blackouts, delusion and rejection threaten to thwart your efforts. He would also like to rekindle the romance with an old love, a significantly flawed perspective, as things happen. Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield employs a lot of black and white photography, colors and tricks to create humor. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) performs relatively well. It is not enough.
