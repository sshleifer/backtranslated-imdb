I always felt that a good movie should have a plot. This particular movie was missing one, and I feel I would have been more effective with a plot. This was made worse by the fact that it seemed to last forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it seemed four o'clock. Not only was there no plot, but the film also had no notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I used to say it was until I saw "The Fast And The Furious." So, do not think that my review is from someone who needs nothing but action. I really hate most action movies nowadays; it's just that this movie is all the way across the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie. However, the setting and costumes were fine.
