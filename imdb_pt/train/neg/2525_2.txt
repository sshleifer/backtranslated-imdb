This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have said, "more boring than the church." Maybe I do not understand well enough, and I thought it started very well, but then (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working / sleeping with her boss, he just started dragging, and I fought stay awake. Again, it might symbolize something, but the explosion at the end seemed too forced and out of place. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I can not see why others think it's so good, because I found it extremely boring. By the way, I did not watch this movie of my own free will, as I was forced to watch for a film class.
