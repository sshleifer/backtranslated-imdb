Despite some slightly intriguing quirks in the screenplay and the overall value of the film's curiosity, Fury of the Wolfman emerges as a monotonous and uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy, saved only by the sculptural presence of the villain Crystal Pearl. The rest of the players, including Hammy Naschy, are a full write-off (though admittedly none of them are helped by an often atrocious dubbing). Although the script has enough variations from the werewolf / Frankenstein / Dr. Moreau themes to compose a dozen films, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterizations so weak, and dialogue so verbosely ridiculous (at least in the English version) that any the latent interest in uncertain procedures is soon nullified. <br /> <br /> Zabalza's direction seems spasmodic, even amateurish. His staging is awkward and ineffective. He is not helped by Villasenor's over-illumination. Even promising sets are photographed so unatmospheric that the director's few attempts to scare the audience are flagged far in advance. <br /> <br /> Other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude, although the strident and overly emphatic soundtrack of the ridiculously crude and totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation.
