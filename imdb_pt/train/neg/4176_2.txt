Maybe I missed the meeting when the meaning of "movie B" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good synopsis of this movie? Take aliens, replace xenomorphs with vampires, then remove all that was good about it, and that's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes in the movie, the "V-SAN squad" (which is the idiot acronym). I've heard) checks for a "base" that was massacred by vampires and then they descend (DOWN?)? A ladder obviously attached to a billboard with an obvious current train in the background. When should this happen? 2210. Ok ... (wait, I come back to this) <br /> <br /> Yes. The characters. Wow, well, there's the symbolic lesbian Asian girl, the cowboy cowboy, the weathered captain, the hot vampire / hot topic part clerk, and the disgusting disgusting man in charge. They are all interpreted by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost hurt me to see Micheal Ironside in this movie. Is not he getting enough money to be the voice of Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell? Pretty much the only original thing about Vampire Wars is about how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Watching this placenta from a movie, the only fun I had was with the weak attempts to make sets. Since when did the recording of PCI computer cards on a wall be considered a ready room in a spaceship? The money needed to make this movie could have been used much better.
