I agree with most of Columbus's fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format. Columbo is a single policeman with heterodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of any other common detective drama of the past. And that's the disturbing point, because Columbus is not an ordinary detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts to this movie that have puzzled me. First, I can not figure out the title of this movie. It's misleading. Perhaps a better title was "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Second, Columbo hides a test without offering the reason (at least for the viewers) of why he does it. <br /> <br /> I do not feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk has returned to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
