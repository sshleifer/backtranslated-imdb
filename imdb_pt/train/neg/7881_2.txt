This movie is a portrait of teenage twitchy Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his bad marks in math. He did not make the best experiences of his life before and had serious self-esteem problems. After a difficult start at his new school, he starts making friends, falls in love with a girl and does some American teenage things. <br /> <br /> In addition to some elements of comedy, the film is told in a very serious way. , concentrating on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this summary of the story, spare your time and see something else. If you do, please be aware of the following: 1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong and then gets self-pity all the time. For me he was not that kind of "lovable loser" with whom you can feel sympathy and laugh. Instead, he and his behavior really annoyed me, and with my own teenage years, not far behind, I could hardly stand watching. <br /> <br /> 2) The film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be just my experience the characters simply are not (except for Janosch maybe). And yes, I know this movie is based on a self-biography written by a 17 year old - but having some experiences with German and German schools, I do not believe in it. <br /> <br /> 3) Showing sexual arousal is really important to a movie about this subject. But I doubt that teenage boys will do an "Ejaculate on the cookie" contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with their sperm during mass masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the wet cookie afterward. Although this has amused me in a despicable way, it is not funny nor to underline the serious attempts of this film. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a sub-plot about Benjamin's family and his father cheating on his wife - still, I do not know why it's there and where to put it. I just got bored. Well, I personally hated this movie for having Benjamin's character, without a message, concept, scheme, whatever it is, and the failed attempts to be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people may find it sensible and touching. If you liked "The Other Sister", you'll probably like this too. I hated them both. <br /> <br /> 17-year-olds should not write an autobiography and if they do, it does not seem like the best idea to make a movie with him. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
