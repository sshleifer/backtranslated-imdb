Because I? Why should I be subject to such slaughtering as might have made an interesting plot? At least if I can tell other people, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the synopsis in the back of the thing and avoided it. The movie was slow, had very little character development, and focused on the idea that a weird white man could become cool if he got a black man in the Los Angeles style. <br /> <br /> If you want to try the stereotype LA sensation of vertiginous superficiality - watch the movie. Note, however, that this movie does not define what we came to think of as a "LA lifestyle", it is a wonderful example of the products that derive from it.
