As the number of Video Nasties I have yet to see decreases, that little pile of crap appeared on my "for rent" list when I saw it was available. <br /> <br /> The premise involves a fashion model or Something being hijacked and taken to the jungle to be rescued by a motley pack of idiots. Some other idiot is hired to bring her back and gets a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, but if he comes back with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, this pilot is one of the worst actors of all time! All right, they're totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose wandering terrestrial god wanders through the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribal women to devastate and devour. Now this guy is just a guy naked with some of the worst makeup ever, ping pong balls for eyes and that's very cute. His grunts and groans are a feature always present in the soundtrack, and I found myself silencing many of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I forget to mention almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this movie was banned, although there is a specific scene, about a second long, where the god attacks a girl and expels her, but it is not a redeeming factor for the fans. In addition, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows long closes of female genitalia and, unfortunately, also masculine. So if you want "fair" in terms of exploration, you get it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this garbage to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just an atrocious padded junk that only a Video Nasty fan will likely see and even then if you're making your way through the list, leave it to the latter. If you watch first, you may have the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
