Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about three 20-second appearances and what Gene Barry is doing throughout this movie? I have no idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that does not make any sense. The inept writer / director (the same guy) killed everyone's talent with his horrendous ... work. I got the DVD for a penny so I can not complain! But it's weird! And that makes you feel strange and not in a good way. This was the 70's and it looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be inside their head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched disk, it quickly plays dirty. There's that vibe "Manson family in acid." <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the other reviewer got everything he did from this movie? Maybe they worked on it when? Either way, be prepared to lose more than 80 minutes of your life and never come back. Yes, this is awful!
