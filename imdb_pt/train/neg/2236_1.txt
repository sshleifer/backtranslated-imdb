I really do not know where to start. The acting in this film was really terrible, I do not remember seeing so many 'actors' in a movie that could not act. Not only was the acting bad, the characters were incredibly stupid as well. <br /> <br /> Then there is the action. I believe even children know that when someone takes a shot, there is blood involved. But when someone is shot in the Golden Pomeranian for ten (!!) times, there is no blood. Well, I guess it's just me. <br /> <br /> To shorten the story (because believe me, I can continue for hours on this movie), this is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie should be number 1 on the bottom 100, no doubt.
