Little Mesquita is one of the most annoying CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a way to produce the easiest comedy programming possible for the most easily offended viewers who, for CBC, are 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and so deadly that I can not believe it. The performances are very complicated, but I do not blame the actors, since these types of stereotyped one-dimensional characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded. Very lame show with bad jokes that they tried to present as "controversial" well, is less controversial than the other annoying CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
