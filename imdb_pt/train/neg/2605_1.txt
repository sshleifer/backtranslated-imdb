Although I recently put it on my list of 10 worst films, I must say it's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or any of the "Look Who's Talking" sequences. Still, it's quite nauseating, even with sexy Drew Barrymore making a kind of horror movie response to Holly Golightly, moving from New York to Los Angeles, but discovering that she's being pursued by a murderous look-alike. Poor Sally Kellerman, a quirky actress acclaimed in the 1970s, is reduced to an insignificant supporting role, and Barrymore's leading actor, George Newbern, is the worst kind of serial actor, always pausing to laugh after each sentence. The image is beautiful, but Drew's bloody shower scene has showmanship, and the psychopath's identity (even though it came out of an episode of "Scooby Doo") is interesting. But in the end ... stay real! Who had to clean up this mess? * in ****
