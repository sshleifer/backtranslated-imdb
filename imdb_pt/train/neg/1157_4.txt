I ended up watching The Tenants with my closest friends, who rented the film just based on the appearance of Snoop Dogg (a passionate fetish of them) on the cover. Understandably, I did not expect much. I thought the film would include the typical set of behavior and images related to Snoop Dogg, often seen in videos of rap cliches. However, my generalization was mostly wrong. Unfortunately, that did not make the movie any better. <br /> <br /> Most would describe the film as a serious and somber drama, while I would describe it as a dark and boring drama film. The film tells the story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces. Their opposing lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the film as a wild rollercoaster - most of which is contributed by Snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a serious case of split personality disorder. And although the film is a drama, the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - of Snoop and company was more comical than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to those who are impaired attention because it has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are largely bound to more dialogue. The end, however, jumped at me with a sudden surprise. It was a bit skewed, a bit unexpected and a perfect way to finalize a movie that needed finishing. While watching the final credits, I could not help but imagine the director thinking, "Oh God, how the hell do I end this asshole." By the way, the director has carefully laid out suggestions and subtleties that have led to climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo in a street crowded with dwarves wearing only black blouses.
