For years I remember reading about this show "Trouble With Tracy" on TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 AM! I lived about two hours drive north of Toronto and we could not get the CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can not have. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this "Trouble With Tracy" was all about. Did she have a beautiful girl in the lead role? Was there nudity? Was there suspense? Was it a comedy? It would be okay if there was some promotion of the show. At least I could know what I was missing. But not! The mystery made me crazy, until CTV's affiliate CKCO built a transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario, and began broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as the CFTO. Saturday morning at 6am !! One Saturday morning I got up and turned on the TV at 5:59 and finally got to see what was "The Trouble With Tracy". Yes, the "Trouble With Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and was stuck in the harmless 6 o'clock spot so no one would ever see how horrible it was. <br /> <br /> Talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years ago. later, but many would argue that he actually "died" the first time he appeared in this program. When I first saw that cold Saturday morning and fell discouraged back into my bed, part of me also died.
