Some of my old friends suggested that I watch this movie, but I only had a chance recently. I had high hopes of seeing something interesting from Kamal Hans, what I saw was a bunch of camera angles rubbish mixed at high speed. I could not understand what the message was except humiliating Hinduism. I'm more like many types of religion, but I felt that Kamal Hasan is a low-key man who orchestrated this kind of thinking. He could have made a horror movie out of this crap. He tried to add the Hollywood genre of virus and God forbade it not to turn him into a mutant and eventually to dominate the world. This is a very suitable film for a film school versus regular audience. What a shame for him for not holding the talent he has. Beginning of the story he tried Chaos to lend ideas of butterfly effect, then between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting Hinduism (again I insult more Hinduism, but this movie has no equal and my insult is even for religion in general that can have made this intellectual movie.)
