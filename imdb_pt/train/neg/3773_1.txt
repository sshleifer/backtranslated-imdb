When people ask me what the worst movie I've ever seen this one. It's not even near riffing at MST3k level, or watching midnight at a theater, or even as nighttime filling of the Disney Channel. The only time I wanted to jump out of a ride at Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Man's jacket from the dummy, tear it to pieces, and put it in the throat of the guide saying "Eat this ! Eat this profane coat of darkness !!! " I've never been so mad at a movie, not even "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon." Do you want beautiful colors and cinematography? Not here, dear. Reviewers keep saying "oh, but it's a lot like a comic book," well, to me, it's the color of a Chubby after several weeks in the sun. About so nice too. Beatty wanders through this landscape jumping and talking to the clock, himself and occasionally with the other actors, waiting for someone to tell him at what time the sequel will begin filming. To be fair, I only saw this movie once, but my pain threshold is for a man, not a God.
