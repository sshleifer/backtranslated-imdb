Now the truth is that your very weak plot - for a Walt Disney movie, it's total crap. When the robinson appears, the films all over the place, I was shocked how poor he was. It 's like "Alice in Wonderland" went wrong!. It seems they were lacking in ideas, some crumpled up a bunch of crazy bullshit to try to get away - and they did not. After that, I sat there wishing for the end. My younger brother lost interest in the middle and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you do not care about the ending, you just want the movie to end. It's a movie to forget and forget quickly. If you have some free time, do not miss it.
