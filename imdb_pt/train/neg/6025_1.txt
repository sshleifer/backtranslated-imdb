Left Behind is the kind of movie "we know what we know because we know" that Christians (and almost any other naive person) need to help them feel that what they "THINK" and "BELIEVE" (do not "KNOW") is right . But at the same time, I feel bad for the little ones, because this is not a good movie. It does not help with any messages. I work in a video store, and I know the only reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and thought it was. Someone on this earth who thinks they know what is going to happen in the future is wrong unless they think they know they do not. I've had enough (but only after I've had too much) of these people walking with their noses in the air thinking that a movie starring a semi-talented TV actor means something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, you will stay away. I refuse to go into detail about this movie (not because AI did not see it (because I did), B-it was too shocking for my atheist to deal with (because it was not), or CI really did not have anything to (which is a word that no one helped make this movie understand) is that I want this movie out of my head, I want it to be made from my head, I want to that I watched it all with an open mind out of my head, I want the message that Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the movie out of my head.I just want all the things that were in my head BEFORE seeing these movies I'm sorry that anyone in this world has gone to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future (but will not) when they could have given that Seven Dolla rs Plus for any Human, Animal, or Rain Forest charity number. that then they would not be able to "BELIEVE" in the fact that it is real, they may indeed have what it is. LEFT BEHIND ZERO (out of ****)
