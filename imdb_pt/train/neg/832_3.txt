I give this film that is very well done and reasonably well represented. But I could not overcome the implausibility of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> First, a game built around the notion of "Russian Roulette" that has to be filled on time. The big problem is that if you are doing a live show, you run the possibility that your first competitor will be at random to draw the "real" bullet. So, what you do? You have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show. The corollary is that Ok, you come to an end and the first five competitors survive, which means that number six has the bullet and can not get paid. He will not kill himself at that moment, so it's kind of anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> Second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People will retreat, panic, dirty their underwear and do things that would otherwise not be very good for television. Lots of randomness. That is why the "real" television of Reality is actually scripted and even more edited. <br /> <br /> (The only random thing is the "performance artist's" discourse on female sacrifices, which were in fact historically rare, predictable since she went on to shoot herself with no effect.) < <br /> We are led to believe that the ratings of the shows would increase while it was happening at 1 am (unlikely) with the Asian symbol. girl announcing every impulse in the ratings. <br /> <br /> A point about race and sex. Big surprise the films of two minorities (one gay) and two female competitors are the ones that survive. So we get the two white males and, of course, the slightly less nice of them is the one who buys it. The purpose of such a show would be randomness, but the guy you least like is the guy who dies. The Climax is that after spending two hours fighting for suicide on television, the character of Eva Mendes (Mendes produced and starred this thing, so she has no one to blame but herself), in fact, a consciousness grows when someone dies. What does she think will happen? She is immediately shot by an annoyed spectator with the whole thing (reasons never explained) and the show happened to be a great success. Same? <br /> <br /> The problem with media satire is that it has to have some basis in reality or it has to be so exaggerated to be ridiculous (like the Network). This is neither.
