This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest last weekend, The Gravedancers being the first. Gravedancers was better. I can only guess by seeing this that production must have been quite limited. I admit that the story started interesting, but it really failed for me in the end. We really did not have time to sympathize or understand any of the characters that just made each of their erratic features even more annoying. I have to mention that there was also some mis-casting with a 12-year-old boy acting as a sheriff. The only reason I went through the whole movie was to find out what the big secret was, which turned out to be not so interesting. A little more background about the family would have helped, but they did not really seem like a family to begin with. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateurish that I could not even see it on DVD. Rank four is for the initial potential that history could have had. This was one to jump to for horrorfest.
