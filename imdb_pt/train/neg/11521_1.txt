This movie is really one of the worst bits of trash ever. It's really amazing that something so utterly terrible can be done. But if you can withstand the plot of mind numbing, character development and direction, you can have fun with the soundtrack that is so scary that it's funny. The film starts terribly and quickly becomes unattainable. Someone should give someone involved with this movie some kind of solace because their career was probably ruined because of the involvement in this movie. If you end up seeing this movie or have seen it (I feel your pain), then those words came too late. For anyone else, stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad it will waste 2 hours of your life. So at least you can clean or something while viewing it.
