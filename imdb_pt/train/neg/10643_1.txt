Usually I'm a bit of a fan of the 80s and early 90s movies that now have beens ... but this movie is so incredibly terrible that it was a real stamina roll. The boys who dress like girls were killed to death - but never so pathetically. Corey Haim's performance was lousy, as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better. This does not have redemptive qualities, even if you're a # 1 fan of an actor / actress in this piece of junk - stay away!
