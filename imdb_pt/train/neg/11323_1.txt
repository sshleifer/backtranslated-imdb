This movie will promote the improvement of the mind. Read a book! It's amazing that anyone thinks this movie deserved the time and investment to make. I've seen "B" movies before, but the "C" movie has just been invented. I do not think I would like Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching, but I saw myself looking for the fifteen minute videos on "Knights." The high school productions are better than that and the actors involved should erase it from their resume. Embarrassment is one of the many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who loves these types of movies, even turned it off. Now that has to tell you something. If you watch this movie and like it, I'll pray for you.
