That was not funny in 1972. It's not funny now. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I'm not criticizing the movie because it's incredibly sexist - I quit liking this bit, or rather, I liked the reaction it generates on boring PC people - I'm criticizing why it is poorly written and acted. <br /> <br /> The only truly memorable character is Blakey, whom the 25-year-old Britons will recognize immediately since he was a favorite of the Impressionists for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
