I am both amused and angry with people who claim that this film is so accurate about Vietnam, and have never been there. This movie is as true about the entire Vietnam War as the beating of Rodney King is true about ALL the cops. Yes, bad things happen (and have happened), but in general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, not everyone uses drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened much more often than the "hype" would lead you to believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam War like this brutal bloodbath but are based on both reality and Star Wars. If you honestly believe in the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: Viet Cong and NVA have done much worse for South Vietnamese than any soldier in the US Armed Forces. Fact: soldiers in World War II treated the enemy much worse overall than the soldiers in Vietnam, and they were welcomed when they returned home. The good Americans who served Vietnam in this country deserve our respect; Although the war was brutally stalled from the political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great disservice to claim that this type of fiction "mostly true" is the way things really were there.
