Ghost ... Class. Ghost II ..... awesome. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Although I would love to stay for this movie, I just can not. The film seems to have "exhausted". First bad signals come when the video has trailers for other movies at the beginning (something others have not done). Also many nonsensical characters, great examples the boy (which is a crack, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight the balls (it will not work, or should not) and the zombies flourishing what the hell they're doing there, there's no link to them in the other Phatasms). There is also a serious lack of dwarves running. <br /> <br /> The only good bits are the beginning of cracks and of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (possible SPOILER coming) <To me, this movie seems to be a filler between II and IV, since the extra characters only come out at the end, so they can continue with the 4 main ones in IV. <br /> <br /> Overall, very very disappointing. 3/10
