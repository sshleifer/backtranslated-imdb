Ultimately, very silly and tasteless. Yes, there is the metaphor of the golden cage, but most children probably would miss it. Forget it. Instantly. <br /> <br /> Animation is, as we expect, super-real. The plot could best be described as fine but tenacious. Although the ending seemed arbitrary to me. The underworld of the sewer is a properly disgusting reflection of the above world, and somehow, wealth and money seem to count for too much there. Oh yes, and there is a romantic interest in the female being the smartest, smartest and most experienced of the pair - this by itself is fast becoming a tiresome (anti) stereotype. Chances are your kids will love this.
