After an initial release of four very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION was able to shave the bottom of the bar with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I have not found Leeches anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. A mysterious tale invites several actresses to their castle for a short vacation. After some sexual antics, the girls are beheaded one by one. Who's the killer? Who knows? There are more red herrings in here than at the local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The pace is excruciating. The story is silly and the skin scenes are not so wonderful. <br /> <br /> Give this a miss.
