Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy and reclusive cameraman and a distressed artist who, both living in the Big Apple, develop an unlikely romance with the help of an online dating site. This in itself is not so unusual, but what it is, is their method of communication. Leaving aside the verbal, they write and then communicate through video. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the creator's own relationship (Arin Crumley & Susan Buice), which in addition to writing and directing acts as the main characters as well. With elements of avant-garde, anti-plot and docudrama, the film spreads to the wind with an indecisive structure, situated between narcissism and indulgence itself. <br /> <br /> As the film goes by, a brief separation and deterioration of its intriguing form of communication ages as the couple faces the difficulties of reality. Focusing only on internal conflict, or the afflictions of the relationship, the film struggles for a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor poignant. This could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplots and external conflicts, and a third act, for which there is none - only a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> What is even more aggravating is the film's descent from the story to the reality that abruptly ends with an open and unsatisfactory ending. That would have been all very nice and elegant, but there are no questions and no meaning to be discovered or pondered. <br /> <br /> (On a side note, the film contains beautiful animations and a lively and moving soundtrack, one of the most interesting aspects of production.) <br /> <br /> But, as always, watch and decide for yourself.
