Okay, so I'm an original Wicker Man fan and I do not usually like British movies remade by Americans, so why, oh, why did I get into the most painful movie experiences of all time? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and I've had some madness, perhaps? The movie was shocking! The little at the beginning with the crash / fire had no relevance to the movie and the female police officer knew where Edward was going, so the part at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland, well, that would not have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated. The story behind the wicker man was not really explored - and I think being in America really did not help the whole pagan topic. This movie was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense. I must say the best part was in the end when Nicolas Cage is on fire! I am in such desperate need to see the original again now in order to purify my disappointed soul. I really can not emphasize how disappointing this movie is, please do not see if you: A) Do not like British reviews of British Films B) You're a fan of the original C) I hate Nicolas Cage
