Watching "Speak Easily" is painful for Buster Keaton fans. Seeing a phenomenal writer, actor, comic, director, and stuntman subject to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a drop cloth, or perhaps more like seeing the best Camembert adulterated with serum solids and processed in Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is poorly educated as Professor Post, whose exaggerated vocabulary is the only thing that keeps him from saying, "Tell me about the rabbits, George." (Post would have said something like, "Please inform me about the status of the small mammals of the Leporidae family, of the order Lagomorpha, kind gentleman, whom I believe to be primarily addressed with the epithet" George. ") When Keaton created his own characters, they may be situationally clueless, but they were not stupid. They were quick studies and became masters of their worlds. Not so with Post, who never stops stumbling and fumbling and who has no control of their fate more than a basement rat had of the Titanic. And while Keaton's original characters had a charming ingenuity and innocence, Post is such a profound sexual retardant that if he ever gets physically excited, he would put an ice pack in the swelling and seek medical help. There are a few small, redeeming moments, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of vampire Thema Todd or his suggestion about costume appropriate for a Greek dance, but it is not worth the whole process. movie to see them. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch "Speak Easily" with friends, at the "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But in addition, stick with the silences. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton is remembered for.
