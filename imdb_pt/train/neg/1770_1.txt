My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst films ever made. Certainly in the top ten of those I watched all the time. At least "Plan 9" was enjoyable. I really enjoyed Christine, The Dead Zone, Firestarter, Carrie, and some of his other films. I did not care much about "Cujo" (just because the sound was so bad in the versions I saw and often I could not tell what people were saying), or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". But this mess was a total mistake in every possible way. The "creatures" themselves seemed designed by a 9-year-old child. (No offense to 9-year-olds.) Even the one-liners made us moan and were not at all funny.
