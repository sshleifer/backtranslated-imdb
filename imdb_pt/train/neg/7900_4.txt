The title creatures wreak havoc in a small, peaceful desert town. This is basically the plot for this movie, and while the scenes dedicated to the Munchies themselves are a little bit fun (in a low-key way), everything else is just filler, and bad filler. From the "hero" who is a painful aspirant to Woody Allen to the city's ultra-dumb cop, it is difficult to choose the most annoying character in the film. There were times when almost all of them were on the screen together and I was thinking, "Okay, at least the girlfriend is cute, but why do we have to put up with the rest of these idiots?" The film is also replete with pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which was probably dated back in the early 1990s. (* 1/2)
