I sat through this movie and I have to say that I only managed to keep my attention. The movie would have been a bit more bearable if I did not need to see the horrible CGI for future reference to the industry if you're going to use CGI to see this, so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Apparently this is supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen, but all I saw was a bad movie that bears no resemblance to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> Overall, the story was not as bad as the CGI. I was quite impressed with the acting and thought the cast was good and little more character would have been cool since it was a bit confusing for me from time to time, but this is not surprising, as I said, I just kept my attention , but in all honesty, I wish I had given this one a miss.
