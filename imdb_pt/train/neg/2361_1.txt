This movie is easily the worst of the series. Although New Line may be just looking at sales, everyone knows that the only reason this made more money than the previous one was due to its 3D finish. It was not that 3D was good either, because it was the 1950s 3D with red and blue lenses (anaglyph). It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. Also, this movie was so poorly done! Bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse direction. This movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like an episode of "Looney Tunes". <br /> <br /> Seriously, not to the horror audience because it's tacky and not scary, and it's not funny or entertaining to comedy crowds. Just a total mess with some bad appearances who are still trying to interpret this whole thing as a camp and have it far short of what they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember most of us who were fans of this series were just praying for this to end at this point because of how bad it had become. This is one of the films that helped take away the terror of popularity and believe that the public really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than to see a good and scary horror movie.
