This is the only movie I've ever seen. bad acting - bad plot - bad cast - bad targeting - bad cinematography - if they intended to make a bad picture, they could not have done a better job. I hope they are proud of their turkey. I'm surprised anyone associated with this movie has been hired again in Hollywood. do not waste your time!
