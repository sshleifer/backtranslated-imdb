I'll try to use words to describe it ... <br /> <br /> I saw the original, which was good in its own way, but at that time I should have feared a sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was 'scared' when I chose this, but now that I've seen it, I have to say, it's even worse than I thought. Why these movies still make money still makes my mind spin. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they are not that good, but it has to be said, some make heads simply horrible. But what can an actor do with a script like that? He is trying to be a copy of the original, but this time the places have changed, any form of history is gone and any attempt to really come up with something that has not been done before fails miserably. In a futile attempt to update it, they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big brother' theme, but that has been worn out for a long time and offers nothing more than a fill for between the beginning. it's the end. An attempt was made to try to save the film by making a ton of references to the original '83, but it turned out to be funny and sometimes a little sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing, and I do not want to say anything, to do ... go watch, or play Frisbee ... with the DVD .... for yourself. He will offer you the same amount of fun .. I promise
