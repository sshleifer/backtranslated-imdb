The thing that stands out in my mind in this movie (unfortunately) is the introduction, where John Berlin (Andy Garcia) is heading for the city. You see your Mercedes passing a winding road through a forest that seems to be laden with Redwood trees. It's very beautiful. <br /> <br /> About Andy Garcia playing a character with the surname of Berlin, well ... Andy is very Hispanic / Latino to be passable. Maybe a Caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm people, he stands out like a sore thumb, especially with his accent that ignites when he gets irritated. Yes, I know, great thing right? He's still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a serial killer that nickname its victims, Jennifer. All the victims are blind and he dismembers them. The killer has had a hiatus, but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness (do not ask) appears, Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman does a good job of playing a blind person, much to my surprise. When I saw Lance Henriksen playing the sergeant. Freddy Ross was worried. Henriksen has played in some very strange films, especially in recent times. I still can not forget him in the bloodbath movie, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> Berlin films in a small Los Angeles city as a detective. He begins investigating Jennifer's murders after finding body parts in the local landfill. His brilliance in discovering that one of the victims was blind seemed exaggerated. Just like the irony of the murder of * SPOILER * Freddy, with the similarities of recording and name. I was very confused by the logic of how eight "Jennifers" had gone. And the reason for the killer just crazy was not very good. In retrospect, this movie is probably more faithful to life in showing an innocent individual as capable of murder simply because they have become a little crazy over time or maybe they were born crazy. John Malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of Garcia! Although no police officer could legally press someone so strong and attack him without being overturned by right. As for the ending, it's a surprise, but it's highly debatable, much like Sgt. Ross's murder. The killer chooses to walk behind his running victim, opting for a joke, I guess. <br /> <br /> And there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that this is ridiculous. I'm not going to ruin the ending because, despite being unstable, it's a good surprise. After that, you'll probably say, like I did, "man, she was lucky!" 4/10
