The sun was not shining, it was too moist to play with, so I went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet day. "The Hat Cat" was the name of the movie. and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played the Cat, his mood was lame, and the kids did not need to see it, the mood was not tame. <br /> <The movie was like drinking milk from a raging cow, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers did not know how to do it. <br /> <br /> This movie, in short, is atrocious. The acting was poor, the plot was too changed, and the mood was surprisingly very rude. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, a rule breaker and a future sheriff. When her mother has to go to work, she gets Mrs. Kwan to take care of it. Possibly, the only funny part in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan is attending a Taiwanese courtroom at the C-SPAN. She soon falls asleep and here comes the Cat. <br /> <br /> The movie starts to get out of control. The cat came to try to let the kids have fun. He has Thing 1 and Thing 2, which all of a sudden begin to destroy the house. He improvises a TV Infomercial and accidentally cuts off his tail. And when the cat gets full Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Possibly, his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist. And there is a fish that tries to warn the children about the Cat. <br /> <br /> Pity he did not warn us that this movie was as fun as sour milk, or cut the tail. Soon the children are outside looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate in his collar. If the crate is not locked soon, your home will be home to the Cat universe. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting, on the whole, is horrible. Mike Meyers brings his irreverent Austin Powers trademark to the cat, saying things like "You dirty ho" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a blow to the testicles while posing like a pi√±ata. Spencer Breslin is great as Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is cute as Sally, although they alone are not enough to save this horrible aortic dissection waiting to kill John Ritter (accident is about to happen). Lawrence Quinn, by Alec Baldwin, is disgusting, always trying to conquer his mother, who is played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, boss of the mother, and it's also the voice of the fish. The last three are also bland. Generally speaking, if I were a parent, I would not take my children to like cool things, because there is a lot of it and more. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. As the late Dr. Seuss said, <br /> <br /> It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. Really, Universal, stop! Theodore is already turning in his grave. <br /> <br /> As my mother always says, "Curiousity killed the cat." - The Cat In The Hat * out of *****
