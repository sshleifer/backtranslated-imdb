Dude, really !!!! where you've been for the last 20 years, that's shocking anyway, horror? This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being low budget, but this is a laugh, if you want to look at the classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Immortal Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener The Golem and the passengers of the Ghost Train, you can not compare it, it gives a bad name, bad acting, bad script, etc. Total waist of money and free time, watched many movies, were like horror is my favorite of all the times, I'm really speechless, I have nothing else to say please do not make the effort to watch something so stupid, please understand
