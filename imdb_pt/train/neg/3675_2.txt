Really, everyone in this movie looks like they want to be somewhere else! No wonder, the cast is not done with the left hand, but not at all. I did not see anything worse than Natascha McElhone going through some kind of agent, carrying a gun. You do not use a spoiled city appearance in such a function. The only worst thing I can imagine is casting Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is equally horrible, possibly with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see him trying but suffering. Did I mention it's a completely insane story? Danger to many people because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, must be because the guy (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because the picture could be worse.
