The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since been duped into appearing in this by his producers, who have told him that many great actors were involved) is Father Pergado and manages to do his usual serious and scary routine. The cast is not so bad, although most have retired. The movie has terrible sound effects (created primarily from keystrokes on an old computer) and sometimes mirrors ridiculously - showing a scene from the sky, for example, for what seems hours on end. Despite this, the story is humorous in a kind of way of the world that is condemned and the production is adequate. Interestingly a scene features Albert Band and wife Jackie; Meda Band; The writer Frank Ray Perilli and the assistant of Charles Band, Bennah Burton. In spite of its lugubrious nature, I really wanted to see how it all worked, and so I liked it a lot.
