I saw it at the Gay and Lesbian Festival in Philadelphia. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Against my best judgment, I liked it, but it seemed to me that this performance was a bit ... weak (mostly I noticed this from the teenage boy's family). I mean, the script was not stellar to begin with, but the actors did not make me believe in relationships. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethelss, I liked it. The characters are friendly and the plot is not challenging or disturbing. It's sweet, the characters care for each other, and I do not count like fifty minutes abused. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
