I watched Phat Beach on the Cape for a while and I kind of liked it. The fat guy is the best character, since he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just a few stereotypes of young black men. I like watching these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fashions. Phat Beach is also funny because the low budget babies in this movie are strictly girls at home. Most low budget movies have this "local babe" quality, and you can tell the babies in this movie that they were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to see how the "young" went crazy about what was essentially a really over-used and high-mileage skank. There were some cuties too. That's the charm of these bad low budget movies. You'll see lots of puppies and some real cuties! I checked some of them on IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. What a pity. It would be interesting if someone could make a "Where they are now" book in all the cuties that appeared in the history of the movies and would never come back. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie that seems to have a lot for them and yet, years later, when you watch the movie again on TV, you ask yourself "what happened to X?" Anyway, this movie usually blows, but it has some funny moments.
