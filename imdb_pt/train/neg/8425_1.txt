Truly a filthy and vile movie with only a small amount of real humor. The character of the father in particular is vulgar to the extreme (intentionally, obviously), and portrayed in the most pathetic way, My wife and I find this movie terribly unpleasant, with absolutely no redemptive feature. Frankly, I wish I had never seen him. <br /> <br /> I consider this British effort a great embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoyed this movie have a skill that I do not have. : to rejoice in a display of deep depravity and misery. <br /> <br /> Producers should be ashamed of themselves.
