"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is crap. The acting is terrible, the atmosphere is non-existent and the characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this scum is that most of the IMDb users gave a 10. That's really horrible. No blood, no suspense, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted, the support cast is also terrible.Yes, some people may like this image, especially a mainstream society, but hard-core horror fans or gore-hound will not love this piece of crap.Personally I hate horror comedies , I'd rather watch serious horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Last House on the Left." opinion, a real horror movie is supposed to be scary, overly bloody and disturbing, without stupid humor, it usually spoils the whole concept.This is not scary, it's not bloody, it's not even funny as a comedy, so do not lose your precious time.
