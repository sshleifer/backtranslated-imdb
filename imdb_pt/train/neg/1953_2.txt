The first episode of this new show was today, and it was horrible. Not only did Shaggy have a new, noisy voice that made her voices heard tortured, but it is so far from the original concept and style of animation that it is almost unrecognizable as a 'Scooby-Doo' show. Even in the dark days, when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's nephew Scrappy was there, the team still solved mysteries. This new show, instead, features Shaggy and Scooby battling a super-villain of James Bond and his henchmen while living in a mansion. There is not even a van called 'The Mystery Machine' (and the teaser for the next episode that promised that a robot type transformers did not put my mind at ease). How can someone pick up Scooby Doo and do it? <br /> <br /> The show gets two points for two scenes with the whole Scooby Doo gang, all talking to the right voices except Shaggy, and even then I'm being very generous.
