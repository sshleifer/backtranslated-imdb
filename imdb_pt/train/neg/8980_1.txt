I'll never forget the night I saw this movie. We were on a patrol submarine in the North Atlantic and this was the scheduled movie of the night. We ALL gave up after the second roll. They did not even try to show it in the middle of the night showing. Opting for a reprise instead ... That's all I really have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment should contain ten lines. I should not fill in the comment with random words, so I'll continue to ramble until I have my ten BS lines. I could not find George Goble listed in the credits, but I remember him in the movie. The sin was terrible and the songs even worse.
