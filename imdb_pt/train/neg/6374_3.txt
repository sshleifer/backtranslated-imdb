This movie was a bit confusing at first. I usually like Gina Phillips, but this one I have to say was a bad choice, just like she's making the movie Ring Around the Rosie, which is not a good movie either. Jeepers Creepers was much better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. She totally scared me and in the end, this was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) coming to the funeral of her twin sisters. She stays in a house that her sister owns and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is kind of sacrificing her relationships to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can not die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, what she tries. Crows have a strange part to it. When intercourse goes to sleep, Crows eat there organs, so they can not sleep. But they do. Basically, everything crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and their relationships will be buried, but not dead, because they have to suffer forever, so that Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yes, I hope this helps. If it does not, sorry. I love you.
