The question, when you see such a bad movie, is not necessarily: "How was such a bad movie made?" or even, "Why did I see it horrible in the first place?" but "what have I learned from this experience?" Here's what I learned: Just because the "rules" of horror movies have been cataloged and satirized countless times over the last ten years, does not mean that someone does not go ahead and make a movie that uses ALL of them, without a trace of humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If the movie has to be described as "vaguely" based on the video game, you have script problems. <br /> <br /> - The black character does not always die first, but the Asian character always knows kung-fu. <br /> <br /> - While you can boast of having discovered how to make the "Matrix" effect on a budget, this does not necessarily mean that you should use it over and over again na nausea. <br /> Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee roles of choice. <br /> <br /> - Whenever a scene is not edited together, just use some pictures of the video game, no one will notice. <br /> < - If your cousin's metal rap band offers to write the theme of your movie for free, politely decline. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not people killing zombies. <br /> <br /> They are about zombies killing people , preferably in the most horrible way possible.This is what makes them SCARY. <br /> <br /> White people who can afford $ 1,600 to get to a rave deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you Find an old book, it will tell you.Everything you need to know.Everything else you will discover in your own two lines dep ois somebody ask, "What was that?" or "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> "Bare breasts are not panacea for horror films. <br /> <br /> - A helicopter shot and a licensing agreement with Sega magically transforms your movie from "student film" to "great studio release." Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you can name the three "Living Dead" movies, that does not make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I've seen movies worse, but only because I saw "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation".
