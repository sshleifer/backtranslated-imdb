I am a sucker for a good novel, but this one does not qualify as good or a novel. I had the story nailed before the credits ended. With such poor dialogue, plot development and character, I suggest investing your hour and a half elsewhere. I had to run off and rent Serendipity a third time so I could take the bad taste out of my mouth.
