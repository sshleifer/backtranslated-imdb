This movie is so stupid that it just goes around and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to watch "Darkness Falls" actually and thought this was the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I pushed as hard as I could and still could not get rid of the boring moments. I just envy people who have been paid to play or work on that film. They really got money for that crap. Is not that incredible? I mean, in this movie, a man is killed and stung in a wooden grinder in small pieces of blood, and a few minutes later, the mother and the boy talk quietly on the table while nothing happens and they drink coffee. Please! Let's go! Who gives money to these bad movies? Oh, and the "tooth fairy" was lame. It's not scary at all and it was obvious that it's a bored stuntman wearing a poorly made makeup.
