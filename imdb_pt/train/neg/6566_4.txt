I watched this movie after having so much trouble downloading it through Rapidshare. And I have to say, I did not deserve this. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so excited that I was really looking forward to it. <br /> Parinda is one of those films that fail to meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, even though they have a great story. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, was vaguely based on the classic "On the Waterfront." Anil Kapoor was annoying, especially when he came from America. The direction lacked quality often, except for some intermediate scenes. <br /> <br /> Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra and I am 100 years old. Sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that Parinda was bad. It was not good enough.
