I saw this movie when I was much younger and found it funny. I saw it again last week, and you can guess the result. Some funny parts, very few and very long. The beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want a total b movie, it's a good choice, but do not expect too much from the dwarf size
