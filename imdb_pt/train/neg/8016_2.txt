First of all, this movie is GLACIALLY slow, and I can see most viewers losing their temper with it in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film was one that I think would form the basis of the film. an excellent film; what was lacking here was a plot to advance the underlying themes. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate because at the hands of a writer like (for example) Lanford Wilson, I think symbolism as a mountain lion invading a school campus could take on tragic proportions without being heavy. <br /> <br /> I think that with a good screenplay supporting the film, the same filmmaker, with the same tastes, and even with the same actors (who did not even have the chance to impress me), could have been able to present a meaningful and moving representation of the pains and struggles a boy goes through when he develops a powerful "fall" into an older boy he admires. <br /> <br /> However, I am sorry to say that without this foundation , and armed with a vague script, stupid and extremely uninteresting, without any kind of plot in sight, and without any kind of sensible structure (eg after viewing it, I believe you will find that you can not point to climactic scenes, and instead you will find yourself enumerating "well, maybe that scene, or that, were climax ...") - the result is 95 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, we were never terribly interested in any of the characters; their attempts and difficulties are simply boring and tedious. Without a good plot, dramatic devices and surrealist freedoms become intriguing and confusing, rather than improvements in the story line. I could never believe, for example, in the creation of "Leah" and I think most viewers would be totally baffled by the conventional way in which their phone calls were filmed. <br /> <br /> As the movie is, I'm afraid it's one that I can not recommend at all. What I can never understand is why a movie like this is not refilled by an enterprising filmmaker ... instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good on the first release! All we need is a good script, written by good writers, and I think this film could easily be transformed into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male maturity that is rarely dealt with in dramas. All the elements that were so boring and seemed so recherche in the film (the messages written on the boy's belly, the scenes "Leah", the fantasies of the television screen) could be rich if they were supported by a good STORYLINE. I see in some comments that people are talking about this movie as being somehow on a "gay" subject, and I think that's wrong. Obviously, the "passion" portrayed is that of a newly adolescent boy of an older teenager, but Logan's character is too young to have been based on specific sexual choices and, in fact, in his portrayals of masturbation, all type of stimulus, sexual and non-sexual, as would be expected in a very young boy like him. I believe that "passions" like Logan's are common among young males who grow up to have a decided preference for female sexual partners.
