What an absolute pile of pants. Having read Chris Brookmyre's books religiously since I came across "Very Ugly ...", I was delighted to discover that this drama had been commissioned. <br /> <br /> Obviously, I had a lot of faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even it does not fit. How can anyone read the book, and then adapt it to this piece of scum is beyond me. Whole characters are changed, situations are discarded, and seeing the dramatic invasion of the Parlablane reduced to Nesbitt by making a quick chin up and sliding open a balcony window ... brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to think what will happen to "Country Of The Blind" if this is the benchmark ... <br /> <br /> Please just avoid this ...
