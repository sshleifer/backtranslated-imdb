I've seen better production quality on YouTube! I pity the actors, as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking, I'm not sure how they could get the lines - I really doubt any actor would have been able to save this movie, no matter how good they were. The characters were not developed, and there was no real cohesion in the plot, which seemed to go nowhere very much. Too bad, since the premise of the film was good and with better production quality, direction and script, it could have been a decent movie. It certainly was not a comedy, unless you laughed out loud with the dubbing - which was amateur, even the English actors seemed strange.
