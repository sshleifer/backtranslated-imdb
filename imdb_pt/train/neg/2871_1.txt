I rented this horrible movie. The worst I think I've ever seen. I think a 1st grade class could have done a better job. The worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad ones. Nothing scary except I paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too many. The acting is horrible, the characters are worse and the movie is just a piece of crap. The slauther house scenes are so low they make a B look like an Oscar nominee. All I can say is that if you want to waste a good night and a little money will rent this horrible movie. I'd rather watch the murderous clowns from outer space while I'm sitting in a bucket of razors than sitting on this flop again
