Umm .. I was quite surprised that someone really gave this movie high notes. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress ... and this movie just proves the extent of her "talent". The plot of the movie was weak ... I bet the idiot who came up with this concept was a perverted tone. If there's one good thing about this movie, I'd say it's Tommy Chong's daughter, just because she's your daughter ... and then there's that male Soap-Opera-ish leader who's decent-looking a little makes him attractive, but fails to help his dramatic skills. * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? How many more ways can you just say "This movie sucks"?
