Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her displeasure with the film, calling it, among other things, anti-feminist. She also said on her radio show that she hates doing "romantic comedies" because she does not believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This movie is a little better. She does her best, but overall, it was just another boring and unbelievable "romantic comedy" that has no real-world basis. Whereas there will be some who will say "suspend your disbelief," one of them will get tired of having to suspend you almost every time you get a romantic Hollywood movie. Janeane's character for some reason is usually filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes it look unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter shades (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons for which she hates this movie). It really hurts the movie if we want to buy the premise that Janeane should be the prettiest of the two. As many have said here and in other commentary topics, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact, very pretty. I did not read a review where someone said Uma was prettier. Having said that, however, I believe that the character of Ben Chaplin would be more than likely with Uma, not with Janeane. Many men do not like really smart women (and many women do not like really smart men), and sadly, Ben would probably have stayed with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive, it does not work. Its natural beauty comes in anyway. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of Janeane's male fans are obsessed with her like this movie because they like to think of themselves in Ben Chaplin's character, and really score with Janeane. Janeane is much more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood imagines), so take a cold shower. This is the role Janeane is best known for, and that's a shame, since it really is not so good for a movie.
