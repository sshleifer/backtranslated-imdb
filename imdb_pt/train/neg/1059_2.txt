I watched this movie last night and I'm already struggling to remember a lot about it. The story is about a group of criminals escaping from a penal colony. They fly to the Moon in a space age trash loader; when the garbage bins that work at the lunar base are terrified. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that low-budget science fiction movies often involve desert planets or, like this movie, criminals who escape criminal colonies. . Because this is that I have no idea. But I can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical. This is not really an exception. It starts reasonably well with a decent credit string and a dance music soundtrack halfway. It then degenerates into a boring science fiction thriller. So little of consequence actually happens in this movie that I'm literally struggling to write a helpful review, so if you're reading this, I apologize for not being able to illuminate the subtleties and nuances of the movie. For the record, I remember a bunch of boring bandits, a tedious pack of treats, some nuclear warheads, and a hologram of a naked woman. Other than that, I'm fighting. <br /> <br /> If you think you might be interested in the activities of lunar garbage hunters, then I would not hesitate to recommend this film. I would also recommend to those who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
