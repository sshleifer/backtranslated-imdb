This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people coming out of the theater, others falling asleep (okay, it was a late night show) ... This is a meaningless movie, one of those that may make you never want to see a picture out of the mainstream again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie, as I am deeply interested in what goes on in the minds of the authors of this junk. Do they laugh when they create this whole ridiculous thing or do they really think they are doing something interesting? I wonder ... The soundtrack is awful, plus some instrumental things that resemble an earlier Bjork album. Even if you are a fan of Bjork's music, stay at home. It's the best thing to do. Small and small pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit to this torture. God!...
