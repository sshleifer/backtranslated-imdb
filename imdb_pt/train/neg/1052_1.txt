***** THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILERS - but that determination would be insignificant in such a classic and well-known story. The story of CINDERELLA is my favorite fairy tale. The world will never have enough of this wonderful tale. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. This can not work if the story goes astray or tries to cast some interesting ideas along with some magical photographs and production drawings with bad direction and editing. <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story is more like an Ugly Duckling that never collides. or rather, is never turned into a swan. <br /> <br /> All the value of the production that money can buy, can not buy a good cinematographic timing and a dramatic development - or a good performance. <br /> <br /> Cinderella's entrance into the ball so poorly done, there was no drama of anticipation or excitement of discovery. <br /> <br /> The writing made me very nervous too. The Prince Charming was the most undesirable of memory. Why would a girl want to marry a coarse, selfish prince who did not like women? <br /> <br /> Turner's turn on the stepmother's role was an embarrassingly painful exhibit that demonstrated more line of action than nuances of action. <br /> <br /> Even the part of Cinderella had little interest or sympathy. <br /> <br /> Maybe just one sentence describe this attempt: So cheap 90, <br /> <br /> What MUST be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is glorious photography, work mate and production design. It was a pleasure to examine the landscapes, scenarios, and scenarios as the story unfolded. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella stories, choose two gems: 1) Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious stage TVs - the '60s look for the scenarios, this is the best celluloid version - none of them. An all star cast makes every effort to provide the greatest entertainment. Inviting, fun and memorable writing and music. This is the classic. 2) Ever After - this Drew Barrymore gem retains the historical perspective, changes the plot, but not enough to prevent the effective development of the most important points of this classic tale. The characters of the directors and all the supporting roles were written intelligently and acted well.
