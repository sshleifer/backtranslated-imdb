Baldwin really bent down to make those films. The script, the music, just about everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> FX sound does not sound real, they stand out too much (technical gadgets etc.) If they're trying to make a movie about things like that, at least try to stay real with it and release the beeps and extra beeps, because these gadgets do not really make loud sounds like that. Natural sounds like footsteps and such are nonexistent, which gives you an atmosphere of emptiness. <br /> <br /> The direction seems to be good for such a cheap film (hope it was a low budget production), although it seems quite amateurish at times. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem empty and fake, they just did not release that movie very well. I imagine it would have been a better idea to make Baldwin speak a little Spanish than to make the Spanish actors speak English, when we all know that their language is more vibrant and alive, so the performance of the actors can be harmed. much if a strange language is used. I mean, could anyone finally realize how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak English with a bad accent? There must be a corpse long buried in filmmaking. Has the production team ever heard of subtitles? This film again shows the European police as lazy and corrupt, vulnerable and defenseless societies. I mean, if the plot again goes like "Interpol can not do jack, then let's call an American to overthrow this international union" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures steps on the same path Columbia did just producing movies for hell. I imagine they also have some self respect. Buyers should buy all the dirty titles just because Sony puts something good a few times a year? Maybe they should have used the same team they were doing Di Say Si - Say I Do. It is spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job keeping the film afloat. Looks and sounds much better! Come on Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
