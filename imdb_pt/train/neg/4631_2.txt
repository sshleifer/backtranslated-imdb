Although Misty Ayers (burlesque stripper) is certainly attractive as the blonde, this film is just an excuse to let her undress for her underwear a few times (no nudity in 1954, when this film was made, not in 1965). >> The guy who hires you to work at a brothel remembers Bud Abbott, from Abbott & Costello. Most other women are unattractive, and the drunken woman is a bit of a freaky fun. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Ayers has a curvaceous physique, but you can not judge any. talent in action because the movie INTEIRO is post-dubbed. Some of these "exploration films," usually made after this, are interesting in some way, but this is really a boring party. Sid Melton (Mark the room for the father) directed. There are some facial expressions similar to samurais and interesting apartments, but there is nothing EVER here.
