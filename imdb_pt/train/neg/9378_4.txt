This is another production in northeast Florida, filmed mainly in and near Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was quite surprised that the company managed to break into the main street of Fernandina Beach long enough to reach the street scenes. The movie is beautiful and very bad. Tami Erin is cute, but exaggerates. Eileen Brennan goes even higher. Good for small children, or for those who like to fluff in large doses. A 4 of the Miller-Movies formula.
