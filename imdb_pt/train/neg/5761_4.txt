Hollywood does it again. Lots of money, no creativity. I'm sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this. Based on the previews, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you do not agree with the latest stupid pop culture, you will miss the silly humor in this movie. Why waste your time? You can sit in a diary doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide. <br /> <br />
