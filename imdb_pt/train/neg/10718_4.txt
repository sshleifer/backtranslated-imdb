Come on Tina Fey you can do better than that. As soon as the movie started, I knew how it would end. Of course it was funny sometimes. Even laughing loud and funny. But there are not enough laughs to save this movie. I would not recommend buying this. At most, I recommend renting, but that's all. Baby Mama has some funny scenes, but it's predictable and you can not have the moving ending you're working on. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher have made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher have done well in this and do well at it. But that is not better there. Baby Mama had a great supporting cast. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin all contribute to the cast's greatness. <br /> <br /> Another film about pregnancy came to the world of cinema. After the great Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama seems very median when compared. Knocked Up and Juno are hilarious, emotional and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face. The end of Baby Mama was bland and bland. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and does not try to be. I recommend it, but do not expect it to be totally hilarious. Expect a common comedy that does not give the grand emotional end it tries to have. I give Baby Mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
