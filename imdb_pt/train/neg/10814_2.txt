As a fan of "Jane Eyre" I was excited when the movie came out. "Finally," I thought, "someone will turn this book into a movie following the story written by the author." Wrong!!! If the casting director was intending to cast a "Jane" it was clear that he certainly succeeded. However, surely he could have found someone who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the frightening suspense of romance when laughter floated in the night seemingly out of nowhere? Where was the brightness of the child who flirted and danced like his mother? Finally, why was the story changed in the end? One wonders if the writers actually read the book. What a disappointment
