I find it hard to believe that someone would put this movie in the same context as the Exorcist. Where the Exorcist was subtle and scary, Stigmata was blunt, clumsy and very stereotyped. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful films I have seen for some time, but the images do not make for the downward spiral of paternalistic exposure that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film was hit when compared to the Exorcist, and my visit to the official website increased that interest. The site had many tales of "real" stigmata throughout history. However, scene by scene, the film is so obsessed with its quest for "genuineness" that it becomes comical at first, and then it is difficult to watch in the end. I began to be suspicious when the priest in charge of investigating possible miracles entered the salon, where our so-called heroine cuts off her hair and evidently flirts with her parents. <br /> <br /> The plot: A woman without faith in God. begins to receive the wounds of Christ (the stigmata) and is disconcerted and upset by the ordeal. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Is Frankie possessed by Satan, or a vessel for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this movie is that it finally ends.
