Another of my plunging into the box of business, this movie gave me exactly what I expected - a load of useless horror complete with screaming ladies. <br /> <br /> It all started so well - I liked the little introduction with the "news" about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear explosion, and was totally absorbed until the first person caught fire ... <br /> <br /> < From then on the film went down in folly, and sometimes it became almost embarrassing to watch. When the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character (the ability to light herons without the help of a match), it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea at the last moment ("that'll be good! "you can almost hear them say ...) As for the almost psychic bond between the main character and the nuclear power plant, well ... <br /> <br /> The movie appeared as cheap tat - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 so you already did.
