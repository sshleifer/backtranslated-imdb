I saw this movie a few years ago. I could not sleep and there was nothing on. Then I peeked. What you really understand is that it does not make sense and that's why it's disturbing. Richard gets tied to the wire and Jarvis begins to kiss Richard's girl while she is unconscious. So Jarvis's friend, Troubador, is playing stupid music on his guitar. The next morning, he shows Richard's girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby, and then she goes back to Richard and looks at him while he's still tied. Then they play a happy song and the movie ends. I mean what happened? Did they brake? And what was she saying to these two guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? Its just intriguing and poor for. I can not stand movies that are disturbing and do not make sense. This was the worst movie I've seen since the 90's version of the Lord of the Flies.
