The hardest thing about this movie is to say something positive about it. The characters were stereotyped as "white trash," the film's "plot" was atrophied from the start, and the worst feature of that film was that nudity was so blatant in body doubles that it was funny. Sadly, that was the only funny thing in the movie. Jenkins would be better served if, in the future, she refrained from using her life story to "entertain" people. It was just so bad. The only positive aspect of this film (this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film) is that my brother spent the money for that stink.
