To begin this review, I must say that I was, I suppose, a bit curious about this movie. However, I probably would not have seen it if I had not had my arm slightly twisted. <br /> <br /> My opinion, this movie shows how depraved man can be. In my opinion, the worst of all this Springer phenomenon is not that the kind of people on the "Jerry Springer Show" act like them (which in itself is eminently accessible) but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them . and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose that includes me ... to any extent that is true). If we do not glorify this kind of behavior (as some may say), at the very least, we may be subtly corrupting our minds and / or disentangling ourselves for this kind of behavior. <br /> <br /> But, enough soap box (more or less). Here's the skinny: the movie has an R-rating, and although it might deserve just that (I've looked away in some scenes, so I'm not completely sure), I feel like an NC-17 (tip from the hat to the other reviewer ) might be a bit more appropriate for the immense sexual content (a cynic could comment that the film was just a great excuse to show off sex on the big screen). The plot is very bizarre, joining the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a bunch of upset stereotypical blacks that will appear on different Springer shows. In the end, the film leaves someone with some resizing and Springer on the need to see the real world (evidently as seen through their show). I agree with him, it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek positive change. Having said that, let me just tell you the look of the really bad world on a new newspaper or the news to see it, but we will not shell out any good money to support the kind of sensationalist and perhaps stereotypical title that Springer intends to give us .
