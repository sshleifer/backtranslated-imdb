This movie is weak, The Cashier says that the most difficult gang in East LA and it's really Santa Ana, James Cahill acts like a queen in the closet knocking down all the tough guys from the Chlo gang. It's fake, boring, meaningless and crazy, I tried to get my money back at the store, this movie was so bad. It was also on the homo-erotic tip away from what the video box proclaims. James Cahill must perform in Gay Porn. James is in all the scenes, he can not act to save his life. The film features Eva Longoria, who is sexy, but James can not even punctuate her !!!!!!!!! I sometimes felt like watching the Gay Porn and being turned off all over the movie. James clearly wants to be with the men, but instead of submitting to his gay desires, he overcomes gang members over and over again. His martial arts skills are minimal at best, some members of real gangs would take him and his weak skills and tear him a new one.
