Before I started the TV movie, I had relatively low expectations. That's because it was made after the last episode of the series aired and many of the originals of the series went away. There is no president Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, in the second to last episode of the series, all the regulars except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley, left the B-5 permanently. Now for this movie they brought Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack and the Captain and Doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance. But how much old chemistry has gone, this movie is already seriously damaged. <br /> <br /> The film is about a soul hunter (Martin Sheen) who is taken to Babylon 5 in search of a planet full of souls that had been stolen from a repository hidden by an archaeologist (Ian McShane) . A lot of scary mumbo-jumbo thing occurs, but frankly, it was all very silly and meaningless. Yes, yes, the station almost exploded, but it was saved and everything, but frankly I felt it was a case of "having been done that - and done that much better in the past." The secondary plot, provided more to comic relief, was much more interesting as a businessman set up a holo-brothel and those in charge were not sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure it, they were slapped with a lawsuit. That was cute, but it provided some laughter - something that the other dark plot was certainly missing. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sheen did a good job playing the Shoulder Hunter - with her wildlife. eyes and bizarre delivery. However, over and over throughout the episode, he fell out of character. This should have been spotted and corrected. <br /> <br /> So the final verdict is that this is only for B-5 nuts totally hard (like me). Others seeing this may assume that the series sucked - which is a great injustice. This is a great example of a show without knowing when to leave.
