Was this tim meadows first role playing in a movie? the lion character is funny enough, but shortly thereafter the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to hear more. some movies can get away from the sexual jokes and base their audience to know exactly when the advertisement appears. some movies that do this are American pie and horror movie. horror movie was stupid, and American pie would not have done well without the sexual jokes. the only role, besides Leon, that had some humor that followed was ferrell. the character really was dumb and that was all, the idiot humor was all that made me watch. the movie was ok and nothing more. I really do not understand why snl people who are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show. the skits last about 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie out of a 5 minute sketch, so what's the world coming up for? Molly Shannon had superstar, cheri o'terri had horror movie, but she was not a leading role, and will have elf. but that was fine, but he made a stupid movie, but I can not remember, and mike myers with Wayne's world. How come the crazy tv crew can not get movie deals? seen only a guy break up, but only in 2 movies and a tv show with Andy Dick. but this guy depends on comedy to continue his life, funny or not. this movie is not good but had some positive mood. What a waste of film and people's money. (D D-)
