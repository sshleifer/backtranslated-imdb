Can anyone make good CGI movies besides Pixar? I mean, the animation looked old-fashioned by 2006 standards and even by 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent their entire budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their reasoning, the story really sucked. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a mouse - a mouse that is thrown into the toilet. Yes I know, it seems stereotyped. But then the sewer imitated the ways of London - to a certain extent. Throw a promise of jewelry (????) and an evil frog (??) and you will have a pathetic attempt at entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that something entertained me. Maybe the connection in the movie? Or maybe the happy mouse relationship forever. But nothing happened. He had the talent, but it exploded. D-
