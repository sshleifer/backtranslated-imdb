Recently I watched this movie at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival and, to be honest, it was one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Do not get me wrong, there are bad funny and fun movies (eg "Hands of Fate") and then there are the horrible bad movies. (This falls into the last category). The cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. It seemed that the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a free nipple kick), lighting was something between "a guy running around with a lamp" and "nonexistent." The actors were as bad as the actors in the soap opera, but not as bad as the porn actors, and they looked as if each line was a complete surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the masked assassin's appearance, a classic look at Jason Vorhees's "Friday the 13th". The lot was extremely poor and the ending even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone who needed an example of how a horror movie should not be, or maybe an insomniac needing sleep.
