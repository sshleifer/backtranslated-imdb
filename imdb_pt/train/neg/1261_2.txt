I'm a fan of Jean Harlow because she had a star quality. I do not think her films are good and I do not even think she was a good actress, but she certainly was great at comedies. Every piece of comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good. But this movie may be more of a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful at this and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new. It always strikes me to think that Harlow's beautiful body was that of a sick woman. Well, in this movie, she looks beautiful.
