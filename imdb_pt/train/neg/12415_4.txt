I do not recall "Barnaby Jones" being anything more than a very mild detective show, in which, as with any Quinn Martin show, Act I was the murder, Act II was the protagonist of the murder, Act III was the turnaround in history (another character assassinated), Act IV was the resolution and the Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) asking his father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he discovered the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of show. <br /> <br /> One thing I remember was the great theme song by the great composer Jerry Goldsmith. Strangely, the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show from time to time in the seven seasons the show was on the air. I'll also admit it was nice to see Ebsen in a different role from Jed Clampett even though Ebsen was poorly rated. I just wanted the show to be more fun than when I first remembered it. <br /> <br /> Update (11/1/2009): I attended an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube via the Channel American TV channel. Let's just say I was kinder than Goldsmith to the show "Barnaby Jones".
