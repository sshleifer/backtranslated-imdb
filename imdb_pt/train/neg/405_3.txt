This movie is worth watching if you like to marvel at special effects. There are some interesting visuals. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is typical of the Nineties / aught hollywood fare to dazzle without substance. True to the title. <br /> <br /> It's not worth separating the story. It's like brain surgery on a dinosaur. There is not much there to begin with. It's nothing original and it's not very special. So do not go into history at all. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, it got a bit flamboyant at the end, diluting the purity of the FX treatment of an invisible (and sometimes half-invisible) man. However, if you ignore "standard" pyrotechnics, it is a spectacle to be seen (or not to contemplate). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a decent FX movie that's worth seeing for that purpose and that's it.
