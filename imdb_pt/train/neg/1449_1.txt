First, before reading further, you must understand that I am not neo-Nazi, I am just trying to correctly understand Hitler to make sure that no one like him takes power again. <br /> <br /> I saw this series and found it horrible. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look at, but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler did not get angry all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even when he is a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact, it is highly probable that Hitler, in fact, was gay and fought throughout his life to stifle this secret. Third, people will hate me, but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he got to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. This is a common point I found in the interviews of people living close to or away from him (of course, not Jews). <br /> <br /> This series was horrible because if you think Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly, and of course, not charming, you're wrong. If you think so, it will allow people like him to take power in countries and you do not want that. If you really understand how Hitler got into power, and stop thinking he was horrible, you could find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember he was elected) and stop with the theme before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Life is important to protect, this series is horrible to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler like this, another will happen exactly as the first happened.
