... but it will make you wonder if we had any in the first place! This movie is as bad as any of today's horrible horrors. A man goes about looking at the half-naked women, trying to decide which one to kill, so he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves a man staggering and spying throughout the set for three whole minutes, covering everything that should be more than ten gallons of "blood." The film also tries to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature but the film is so poorly done that it is impossible for the public to unearth any sense of shock or indignation. Obviously obscure and sinister, this film can not even get its own title - the opening credits say "The brain that would not die," but the final credits put it as "The head that would not die."
