A soldier is on the side of the road making sure that all 1 is obeying the speed limit (doing his job); he then pulls a woman who appears to be a mother (there is a child in the back seat); he is then telling her what is wrong and BAM ... they are dead. Ok, this is the beginning of what I personally thought would have been a good movie. When I watched this movie at the movies, I was with some friends. This was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspense / thriller that looked good to everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Not only did I waste $ 7 million on movie tickets, but I had to go through torture to the brain. This movie started with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought "this can not be bad" ... I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it does not make sense; even if you get through the bad acting, the "not-so-scary" plot and the horrible mess that this movie was, you'll still be baffled. It's not because you're not smart enough to understand this, it's because no human with a brain can understand what this stupid movie is. Now you may be thinking "Oh man! I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is." GET THAT THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD NOW !!! I'm trying to spare you the trouble of watching this movie, saying it's so bad it's not worth seeing. Please people have not made the same mistake I thought this movie has potential ... it does not happen. I give this movie 1 out of 10 (if I could give it a zero I would), and I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie, you will be saving many sleepless nights trying to think of w.t.f. This damn movie is about.
