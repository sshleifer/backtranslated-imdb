The film started well enough. A colleague was struck by a bright green meteorite, receiving superpowers (telekinesis, x-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, ability to talk to dogs, super speed, heat vision, and the ability to make plants grow large and quickly), and fighting crime. From there it's all downhill. Meteor Man takes a fancy from his mother, quarrels with resident gangs, and has many aborted encounters with the gang leaders that serve to prepare you for the disappointing, long and final stunned. <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad if it were not like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to beat each other as the audience gets looking forward while the fighters just keep dancing. <br /> <br /> Despite all this absurdity, the film has good points. It clearly states that if you try to deal with a gang alone, they will come back to your house and hurt you. He claims that gangs and communities need to see their true enemies (the great bosses who use them for their own purposes to crush honest people into the existence of a ghetto). It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community to destroy the predators that harm them. The only real missing message is that voters must ensure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and George H. Bush) are not bandits either. <br /> <br />
