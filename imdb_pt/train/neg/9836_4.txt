John Scott (John Wayne) and his partner Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are trail mates heading to the rodeo Gulch Rattlesnake. Scott is a fairly fair competitor, but finds that unless he's willing to accept twenty-five cents a dollar in prize money from a corrupt prosecutor, he'll have to collect his winnings under a gun. Coincidentally, thugs Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide they would like the rest of the rodeo to happen; they shoot promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall) and make it seem like Scott and Kansas are the killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a joke in the movie where they are about to go with fists over various trivia. Each time Chandler takes a violent swing, Wayne's foot steps on him and makes him foolish. <br /> <br /> If you are very considerate, there is an announcement of Lipton's Tea in one of the scenes in which Scott's love interests Anne (Mary Kornman) appears. <br /> <br /> Later in the movie, friends are framed yet again throughout a scene robbery. Having a change of heart and seeing the error of his ways, the bad guy Jim wants to clean himself and confess to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him. When patched up, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne. In an unbelievable scene, Anne marches straight into the middle of a shootout between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff. <br /> <br /> "The Desert Trail" is one of the softer John Wayne Westerns than Lone Star. Productions during this time. Remarkably absent are George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both are generally to be seen in these oaters. If you are a John Wayne fan, you will have to see it once, but that will probably suffice.
