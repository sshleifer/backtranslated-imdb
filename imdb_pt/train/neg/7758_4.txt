this movie had a lot of blood when the sabretooth attacked too I loved it when that guy and the women were having fun and then the saber attacked the women and ate their stomach and took the liver. that was the best and the 1ton saber walking on his hilarious front paws to make this movie better action and less talking if you know what I mean and also please please people who made this movie not make a movie like that was terrible 1 sabretooth alive and dead that women at the end of this movie reminds me of the grudges ending there is always 1 enemy left! Okay, gee, this movie sucks, I can not believe it, I loved it when my little brother got scared by the stomach and blood attacks
