I loved the first two movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and for the studio). I'm still wondering why they made this movie horrible. The thing with the plastic gun and the toy car, which can get into another house, is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two films were so funny, but the terrorists are so stupid and not funny. Believe me this movie is just a waste of time.
