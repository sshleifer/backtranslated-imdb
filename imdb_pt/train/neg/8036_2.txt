Do you want to know a secret? This movie sucks. Well, actually I do not know, because if you allow yourself to be favored by plagiarized versions of original movies, then maybe you might find this movie astonishing (this movie is a plagiarized copy of I Know What You Did Last Summer). The first 30 minutes of the film are based on a typical story setting; a lot of teenagers called cool teenagers enjoying their Florida vacation and being themselves behaving much like the young ones they are. The only insight we have at this point is to what extent the director managed to illustrate a pretentious sense of teenage decadence within the characters. The second half hour of the film gains momentum and begins to illustrate the beginning of the unprecedented murders. The third half hour of the movie definitely will remain a mystery to me because I hung up before I could delude myself further thinking that the movie may still have something interesting and original to show. As far as history is concerned, it can be easily explained in a few lines. A group of teenagers goes to Florida on vacation. While they are busy partying, they slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) start being killed because they know some kind of silly secret. The only topic for the murders is that all the victims were enrolled in an ordinary school. One thing that did however surprise me about this movie, was how much betty (I'm not sure about her name .. the blonde character) seems to reese witherspoon. Another thing that surprised me about the movie was that it made me jump out of my seat a few times. Does that make it a work of art? absolutely not because my 12 year old niece made me knock a glass of orange juice because she "booed" me when I was about to walk through the door of the guest room .. that's the difference between the director and my 12 year old niece ???? <br /> <br /> Do you want to know a secret ??? I'm not sure about you, but I do not ..
