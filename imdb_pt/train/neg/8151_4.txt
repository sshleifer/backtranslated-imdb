Leslie Sands' "Deadlock" game becomes a low-choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, following the joint success of "All About Eve." After killing her spouse, an intriguing woman is visited by her husband's best friend, who poses as her husband when others start to stop at the house. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors from his peak years, unfortunately fails to elevate this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously indifferent and restrained to the outrageous end (where she gratefully takes all the stops). Production and support strictly cast second category; only to the experts at Bette Davis. * 1/2 of ****
