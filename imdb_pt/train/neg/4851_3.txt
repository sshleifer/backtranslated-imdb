Watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count their time before they can go home. <br /> <br /> That sounds boring in itself. Every time this little caption came out telling us how much time they had left, it made the movie no plot to drag and follow. Hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I must be missing out on something. I am a big fan of war movies if they are well made. This had jarhead syndrome. A film that was sometimes beautifully filmed, but cinematography does not stop it from being totally monotonous and meaningless. <br /> <br /> And overcome the slowness of the "cartridges that come out of the gun" already filmed. they could have saved money and just finished getting footage of any other movie with a gun. <br /> <br /> I had no empathy for the main guy, I was constantly hoping that his recklessness would cause him to die. In fact, the movie would have worked out much better if it had. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews and got the impression that those in the military did not like it, and everyone loved it. I've never been in the strength and I'm with them. It's pretentious nonsense. the 3 stars are for cinematography.
