A memorable line from a short show. After seeing the episode in which this line was introduced, my fraternity intramural flag football team began using the line to break our heaps in the attack. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarterback said FOOTBALL and the rest of the team answered YOU BET! A fun way to break the heap that made our opponents scratch their heads, as very few had attended the show. Using this line has added a unique element to our season that I will never forget. We had our best season during my time in college that year and, in a way, it was due to the fun we had with that line. The show was practically a stinker but lives on in the memories of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi intramural pavilion soccer squad in West Virginia Tech.
