They really can not get more stupid than this movie dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the spirit of college during the annual spring break festivities in many of our high schools. The problem is that these losers try to do that 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to take care of the daughter of a female senator being prepared to be the next vice president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that her daughter is anything but popular, but of course she comes out of it all. The girls go through drunken rages, exotic dances and other absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It really can not get much worse than this horrible movie.
