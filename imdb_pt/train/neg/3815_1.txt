The acting is awful, ALL the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly too young, assuming they have below average IQs. I realize this was done for children, but Malcom is also in the middle, but still they play humor and adult situations. <br /> <br /> What should we expect from a show led by Bob Saget, the only comedian in existence that is less funny than a ball that hits a man's groin, which is probably why he stopped host America's Funniest Home Videos. <br /> <br /> Parents, do not let your children attend this show unless you want to save money on college. Expose your children to stupidity and they will grow dumber.
