Although this film was made before Dogme emerged as the prevailing method of cinema, and before digital triumphed over - that strike. You understood. This 1991 masterpiece clearly foreshadowed these developments. Corin Nemec is simply remarkable, as the ne'er is both author and narrator. The pace is slow, but with elegance, because cinematography is so beautiful. Register it the next time you're on TV, because I guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia movie made for TV. Direct-to-video has never been so good!
