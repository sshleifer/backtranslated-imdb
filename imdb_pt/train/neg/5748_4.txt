I have to say I hated this movie. I do not like to say that because Gerard Butler is in it. About half an hour of boring talk, sorry to everyone who really cares about the plot, I started to fast forward to Gerry's scenes. I really do not know the ending, I was so bored with it. If Gerry was not in this, I probably did one of two things: I fell asleep or hung up, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie, as it is with most of his previous films. If you're a fan of Gerry, do not worry, it's as lovely and precious as it always is, but if you really want to watch the movie for the plot, good luck, because you'll need it, coffee or soda to keep you awake ! 4/10 ... and that's only because the casting director had the good sense to put Gerry in this movie even though they had no idea how to spell his name!
