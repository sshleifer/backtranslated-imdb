Considering how much money has been budgeted for this movie, you would expect more from the story as a whole. This could be the most useless movie I've ever seen. There was no real advance of anything. Character development, minimum. Batch advance, maybe. Pleasure, none. I'm not sure what points were trying to be made. If you want to see a movie where the terrorists are kind of good, the American CIA bombards everything that does not agree with our opinions, all the capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything like a storyboard advance accompanied by a death . For those of us who realize that we do not need to kill a good guy to make a point, let's stick to other movies. In short, this was a horrible attempt at a 'hide and seek-in-the-ocean' movie from 'Ocean's 11' because not only did you not know what was going on, but no one made the movie . Home Alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.
