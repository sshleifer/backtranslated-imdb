"Native Cemetery": If these three words appear anywhere on a real estate listing, look for a different neighborhood. A young couple with a small daughter and a child the age of a baby move to a house in Maine, adjacent to a pet graveyard - and, after a walk of l-o-o-o-ng, an old Indian graveyard. It seems that Indian soil can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead - if you do not mind having a beast from hell for a pet. He can do the same with dead people - if you do not mind having a homicidal zombie around the house. <br /> <br /> Play on a busy two-lane asphalt, accelerating large platforms, a well-meaning (if somewhat obscure) old neighbor, and a kid who really does not have enough supervision, and I think you you can find out what's going on from there - an exaggerated, illogical mess, which, in all fairness, offers. There are some worse adaptations of Stephen King (such as "Maximum Overdrive," which King also directed). But there are other very best ones too (like "Salem's Lot", "The Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
