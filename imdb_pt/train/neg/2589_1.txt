For those with little time on hand, I will summarize quickly, in one word ... pathetic. There are many good examples of why this film fits this description perfectly. So much so that you barely get through 2 minutes of time on the screen without seeing something completely stupid and no sense forced upon you. Want a totally naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You understood! The reason it appears is so meaningless, it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of youthful junk. You can almost glimpse the deluded minds of the 12-year-old boys who wrote this piece of garbage just by looking at that crap they expect the public to actually pay for !! <br /> <br /> I've watched a lot of movie franchises dwindling over the years, but American Pie; Beta House has to be one of the worst criminals when you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie, it's still a thousand times funnier than this dreck. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, and sometimes you really feel like you're watching a school game. The things that happen in this movie are so unreal that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it (we're talking about Star Wars suspension levels, as the kind you need to convince yourself that Jar Jar is real). <br /> <br /> The plot is paper thin and mostly the events that happen are there just to show off another pair of breasts or create another pathetic joke. There is no talent for talking, all you have is a bunch of cute boys trying to make us laugh. And ohhh how they fail !!!! Every joke falls and the only thing I laughed at was how socially unconscious the writers seem to be. How else can you explain the bulls they try to pass as a story? <br /> <br /> They let go of every opportunity to do something worthwhile and amuse themselves in favor of poorly written, low common denominator nonsense. The characters have to complete a set number of tasks before being accepted as members of Beta House, but this is mainly handled by a series of very short assemblages implying that they are completing the tasks, but we see little or no evidence of this. really happening. It's a very lazy way to tell a story. He also misses opportunities to be funny in doing so (imagine the Wizard of Oz where all the important events happened off-screen, and all we see is Dorothy greeting the Scarecrow from time to time and saying " great adventure we just had at that time ") Lazy. Lazy. LAZY !!!! <br /> <br /> The female characters have little or nothing to say. All they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual props for most of the film. Your problems that only seek T & A will not be disappointed, but, for that reason, just shame. If you buy this on DVD, you will be contributing to the downfall of society in a special way. Congratulations.
