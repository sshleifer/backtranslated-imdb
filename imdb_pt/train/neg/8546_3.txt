Spanish production highly implausible, unbelievable and incoherent about ... well, let me see how close I can get from it. The film begins with a woman having one of her cats killed by a young woman. She then begs her lover to take her somewhere on her vacation. He calls the job and demands that he waste his vacation time and she says he will pay for it. What relevance does this represent for anyone is the end of the film because the guy, a brown photographer, looks like a beautiful Patty Shepard, queen of the Spanish horror movies, taking off his bikini for a moment so he can take a picture, ask her out to lunch, and then to his designation for Witches Mountain - for once again, we are never aware. Before they leave, Patty must stop at the house and hear a mysterious "loud" echo in our hero's ears. Again, this is never explained. The film continues with these two stopping at a guesthouse, going to the mountain and finally noticing why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, there are several aspects in this movie that make it better than a bad movie. It has some atmosphere, some of the character actors are really very good (especially the deaf and old innkeepers), the clues are at least adequate, and the climax - though it makes no sense at all - is well choreographed (literally) witches in white bras and long black hair. It just does not make sense, and that's a great detractor to me. I was able to watch the movie ten more times and still do not know it now more than after the first screening. This is a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film from the long list of cheap and atmospheric European horror films that covered that decade. If you can get more out of it than I do, better power for you.
