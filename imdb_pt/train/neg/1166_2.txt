Having seen Versus previously, I had high hopes for Alive. The description of the film on the back of the DVD jacket looked promising. Vivo did not deliver. Very slow development. Potential loads with the cast and the cool look. The premise was intriguing, but the reward did not make up for the increase. Could have done much more in the end. Most of the film is just "sitting". To put it bluntly, three of us were excited to sit and watch this movie and, at 50 minutes, we were struggling to get to the end. It really needed more shock elements. If you are looking for Ichi the killer or Versus type fights then save yourself a little $ and a lot of disappointment.
