After finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what was supposed to happen. I had high expectations regarding the film, because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars is that it was okay to be a movie. I have some main points for not liking this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. The cast. Jack Nicholson barely fits the character of Jack Torrence. Besides, I would never have chosen Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I thought Wendy was very different. I can see why they chose Jack Nicholson, the smile, the pointed eyebrows, but it should not really look "evil." He should look normal, and he becomes evil. In addition, they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was fine, he needed more life. He acted the way of droney. <br /> <br /> 2. The script They cut so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to the movie were deleted, altered or mistreated. Some of the things that were in the book that I was eager to see (the hedge animals, the mallet rock, the elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and a half hours !! I was extremely irritated. <br /> <br /> 3. The end. The end was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack froze to death, Wendy never hurt himself ... Overlook did not explode. The Ending was so cool in the book, and the movie spoiled everything so horribly I got caught. Hallorann should never die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least Jack would use a rock hammer. You've never seen a mallet of rock throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There are other things I did not like about the movie, but there are things that were fine. The angels on the camera were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (not the book) was cool, but maybe I was too annoyed that the movie did not go with the book to try to scare me. I recommend reading the book before watching this movie. I applaud Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract not to let Stanley Kubrik anymore. I would never have done it, I would have taken all the rights I could shout at him all day. I can not wait to see the 6 hour version at least have the hedge animals. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
