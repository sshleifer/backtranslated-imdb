However, another venture into the realm of teenage-brutal comedy, set on a college campus with the pursuit of a nerd for coolness, and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular athletes so he gets the girl. Everything has been done before, and everything has been done in a much more satisfactory way. The rough humor that made movies like "American Pie" and "Dude! Where's My Car" is so popular that it seems completely out of context in this issue, appearing so randomly that the viewer can only disapprove and disapprove. The film is poorly written, and the actors can never make anything like this bearable at all. I will not even dignify this terrible image by divulging it, since it is a waste of my time and yours. At best, Slackers can never entertain or tease laughter, and at worst is terribly bad and sometimes completely unacceptable. Jason Schwarzman, who impressed in his Rushmore debut, humbles himself by appearing in this photo and wonders how a career could end up in the bathroom so fast. Please avoid, please avoid. Save your money.
