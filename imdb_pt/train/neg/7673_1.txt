I do not know where to start. Tara Reid needs to be stopped before making another movie. Stephen Dorff seems to have achieved the motivation of his Val Kilmer character in "Top Gun". Slater sleepwalks through this dreck. Direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gunfight?), Fantasies (bullet proof vests with muscles) and, hey, there is no perceptible plot. It amazes me that no one connected with the project stopped and said, "Hey, that does not make sense, let's start over." I hope that Slater's career can recover from this disaster. <br /> <br /> Lower the worst movie I've ever seen.
