Extremely complicated and monotonous. I'm a bright guy, but that was too much for a weary brain. I would really benefit from some initial clues about who these people are and what they are doing. Probably better for the US market. GC himself suggested that this by itself did not provide his Oscar and you can see why. <br /> <br /> Still, the sand dunes are beautiful. The pulling of nails is unpleasant. Drunk father attorneys is a mystery. Cricket is good to see. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to write the ten lines needed, despite having more than 2 hours in length. Thank God they shortened it. Admittedly, we did not get much of the footage, but the last movie we saw, Walk the Line, was ten times better and I do not really like Johnny Cash. My wife says that George still looks good with a beard and a few extra pounds, so that's it ... am I almost there yet? <br /> <br /> How about now?
