I was attracted to this movie when I looked at the cast list, but after watching it, I must admit I felt a bit disappointed. The main problem with this film is that the actors are not able to hold this film in the back. Because? Because of the bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones go to great lengths to take this film to another level, there are no groundbreaking stories and the direction is very common. So for fans of Matt Dillon, this is a watchable film, as well as for the admirers of the beautiful Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but this is not film for him; far below its level. So if you get involved with this great cast, watch out, but do not expect anything grand or extraordinary. The only thing you will remember about this movie is scenes from Diane Lane; the rest is very forgettable.
