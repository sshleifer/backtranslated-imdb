Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst photos I've ever paid to see - the kind of movie you choose in desperation at the movies during a Christmas holiday, when you missed the departure times for anything good, but it's still dead set in watching a movie! And that's exactly how I came to see this stinking bomb ... <br /> <br /> At a distance of almost three decades, I still smell the rotten fish that makes up this plot. An unbelievable plot - that a murderous whale bears a grudge against an individual who is not of the sea - is laughable. And it's about everything except for a completely out of place "love theme" that plays at the end of a movie without a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is adorable (on a two-dimensional paper), but Richard Harris just chews the scene. He was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is not "Jaws". Mercifully, I have put most of this in mind and when I go through it on television, I move immediately. "Danger, Robinson!" See the current commercial TV showing a husband and wife watching the whale ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least it finished in sixty seconds. This movie represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never go back.
