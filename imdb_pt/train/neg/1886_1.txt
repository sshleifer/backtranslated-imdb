I once promised to never leave any movie (a personal policy that made me suffer from the most different types of wreckage, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly terrible experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that the Austrians are a miserable and pathetic bunch of retarded. It shows a world where love and humanity do not exist, a world where people humble themselves only for a reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. In choosing a documentary style with non-professional actors (most of them seem directly from Deix's imagination), director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in the Austrian (Western European) suburbs. . The spectator is confronted with depictions of sexual orgies, violence against women and people with disabilities, insanity and degradation. But this is not social criticism. This is just a shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you have bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filming. If someone needs a movie like this to realize that there are wrong things in our society, that person must have gone through life with their eyes closed. This is a pseudo-social criticism with a sledgehammer. And look at people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that's not the reason why I hate it. But it portrays ordinary people in an ugly and misanthropic way. And that's why this movie is truly despicable.
