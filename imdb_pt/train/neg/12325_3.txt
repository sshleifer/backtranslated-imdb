I remember this show. I still remember that fun song, "America's Funniest People". Frankly, it should have been titled American's Lame or Unfunny or Downright Disgusting People. Dave could not save this show and neither Bob Saget nor the AFV's substitutes came later. The Jackalope segments were hilarious and, yes, Dave could make better voices than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of the bad videos that people sent. It was also developed as a variety show with invited stars, including the Olson Twins. In addition, the AFV was at its peak before beginning to pick Ugly Baba as babies without as the winner. Did I mention that the videos were disgusting and lame? But still rock theme music!
