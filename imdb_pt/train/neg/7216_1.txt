I love the west. I could take care of them all day. "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is my all time favorite. I watched "Silverado" probably for the 8th time the other day because it was being presented at the CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is arguably the worst western I've ever watched. The acting was terrible around. They do not explain anything at the end of the mysterious compass. The only good part I can think of is the beautiful canteen girl. The very long pauses between the dialogue seemed intentional only to compensate the time of accomplishment of the film of acceptable duration. This movie was not even worth the new rental fee I paid at our local movie store. I felt like I had been robbed and deserving of a rent refund if there was such a thing. The only reason I finished was because I hate not seeing a movie until the end. I hung up half because it was so bad. For the director, please do a better job if you decide to do another one. This is the kind of movie that has the potential to take people to the Westerner.
