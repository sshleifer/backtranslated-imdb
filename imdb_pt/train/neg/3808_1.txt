NOTICE! This review will reveal the end of the movie, "Scoop". If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad you'll think "Annie Hall" was a fluke. <br /> <br /> He gets a star because you can see Hugh Jackman's naked chest. That's the only thing that Scoop has in your favor. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's misogyny and his attachment to young women long enough to be his granddaughter rendered him incapable of making any films he could make. The plot looks promising: a ghost, Ian McShane, runs a skinny student, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether an English lord, Hugh Jackman, is the famous Tarot. Card killer of prostitutes. A magician, Woody Allen, help the girl. <br /> <br /> Despite the promising plot, the film lacks charm, humor or atmosphere. It's an incredibly chic and amateurish endeavor for someone who has even made an earlier film, no matter dozens. Maybe Allen suffered a stroke that was not reported in the press. Much is spoken of the fact that, unlike his previous films, Woody Allen, now a septuagenarian, FINALLY allowed a young male to lead take the girl. <br /> <br /> It's not like that. In fact, the plot is built in such a way that the girl can not get anyone. <br /> <br /> There is an early scene in which Johansson, with no central reason for the film, gets drunk, and seduced by a powerful and older director. "Seduced" is a euphemism for what happens. It's a "slam, bam, I have to go" moment. It has no relation to the plot, and this weakens Johansson in the viewer's eyes. Why did Allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - having sex with the female leader. Allen also has his cake and eats it. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actress. She does not know how to command the screen, except using a short and fair top. She imitates Allen in some scenes, and this seems strange and sad. <br /> <br /> It does not help that your character is scripted like a doll that can not function without a ghost or an old man. and less than an inspiring magician, telling him what to do at each turn. <br /> <br /> She is about half Jackman's age, and she appears as a very vague presence in her scenes together. <br /> <br /> Audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve more on their heroines, and Jackman also deserves a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency, and an actress who can convey those qualities. <br /> <Hugh Jackman is equally fooled by the script. Apparently Allen does not support that Jackman is so handsome and young, and so gives Jackman nothing to say or do. Like Johansson, it is used only for its good looks. That's a pity, because as Jackman has shown in various productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men", he can act. <br /> <br /> Here's the big twist in the story - Jackman, gentle, charming English Lord, is really a killer. So even though the movie says it's all about letting someone else, aside from Allen, get the girl, she does not get anyone. Jackman, the man she's making love to, is a man who murdered a prostitute. Good, woody. Nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your reach. In an aggressive passive touch, Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence, killing his character, the magician, leaving Scarlett Johansson alone at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> One final note: in my performance, no member of the audience laughed at any point during the film. Always a bad sign when a movie is advertised as a comedy.
