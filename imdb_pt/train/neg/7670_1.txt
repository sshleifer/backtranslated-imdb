Well, where do I start my story? I went to this movie tonight with some friends who knew no more than the actors who were in it, and that was meant to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I discovered in the first 20 minutes, what a bad decision I had made out watching this movie. The plot was crap, and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically. <br /> <br /> The cast could not have been more plastic. Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much more quickly ... as if they dragged on for no particular reason. Very poor editing. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
