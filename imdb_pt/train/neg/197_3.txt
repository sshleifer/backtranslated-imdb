Despite being a great western of James Arness, this movie was like the worst Alamo movie ever made. The story was terrible, imprecise all the time and just lies reversed! The continuity was thrown to the four winds. Anyone pick up the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were idiots enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and rods still coming out of the tubes. Let's go! Then there's the ridiculous Brian Keith hat! The client must be absent or something. Or just out of your mind!
