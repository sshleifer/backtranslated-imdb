Horrible movie. About an old grumpy painter hanging around with a girl. Boring. Tatum Neil goes through the motions on his part and has some of the most common lines in movie history. Richard Burton seems close to death in this movie, and we must believe he looks "good for sixty". The acting is bad, just like the plot. The characters are horrible, just like the story. It's really hard to feel for someone in this movie, except Larry Ewashen, who plays a guy in a porn movie that hits Tatum, he's kind of funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you're a fan of Tatum, like me - and that's why I rented this in the first place - please do not watch this movie. She's very bad at it, and you wonder if maybe the MOON role was a fluke. It was not because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS, it is known that she can act well, but still, do not rent this movie. And if you're a Burton fan, rent something when it's beautiful, not a fossil.
