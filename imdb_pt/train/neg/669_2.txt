I'm the guy who usually holds opinions to himself, but I just came back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I'm a big horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure would like to see even a little bit of good script and character development. I know I often miss out on horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it did not even make any effort in that department. Then we all love suspense. That limit your suspense seat with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night has it? No, there's a handsome boy with a cute knife. And when all else fails ... at least terror has its guilty pleasure of making it enjoyable, like an occasional nudity scene! Well, when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 as Prom Night, they also leave that aside. So with all these missing elements, I ask .... does this still count as a horror movie? No. I would call it more comedy. The people in my theater were laughing more about it than when I saw "Semi-Pro", which was actually a comedy (which sucked too, but that's another story!). I think I'm going to have to give up the new horror. All the good horror films of the good old days have been turned into trash so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see with this did not even know this was a remake! What drove me crazy! I wonder what will happen when there are no more movies to remake ??? Where will the horror follow?
