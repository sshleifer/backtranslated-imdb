I've seen some bad movies (Austin Powers), but this movie is so horrible, so annoying that I stayed in the middle of the road and could not stand to see the rest. A feather. With talents like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall, and a story by John Grisham, what went wrong? Branagh is a great lawyer who has a one-night stand with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hanged her cat, etc, etc., so Branagh sent him to an insane asylum, and he promptly escapes. Somehow (I could not figure out how) Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen, and Tom Berenger are all mixed in history that moves slower than stationary. I wanted to like this, and being a big fan of Grisham, I read everything about this movie and I (foolishly) expected something interesting. This is honestly the worst movie I've seen so far and would like to have my money returned. * outside of *****.
