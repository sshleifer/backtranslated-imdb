Add to the list of caricatures: a southern preacher and "congregation", a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dancing choir, and The Mills Brothers - only makes it worse. <br /> <br /> Despicable burlesques of "black" artists, who often appear in movies to parody themselves and their race. Although "black comedy" may have been accepted in your day, it is extremely offensive these days, and I doubt it was funny. Although I had not offended myself, I did not think I would have laughed at the faintest attempts at humor. As an 11-year-old white boy, however, I could not have understood a little of it.
