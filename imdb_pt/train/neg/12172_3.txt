After the failure of the first Sleepaway Camp, they thought that a franchise could be born. SC II is superior in appearance. More inspired and much more fun killers. While this may not be saying much (compared to the first movie), the Sleepaway Camp II is worth the location. <br /> <br /> Pros: Fun, do not take yourself too seriously as SC I. Inspired Killings. Cons: Grumpy staff and mullets are plentiful. <br /> <br /> Result: 5/10 <br /> <br />
