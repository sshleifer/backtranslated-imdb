Well then, thank you to Disney for DESTROYING the good memories I used to take of my favorite movie from PREVIOUS. I was about 5 when the original movie was released, and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing. So now that I'm 16 and feel pretty masochistic, I decided to rent this movie. So I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with that excuse for a movie. This film takes everything that made the original captivate and destroys, down to the last detail. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go show her to everyone in the ocean ... BROADWAY ROAD! After the musical number ends in a few minutes, the witch of the Morgaine Sea appears and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. So he gives up without even a fight. Eric stands there gaping, although Ariel finds out how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never approach the sea until Morgan is caught. <br /> <br /> Well ... nothing of note really happens. Eric is a total coward. He can never do anything. Ariel kind of does something. Melody manages to ruin everything. In addition, the animation is a new low for Disney. The computer graphics crash into the background. Always a single opportunity for character development is wasted. The songs bite. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste your time. I'm sure even little children will get bored with it, since nothing even remotely exciting happens. They will not want to sing the songs. If you can get a copy of it, throw it in the ocean and hope no one finds it. Ever.
