The movie is worth watching only if you stop after half an hour. It starts with funny conversations in a bar and makes a person wait for a good, funny story to come. Well, I can say it will not come. It will deteriorate in minutes in a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame to the actors to an extent that you probably will not be pleased to witness. <br /> <br /> In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that, according to him, is the majority of people in this globalized world experience. I was amazed to hear that. Am I living in the same world in which he lives? Okay, a lot of people walk in the same clothes as mine and they listen to the same song and everything, but that does not make me feel like I'm losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky think, that we are nothing more than the clothes we wear and the films we watch? Am I myopic or is it? <br /> <br /> Well, my vote: the good start of the movie prevents you from winning a 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
