We do not have it on TV in England, but I've been online on YouTube. It's dumb, immature and annoying! This is from the creator of "Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I never got into this drawing, but I must admit it's better than that. The cartoonist has not done anything for years. For Doug TenNapel, this is a farce and a low of all time! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and a lot of money from their dead old lady. They are argumentative and continue to disagree about what they want to spend their money on. "BORING"! The animation is terrible. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they do not look like cats at all! Just strange monstrous creatures with big mouths, sharp teeth and bulging eyes! The human and other animal characters are also attracted ugly! The theme song is terrible and annoying! In addition, the stories are thighs and probably copied from older programs. I was amazed how this show received 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. Television really is not what it used to be! But now most of them are dumb, cheap and boring. Some of you on the site may not agree with me well, I'm sorry, but that's a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and I'm glad that Britain has not tolerated this crap much (oh yeah, if you have digital you have to) but I do not, so it's not my problem! Failed! 2/10 (and it's very lucky to get that because I gave the other shows the worst!).
