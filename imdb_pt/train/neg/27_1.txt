Terrible movie. Nuff said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just filling. The movie was bad. Why I have to expand this I do not know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn the others. Avoid this movie. Acting is a drug and writing is just dumb. Bad in every way. The only cool thing about the movie is the breasts of Deniz Akkaya. Even this was ruined by a terrible and unnecessary rape scene. The film is a piece of trash badly planned and totally unbelievable. <br /> <br /> OK, now I'm just going to cheat on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text at a minimum. First I waste my time watching these offal. So, feeling compelled to warn others, I created a IMDb account just to find out that I have to write an essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is. Totally unnecessary.
