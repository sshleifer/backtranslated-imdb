This is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have a big appetite for horrible (and good) movies. He could have (just) gotten a kind of teenage humor if it had been consistently ironic - la ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really funny. Other films, such as PLAN NOVE EXTERIOR, can be funny while (apparently) try to be serious. As for the acting, it seems that they harassed teenagers with brain death and asked them to improvise the whole production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation - that of the earliest ghoul attack on the motorcycle.
