If you saw the 1975 Sholay, do not watch this movie. If you have not yet seen the 1975 Sholay, go see it. But do not watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that could have gone wrong while doing a remake of Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psychopath villain to the best (Probably the only 40 minutes of the reel that should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play with your character, it would still be worth watching. But as Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely mundane and the only reason I think, they cast Prashant Raj in the role of Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh of his young days. Sushmita Sen behaves well, with grace and makeup. But the award for the "worst performance and any role to date" should go to Nisha Kothari. She manages to degrade her performance to levels that even the school drama would overshadow her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a mortal enemy, take him to this movie. :)
