A number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar, and then their bodies are stolen on the way to the morgue. Journalist Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious murders. She discovers that just prior to each ceremony, the bride received a rare orchid (supposedly from the groom) that contained a powerful drug that succumbed to them. Patricia is informed that the orchid was first cultivated by a Dr. Lorenz, who lives on an isolated property with his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, putting the brides in a suspended state and using the fluid in the gland to keep his wife forever young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who is working with Dr. Lorenz in the medical mystery surrounding his wife), try to force Dr. Lorenz's hand to establish a fake marriage, which ends up leading Patricia to the clutches of the mad doctor. This movie made a good start, but basically ended up creating many plans and other weak scenes. The cast is decent, Walters and Coffin deserve better, but it's life. Russell steals the show (even out of Lugosi, which does not give one of his most memorable performances, even considering his monograms) as Countess Lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical features of many of today's Hollywood prima donnas . Weak and artificial end too. Classification, based on films B, 4.
