It's an indulgent waistline for great actors in such a weak and boring film. Aside from all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments, what is so difficult about catching thieves? Just eliminate employees from the bank, see who was in the bank - from every camera angle - before the thieves come in and you have the 4 thieves left in the hostages. Where is the suspense that every body is talking about? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they would all walk out the front door ... seen many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the film with good music and artistic footage. The movie is not worth it. Ready!
