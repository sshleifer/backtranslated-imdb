After reading the other reviews on this movie, I would like to share my opinion that this is a hard movie to watch, unless you are a total Brooksophile. I'm not. When viewed by a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more un-distilled neuroses than capable of being absorbed at once. It is very difficult to watch. The character of Brooks (Robert Cole) is so unfriendly and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to him - let alone cheer for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional situation to the next. And he should NEVER make a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man could have so much exposed foliage and should turn into a cat like Kathryn Harrold - unless, of course, he is Albert Brooks in a production controlled by Albert Brooks. <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" has its fun moments ----- but they are fragmentary and infrequent. More often than not, I felt like I was on a journey confined to a completely unpleasant person and wishing it were over already. This confirms the problems that can arise when too much control of a movie is put into just one person - someone who does not have self-discipline to be able to step back and see what is happening clearly. <br /> <As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is in fact what he portrayed. Six years later, he founded Albert Brooks on the successful "Broadcast News". James showed us how Albert can shape a believable and entertaining comic performance. Albert allowed us to see James (usually not as an actor) do a rare turnaround in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" will now move on to the next complimentary comment. about this. For you I say - there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a movie meant to be an entertainment.
