The saying "Never judge a book by the cover" was coined as a warning for those who do not look below the surface. <br /> <br /> As I saw the work, "King of the Ants" I instantly thought HORROR! The arcana image proudly displayed on the cover and on the back spoke of a somber vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal, and retribution. Instead, what I discovered beneath that surface was less interesting than what you might find under your average rock. "King of the Ants" features Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, a common guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Except Sean Crawley is someone you do not care about, I've never felt any compassion or sympathy for this character. In fact, he is frankly unpleasant, but not so much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who turns an uninspired performance as a feat of all the worst by the totally laughable dialogue he is forced to recite. Play Kari Wuhrer as a bereaved widow who apparently has unconditional confidence (especially the homeless), and little or no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, which is basically a sobering standard of praise, but it does mean! <br /> <br /> Now there are some interesting sequences of "hallucination" in this film (the source of the cover images), but this film never delves into this world. He prefers to bombard him with unmotivated characters, bad dialogues and unlikely events after unlikely events. Oh the horror!
