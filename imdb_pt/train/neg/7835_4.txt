Dude, I really wanted to like these shows. I'm starving for good TV and I applaud TNT for providing these "opportunities." But unfortunately, I am in the minority, I think when it comes to the cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as King's writing, the irony is that it simply does not translate well on the screen, big or small. With few (very few) exceptions, the King's experience can not be filmed with the same impact that stories have when read. Many people would disagree with this, but I'm sure that in their hearts they have to admit that King's best recorded history is just a pale reminder of what they read. The reason is simple. King's story takes place in the mental setting of the characters in the story. It gives us glimpses of your inner thoughts, your emotions and your sometimes fractured or unrealistic points of view. In short, King takes the reader to places where you can not put a Panavision camera. As an audience watching the filmed king, we get less than half the information the reader has access to. It's not too hard to claim that One becomes a character in a King story they read while One is limited to the small voyeurism of that same character when filmed. While King writes, Hollywood will try to film everything that comes out of its word processor, regardless of whether or not it should. I do not blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works. The task is similar to turning lead into gold or some arcane domain of Zen. Well, luckier next time.
