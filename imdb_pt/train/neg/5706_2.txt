This movie is like the thousand "cat and mouse" movies that preceded it. (The following may sound like a spoiler, but actually only describes a large class of movies.) There is the main character, wise and passionate, his goofy but well-meaning partner with his ill-made attempts at humorous comments, the hostile initially hostile. but soon softened the beautiful lady who unleashed the inevitable "unlikely" love story, loved ones taken hostage and of course the wicked and careless adversary with his brutal minions. Everyone has seen tons of these movies, and "National Treasure" is just like any of them, with only a slightly modified packaging. Each turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you that I am not the sharpest tool in the shed). I'm too tired to feel cheated for money after leaving the movie theater of a Hollywood movie, and if you've felt that way too, pay attention to my alert; stay miles away from this movie.
