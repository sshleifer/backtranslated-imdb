I make a point of watching bad movies frequently, and the original science fiction channel movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands of Olvivion. The acting was not characteristically insignificant, unlike the disgracefully disgraceful display that science fiction normally holds. There are some appearances made by people you would probably recognize, although you may not know their color names. The special effects of CGI are minimal and as such one of the greatest sources of comedy in a science fiction feature is lacking. Of course, there are some funny moments like when a guy is beheaded by a tractor, or when the main character leaves his friend to die to save a girl he knows a few days ago, but in general, ends up not having you roll on the floor of either laugh, and I consider it a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I were evaluating on a 10-star scale made specifically for judging TV movies, I would probably give it a 4, maybe even 5. It's a shame that I have to wait until the next original movie science fiction to give a good laugh, and I really hope this movie is not part of some general quality increase in the original sci-fi movies.
