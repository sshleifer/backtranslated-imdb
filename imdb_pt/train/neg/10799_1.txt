This movie is so, so horrible that it makes the angels lose their wings. Shaq had attempted other crossover efforts, such as his Shaq-Fu work for the NES and his plethora of unbeatable rap albums, and later the epic horror film production service that is Steel. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good to say about this movie. I've seen it many times when I was very young, but I must have been an idiot, because this movie takes all that is fun about movies and destroys it. It's fun to mock. I saw it on the Disney Channel a while ago and spent a few minutes doing it. Although, once the thrill of mockery is made, you are still overwhelmed by its terribility. <br /> <br /> If you watch on TV, try this: consider while watching the movie, remove altogether scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genius powers. If you do, it becomes like a movie about a pedophile chasing a kid and doing rap to seduce him. This is kind of funny and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A horrible example of a movie. No, unless you want to make fun of him, watch this movie.
