Only a few of the segments are involved here. A segment with a garage attendant from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins makes their point, twisting by twisting until the final shot exaggerates things. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke Paris. The others are so scattered in theme, tone, volition and production that you may also be watching "The Years Best Commercials, 2006." It's really the whole place. It does not develop over time of execution, and nothing reigns the directors in. No building successfully joins the pieces ... boredom sets in. I'm at the point of an hour, twenty minutes and Elijah Wood is in some idiot - overproduced vampire cartoon. It has as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in Antarctica. Fantasy appears I think first in the segment of the Coen Brothers (Uh, thank J & E for ruining another film) and then makes many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you do not need crap to lie to make your days extraordinary. Why divide by neighborhood if the Quartier de la Madeleine is equated to vampires by some losing director? Has there ever been a genre more represented than the vampire movie? Every three years we have the same vampire cliches. <br /> <br /> Making things worse is that moving from segment to segment is pretty simple. Transitions are lost. This does not seem intentional, it seems sloppy.
