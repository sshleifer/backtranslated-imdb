I hated this movie so much that I remember it vividly. It's not even funny. Any movie that relies on bland sexual jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to do so. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drinks a box of rancid milk. All I could think of was "he deserves it, for making such a bad movie." Do not waste your time or money on this.
