It was a decent movie, I really enjoyed it. But the end is so abrupt !! There is absolutely no closure and leaves tons of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What about her boyfriend? Does she call Grant? Is she coming next semester? What about Angela? Obviously, Holly's performance would take Angela off a few pins, but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts. There is a lot left in the air and it is very unsatisfactory. I do not know if you're trying to make room for a sequel or something, but it's a terrible ending and I think that really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
