I watched Grendel the other night and am compelled to set up a public service announcement. Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem. The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of harmless and uninteresting movies, and the previous ones promised a low-budget inauthentic mini-epic, but the latter refused to allow me to change channels. It was disconcerting, overwhelmingly, bad. I watched with fascination and horror at the train crash that you could not take your eyes off. I grabbed a notebook and managed to capture some of what I was seeing. The following may contain spoilers or just save your sanity. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> - Just to stop this, Beowulf's warriors wore horned helmets. Trivial question compared to what came next. It also appears that the helmets were in a dumpster and delivered to any actor wandering alongside. Appearance, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Marina Sirtis was obviously blackmailed to make the film with the Ringling brothers, the circus Barnum and Bailey. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup. Ben Cross pretended not to be ashamed as the king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become the King of the Danes just minutes before the movie was opened and not having had the chance to get the crown resized to suit him yet. <br /> <br /> - To make it easy for the actors to return to their daytime jobs waiting tables, no one needed to change their hairstyles. The variety of hair included cornrows, chops, buzz cuts, and a mullet, and at least served to distract the dialogue. To prove that he was a multinational cast, everyone was encouraged to keep whatever accent they chose. <br /> <br /> - As is typical in this type of film (at least since Mad Max), leather armor was a requirement. . In this case, it was strange, ill-adjusted and brand-new. <br /> <br /> - Female love interest, Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, followed a long tradition of cats that should be observed. with the volume completely lowered. <br /> <br /> The unintended focus of the film was a compound and repetitive beast with exploding bolts. He never needed to be charged and had a setback when he was fired. He was able to tear apart the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, the historical fact, and the plot suspended by itself. <br /> <br /> Hrothgar's palace, Heorot, instead of being a long Nordic hall, was apparently designed and built by artisans who sank with Atlantis. <br /> <br /> Beowulf arrived in the land of the Danes on a two-masted ramp ship that was originally part of one set, the other two being that of Santa Maria and Pinta. <br /> <br /> Prince Unferth watched the approach of Beowulf's ship using a telescope. Before you could recover from this amazing innovation, you have to see the ship from his point of view. Judging from the angle, the prince was on some kind of aircraft. <br /> <br /> - Fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (from a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you can see the breath of the actors, whether inside or outside the home. <br /> <br /> - Fact 2: The Dark Age dance in Denmark looks like a slow dance in 8th grade. <br /> - Fact 3: You can also make a catapult with an explosive air blast in time. But do not expect it to really hurt anything. By chance, Beowulf was apparently a World War II veteran, shouting "Incoming!" to destroy any remaining suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> Grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely CGI creation he could not leave footprints. Even in the snow. <br /> <br /> - Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in a bad mood because she was a single mother and the junior did not inherit his wings. Gene recessive, I suppose. By the way, we can now guess that Grendel's pop was probably Swamp Thing. <br /> <br /> Grendel and his mother chose to randomly kill, fly, or drag their prey based on only a close reading. of the next pages of the script. <br /> <br /> Medical suit: Being hit by a mythical beast strong enough to be thrown fifteen yards against the stone causes minor facial scrapes that do not bleed much. <br /> <br /> The sword of legend that Beowulf used to dispatch the Hag was as long as it was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately, the oscillation dispelled any concern about weight. <br /> <br /> Best line in the movie: Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spat a quart of blood at about a meter and a half. Princess Ingrid gently cradled him and said, "You'll be fine, my prince." So much for that job at the screening clinic. <br /> <br /> I feel better now.
