From stupid "picturesque African natives" to travel shots with our overlapping directors acting as narrators, to the horrible false ears that turn the docile Indian elephants into African elephants, for the utter lack of any logic, to the incessant Maureen O'Sullivan lamenting "Tarzan! Tarzan!", there is nothing about this movie that deserves classic status. <br /> <br /> 4/10
