Lady in Cement - PI parody with ole Blue Eyes.Frank Sinatra is a shamus at a houseboat in Miami in this rarely funny "comedy" .Burdened by an annoying and repetitive Hugo Montenegro Count and Punch outfiring this 1968 film never ever rises up a little too obscene to be done on television for movie status on television. Dan Blocker is effective in the great role of Mike Mazurski / Ted De Corsia and Raquel Welch should thank his personal trainer. The only thing that makes the DVD worthwhile is collection of cheese trailers for Welch movies like Bandolero, Fantastic Voyage, Mother, Jugs & Speed ​​and Myra Breckinridge. Even if you grab the DVD-skip the predictable movie and go to the library of trailers in the special features. In addition tons of mysoginistic apart- Sinatra faints @ homosexual owners of the local Go-Go bar. A relic that needs to be put back into the time capsule. D
