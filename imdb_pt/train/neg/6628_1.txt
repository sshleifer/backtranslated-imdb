If the scale were negative I would be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was cool, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and director ruined every pleasure in this story. The choice of angles, choice of lighting and well all distracted from trying to remember what the story is. Oh, if the songs and dances did not make you rip your ears out of your head, first. The film could have been made twice in 1.25 hours, and was very good, like "Seven Samurai", but the director and writer did not follow this direction, even if the "city dwellers" finally find their backbone and want to help. This film fails on many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, screenplay - name any aspect of this movie - it was BAD - probably the vendor's food was also bad. I have never seen anything like this in 6 years of watching Indian movies (Bollywood).
