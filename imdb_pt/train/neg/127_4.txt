I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my music studio because of all the controversy surrounding it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that it was confiscated by the US customs at first, if it tried to enter that country, , A fan of movies considered "controversial" I really had to see it for myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around a young Swedish theater student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular, she wants to focus on making some sort of documentary about what the average Swede thought about certain political issues, such as the Vietnam War and racial issues in the United States. Between asking politicians and ordinary citizens of Stockholm about her views on politics, she has sex with her theater teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What kills me I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, yet it's not filmed like a cheap pornographic movie. While my compatriots find it shocking, in reality, sex and nudity are an important element in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, no doubt his response to good old boy John Ford, made sex scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I recommend to filmmakers the fact that any sex shown in the movie is shown for artistic purposes, rather than just shocking people and making money to be screened in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to study meat and potatoes (no pun intended) from Swedish cinema. But really, this movie does not have much plot.
