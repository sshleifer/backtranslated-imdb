The horror movies of Schlocky's 70's ... you have to love them. In contrast to today's boring slasher movies, these K-tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about producing a B movie ... it was terribly wrong. Faith Domergue stars as a movie queen of B, making a movie about a series of horrific murders that hit a family in her home. Her boyfriend / director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude, is filming on location and on a tight schedule. Ken doll co-star discovers a book of Tibetan chants working on the script to add "realism." Unfortunately, "realism" is something they could have done without. <br /> <br /> John Carradine, having long since given up looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now has a humble existence as the janitor of the state. He does his daily work, but always seems to conflict with the director. <br /> <br /> Horror builds slowly; a dead cat here, John Carradine entering a tomb there, finally culminating in seven, yes seven murders. (At least there is truth in propaganda.) It's sad that the ghoul did not understand that there was a movie being made above him. How did poor Faith know that those Tibetan songs would really work? Face it, you just can not go around pulling on Satan's coat and wait for him to lie down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to do an autopsy on the House of Seven Corpses.
