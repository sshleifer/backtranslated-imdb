I like musicals, but as a Dickens fan, I hate that. ** SATIN SPOILERS ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the asylum? The poor Londoners coming out to sing? Fagin and Dodger walking into the sunset? Not exactly true to romance. As I recall, Dodger was hanged publicly and Fagin went mad in prison. ** END OF SPOILERS ** Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing little more than growling to indicate his evil. Worse, however, is Mark Lester as Oliver who often comes across so strange and passive that you wonder if he's really the main character. His portrait is by no means aided by the fact that the best they could do when singing is to voice a girl's voice. I think they did not realize that the high-pitched boys can be found in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Loving Dickens fans: stick with David Lean's incredible 1948 film or the BBC's 6-hour adaptation of mid-'80s. Avoid this bloated whitening of a musical.
