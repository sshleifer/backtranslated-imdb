After watching this movie, I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack or if the cinema sound system may be defective. At least in the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what someone is saying because of the background music and the scratching of the soundtrack. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment, but it was not - it was the director. I was told that the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the film's production. Music and sound should be distorted to create a very disturbing effect inside the movie. Nowadays, the directors will make great efforts to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see that movie, the soundtrack will be the same. <br /> <br /> So, in addition to the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere), the soundtrack distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a lack. You will only hear the distorted scratching of the soundtrack and certainly not the meow of a cat.
