This movie looked promising, but in fact it was very bad. The premise was O.K, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors tried their best with limited material, but they could not overcome the stingy spirit of this kitschy film. Jason Schwartzman was once again hugely annoying - even more so than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast had no event. Scenes that should have been fun ended up being daunting and incredibly juvenile. Try to be a Road Trip / American Pie, but it fails terribly on all levels. A total waste of everyone's time.
