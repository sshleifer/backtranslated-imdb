A reasonable effort is a summary for this movie. A good movie from the sixties, but without any sense of accomplishment. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was believable enough, but not as good as she could have given, other actors were just awful! A terrible picture. It was not very funny and so it did not reach its genders, since it was not particularly funny and it was not dramatic. The only genre reached to a satisfactory level was the novel. Audiences were not reached and the movie sent messy messages. A very basic storyline and a very basic storyline were not taken out or performed at all well and people were confused as to why the movie was not so good and what the target audience was etc. However Maggie was very good and the plot went well with moments of ability. <br /> <br /> 4.
