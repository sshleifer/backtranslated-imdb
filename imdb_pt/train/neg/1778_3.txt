I have nothing against a quick scare movie, but this nonsense derived from Stephen King is very clean, too bright and modern. The plot, about a new teenager in a small town that is a "Sleepwalker" - a kind of cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and who feeds on the blood of female virgins, begs for a more mysterious and ambiguous treatment. . This thriller has an inappropriately colorful look and feel with almost no atmosphere. The children are predictably beautiful and energetic, but the great advantage is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge, of "Ghost Story," has never left the female mold, and it is a huge loss that she has not been used. His performance is scary and intense, and gives the hint that "Sleepwalkers" may have been a much better film with a different focus and stronger direction. It is very exaggerated and directed commercially, with an uneven tone that ranges from suspense, comedy and drama. Stephen King appears at one end, as do real-life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 of ****
