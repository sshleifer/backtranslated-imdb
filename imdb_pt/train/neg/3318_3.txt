How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her ... too bad she's completely out of the role. I have not read Jane Austen's book, but I can not believe it's so shallow and the characters are not much more than caricatures. It probably was not so easy to reduce by about 2 hours of the show about 600 pages of the book, but I expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and cups of tea. I was giving a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor that did not exceed the mark of exaggeration (sometimes).
