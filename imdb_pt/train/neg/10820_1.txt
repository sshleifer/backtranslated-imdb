What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Could it be that Hollywood was responsible for this farce, or can I console myself with the idea that someone who did not speak English as a first language simply missed the point of view of the Charlotte Bronte classic? I do not think I can improve on a comment I read below, so I'll paraphrase: "Jane Eyre is a great book, the screenwriter should read sometime." It's true that the two tracks in this film were sadly mischievous. But it pitied the actors, because the writer left out all the best scenes. The dialogue that makes you understand Jane and Rochester has a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun ... deleted from the script. The marriage proposal, the fortune teller ... is gone. The allusions, half joking, half heartedly felt, Jane like a fairy from England look to rescue Rochester in his desperation ... eliminated. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the ending of the novel and Jane's interactions with the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love of one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 miniseries (?) with Timothy Dalton.
