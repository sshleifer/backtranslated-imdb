I remember when it was in theaters, comments said it was horrible. Well, I did not think that bad. It was fun and had a lot of ironic humor about families over Christmas. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a wealthy guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He will visit the house where he grew up and make a deal to rent the family for Christmas. I really enjoyed the scene from the lawyer where they sign a contract. That was funny. <br /> <br /> So he makes foolish family requests and even writes scripts for them to read. Of course, the family has a hot-loving daughter. And he finds out that holidays are not so bad, after all. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole doo-dah act was funny, especially when they replaced the first with a black guy, and the parents of the girlfriends did not like it. even say something about it. And the parts where doo-dah is hitting her "supposed daughter." VERDICT FINAL: I thought it would be worth checking if you pick up the cable.
