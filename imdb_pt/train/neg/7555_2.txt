Do not let the premise fool you - this was a funny movie. The problem - it should not be a comedy. The story prepares you for an ending that never comes. Worse still, the setting is NEVER explained. You're going to leave the theater asking, "Is that it?" I rate it as a 2 simply because there have been a few brief moments of promise but the ending leaves you completely empty. Nicholas Cage did a job as good as can be expected on paper, but he had very little to work on. There are strange quirks and interesting twists everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the film. Let this go out on video before wasting your money.
