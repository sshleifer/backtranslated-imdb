"Because?" <br /> <br /> This simple question had to be in the mouth of every New Yorker during the 12 months of terror that David Berkowitz created in 1976-77. That same word will surely become the same baffling question 22 summers later, when people leave the theaters displaying the banal and explorer "Sam's Summer." <br /> <br /> Director Spike Lee tries to weave the story of a bunch of misleading liars. bandits in search of the notorious psychopath - who paralyzed New York City for over a year - with a blatant and graphic depiction of the murders, the demons inside Berkowitz's head, and the frustration of a useless hunt for New York police. It features a sleazy set of losers who hear their own "dogs barking" while living lives without love, honor and humanity - nothing different from Berkowitz. Lee browbeats the audience in almost every frame with "none of us is what it seems to be". Often a white establishment critic, Lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene in which Mira Sorvino, playing a newlywed with a betraying husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man "on the back of a large Black Cadillac ". An Italian mobster tells a black detective that the famous Willie Mays camp was "lucky." Lee is still keen to hand over the racist reflections of a middle-aged black woman who declares, "I'm glad you're a white man killing all these white people because if you were a black man killing all those white people - there would be the biggest riot in the history of New York City. "In addition to an excellent opening photo of an arrival at a nightclub (reminiscent of photos by Martin Scorcese's" Goodfellas "or Orson Welles's" The Third Man "), , this movie has no soul, purpose or passion. He parades characters on the screen devoid of human decency. Although we have not learned anything about the real victims of this horrible spree, Spike Lee seems to be saying that New York received what it deserved during the scary, boiling summer of two decades ago. <br /> <br /> "How could anyone get rid of this?" such damage in your beloved city? "How could anyone show such hatred toward their fellow men?" <br /> <br /> Are these the appropriate questions for Berkowitz or Lee? <br /> <br /> You decide.
