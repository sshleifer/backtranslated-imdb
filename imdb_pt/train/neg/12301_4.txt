Oh my ... bad clothes, worse synthesizer music and worse: David Hasselhoff. The 80s are back with revenge in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, directed by the infamous Joe D'Amato on the production side and director of short-care (thanks to small miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti driving. Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (which was dubbed "La Casa"), Witchery offers some modest supplies and bad performances. <br /> <br /> A mixture of ghost stories, possessions and witchcraft, the movie jumps without notion of scene to another without letting some seriously lumbering actors and hilarious night and day confusions slow their progress to the expected end , surpassed with a serious WTF surprise climax. (I just love the look on his face ...) Surprisingly, Laurenti manages to gather a little suspense and air of malice in a few - very few - scenes; Unfortunately, for him, those few glimpses of the soft magic of cinema diminish quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> Positive sides are experienced when the blood reaches the ventilator. This department is quite effective and entertaining in the classic style of latex and red paint from the 80's when things were made 100% handmade and as shocking and vivid as modest budgets could afford. I could only watch with sadistic joy and a few giggles all the exaggerated ways that detestable characters (and actors) were mutilated and misused, one by one. I just felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently was not invited to try anything other than the good old woman / woman role she had in her career, or so it seems when checking her filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, folks - not much more to tell, and even less to tell. Do not expect too much when you spend a rainy afternoon with it, and you'll probably experience at least some light fun. It also helps if your little heart can beat the horror beat of the 80s. And speaking of hearts - every movie that has David Hasselhoff being stuck by a handsome metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and hallways, MUST have one on right place. <br /> <br /> This is my truth - what is yours?
