This movie has some things happening right off the bat. Having Dani Filth as the lead actor will make some people like this movie. I admit that I love Cradle of Filth and I listened to the movie soundtrack long before I watched it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and contributes to a great advantage. The independent film style of the movie is great for the scary factor. There are some beautiful actresses in this movie. Being low budget, the special effects were not bad either. The ways people died were very creative and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Let's now turn to the cons. There are VERY few conversations throughout this movie, thus doing very little with regard to character development. It is difficult to fear for the life of static and flaccid characters. When there was a little talk, the F-bomb was plentiful, popping up in random places. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it seems that a preteen boy wrote this and found it cool to include the whole language. The plot, what I could do with it, was very good although many pieces are left hanging and the lack of conversation leaves someone wondering what is going on. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cradle of Fear is like a porn for people who love sex and violence, but as a pornstar trying to pull a plot, it just does not work very well. Rent it, however, if you are a morbid person wanting to satiate your blood and appetite for meat.
