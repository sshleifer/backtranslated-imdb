The film must have been filmed in a day, there are scenes in which you can see the reflexes of the camera and its red pointer, even the green light of the scene that combines with the actors !!! The plot and the lines are really horrible even without the slightest inspiration (At least as a genre thriller movie). Everything that has to do with Poe in the film, has a superficial and childish approach. The film is full of clise and not exciting. If you want to watch a funny b-movie for a relaxing evening with friends then go for him you will have fun (like I did) but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
