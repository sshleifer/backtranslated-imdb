{rant start} I did not want to believe them at first, but I think that's what people are talking about when they say that South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going down. After the astonishingly entertaining and moving film "Gwoemul" (also known as "The Host") of 2006 - which actually managed to make a sharp satire of a B movie genre - successive Korean blockbusters have become increasingly generic even though their budgets (especially spending on special effects) have become increasingly fantastic. Do South Korean filmmakers really want to squander all the goodwill of the public and investor that their industry has built since the 1999 film "Shiri / Swiri" in making a series of mediocre big-budget movies like mainland China? ? {rant end} <br /> <br /> The only "reason" I can understand to make this movie is to fool investors into financing the more detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean / Oriental style dragon I've seen to date, for the final scenes. Now if they had introduced the dragon in the beginning and had more personality and purpose as in the 1996 Dragon Heart, the film could have some other redeeming qualities besides having many digitally animated dragons. Remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? No one has learned that the trick is not how many VERY special effects you use, but how do you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use because they have just killed a lot of international interest in the legends of Korean dragons with the way they filmed this. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree. with all the previous negative reviews and I wonder how the Koreans felt with their popular anthem "Arirang" to be played in the end. As a creature feature, I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences were worth it, but I have seen many video games with better camera work and scripts (only less dragons).
