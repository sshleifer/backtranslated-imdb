Portly cool guy falls in love with a hot blonde; she likes him too, but not for the reasons you think. The little-seen black comedy comedy writer Pat Proft features very good performances from Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but this does not have lasting impact. It's just a quick effort, directed by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at the level of B-comedies, the somewhat similar "Raoul" is a better bet. There is definitely a fun setting here; unfortunately, the image has nowhere to go in its second act. An interesting attempt, but fails. <br /> <br />
