Bottom of the barrel, unimaginative and virtually unwatchable remake of THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows the exact plot as the filmy film STRYKER and is worse by far! Bad acting, dialogue, effects, dubbing, rhythm, action sequences ... The list goes on. Italy literally did dozens of Road Warrior robberies in the early '80s, some good, some bad. This is the worst by far, no contest. Not only was the mood of the film completely desolate and miserable, but the experience of sitting down with this movie is boring and mean. There was 1 (one) good chase sequence toward the beginning of the movie, and a cool shot of a man holding an exploding hand grenade. But everything else about this movie really smells! For post-nuke fun, go after a copy of ENDGAME, after Fall of New York, or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX. They are much nicer than this garbage.
