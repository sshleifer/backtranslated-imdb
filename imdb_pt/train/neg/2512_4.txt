Tim Robbins is strangely benign here, cast as garage mechanic in New Jersey in the 1950s, who falls in love with a gay blonde who ends up being Albert Einstein's niece! Although he is on screen most of the time, Robbins cancels the inner workings of his intense persona and disappears in the background (it's easy to forget he's in the picture!). Romantic comedy with a trick, being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoon character). Otherwise, it is sugary and sunny, run sleepily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart, but without intelligence or intelligence. Meg Ryan is her usual personality and the chemistry between her and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her older brother. ** in ****
