Slaughter High the revenge tale of a nerdy guy who was the victim of one of the coolest and coolest jokes in movie history. Unfortunately, after the promising opening, the film went straight to hell. A very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre cuts and a final half hour that sucked a whole new level of suckiness. The guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the movie was released. If you want to rent the movie, stop it after the joke and remember, choose life.
