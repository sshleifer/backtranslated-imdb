The plot is not worth discussing, even if it indicates corruption, murder, power and the rest of the topics related to thriller. Characters are interesting, though sometimes. It's not realistic but interesting, though. <br /> <br /> The development is slow as the tea ceremony. Visuals not impressive, but good enough to relieve eye strain. Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing too shocking, nothing over the top. Cinema sitcom style. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody - excellent performance. I had to fight the unsuitability of the plot and did the job very well. The rest is bearable, though very predictable. The whole is watchable and better than most TV shows.
