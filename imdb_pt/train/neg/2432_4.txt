Not much to say about this. A plot you can very well in the first 10 minutes. Nothing much wrong with this movie, very little action for an action movie. There was a chance to explore the emotions of the characters occasionally. If an action movie is the right genre to do that, I'm still undecided. Sniper was one of the easiest movies to watch without paying much attention as it had few twists and a direct storyline. I was probably guilty of that, so with a second watch or with full attention, it might be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10)
