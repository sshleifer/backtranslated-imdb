Adapted from Stephen King (written by King himself) in which a young family newly arrived in rural Maine discovers the graveyard of animals near his house. The father (Dale Midkiff) then finds out about the Micmac cemetery beyond the pet graveyard that has resurrection powers - it's only clear that anything buried there does not come back well. <br /> <br /> Below average "horror" starts clumsy, insulting and inept, and continues for a while, with the absolute worst element being the worthless performance of Midkiff. It gets a bit better at the end, with a genuinely disturbing ending. In fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, and that's why I can not rule it out completely - at least it has something to make it memorable. Fred Gwynne's decent supporting performances, such as the wise old neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, like Victor Pascow's disfigured spirit, are not enough to really redeem the film. <br /> <br /> The king has his usual appearance as a minister. Followed by a sequel also directed by Mary Lambert (is it any wonder she has not had any mainstream movie work since?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
