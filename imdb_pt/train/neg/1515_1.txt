I watched the movie "The Flock" because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the synopsis of the story seemed interesting. This was one of the WORST films I've seen in a long time (and I've seen some turkeys). I've never posted online before, but this movie was so horrible that I had to do it. I suppose the problems start with the script that was so amateurish that it's unbelievable. The story does not make sense and the dialogue is so banal that it is nauseating. Poor Gere, he deserves much better. As for the Gere / Danes on the screen, because of the horrible writing, one does not believe in any of the characters for a single minute. I bet Gere would like to be able to buy back the negative, that would be possible. It's a shame to see wasted talent so badly, not to mention I'd like to have my 2 hours back. I know what you're thinking. How do I really feel?
