I'll start by saying that I did not understand everything. I caught on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I realized there was no way I regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They need to be forced to watch this movie several times until the end of eternity. This is the only proper punishment I can think of releasing something so bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS camera. The acting is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some interesting entries. Yay, who cares ... Shky Moskowitz is blunt, and the ship comedian is an even bigger loser. That's the best of the plot I understood. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own on DVD and gave many co-workers to watch. Each one comes back and laughs and says "Wow, I did not think it would mean that I turned off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes later ..." <br /> <br /> My answer is always "Well, now you can" br
