Ok, just reading the title you would think would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started well, but it got so boring after the first half hour. * Spoiler * He tells a story about a mother who is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will do anything to get what she wants. The only problem is that your daughter's friend is the girl on the way. She always wins the competitions, pushing the mother even more to "eliminate her." After talking to a "killer," the mother decides the girl needs to be mistreated a bit. Then actions are taken, but she eventually gets caught. <br /> <br /> The cast is horrible and the movie drags on for too long without anything happening. Do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br />
