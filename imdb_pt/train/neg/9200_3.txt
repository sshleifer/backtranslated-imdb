One wonders how the script came to be written. <br /> <br /> Wayne and the other performers do a good job, but since it's not comedy, romantic thriller or anything else, it's all a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> Feels as if one of the strings had been chased, it could be worth something. It is interesting to see a real turkey from a story made shortly before the US became directly involved in the war. I wonder if the politics around had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes, but ending up with something that no one likes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it has historical value.
