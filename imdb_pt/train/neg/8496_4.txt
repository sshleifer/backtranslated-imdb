Have you seen a movie made entirely of long footage? Not? Me neither. Well, I finally saw one in "Spring in my Hometown," and I must confess, now I know why people do not do it. The technique is "artistic" for sure, but it is definitely NOT ripe for public consumption. The technique is very flawed, simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and maybe that's the director's intent. I do not know, I can not read minds, and certainly do not know enough about the director to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is ridicule. anti-American sentiments. As an American, I am well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am very aware that we were not always angels, but I will be damned if I get the version of this guy from how things happened. According to this blind idiot, the Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the cause of the war and we almost destroyed the country alone. Anyway, sir. And I suppose you'd still be making this movie in COMMUNIST KOREA if we had not interfered, right? Talk about forgetting your story. This is almost like making the Nazis the "good guys" while turning allied forces into "villains." This film is so naive historically and so factually inaccurate that it is almost embarrassing to watch. For a man who comes from a country that owes his own EXISTENCE to American interference, he is certainly so tall, powerful and critical.
