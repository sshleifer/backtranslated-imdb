Much like the first horror film The Boogens, the invisible devotee killer is a disappointment when it is finally seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst has obviously enjoyed his role as an incest product, his performance is more comedy than horror. The extremely weary plot has three sexy women (Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the night, so they willingly agreed to stay with an apparently amiable museum curator, exceptionally played by the late Sydney Lassick. If you've ever seen a horror movie, you know that lovely IL 'Sydney is a mad psychopath, so you know what will happen to the lovely ladies. <br /> <br /> The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara. Bach, but Lois Young (a clone of Helen Hunt) is the only one to be naked while Sydney watches her take a shower.
