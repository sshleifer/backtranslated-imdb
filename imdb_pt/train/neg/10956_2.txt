I bought this movie from Gamestop's used movie drawer at a discount and the cover made me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself is retarded and they use as ten different monkeys throughout the film that are hardly similar. Not to mention that they use a stuntman who is just a short sleeved man making a desperate attempt to pass himself off as a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director more than likely committed a murder-suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted. in a preview for another Warner Bros. movie. and he ended up owing money to the studio. It also did not help that he was not even infamous for the terrible work he did, he was not even known for producing a stern film. <br /> <br /> Why has this movie been made?
