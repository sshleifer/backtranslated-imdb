'Home Alone 3' is the first of the Home Alone movies not to feature Culkin in the lead role and the same villains. However, the plot is very similar to the original movie 'Home Alone'. Instead of two comic villains, we have three or four of them. This movie involves some pitfalls but also has a long scene with a remote control car. The humor of the clown is also consistent, but the boy and the villains really can not make an impact on that film. (No pun intended.) This movie does not offer anything new or different than the previous films did, and there really is not the hot weather, vacation or subplot that the other two movies had. It's more of a pure comedy, but it did not make me laugh, since the characters really did not do it for me. I would not recommend this movie; it's very boring. If you're looking for a good family movie with comedy, then watch the original movie 'Home Alone'.
