There are so many comments about this movie, but I find them misleading. This is an overused scenario in which a normal human being becomes a partner in crime for someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. Boy knows girl. Girl holds boy in the sights of a ridiculous thing. The boy is intrigued. <br /> <br /> You know what to do: The antagonist ends up being a wild, free spirit instead of a sociopath. Play a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy is 'Is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' The Breakfast Club's role simply smells like main character. And all that's left is a truly hideous turkey from a movie.
