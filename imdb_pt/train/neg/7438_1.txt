This movie is a complete waste of time, the plot is horrible, the dialogue is horrible. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. The photography and some of the special effects are also good, but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. There is no logical progression to the story, the plot is total nonsense. It's not even scary. For a movie to be scary, there has to be at least a small element of credibility. This movie has no credibility whatsoever. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is superficial and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects and makeup work are poorly done, or at best mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see a totally horrible movie.
