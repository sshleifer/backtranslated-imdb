This remake of the original 1962 film, the book has some very good parts to praise it and some great performances of some beautiful actors - however Scorsese opts for the end for the most stupid turnaround in history and an embarrassingly overcome Shakespearean death that made me DeNiro is an excellent actor, dedicated to giving his all in the work he does, however, he needs guidance to focus his talent, and that is extremely inadequate in the last five minutes of work. the film. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Gregory Peck is useful, but nothing more, while Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with few lines like this. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte transforms into a better performance than Lorenzo's oil, but it's not in the same shape as "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has great lines, while Juliette Lewis proves once again that talent sometimes skips a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? The initial credits (!), Cody's first sight as he dives into prison, the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats, the panicked panic of Sam Bowden in the midst of panic, the seemingly calm but unnerving presumption of Cody. <br /> <br /> The worst? The "cleaning lady - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" part. Clutching bare hands on the underside of a car for sixty miles at high speed. (There are no speed bumps in the US?) "He's dead - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" PARTS AND THE END FINISHED ABOVE. <br /> <br /> I can watch the original again, but I still have to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since I saw it.
