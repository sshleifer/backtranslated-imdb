"Ambushed" is not a common action movie. It is very bad to be ordinary. One man walks toward the other with a machine gun on fire. The other man fires a round and knocks down the man with the greatest firepower, without even a blow from the lead rain on him. Guess who's the cool guy. Duh. Such is "ambushed" through and through. It's not a good action movie, neither a good drama nor a good movie, "Ambushed" fails on all levels with the cast of B movie veterans passing mechanically almost as if they knew they were making a real flop. Not recommended for anyone. <br /> <br />
