Despite a few moments of heavy rain, a meeting with a drunk and an organ player with a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanatorium, this short and short comedy "Fatty" Arbuckle Roscoe with the support of Buster Keaton and Al St. John is just fun, although there is a very funny Arbuckle sequence in dragging flirts with Buster, which is the last word in "cute" scenes, especially since it is one of the few times we see the smile of The Great Stone Face and we laugh at the movies! In addition, many scenes appear to have been edited possibly due to excessive use of the film. Still, if you are a completist of Arbuckle or Keaton, Good Night, Nurse! is certainly worth a look.
