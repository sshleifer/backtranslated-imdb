I saw this movie when it was first released. The memory of how bad it was remained with me for almost forty years. I did not want to rely on my own feelings about the film when I saw it, so I consulted a review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day - the feeling confirmed, the critic wrote that the film was incoherent, indecipherable and uninspiring. . A little research reveals that the producer was the husband of star Leslie Caron, so the smell of nepotism suggests the beginning for this horrible movie. The list of many capable actors in the film - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking, among others - suggests that this is a promise. But the death of this film is attributable to his terrible script. The "mystery" implied is so obscure and so unrevealed throughout the film that the viewer is perplexed from scene to scene. The film seems torn between being a mysterious detective and a spy thriller, but it never fits into one or the other. The sense of suspense is totally absent. The main characters are content to interpret dry, emotionless types in a way that does not inspire empathy at all. Cinematography is pedestrian. The result is that the unfortunate spectator loses interest in the characters, in the plot and, in the end, in the film itself. No wonder there is not a version of this pathetic movie available for purchase. I hope that if the TCM finds a copy of this film and feels compelled to broadcast it, it is safely relegated to the space of 4:00 in the morning.
