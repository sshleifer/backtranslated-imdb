From time to time, a group of friends, on a minimal budget but full of enthusiasm and talent, will create a low-budget masterpiece that takes the world of terror by storm. Raimi and co. did this with The Evil Dead, Jackson and Pals won with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> Director Todd Sheets and his friends, however, are destined to wallow forever in relative obscurity if Zombie Bloodbath is anything. A lesson in how not to do cheap horror, this miserable effort (on a plague of meat-eating zombies? Natch) serves as a reminder that, although many people nowadays have access to a video camera, most should not which as a suggestion to try to make a full movie. <br /> <br /> It is not that Sheets does not have an eye for a well-framed photo (some of her camera angles and movements are really beautiful). good), but rather that a) he has a bad script b) he has a bad cast, and c) he does not realize that he has a script and bad cast. Which means that the final movie is amateurish to the extreme, and is unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than the zombie movie completers (like me) or cast and crew members (such as those who gave favorable comments To the movie). <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at non-killing dogs, and Sheets (who currently has 34 incredible titles as a director) certainly does everything to please, with buckets of offal and blood thrown in all opportunities. But while these moments are undeniably disgusting, they are not particularly convincing, and soon become tedious. <br /> <br /> So to summarize, this is a very bad movie, almost without redemptive features. Except for two: <br /> <br /> First, it features the largest single mullet in film history, as sported by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The magnificence of his beard (along with a handsome mustache) is motive just to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are 'pathetic stealthy zombies': flesh-eating corpses who are waiting for unhappy victims to wander, before jumping from their hiding place to launch a weak attack, which requires almost no effort to escape. Best known for peering behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it, pathetic "stealth zombies" also occasionally hide behind low walls, or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Usually a movie that would barely have 1/10 for me, but in commemoration of Jerry Angell's maneuvers, I am generously raising my rating to 2/10.
