Not to be confused with Lewis Teague's "Alligator" (1980), which is actually an excellent film, this "Il Fiume del Grande Caimano" painstakingly ends Sergio Martino's exotic trilogy in the late seventies (including the " L ") Isola degli uomini pesce" and the not so good "La Montagna del dio cannibale".) By scandalously tracing the plot of "Jaws", the script fails to create any suspense as it always does.The creature is ridiculous and its victims are Stelvio Cipriani's melody ill-fits the adventures of these foolish tourists presented from the beginning as the obvious items of the reptile meal.No emotion out of it, quite a lot of laughter indeed! And we could find this pitiful movie quite funny if the dialogues are the appearance of the natives was not so obviously inspired by pure racism. Soon the laughter stops in favor of a bitter feeling of witnessing such a patronizing attitude. we were to excuse badly made movies and bad bad effects, but not that kind of mentality. Never!
