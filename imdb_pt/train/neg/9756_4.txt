Despite the title, this seems to have little to do with Devils and much more to do with a power-hungry ruler who seeks Philospher's Stone and wants gold made from lead (virgin's blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little problem with having people killed when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for his blood. He is basically encouraged by his beloved and alchemist that he is employed and it is more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least a bit thrilling, like fair and adult men trying to hit each other with big sticks, and the movie at least looks good but on the other hand there is little else to recommend it to. Little seriously and nothing to fear, and the most unusual, for a Molina / Naschy film, is not really an unintentional mood. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
