This movie was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that immediately jump to me: 1. The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with some trees and shrubs. It's not scary. News flash, if you're filming in the Southern California area, Big Bear is only an hour away. They really have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. Writing was undoubtedly the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. All the possible lines in the movie were not original, clich√©s or just stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "camp blood" (lame), the name of the clown is "the murderous clown" (lame). What is a clown doing in a forest? Was that the only mask they could find? 3. The last but certainly the least was the acting. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and bad acting. The worst part was when they then randomly blinked back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a photograph. It's a very long scene and I think she should be sexy, but she was not. Also, and this was one of the few nice parts of the movie for me, this tool was supposedly "athletic". For example, when he is bored in the movie, he picks up some rocks and starts to curl them. So later he must be running to the clown and is immediately clear with his very "girl like" run, that he is a long way from being athletic. Oh, and for the girl who played Kat, good God, stop singing. This song that you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see this movie, I would recommend at least watching the special features. The group of idiots who made this movie talks about it as if it were this really original story. In fact, one of the girls says she let some of her friends read the script and none of them could predict the ending. Apparently she goes out with special children.
