Not so bad, as it's credited to be (Hooper is made much worse)? more so disappointing to me. Such an imaginative concept that is never used by Hooper with his economic direction and still less with the smoked writing (excuse the pun). It is so sinister and exaggerated in a serious tone, becoming ridiculous and blurred, allowing all pessimistic mystery / conspiracy narrative to be easily telegraphed to end in something completely abrupt. Because of that, the pace remains slow and Brad Dourif (cool to see him in a leading role) seems to struggle with an unbalanced performance, despite recording a strangely strange intensity in his out-of-character character. Even if it is done cheaply, there is a competent technical attitude for it. However, it does not seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts (which some work) and special smoking effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper exhibits some elegantly frenetic images (more towards the end), and camera work is quickly maneuvered and the radiant score is exhilarating. The performances are all over the store with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small but fun cameos ?? especially Landis. Nothing surprises, but it is passively engaging.
