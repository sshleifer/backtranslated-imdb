This definitely fits the period of time that Axis & Allies was playing espionage games in most of North Africa and the rest of the world. It's not the best of the movies, but it's certainly not the worst of the budget movies as previously described from the War Classics compilation. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Kid of Cisco" Renaldo was really good at one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke (credited as Parkyarkarkus). Why he never got bigger papers is beyond me. He played the role of perfect partner / partner and saved the movie ... imho. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was part of a budget pack from Superbox-Mart titled War Classics. Eight $ 8 movies, which included other movies never heard of movies that have some decent stars trying to pay the bills. <br /> <br /> This script is ... well, not so hot. Editing and cinematography are ... worse. If you can ignore all this and want to see the future Cisco Kid and a great companion who, unfortunately, never fulfilled its true potential, definitely continue! Otherwise there are other WW2 movies to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
