I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian, but all this was too much. Much love for music, too many parties, too much contrast between the pleasant lives of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the look of the city shown by the director. Everything seems too false to me: families, relationships, music, "happiness". It simply sells a little taste of Latin American fake culture. I must be honest: this seduced me a little, but who would not be seduced by that false life made of good music, sex and parties? I'm not that stupid: what kind of world is this in which people do not suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness, and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the scene with the call of the mother of Caridad and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
