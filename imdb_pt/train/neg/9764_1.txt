In a word ... abysmal. I give a star to the scenes of hippie sex and sweet-eyed women, otherwise forget it. Corman's worst effort, none of them. Ben Vereen should have his name permanently hit by the cast. I can not believe this will now be on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with "Wild In The Streets" - another retro stinker. I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold, I decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some, I scanned the digital channels ... the premise seemed interesting enough because I like to watch movie B, science fiction, hippie culture and rebel movies adolescents. It looked familiar in some way and with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a horrible start to my day. Just after seeing it, I now know why familiarity has entered the recesses of my newly awakened brain. I remembered seeing the next attractions of this film at the age of fourteen (I'm 45) in the early 70's at the Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned loudly with how bad this movie looked. Performance: terrible, story: horrible, cinematography: almost horrible, music: terrible, sound: horrendous, direction: a joke. If you choose to watch this after my warning, remember ... "I warned you." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel "gassed" after watching this putrid movie - or maybe you should be taken to a "gas" chamber to waste your brain. I've seen Super 8 homemade movies that have embarrassed this movie. Definitely a new addition to my all-time Top Ten WORST films ... is up there (er down there) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
