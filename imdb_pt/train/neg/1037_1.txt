That this poor excuse for an amateur hour show was announced at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most independent filmmakers these days. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is such a thing as the art of cinematography. . Just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing to whoever has a line does not make a real movie. <br /> <br /> I think we have to consider ourselves lucky that the director did not get someone's camera ... <br /> <br /> Second, independent films should be about real people. There is nothing real in this movie. None of the characters seems to be even remotely human. <br /> <br /> What they see as being is the fruit of a writer's imagination trying to impress their friends by showing them how "cool and nervous" he is. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this is not a good writing or a good direction. <br /> <br /> What remains is a bark from a bad movie that somehow made it to Sundance. Hard to believe that this was one of the best films ever presented ... <br /> <br /> In any case, that made me lose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand.
