I just gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror movie to 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear on it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland, but actually in Canada, comes into conflict with a mutant cannibal consanguine or something like that, and the plot is more or less in order of distance between the EYES AND THE WRONG EYES. The only problem is that unless I've been fooled, there's only one mutant on display, and it's not that impressive. More or less like the mummy belted in that homemade movie about five years ago. Some bloody but dumb deaths help, but the film is strictly amateurish and boring beyond belief. The end is predictable and was done to the death. No pun intended.
