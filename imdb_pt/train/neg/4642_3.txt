I saw "Rachel's Attic," thinking that I would be on a pleasantly visceral journey. However, this was not the case. Visceral, yes, but nice? That would be a big, fat one, no! In fact, the only reason I gave a "3", is due to the fact that Gunnar Hansen appears (always so briefly) as one of the film's reprehensible characters. How they attracted Mr. Hansen to this job ... I'll never know. The idea of ​​the story is interesting, but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrian and the performance is mediocre. The only thing worse than that is the special effects. YIKES !!! I've seen better effects in a school game. Give it up, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I heard they're hiring at Mel's Diner! There are very few, well done, Inde films coming out of Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
