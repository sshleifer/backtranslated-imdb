A young geneticist who plays basketball does research on the genetic sequence, using human fetuses. He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He is pressed to complete his research because he has not published, so the university is having trouble justifying his funding (I think). <br /> <br /> He does an experimental injection into a monkey, which quickly dies. He then tries on himself. He begins a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying boy; It was she who demanded the results of the research. Initially, it seems to have no injection effect except a new force. He then realizes that he has had some memory loss and begins to remember what happened. In addition, it starts to look very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is called metamorphosis, it eventually transforms into something else. You will not believe your eyes - or what he has become, or the absolutely bad fantasy that the actor is using to describe what he has become. Incredibly, there's one more change in the store - the end of the movie is really, really absurd. <br /> <br /> About the only thing this movie has to do is that Laura Gemser is in it, but it has a very small part. <br /> <br /> I've seen a video box for this with a form of plastic carved glued to the box. Maybe he could have some electronics at the same time, maybe eyes that light up (the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie). The copy I saw had a box that showed only rip marks where the glue was on the plastic, which had been removed. The novelty case cover, if it still had, would have been the only reason I would have insured this film; I'm definitely getting rid of it.
