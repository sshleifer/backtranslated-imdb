I can not say that this is the worst movie ever, but only because there are still some movies that I have not seen! This has to be the most pretentious attempt to make a movie of all time! The director suffers from the same problems he had with "There Will Be Blood" (although he was not that bad in that movie.) The whole movie seems like you're watching a guy trying to impress beyond your abilities. in his little director's chair and thought "how would a great filmmaker deal with that scene?" He simply does not have it in him.I do not know if this movie could be saved by a great filmmaker.there certainly some nuggets of grandeur that could have been polished, but nothing was brought to maturity. The scene in which all the characters are singing was the worst moment in film history. One by one, as we see the characters singing, and I writhed in my place, I kept saying " PLEASE, just do not let the guy on the verge of death sing too! "Sure enough, MASSIVE FAILURE!
