The fact that I watched this whole movie says something about it ... or about me. Not a good movie. Terrible indeed. But terrible in the way that kept my attention from that perverse way that is similar to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away. It would have been a great subject for MST3K! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a movie terribly enjoyable are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, planned plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You will be thrilled with death sequences, the poor victims with gaping mouths and long waaaaaaaay to contemplate their impending death, facing the outrageously planned deliverer of their deaths. Your heart will be warmed by old cliches of action scenes like when two women fight for a gun and it goes out, but WHO? They both look at themselves, then at each other, then at themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), one finally descends. You will sing together (in clear Latin) with the street singers that turn into a horrible death choir that, for a moment, threatened to turn the film into a distorted musical. <br /> <br /> So if you believe that as I do this while the movies get worse, they get better then this may be a decent choice for you. It's not as funny as my current science fiction favorite, "They Live," with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 out of 10.
