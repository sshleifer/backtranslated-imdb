The premise of the film is scary: a woman becomes pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the movie begins, a horrible opening scene states that this is a Sci-Fi TV type C movie. It's a big Star Trek and a little X-file, but more than anything else it's annoying. <br /> <br /> When the movie comes into action, everything is predictable and clich√©. It looked more like a parter 2 on a bad Sci-Fi TV series. No suspense and no emotions, but not for lack of trying. Only many dramatic predictable conflicts between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
