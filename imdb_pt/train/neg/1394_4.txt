"The Brain Machine" at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it's all about. Four subjects of different origins and intelligence levels were selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and the environment. As the only common denominator among them is the fact that each of them has no known family should have been a hint - none of them will be lost. <br /> <br /> The whole affair is overseen by a mysterious creep known only as the general, but it seems that he is taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous. Good connection there from the senator. There is also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in, which later states that it does not take its direction from the General or "The Project". Too bad he was not more effective, he was easily subdued before the whole thing went crazy. At the very least, the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970s technology, with repeated shots of dial phones, room-size computers, and a teletype machine that will not give up. Perhaps this was the basis of the film's alternative title - "Time Warp"; nothing else would make any sense. As for me, I would like to consider a title suggested by the murdered Dr. Krisner's experiment entitled 'Group Stress Project'. Applies to movie actors and viewers. Keep an eye on just above General's head by the pool when he asks an agent for his gun. seconds. <br /> <br /> You might want to get this movie if you're a diehard Gerald McRaney fan, could he have been so young? James Best also appears in an uncharacteristic role as an enigmatic reverend, but does not call him father. For something a little more in its alley, try to get your hands on 1959 "The Killer Shrews". At least he does not pretend to take himself so seriously.
