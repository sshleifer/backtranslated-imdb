This ghost movie by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is very wild, and had at least one scare that caught me off guard. But all in all, the film is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer, only to find out that he may have committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a beautiful Asian ghost, and has no idea why (and not the spectator). As other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused, as murderers are easily found, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, the ghost lady is funnier than anything, especially when she suddenly flies around town like Wonder Woman. And the ending makes little sense, in fact, the whole movie makes little sense, and I can not recommend it at all. If it was not so serious, I'd think it was supposed to be a black comedy. Out of "Bright Future" this is the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa I've ever seen.
