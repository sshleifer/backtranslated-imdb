Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master with this movie. He had the brilliance of producing a movie with actors who could not act. Also, he chose to write a screenplay based on some kind of bad trip with acid that was terribly wrong. Putting it all together, you end up with a film that sucks more than a tank full of suction cups and vacuum cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain it caused is approximately equal to the pain caused by having your genitals sculpted with a spoon, and then having the entire wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
