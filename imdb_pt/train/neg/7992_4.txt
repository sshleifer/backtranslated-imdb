I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television. I remember the premise of the movie being about a group of hotel occupants being attacked by hungry ants. What I did not remember was how awful !!! <br /> <br /> Recently I got this movie on late night television. I'm sure it must have been a mistake, because movies like this usually disappear from existence and will never be found again! Suzanne Somers (at the height of her career playing Chrissy in 'Three's Company') plays a tourist at Lakewood Manor. Construction workers are installing a pool outside and accidentally disturbing the nest of ants. Or should I say, a * ANIME OF MAN'S ANIMAS * !! One of the workers is attacked by the ants. One minute he's taking off his clothes one by one, the next minute he's covered in them. The next scene shows a skeleton on the ground. <br /> <br /> If you thought this was very unlikely, you should see Myrna Loy playing with a resident of a wheelchair who is taken by helicopter out of the mansion! I could almost imagine her thinking, relieved, that she was being taken from the movie! <br /> <br /> The final scenes show Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room, with their backs to each other, blowing through straws and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> This is basically the movie. There's really no appeal for "disaster" or "big star" for the movie. It was intended to be a large-scale television event at the time. Now, it's lucky if it's played on a 4:00 am time on your local TV station. <br /> <br /> If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at her best, then watch an episode of Three's Company. If you want to see Myrna Loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills, then watch this movie. <br /> 0/10
