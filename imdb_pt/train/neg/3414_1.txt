That's just horrible, horrible crap. Yes, we have beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. But meanwhile it can work on the mechanism of a porn movie? may even have been a success as a porn movie? this tries to masquerade as a "movie" with real things to say, with real excitement and struggle. It is not. It's an excuse to leave some girls naked and have fun. I'm sure all those women (and men) in this particular movie could have performed well in the porn movies industry of the 1970s. . but not in the real movie business. <br /> <br /> The acting was banal, so bad, I mean really terrible. The writing was even worse. Can not I put all the blame on these actors? they had nothing to work for. The broad structure or plot of the film could be done and well done with good writers and competent actors. The very broad frame or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting at people from afar, such as a sniper. These shootings were motivated by men who did not respect their wives enough. If there was more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less free sexual imagery, we could have something to work on. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been filmed, made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all the time. ; I would have made more money. It's practically a hardcore porn movie, and it's still the only non-pornographic movie I've seen that shows a male erect penis.
