I had the misfortune to watch this crap at Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just crap. This is even worse: it's one of the dumbest bullshit I've ever seen in my life. Horror Movie? Yes, there are horrible things about it: the acting, the screenplay and the special effects. Wow, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a movie for 90 minutes. In fact, if it was a comic book, I would have given it a 5. You do not even think of renting it, unless you want to mock the producers. <br /> <br /> Vote: 2 out of 10 - I did not vote one because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
