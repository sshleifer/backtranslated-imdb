Did I see it on TV the other night? or rather, I would go to another channel from time to time to watch infomercials when I could not take it anymore. It was bad. Really, really bad. It's not "so bad it's good" just bad. How was this funded? Who thought that was a good idea? An actor my friend auditioned and was informed that he was not good enough to play a bad guy, but I think what they meant was "save yourself and get away from that steaming pile of @ # $%". I bet the rest of the cast had the option. To be fair, the acting was difficult to judge because of the terrible American false ancestry. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The action was awkward and flushed. The dialogue was inane. By far the saddest thing was the ship. In real life, the Interislander ferry is a battered boat and, in the film, does not scrub well. Instead of trying unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crew crew with bits of tins wrapped around opinion polls, I'm not joking, they might have changed the script to explain or even celebrate the disrepair. Mute, mute, mute. Do not watch this movie, not even as a joke.
