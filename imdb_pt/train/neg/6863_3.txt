oh my god, I give this movie three stars out of ten for the following reasons. the final sequence is again quite effective and was absolutely hilarious. that's what you get these three points for. Other than that, it was atrocious. it was not to be so funny, this is obvious, but the dubbing, the acting of the dubbed voices, the dialogue they said, were often hilarious. the actions taken, and / or unrealized also lead to much hilarity and / or throwing things on the screen. like when the whole town is being slaughtered and a small group of people stand on a porch looking as if they were watching a kitchen glass, or the "attempt" escapes from the church in which they hide. <br /> <evil mayor: I think something is happening outside, so you should go up and look out the window. <br /> <br /> Hero: Okay. <br /> <br /> prefect of evil: now it's mine The chance to make some idiot go out and struggle with the fire being totally ineffective and being hacked. <br /> <br /> Enter the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> Evil prefect: damn, wait, I'm going to get this little kid and she's going to come out and cry seemingly obvlious pappa to the fact that these rotten corpses are not just scary strangers, but actually they are meatless zombies or skin or anything and she'll take them away and I'll run away! enter the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> Hero (on top): he's trying to escape again, fool, and he left the door open, he's silly, that's a nice sight. <br /> <br /> Woman: Where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (down below now): I do not know, I can not see her anyway and she was not out because I could not see her despite her being out there and I having a vision of the whole neighborhood and she's on the outside, where on earth could she be? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, anyone would be throwing things on the screen after 10 minutes of it. So watch the first movie with a couple of friends, having a few drinks, and make sure that when you watch this movie, you're absolutely blindly drunk and can only laugh at the stupidity of it all. and there was not even anything decent, a shame.
