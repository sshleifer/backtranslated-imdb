They built this movie as a kind of fantasy. From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play with high-class talents, the bored young wives of rich and old men. OK, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts, still leaving room for artistic creativity in producing a good historical drama. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, nor the Arthurian legends, nor Beowulf, nor one whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many centuries past that any re-creation of his life and his times has 99% divination . It's just a couple of lives ago. My grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> So it's foolish to imagine that imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell Kelly's story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel, "The True Story of the Kelly Gang," I had eagerly anticipated that this would be similar. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much ridiculed Kelly in 1970 was probably much closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which does not mean much to him. <br /> <br /> How nice that cost me dearly two dollars to hire the DVD! I'm going to give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the good Australian bush photos make me feel generous.
