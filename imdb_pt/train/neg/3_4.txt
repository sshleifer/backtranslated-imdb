If I had not read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before seeing this movie, I would have liked it. Unfortunately this is not the case. In fact, it's my kind of movie, it's well done, and by no means do I mean the opposite, but as an adaptation, it fails from any angle. <br /> <br /> The harrowing novel about the reality of the film. living in a working-class area of ​​northern England clung to my heart and refused to let him leave for weeks after I finished. I was subjected to tears, disgust, shock, anger, sympathy and misery as I read about the women of Union Street. Great. A romance that sometimes I felt I could not read anymore, but I romance I just could not let go. Depressing yes, but totally exciting. <br /> <br /> The movie. Oh gosh. Hollywood took the truth and reality of Barker and poured a layer of icing sugar over it. A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance ... yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street' ... no. <br /> <br /> The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into the character of Fonda, their stories are played, but many are discarded. I accept that some of Barker's short stories are delicate issues that are too horrible for mass screening, and that a film with about 7 leading characters is not practical, but content is not my main problem. The essence and the real gut of the novel are lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered in cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced by sunlight, beautiful houses and a shimmering stretch of William. <br /> <br /> If you liked the film because of its positivity and hope for 'reality', I advise you to hesitate to read the book without first preparing for something more like 'Schindler's List' ... more without the happy ending.
