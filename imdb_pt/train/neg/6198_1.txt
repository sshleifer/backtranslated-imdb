This cowardly and offensive movie intrigued me to begin with. The characters are the young expropriated males who are often seen out there in a seaside town. Robert is a stranger, but he has his music that could have been his soul. Instead, Clay turns Robert into a freak who embarks on a journey to cannabis and ecstasy and enters the wrong class. Clay seems to believe in "madness reefer" and Robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. One wonders how much real life experience this young director has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young Britons are out of control. A very subtle connection is made with the Iraqi insurgents; during unnecessarily graphic rape, we are subject to explosions and images of war. The film shows the extremism of the male peer group pushed by its limits. The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's odious depiction of modern man. Clay implies that men simply can not stop themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence. It is a wonder that the British film industry allows money to be invested in films that advocate such divisive propaganda, while in London we are still recovering from the recent attacks. This is Clay's first movie, I would be very happy if it's the last one.
