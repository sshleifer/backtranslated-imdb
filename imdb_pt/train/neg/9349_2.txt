This movie was terrible. I gave the highest note of 2, as I have seen, but very few. <br /> <br /> From the beginning cliche to have the end of the movie at the beginning and return to the beginning at the end. this movie used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just because of it, like a child with lots of toys. There was repetitive narration, endless and tedious, slow motion, frozen frame, flashbacks and merged images, etc. - none of which made the film bland any better. <br /> <br /> It's called "16 years of alcohol," but there was little drunkenness or drunkenness and no description of withdrawal with the movie jumping all over the place without any coherent sense. The story was poorly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally weak and it's a shame that people have invested more money into more of Mr. Jobson's films, formerly known to be in a bunch of trash and on TV making as much sense as this . movie does. <br /> <br /> I found it a great fight to see it through to the end, but hoping to get better I continued with the bitter, but it was really a waste of time and I would have been better off not bothering.
