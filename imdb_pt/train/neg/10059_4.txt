I was hoping for a documentary focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I observed a man who laments that his great-grandfather had lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family. And this went on and on. If McElwee's family had prevailed over the dukes, I doubt that mr. McElwee had some problem with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwee's family started their tobacco business; I expected more than McEwee's continued focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the North Carolina economy and the ramifications for the state's economy for stricter tobacco regulation. The numerous references to the film "Bright Leaves" are out of place. What if Gary Cooper was McElwee's great-grandfather? Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by showing old movie clips from a fictional movie? I did not do.
