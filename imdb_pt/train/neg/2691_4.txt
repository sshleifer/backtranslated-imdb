Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. He usually gives solid performances, as in The Straight Story and The Gray Fox. He also performs reasonably well here, but the rest of the film suffers with a low budget, a poor writing and a photograph or so. The Miller-Movie formula gives you a 4. Richard gets a 5.
