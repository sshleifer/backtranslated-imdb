A country singer dubbed "Big T" - seriously, as they call it - risks her musical career and her life by joining the company of a drunk (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father is also an alcoholic and he has a violent temperament. You can imagine where this leads. Meanwhile, there's a lot of music, as Parton, with his fluent vocal talents, sings music after song (at least half a dozen of them over Texas). Avoid this mess and check it on NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
