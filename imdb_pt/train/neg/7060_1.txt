This movie is terrible. The characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent. The plot is horrible and some scenes from the classroom are worthy of embarrassment and provide an uncomfortable sight. In fact, the quality of script and characterization would suggest that this film was written by high school students, the total lack of credibility in the school environment would suggest that, in fact, writers probably never attended the film. high school. The acting in most cases was also weak, although much of it was due to a bad script and plot, I do not know if any actor could have watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Said the sound The track was good, and cinematography was good in some places (although the editing was bad).
