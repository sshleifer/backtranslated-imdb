There are not enough gay-themed movies and there are not enough "out" movies. Each one is a welcome addition to the genre. Although production figures are high (the movie "looks" good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks REAL good on a pair of jeans) this is a bad one. It is a play of the period: gay life under an oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989), a life that seems to be 40 years behind the west. In a way, we are seeing our own history; which might have been for gays in the '40s and' 50s here (I often remembered "Last Exit to Brooklyn: The Book Is Not The Movie.") But it's incessantly depressing and SLOW in an invented way that evoked an old SCTV by Ingmar Bergman It's so poorly edited that I wonder if the director simply did not hack randomly Yes, it's a miracle that this was filmed and released before The Wall was released and yes, the life behind Curtain 'was a tough one for the gays.A good director could have shown all this without stumbling the audience.A good director would have made me mark this as one of the great opening movies and not one of the mistakes.
