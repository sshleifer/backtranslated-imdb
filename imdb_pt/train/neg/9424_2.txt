That was not pleasant to watch. Frank puts all his dreams into the background and gets a normal (boring!) Job so his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides he will make a humiliating documentary about the man. A documentarist should point the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment with malicious subtitles. The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker over his stepfather is obvious. It's sad. The purpose seems to be to make Frank look dumb and pathetic; instead, he appears as the most humane of the three featured people. <br /> <br /> Essentially, a defamation campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and bolder than it really is. This left me with an intense dislike of the filmmaker.
