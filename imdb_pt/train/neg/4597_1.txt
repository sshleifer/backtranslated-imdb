Having endured this inaccurate film I will admit that it is a more modern account of history than previous versions. However, it is so inaccurate and was made so politically correct that it drove me crazy after watching it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, which I thought probably would have been better when Sam Houston gave as much love to men as to oratory. I think the selfish Dennis Quaid (a real Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and definitely would have nurtured his sense of self-worship. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mentality, I sense that Davy Crockett was the Texan par excellence, even if he was not born here. And that last scene in the Alamo, where Crockett is the last survivor, has got to be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett ever made, even if it's a friggin 'if it's a fact. To suggest that this giant of a man and an experienced fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. Three different accounts of eyewitnesses place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead Mexican soldiers after an undoubtedly fierce hand fight in Finally, that lame ending to the film supposedly portraying the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 Texan soldiers against 700 Mexicans, when in fact there were more than 1,500 well-trained Mexican regulars. in his first history class in Texas he knows that the battle caught the Mexican army by surprise during the siesta time and the Mexican army was so confused that it failed form ranks and fled because he was not trained to fight hand.
