This is ostensibly a movie about multiple pain. As such, it should move the viewers and make them empathic with the situation of the main characters. However, his annoyingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera changes continuously from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to another, creating a choppy and disjointed effect. Most of the characters seem to live aimlessly and unstructured, united by their professional commitments. (It also increases the credibility that a man who has just received what amounts to a probable death sentence would happily indulge in a sexual joke with a woman he has just met.) The plot (if there is a plot) is difficult to follow. In short, the overall effect is quite disappointing. Despite all this, the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful.
