Very bad movie. Film very, very, very bad. It's a rarity, but it's definitely not worth hunting for. This Italian Jaws steal makes little sense most of the time, and does not make sense of the rest. The "alligator" is unconvincing, and many of the subplots do not get anywhere. If it's at the local video store, you might want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies, but it's not worth hunting for.
