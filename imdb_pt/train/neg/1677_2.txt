Unlike others, I refuse to call this regrettable excuse for a movie a style triumph over substance (I do not want to disprove the style). Still, it is the most appropriate description that comes to mind. A useless, unpleasant, and ultimately meaningless attack on the eyes and ears, "Wonderland" leaves someone wondering why the film was made in the first place. and who in good conscience gave the green light to this dark and tangled mess. A biography of porn star John Holmes? A study of who the man was, why he got into business, and how did it affect him? Great. Thank you to be attractive, thank you to be entertaining. Thank you for being enlightening and fascinating at about a million levels (and I have no interest in pornography). <br /> <br /> But a confusing and violent Rashomon-style study of a series of murders with which Holmes was connected after his career ended? Who in hell cares? What perceptions do we gain? This movie completely ignores the most interesting aspect of John Holmes's life - that he was a porn star! "Wonderland" could very well be about any one: the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult movie star in the story is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make things a thousand times worse, the image is loaded with jerkoff tricks - annoying machine gun editing, sloppy Dogme-95 camerawork, unnecessary split-screen graphics and animation, and so on. etc. <br /> <br /> In the absence of a compelling story and unparalleled main character, the director (and I use the term loosely) brought together a dozen other film techniques and decided to call the resulting confusion of a movie between them : the modern look of "Narc" or "Traffic" or "Minority Report"; the frantic, often incomprehensible style of throwing the pieces of film into the air of "Natural Assassins" or "28 Days Later"; the "all-moment-of-silence-with-an-old-to-evoke-the-period" soundtrack of "Goodfellas" or "Blow"; the sequence of retro and groovy titles from "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can". The list goes on and on. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I had real hopes for that. "Wonderland Avenue" existed for years; If the context of the murders had been emphasized instead of the murders, I think it might have worked. If the murders (and Holmes's growing involvement with decadent LA types) signaled the end of a career, or the late 1970s, I think the film could have meant it; could have served a purpose. As it is - nonsense. Meaningless. Who cares how many perspectives exist in a series of murders usually unknown to the public? The case is not famous enough to deserve such a meticulous examination. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been the third act of "The John Holmes Story." That's it. Period. And that could have worked. What is it? Oh, of course, they did not want to tell a traditional story of ascension and fall. They did not want to do "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted their film to be different. Right? <br /> <br /> Well, in a sense, they did it. There is a big difference between these films and "Wonderland". The difference is that these movies are good. <br /> <br />
