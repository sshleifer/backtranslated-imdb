I gave this movie a 2, and although I consider myself a fan of science fiction, I found this film very difficult to take seriously. It was at AMC one late night, and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much else. <br /> <br /> Special effects are on average for the period of time - not horrible, but also not great. Of course we know more about Mars now than we did back then, but we really can not argue with Mars. The main reason I did not like this movie is because of the story. <br /> <br /> There were several parts of this movie that I would have liked to have been explored in a bit more detail - the astronaut's injury / condition, city on Mars, the creature on the lake, etc. Overall, the movie is very much like a long-running episode of The 60's version of The Outer Limits - complete with a tacky ending.
