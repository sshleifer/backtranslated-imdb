I loved this movie, I'll admit. This has to be the best (straightforward?) Video movie I've seen. Well ... me and my friend decided only by shit and laughter that we would rent this movie. We knew what to expect and got exactly what we expected, more. When that red neck is thrown against the tree by Sasquatch, we literally watched that part about three to four times, it was incredible (hysterically, of course). It's because? Why does the main character have to roll a lot? How honestly, we know that you are in danger, this will not help much. But really, if this movie is in your local video store RENT IT. It's worth the money and neither is it so bad, as bad but not unbelievably bad. Overall, a complete surprise will be reserved for you if you rent this movie.
