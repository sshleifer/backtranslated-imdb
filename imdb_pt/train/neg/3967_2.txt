DARK REMAINS is a low budget American horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awards. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to involve two separate strands. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting off her wrists while showering. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with cut throat. The mourning couple decides to move to an isolated hut in the mountains. Later, it turns out that the hut and surrounding places are haunted. <br /> <br /> As the film continues, the two separate strands of storyline converge as one could reasonably expect. However, the execution is random and results in confusion that perhaps could be solved only by multiple views. Unfortunately, the film simply is not attractive enough to entice most viewers to watch it more than once. <br /> <br /> Almost everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the low budget can not be used to justify all the shortcomings found here. <br /> <br /> I believe it would be wrong to judge the actors involved in this production, since the material was simply very poor. /> <br /> The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. Poorly written script introduces many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-based situations and without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired. The inspiration for J-Horror films, such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL, is obvious. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay much attention to the J-Horror style. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays with the fear of the unknown. The tension is created by constant changes between a bizarre situation (a ghost in a CCTV camera walking towards it, for example), and the reaction of a central character who comes across it without any warning. There is no humor or ironic element in these films. Everything is played so directly and without remorse or limitations that you can not help being convinced and captivated by it. The agonizing atmospheres create suspense and ensure that terror has psychological impact, very different from the "panic of fright" used in Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> DARK REMAINS directors made a bold attempt to avoid Hollywood clich√©s and also successfully avoided the use of CGI. The homage to J-Horror could have been well-intentioned. Unfortunately, lack of inspiration will probably make the viewer laugh at the supposed "scares" on the screen. The makeup effects of the "ghosts" were not so bad due to the low budget, but their actions only challenged logic. I was scratching my head a few times during this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not give the ending even if I wanted to. I just could not understand. All I could gather was that it was something of an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> What's left? The answer as a reviewer on a different website pointed out is boredom. The film is a difficult task. Fortunately, the pain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably be disconnected long before the end. <br /> <br /> There are only two positive things I could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scary cliches and the absence of the "f-word" in every sentence as one would normally expect to find. That's what the two stars are for. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy supernatural or psychological horror-related ghosts and haunts should devote themselves to such films as THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING or J-Horror sub-genre. <br /> <br /> If you think you've seen many already established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget "R-rated" horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OF A FANTASTIC HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror movie ever, but it's certainly a lot better than DARK REMAINS and has some genuine surprises in stock. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.
