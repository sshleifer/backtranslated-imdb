This is just flat out unwatchable. If there's a story here somewhere, she's so deeply buried under the horrible characters and the shrill camera work that's indiscernible. There are a bunch of vampire hunters out there doing their thing, and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside them. They blow their heads and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine blood and a blood-soaked alien half puppet screaming in horror when a cowboy's face hits him with a bang of cattle, well, that's what you get here. These people are loud, obnoxious, violent, and extremely annoying. Then there are some antihuman humans, who stand in their CGI spacecraft being so incredibly pompous that it is impossible to take. These people make Hillary Clinton seem like a right-wing extremist by comparison. They're friends of some vampires, or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then there is the work of the camera. Remember how everyone hated the fucking thousand cuts from Rolleball's recent remake? The people who made this movie LOVE these things. There's plenty of it here for three really bad nu-metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. In comparison, the Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
