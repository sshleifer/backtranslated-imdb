I sincerely disagree with the other viewers of this miserable movie. The only reason I did not rate 1 as horrible was due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and the end are the best parents because of their talented singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem is in the rest of the image. Alice Faye comes out pretty empty. Don Ameche has an excellent singing voice, but with the miserable writing material, he comes out so terribly tacky. <br /> <br /> The plot is a real tough here with Ameche taking on two parts as a man of music and dance and a baron Not happily married to Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems that when playing the man of music and dance, Ameche's marriage gains a second change to rekindle. Some silly nonsense about the baron having to clean up the business and being away lets him throw both parties. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal is given little to do here and so his comedy gifts are not given the opportunity to shine. The same goes for J. Carrol Naish, who actually seems uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a classic bomb of a movie.
