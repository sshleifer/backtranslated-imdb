A truly scary movie. It seems that it was done in the early 90's by a heterosexual person who wanted to show that gays are good, normal and aspiring mainstream people. Retrograde to the point of being offensive, the LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred route for the salvation of crazy, lonely, sex-mad gays. Wow!! Who knows? The supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (the effeminate buffoon, the bitter and solitary queen, the bitch witch, etc.) and the main characters are miraculous, middle-class, middle-class clones of little interest. <br /> <br /> With regard to the romantic and ideological struggles of the main couple, there is not much to say: we have seen it all before and did much better.
