I'm starting to write this comment during a break while watching the movie. It's the first time I've tried to do this, but I'm having trouble going through this without occasional interruptions. This is not because it is intense, but because it is bad. <br /> <br /> It's almost painfully boring and unbelievable, especially when dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is being tragic and malicious, self-indulgent and selfish. -with pity. This would have been a much better movie if they had just let the character out of the story. <br /> <br /> He adds nothing more than mawkish, mushy melodrama and very annoying. Maybe someone has decided that if they could not make Ryan credible, they would make him unpleasant. The problem with this is: who cares if a spoiled, whining, obnoxious idiot is dying? Not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing this character has for him is the fact that he's dying, and sorry, but that's not enough. Dying does not make anyone special. We're all dying, sooner or later. It gives no one the right to expect sympathy while acting like an idiot. <br /> <br /> The other two characters, and the actors who play them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are much more interesting, and their story, without Ryan's self-pity breaks, would have made a much better movie. But it's not over, and it's time to hit PLAY again. Maybe something big happens before the end ... <br /> <br /> No. I'm sorry. This rented turkey comes back tonight!
