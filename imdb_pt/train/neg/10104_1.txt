I only watched the first 30 minutes of it and what I saw was total crap. The scenes I saw were as bad as a movie by Ed Wood. No, it was a hundred times worse. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director of all, but this is not true; the idiot who ran this garbage is the WORST director ever. <br /> <br /> The American policeman has a German accent! The "police station" was a table in a warehouse with a "Police Station" sign hanging on the wall. There is a fight where the punches clearly lose around ten feet. <br /> <br /> This policeman pulls the women, the handcuffs and takes them to a warehouse. He tells his police partner to wait in the car. Then he leaves the warehouse carrying a backpack. The police partner thinks maybe something is not right, that his partner may be a bad cop who is murdering these women, but he is not sure if that is what is happening because - he is an idiot! The dialogue is totally stupid, the acting is horrible and the characters act in the most stupid way I've ever seen on screen. It is totally obvious to the police partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them, taking them to a warehouse and returning to the car with a backpack with a body, and still the partner, who is there. All the time, you do not know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a total hack. I stopped the movie in the 30th minute because I could not take it anymore. It has to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen and I will not waste any more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely worthless.
