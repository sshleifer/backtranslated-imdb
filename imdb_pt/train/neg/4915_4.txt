One of the previous reviewers wrote that there seemed to be no middle ground for Love Story reviews; one loved or hated. But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions across the scale from 1 to 10. For me, this movie rated a 4. There are some beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland turns into a fabulous job as Oliver's father. But the film did not do a particularly convincing job of telling its story, and the story was not so exclusive as to warrant multiple views, at least not for me. I may be a little snobbish, but I usually avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I have not seen Barry Lyndon yet - because most, but not all, are ruined by his presence. The only exception is "What's Up, Doc?", In which his direct performance is the perfect underline for the protagonist of Barbra Streisand - and, not coincidentally, he takes a good chance at Love Story! McGraw and O'Neal tend to assault their lines rather than represent them. <br /> <br /> This film is notable for the beginning of a beautiful career: it was the first Tommy Lee Jones film.
