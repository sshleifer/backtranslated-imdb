Clich√© dialogue and plotting (the same sort of thing we've seen in all 80s fantasy movies), crazy music, and numbered characters eliminate this from the race for all but the hardcore fans. What saves this film from the trash is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi's work, the rotoscopy and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... moving. The violence is spectacular and the direction of art and animation are unlike any other sword and witchcraft movie of the period. <br /> <br /> I like to see this with the sound off, playing the soundtrack of Conan's first movie.
