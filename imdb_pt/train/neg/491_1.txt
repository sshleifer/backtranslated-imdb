As others have noted, this film is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist's life, and I, for example, became very upset and offended ... by transforming his rape into a tragic love affair, by the implication that his rapist was responsible for "Awakening her talent," completely disrespect for her work, for the way she turned her into a sex object, non-stop, you understand. Also, I find it disturbing that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi see this movie and leave with that kind of impression of it.
