They made me watch this at school and it was terrible. The film is outdated. The episodes become confused because facts are combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. The teachers talked about it as a treat, but in fact it was a painfully boring experience. I read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them, they do what they do in the movie in real life. This explains the tacky performance very often. In addition, the story often becomes slightly outrageous and absurd. I do not like the way some of the lines were written and I wish they had more meaning for them. However, it was written to be educational, funny, suspenseful and hip, ended up being boring, dry, stressed and old. I hope no one has time to watch this movie because you would be fine without seeing it.
