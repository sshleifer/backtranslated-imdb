This is a bad B movie disguised as mockumentary. The film's pornographic documentary has almost as much screen and dialogue time as any other character. This completely destroyed any "documentary" they wanted to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film is not really a mockumentary is the least of its problems. The movie is not funny. The movie is not sexy. The movie has nothing insightful to say about the porn business. It is not particularly depraved. While there is simulated sex, the amount of nudity is light for an R movie. <br /> <br /> Someday, someone will make a good documentary about the pornographic industry. Is not it.
