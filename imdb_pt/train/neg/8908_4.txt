This series was CBS response networks for Big Valley success. It was a 90 minute Western just like the ABC show was. Although it was an answer, she did not have the material to pass Season 2. <br /> <br /> The problem really came true if it got lost on this show. For example, in one episode, Johnny keeps an eye on a piece of wood. Surprisingly, by the end of the show, Johnny had fully healed. Along with this, the stories about this were not as close as the Big Valley. <br /> <br /> This is a show that I would not want DVDs, and I sincerely hope they are never released. I think that since CBS was running out of batch, they reused many familiar settings. This was one of the last Western series produced by CBS, since westerns were not popular in the 1970s.
