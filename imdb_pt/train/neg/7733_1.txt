What a disgrace! I was checking this out hoping it would be an unknown gem of James Garner and what a stinker it turned out to be! The quality of the production was good, but the plot was undeniably lame and I can honestly say that I am only two hours older and much dumber now. The film did not really have redeeming qualities and if that sort of thing keeps coming out, that will give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it was, it is nothing, and in this case, it is not a good thing. We are liable to watch a stubborn old woman who is one of the most idiotic creatures ever to travel the Earth, who happens to be married to a true lover who is probably the only living person who could bear it. She drags him through one mess after another, he gets in one embarrassing situation after another, and prides himself on himself all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief that was! It's not worth the time it would take to watch it, so do yourself a favor and skip it, you'll be glad if you knew how bad it really is.
