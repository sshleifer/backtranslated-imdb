This movie sucks. The acting was a drug, the script was a drug and the movie was a drug. There were two topics in the film that were not developed and the viewer had to work a bit to find out what was happening. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it needs to be explained, but all of a sudden you find things happening and it's said as if you had the slightest idea of ​​what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> Heroine's negative comments about the hero. The audience is never shown how she knows anything about the guy and how he is tied up in the death of his fiancé. The viewer has minimal exposure to the death of the guy as well. <br /> <br /> In addition, all of a sudden, there is a scene with a lot of guys loading and machine guns and that's all you see before cutting into the other scenes. No explanation about guns and people with them. <br /> <br /> We gave a 3 because we did not feel we wanted our time back. It was fun to talk badly about the movie while watching, so at least it gave us some entertainment. ;-)
