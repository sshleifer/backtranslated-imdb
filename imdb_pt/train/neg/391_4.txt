For the first two seasons, I thought The Apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting program. The combination of the reality show and a 16-week job interview was groundbreaking, and the program's producers managed to keep the show relevant and not too "out there." <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is nothing more than that. than a big joke and has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. In previous seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly on the boardroom where participants must do EVERYTHING to keep them in the program (that means lying, talking to trash, backstabbing, etc.). The boardroom can be fun to watch, but it's entertainment at its lowest point - you sometimes wonder if you're watching a replay of an old Jerry Springer episode. The program's tasks are boring at best and, for the most part, a showcase for companies that are dumb enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what is the problem about half of the competitors who live in tents in season 6? This is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life. <br /> <br /> I have absolutely no respect for any of the competitors this season, they all look stupid to me. In previous seasons, at least some of the competitors had a bit of integrity, now it looks like competitors would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. It also seems that Donald Trump's huge ego is getting bigger and bigger for each passing season, and to be honest I do not see why anyone with good sense would like to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom most of the time makes no sense at all and sometimes it seems he just likes to fool people for what it's worth. <br /> <br /> R.I.P The Apprentice. Please, NBC, for God's sake, take the show out of the air as soon as possible. It is very embarrassing to watch. The Apprentice has already been a great TV show, but now it's just a big joke.
