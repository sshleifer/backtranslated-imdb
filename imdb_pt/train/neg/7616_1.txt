The good news is that a movie was made, based on a supposed Aztec myth and featuring an exceptionally Aztec American cast (there is such a word). The bad news is that he was dead at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood had retired and trained George Romaro through his classic 'Night of the Living Dead', this is what we could have. 'The Legend of Diablo' is clearly the basis for any future resurrection of the 'Mystery Science Theater 3000'! <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone can call it a 'B' movie. The production values ​​are so abysmal that I get the feeling of watching a long piece of a variety show or an 8mm film made by a group of school kids. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The basic plot seemed interesting enough to convince me to rent it. A California rural sheriff finds a box containing an Aztec demon and, accidentally, let loose in the unsuspecting community. His daughters, one hot and one homely, joined an FBI man and a priest to try to rebuild the demon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, every zombie scene someone has seen in previous undead films is re-enacted - evil. These zombies walk more like an army of crazy teachers than the undead! The supposed infrared scenes from the devil's point of view are nothing special ?? and he / she certainly seems to back up a lot (instead of getting around to moving). And the scene where the priest takes the devil out of the fast moving cave is ridiculous! Really, it really does seem to be made for comic effect - though I know it was not! I kept hoping that Benny Hill's theme song would start ringing and that the entire zombie gang would start chasing the priest all over the beach. <br /> <br /> Of course the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams calls the FBI. agent becomes frankly comical. Then again, so was the bulk of this cheese ball! Robert Napton, scriptwriter and director, must win SOME for this effort! (How about a lifetime game of chance, like 'Hollywood 10'?) This, I see now, is rated 1.5 on a scale of 10. I'm afraid this might be a bit generous! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks very handsome as the dead daughter of the dead sheriff. That's probably why your older sister (Calvi Pabon) ran away from home! Fred Deck is reasonably decent as the FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who threw for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, he should have stayed in baseball. In fact, they could not have done anything worse if they had come out with a baseball theme and called it 'Demons in the Outer Field'. <br /> <br /> If I discovered that this was really a project for a community college film class, I will make excuses. It may be good enough for a B or even B + as long as the gang has the college camcorder back on campus in one piece! 'The Blair Witch Project' proved that a cool and extravagant movie could be made with little money. "The Legend of Diablo", however, did not seem to have a shoe or tight shoes to work with! It was low budget, low talent, everything low. The final scene - and I mean about the final 10 seconds of the movie - is the ONLY lightly creative or interesting moment. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 to rent this. I could have better spent on a burger!
