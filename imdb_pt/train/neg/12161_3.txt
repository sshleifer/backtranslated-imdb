"The Deadly Look of Love" is essentially "Fatal Attraction" with some twists added to the back. The ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three films of the week. It is more of a cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation, and adds nothing new to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who happens to have a handsome fiduciary fund. Even if he has everything, he risks losing everything by starting a case with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a red-eyed blonde from Cedar Falls, falls in love with Brett, and she does not quite understand when he talks about her engagement. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett appears dead in the master bedroom of the large and luxurious house she shared with her new husband. When the police ask Brett, he promptly points the finger at Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to be looser by the minute - not that she was the image of stability before. His defense lawyer (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is determined to prove it. <br /> <br /> Did she do it or not? How will this end? You can find out the answers to these questions the next time "The Deadly Look of Love" goes to the air at your local station. And do not forget to not lose the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
