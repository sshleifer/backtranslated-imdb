I got into this movie after watching 82 minutes "Borat" tonight, and I was quite disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, and I usually go to see animated films. That said, I found myself napping and at one point I almost left, but I was waiting for the movie to improve. Never happened. <br /> <br /> The visuals are impressive and the voice work is top notch, especially in my opinion, from Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself sometimes that the lizard villain was Gandalf and Magneto ). The problem with this movie for me is that it's one of those animated features for the ADD set. It registers after the fact like a gossipy routine after another, overwhelmed by a web of lollipops that pulls all the stops in an attempt to convey an "Important Message." It looks a lot like Oscar lures for the animated category, and considering the way it's marking the critics, I would not be surprised if the Academy goes wrong and offers its hardware. But if you're looking for a nice animated film about rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
