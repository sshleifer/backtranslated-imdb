It's true that the setting in Paris is great. The actors are fine. History is a piece of distorted morality. Is it supposed to say that if you want someone bad enough, it's okay to hurt everyone along the way? In a real novel, you kind of want less clich√© than the man who got bored with his wife and is willing to leave the family, and the woman who is right to encourage him to do so. So what if they look decent and if Karen Allen shows off her body? The characters are still self-absorbed and reprehensible. Perhaps the moral of the story is "you get what you deserve". I give a 4, just for the quick scanning potential through the bits of "male interest".
