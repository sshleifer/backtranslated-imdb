Is there anything in this movie? There are only the short and bizarre scenes where I did not know what the hell was going on, so that does not count. This movie is so annoying that it hurts, and this comes from a person who likes it when it comes to movies. Confused?, Well, I was after watching this crap. What was Donald Sutherland because he completely lost it. And what about the "pedofile" scene at the beginning of the movie. You can put somebody to sleep! 4/10
