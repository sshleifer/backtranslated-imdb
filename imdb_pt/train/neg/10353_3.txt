I never read the book "A wrinkle in time". To be honest, after watching the movie, do I really want to? Well, I should not be reviewing this movie I'm going to start with this. Then I will say that the TV movie is very forgettable. Do you know why I say this? Because I forgot what happens in it. I told you it was forgettable. To be perfectly honest, no TV movie will be better than "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How do I describe a TV movie? I have never written a review for one before. Well, I'll say they usually have some celebrities. A wrinkle in time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (Or Woodward, not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has special cheesy effects, a slightly interesting plot, scenes that make you go "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and makes you go "WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They are usually not good. How is this here. A wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a great waste of time. On top of that, you'll probably forget about the second one that ended. Well, maybe not the second one is over. But in a few minutes. A wrinkle in time: * / ****
