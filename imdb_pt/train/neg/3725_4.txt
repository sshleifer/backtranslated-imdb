This is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial, (just read the other reviews on this movie). Apparently, you love or hate, and it seems that most people make this distinction on the basis that they believe that the tribulation and the end times will happen as portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie - and its sequels - were made for about $ 1.30 each. Production figures are well below "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and the performance is on the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (my apologies to Ed Wood). Leaving aside the religious message, the story is as scary as they come. Add even the smallest thought that history can really be close to something that can happen in the future and it becomes even more frightening. <br /> <br /> This movie, and its sequels, did not try to bring reasons why the tribulation happened when it happened. "Left Behind" and "The Omega Code" tried to get into everything that "Thief" did and explain all the politics and maneuvers in the Middle East that led to it. The net effect was "Thief" did a much better job in the scary part of the movie, rather than spreading too thin trying to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget politics and watch this movie, and its sequels, for what they are - horror stories. That they may be stories of terror told, indirectly, by God, make them much more frightening. If this makes you think about it, it has done its job - even if you never believe it.
