This "Debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I'm speechless" I recorded today so I could watch tonight after work. I had high hopes, now I'm destroying the cabinets looking for a piece of rope to be able to hang myself. Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something cool like "It was fun making fun of this movie," but this movie is not giving me anything to work on. I know you should not post spoilers here with advance notice, but I'll go anyway "This movie sucks" There I said it! They should show this movie to film students to show what NOT to do! My nine-year-old niece could make a better movie. The only decent thing about this movie is the sound and / or soundtrack. OH! I just found a rusty C cuff in my old toolbox. I'll place it on the thumb of my left hand and squeeze it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just record this VHS, but I think I'll burn it at the stake. I could wash with soap, but I fear I'll never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to the people you hate. -Mike
