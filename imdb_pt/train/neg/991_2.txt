If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight against sexual assault, then this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social commentary on a woman who was victimized and counterattacked. Rosario Dawson turns the table on his assailant. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to the use of vigilantism. It basically nullifies the judicial system. The film "The Accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the court system and wins. What does "Descida" do is tell the victims of aggression that they should resort to violence? Is the victim better than the accuser? Not!!!
