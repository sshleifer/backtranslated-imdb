After watching some of the great things on HBO - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc - I must say I had very high expectations before watching the first episode of "True Blood". Wow. Often the script seems to have been written by an 8-year-old child, some parts are just filmed horribly, (The scene in which she "saves" Bill, I mean, come on in. She throws a chain on the guy and goes around! It was very embarrassing if you want my opinion, or a few moments before that scene, when she finds out that the couple has gone with Bill, ridiculous. She hears them planning their things, and like 5 seconds <br /> <br /> I want to say that the idea of ​​the show seemed interesting, mysterious, intriguing, vampires coexisting with humans in our society modern ... but honestly I do not think they really wanted to do it more than a stingy soap show, which the average teenage girl watches all the time, but no one else cares about it ... Unfortunately, the script is Bad written, mediocre at best. the assumptions, is superficial and extremely predictable, I often thought this was some kind of joke or something. <br /> <br /> The actors present really unconvincing performances, if you want my opinion. They seem to take the show very lightly, as if it were some kind of regular and low budget family TV show (well, maybe that's what it is if you take the family part). The only actor who sounded good to me was Stephen Moyer in Bill's role, considering the extremely short and extremely poorly written responses he had to say "What you are ..." "I can call you sometime ... "I think he did well in bringing the somewhat mysterious and scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role should actually have. Anna Paquin was fine too, but not anymore. But the guy, playing her brother, dammit, he's horrible. The scene in which he is arrested is simply a shame for modern television. The acting is bad, the construction site looks fake to the bone, and the other two guys "Why is he being arrested? Uh .. I do not know ..." That was very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I think was completely lost was how they introduced Sookie's psychic powers. They make us listen to what people think and speak both at the same time and that is simply wrong. It often seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if people's thoughts are some kind of annoying radio channel, and when it comes close, it reaches the correct frequency level and needs to hear everything it thinks. <br /> <br /> And finally, the sex scenes are simply unnecessary and this sex tape thing with vampires was totally disgusting. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong - I wrote all those reviews not because I thought the show was bad, but because I was very disappointed. I expected quality stuff. I did not think it would be like this. Definitely not a GOOD show. Mediocre at best.
