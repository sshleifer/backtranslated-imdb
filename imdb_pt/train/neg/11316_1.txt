Knights was just the beginning of a series, a pilot, you might say. The plot (I really should not call it, there was no plot) was not at all logical and there were many mistakes, like [warning, I'm summarizing the plot]: <br /> At the beginning of the movie, someone said there was only a few cyborgs, but after the climax, Nea discovered that there were many more to the left of them. And it was said that the cyborgs were difficult to kill, but after a month of training, Nea could kill them with a single blow. <br /> <br /> The movie was just kicking. I was not surprised when I discovered that the protagonist was a kick boxer. <br /> <br /> There was one positive thing about the whole film: it really made a lot of laughs when watching it. and talking about it with my friends. I recommend watching it if you need laughter.
