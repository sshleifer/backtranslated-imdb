In the recent move to bring Asian movies to America, this is the LAST film to be released here. Being a huge fan of Asian movies of all genres, I was surfing the internet and came across this version to be re-released in the US market, so I decided to check in early and rent it at a local store. Trust me ... the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey have completely ruined this movie from the water. Jet Li slept watching the fight sequences. If you are looking for martial arts entertainment, your time would be better with a Jackie Chan movie. <br /> <br /> Besides ... you think you're going to watch a martial art with a girl swallowed up in revenge for the death of your parents, BUT SURPRISE !!! A good hour of this film in the middle is full of dialogues, a lack of action, the failure to unravel a tangent plot, practically NOTHING to do with the premise we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy group, in which the producer / director does not spend time dancing, and still devotes a part of the film to dragging the issue. It would have been much better if they had just cut off that whole hour and developed the story itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, I do not really believe in the choreographer of Iron Monkey, made the action sequence in Princess Blade. I was completely insulted by the frequent use of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the physical speed of the killers. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I'm telling you not to waste your time / money on this movie. The premise is intriguing, and the trailer may even tempt you, but I'm sure that this movie is not suitable for the public (perhaps in Japan, but not in the US) and will be the worst film brought to the Asian movie states. industry.
