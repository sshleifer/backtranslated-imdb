Hello, can anyone hear me? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you are a movie viewer, join the fan club! This movie was so incredibly bad that I could not stop laughing when I saw it. I think we need to see, it's bad in a cool way. Every clich√© ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I fear it is very difficult to get a copy of this movie, but it must be in the top 10 of the worst movies ever made.
