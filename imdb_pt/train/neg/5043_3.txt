I'm a big fan of Ziyi Zhang and I go to any movie to see her, which is what led me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I have to agree with many others who commented on it. It is very confusing and also extremely slow. As the whole film seems to have been filmed with a handheld camera, significant parts of it are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue and what there is does not tell you much. There are endless scenes of people who are just around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room looking at each other without any conversation. The way the movie time changes is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Even having read a series of comments beforehand and having a general idea of ​​what the film was about, I still had a hard time understanding what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew beforehand that the film was not remotely similar to Ziyi Zhang's previous film, but I was eager to see it in something different, but unfortunately I was disappointed. She never smiles in this movie, although admittedly most of the time she has nothing to smile about. I could have done without the sex scenes as they were as sexless and without any obvious feeling among participants as you might expect to find.
