A very "straight" old lady, desperate for money to save her house and her possessions, grows "marijuana" in her house, smokes with some old friends and then sells. This is the story for this low-key comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and a bit of the humor it brings. For much of the movie, it works. Humor is not the laughing kind, but keeps you entertained for an hour and a half, so I guess it serves your purpose. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role. But the ending really ruined a "fluffy" movie with insulting messages that only the ultra-liberals of the movie world would like to see happen. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending, too, but not everything should be hot and confusing for those who brazenly break the law. Also here are typical children (1) outside of marriage, but this is no problem and is considered right; (2) clerics portrayed as morally weak; and (3) even a doctor who also gets stoned! <br /> <br /> Hello? And the critics here blow Hollywood? This is a demonstration of how a secular society has lowered standards in the UK and Europe in general. Hey, people: at least have a trace of morality instead of nothing, but a message from Timothy Leary "If it's good, do it."
