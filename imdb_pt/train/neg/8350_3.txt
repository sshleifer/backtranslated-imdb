I just got back from "El Otro" playing here in Buenos Aires and I have to say that I was very disappointed. The movie is very slow moving (do not get me wrong, I like slow moving movies!), Slow to the point of driving you crazy. All you hear is Julio Ch√°vez breathing heavily throughout the film. This is a badly made film, but more importantly, it's a movie without a trace of inspiration, I did not feel anything for the story or its characters. <br /> <br /> "El Otro" was made just for the sake of making a movie ... making it forgotten. I advise you to broadcast this, if you want to see good Argentine films, look for Sorin films.
