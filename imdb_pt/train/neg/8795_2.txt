I have seen virtually no redeeming quality in this film. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's insane obsession with that ... There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe that's a decent quality. Overall, I found this movie surreal and ridiculous. The handmade film, along with the slow motion and other cinematic tricks, I found awkward and dizzying, even sickly. Overall, the song was horrible and repetitive to the extreme, also reminding me of the psychological warfare of the US military against various disgruntled ones. <br /> <br /> The various stickers that made up the film are random in their placement and dissatisfaction and not solved in their content and "conclusions". A depressing film (not a true film, a term I reserve for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the various people who try to do this as a "romantic comedy," though there are certainly elements isolated from both: this film repudiates in content, form and conclusion any association with that genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest staying away, despite the seemingly overwhelming visions of IMDb and other sources.
