Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a giant safety pin ....... these are the words that best describe this terrible movie. I love cheesy horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but that must have been the worst ever done. The plot is fine and ridiculous, the acting is an abomination, the script is completely laughable (the best is the final confrontation with the cop and how he discovered who the killer is - it's so incredibly written), the clothes are disgusting and funny in equal measures, hair is big, many breasts bounce, men wear those cut-up t-shirts that show their stomachs (nauseating men actually used them !!) and the music is just trash synthesizer that plays and again ... in almost all the scenes there is trash music, breasts and paramedics removing the bodies ... and the gym still does not close for mourning !! Kidding aside, this is a really bad movie whose only charm is to look at the disaster that was in the 80's and have a good old laugh about how bad everything was at the time.
