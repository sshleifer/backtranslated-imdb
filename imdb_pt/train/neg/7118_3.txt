I could not tell if "The Skull Screaming" was trying to be a Hitchcock theft or a modernized tribute from Edgar Allen Poe. These days, someone would have let him down a bit and introduced him as one of those television anthology episodes from the old "Black Side Tales" ... but only after an extensive rewrite. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is that there seems to be a nasty little story trying to get out from under the rubble of this movie, and the actors are obviously doing the best they can with the talent and stuff they have to work with. But the director simply did not know how to stage or stage a dramatic scene; the special effects simply did not work; the script telegraphed its frayed plot points so clearly that a bivalve could have seen them coming; and the soundtrack continued to play German "oompah band" music when it should have been trying to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; they tried very hard. But this is of interest only as a part of the period. I suppose someone very young who has not seen much suspense or horror can get a charge of "The Skull Shouts," but someone young would probably not get most of the time. subtext or plot motivation. ("Mama, why is this nice man trying to scare the frightened and frightened lady of the cat?")
