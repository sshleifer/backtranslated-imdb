This production has absolutely no plot. The acting is embarrassing. Promising Dutch television star Sophie Hilbrand should not add this film to her resume. Her acting is far from flawless, and I personally think she has gone beyond the limits of professional decency; relating to how it is exposed in this film. This film contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sexual scenes and rude language. It also shows a wrong picture of the Netherlands (as most films do). Do not bother watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, who proved to be better with her up close on the screen.
