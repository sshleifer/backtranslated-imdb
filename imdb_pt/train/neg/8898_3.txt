Can fake scenery ruin a photo? You would not think so, but actually for me here. Listen, I have a lot of movies from the classic era and I know very well what to do, like drivers driving cars in front of a screen, etc. But a lot of this corny business has to do with action scenes. To have a fake scenery, fake mountains and flowers shot after shot, as seen in "Brigadoon" gets an insult after some time. <br /> <br /> As for musical entertainment, this is always subjective. What songs one person likes, another may not be a big part of judging a movie (if someone likes the songs). I could blow this movie up for its 1950s songs, dances, novels and characters, but that was in the 1950s and a lot of people liked that sort of thing. Musicals did very well in the 50's. I enjoyed the 30's and 40's with the great touches. In the 50's, the tap was launched and this new material - which I support - was. Does this make this a bad movie? No. He only does one that I do not care much about. <br /> <br /> Despite the good cast, good director and high expectations, this movie bombed the box office, and with me. I should have liked it better, be a dreamer and that's a good part of this story. I'm not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds like a terrible resort. So why could not I connect with this movie? Part of this was also the dance. I do not care about the things that replaced tap tapestry. But - no - the thing really discouraged me. There was no Scotland, no uplands, just a tacky-looking backdrop to make it look like this, and it transformed me almost from the start. Make a point for today's realism, where they "go to the place" most of the time.
