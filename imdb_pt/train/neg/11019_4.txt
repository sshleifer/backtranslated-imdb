Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director, even when it comes to movie directors B, but "Haunting Fear" is probably one of his best films. Yes, it kills the great story of Poe 'Premature Burial' and yes, it is badly rhythmic and erratic, but it's also a lot of fun. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty and frail housewife whose unhelpful husband (Jay Richardson) is planning to do away with her because he needs money to pay for a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many soft-core films of the 1990s, actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty lover. You will also enjoy small roles played by Karen Black as a medium, Robert Clarke as physician and Michael Berryman in a great turnout in one of the best scenes. The end did not make much sense!
