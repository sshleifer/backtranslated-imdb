Jack London's life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of it. Sad to say that what his life was used in the film was some war propaganda that put the best face on some of the less attractive parts of his character. <br /> <br /> Jack London, who barely saw the age of 40. When he died he wrote some of the best stories around. He wrote about what he knew, but he also wrote, as did everyone else bringing with them the baggage of their own life experience. Some of that experience on another day and hour would have been condemned as racism. But this was World War II and London was a big believer in the "yellow danger" as it was called back in the day. <br /> <br /> Two-thirds of the film covers his life as an author, we see his years as a sailor from where he had the inspiration for the sea wolf. We see him in the Yukon in the hut of a miner with a dog that was undoubtedly his inspiration for The Call of the Wild. London was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was in the right role for the world to enjoy ever since. <br /> <br /> The final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering Russia. Japanese War. London was socialist, but its socialism did not include people who were Easterners. Like a few million others, he saw increasing immigration of Chinese and Japanese to the Pacific coast as a threat to jobs for whites. He advocated strict immigration policies for the Orientals. <br /> <br /> The movie puts the cart before the horse. London is presented as a man who saw why the Japanese ambitions were at hand in the Russo-Japanese War, and for that reason he was as xenophobic as he was. In fact, the kind of atrocity present in World War II did not exist during the Russo-Japanese conflict. Japan had its imperial ambitions, but so did all the others, including the US at that time. But our immigration policies caused by pressure from our West Coast politicians have been a major contributor to the deterioration of relations with Japan for a few generations. London was part of the cause, not a prophet crying in the desert. <br /> <br /> This film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston, who later made some films with a little more budget than Jack London. If he had a little more money, Bronston could have got James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, both of whom would have been right for the role. Instead, they succeeded Michael O'Shea, who was making his second film after Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is good in part, but it certainly was not any box office. <br /> <br /> As London is covering the war, he meets a captain Tanaka who is played by Leonard Strong, an actor who specializes in Orientals and played a ton of them in World War II. From the privileged point of view in 1905 Strong contours of the best tradition Fu Manchu of Imperial Japan ends up going to face the US eventually. It must have gone very well with the turn-crew class. <br /> <br /> Very clear is out of the life of London, including a first wife. Playing the second and only wife in this movie is Susan Hayward, who only enters the movie when it's half finished. I wish we had seen more of her. Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband for almost 40 years in 1955. <br /> <br /> O'Shea met and married the protagonist of his life in Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and they were married for 30 years until O'Shea died in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe someday we'll have a vision of Jack London that will be much better than this .
