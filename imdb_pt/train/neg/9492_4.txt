A star for the "plot". A star for acting. A star for the American dubbing of the shrill voice. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with their propensity to take off all the clothes. And ten in ten for the divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before making "Manon des sources". Béart also strips off a couple of times, but even fully clothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable. Beware of the scene in which she tells her friend about the three "first times" for a girl. It's tacky, but still much more erotic than the ridiculously choreographed love scenes with Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. In fact, cinematography is not great; the stills for the final credits are a better indication than David Hamilton is capable.
