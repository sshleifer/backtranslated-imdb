Dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and chaos result. Violent sexy Milligan in her most made home. Little better than a home movie (as Milligans films are) is a 1960s depravity-style trip. Noted for copious nudity and sex, this film is neither sexy nor creepy, and is now more picturesque (though decidedly rated) . The film suffers from its uneven cast and low production price (no one knew for sure where the money went in his movies, since he was always broke). It's a bad movie that is not worth seeing, except as an expert on Milligan, or because there are some pretty people playing.
