I was one of the many extras in this big bomb. Turns out I was in the right place, working safely for the race scenes at the A.I.R. as it was known at that time. Thanks to my scene in the first few minutes of the movie and I do not have to sit with the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set, but hey, the pay was good. The attention to detail was not a strong point for this, but who would know. The funniest thing was to see the cars on the track at very slow speed and then the movie accelerated to what was close to normal speed. Many of the scenes were changed as they were filmed I suppose to scrape the cost and time. But each one was having such a good time that he cared!
