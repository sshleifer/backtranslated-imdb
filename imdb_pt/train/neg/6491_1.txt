This movie was a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched this film with a group of film enthusiasts, who have a varied taste in films, but always a keen eye for a work of "genius" (as one of my fellow commentators on this site had the audacity to label that steaming pile ??); none of them found a single redeeming quality. We finished the film with an exciting chorus of swearing I will not reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the positive reviews provided here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins himself. After all, how would one of these reviewers tell you, he funded the movie? because no one in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world would risk a single penny or his good name associated with that movie. Do not let the semi-famous actors appearing in the film lure you into their clutches? as Christian Slater admits in the special "making of" features, he signed the film without reading the script or knowing any detail (a madness that I'm sure he'll never repeat). <br /> <br /> I pity the unfortunate individual who comes across this quagmire of self-indulgence written, directed, produced, and financed by a man who is too famous to admit to himself that not everything he creates is a masterpiece (and if you do not believe me, please google "Anthony Hopkins" and art).
