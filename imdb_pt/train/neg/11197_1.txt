What was the worst movie of 2003? "Cat in the hat?" "Gigli?" No more! I propose that it was this atrocious little movie earlier this year. Badly written, poorly edited and (if I may be so bold) acted poorly, "The Order" is the black hole of the film - a film so dense that not even the smallest piece of entertainment could escape its horizons of sucking events. It's not even accidentally funny, like (for example) "Showgirls". <br /> <br /> You know the producers are assuming their audience will not be very smart. They renamed the film, originally titled "The Eaters of Sin," because they thought Americans were too dumb to understand what a sin eater was, even though they struggled to explain what a sin eater is in the movie. Instead, they imagine a totally generic title and an image of Heath Ledger with a grumpy look is more than enough for you to get there. <br /> <br /> And, hey, what you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw Heath's picture and dragged me inside. Congratulations, producers, you've met your target market. She also liked Grease II, so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Back on the topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk of a specific order (you guessed it) who is trying to investigate his mentor's murder. He has problems with celibacy, possibly because no one in his right mind would believe he knew the least of religion, let alone a celibate monk. The only other member of this order is a funny fat alcoholic. As much as I wanted to see the funny alcoholic return to the big screen, his attempts at humor reminded me of all the idiots in my school who did Monty Python imitations, thinking that if they said only the lines how Pythons would automatically be funny . You know the kind of person I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I said more, I would be at risk of generating spoilers. Frankly, the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created.
