Near the beginning, after being established that outlaw John Dillinger (Warren Oates) is an egocentric rapist, another crook of the 1930s is cornered on a farm and surrounded by the FBI. The second in command, Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), analyzes the situations, puts a lit cigar in its mouth, takes two loaded automatic caliber 45 and leaves alone for the distant house. Bang, bang, bang. Purvis emerges alone from the house, carrying the woman as a hostage, and the mestizos are dead. Everything in bulk. <br /> <br /> If you are fascinated by stories like Little Red Riding Hood, this should have considerable appeal. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's as exciting as it is inattentive. Pretty Boy Floyd finds his death dramatically. Various violations of the civic code. Plenty of shootings with guns and guns Tommy. Blood all over. <br /> <br /> As history, this stinks. Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, in part I would say, because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the pursuit of public attention. <br /> <br /> The photo was written and directed by John Milius. He is the guy who had written in his contract that if any animal was shot and killed in the course of one of his productions, he should be the designated shooter. Milius is the guy, a gun crazy, who had Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Hispanic-American War shouting quotes from Henry V - "St. Crispin's Day" and everything. <br /> <br /> Exciting, yes, and complete junk. "I knew I would never get him alive, and I did not try too hard either." That is, kill everyone and let God solve them. <br /> <br /> You'll love it.
