I rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment at little Laura Ingalls for getting involved in something so poorly produced. I'm not sure if it was horrible to write or drive badly or both, but it leaves a very disappointed viewer in having wasted the time to watch this swill. It consisted of a naive and weak plot, very poor lines, and depended solely on a beautiful scenery and beautiful people to sell it. Unfortunately this was not enough. You'd be better off renting a tape full of static than wasting your time on this crap. Lindsey Wagner also played a pretty pathetic role as the owner of a ranch that apparently works a lot doing nothing, anyone who has ever been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young man from Los Angeles and not someone with much knowledge of the world . .
