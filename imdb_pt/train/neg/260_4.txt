Well, I can and I will be very short. This is an unconvincing and balanced film, which could have been a little better. The script does not seem to know where to go ... from funny to serious cliche ... it's a little silly. What more phrases we've heard before "the hacker is in Florida, or not, he's in Madrid, not he's in ..., he's screwing the signal." <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
