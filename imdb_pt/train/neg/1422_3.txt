The original series of Lensman novels is a classic of the genre. It's pure SF adventure with some substance (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood did not filmed it textually because it's exactly the kind of thing they love: massive explosions, super-weapons, heroism, hero gets the girl, aliens (great CGI potential), good against evil in the purest form, etc. etc. Instead (and keep in mind that I am an anime and japanese lover), we have this horrible movie that takes the courage out of the story, blends into Star Wars (ironic as the latter rips the books occasionally) pastiches and changes the whole thing up to the level of 'Thundercats'. To see Kimball Kinnison, the epitome of the Galactic Patrol officer and the second stage of Lensman portrayed as a small boy is unfortunate (etc). I just can not understand why the creators did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have made a lot more money (FAR!) By telling them directly. It makes no sense.
