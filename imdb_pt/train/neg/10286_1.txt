Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are abducted by menacing men during shopping and taken to an isolated island where girls reluctantly tell the thugs they last visited when they were ten years old and a fortune was located. All this basically includes a movie that is practically a long flashback on the girls' first visit to the island and the subsequent struggle with a cannibalistic family. <br /> <br /> This is extremely awful for everyone involved. I began to feel bad for poor Hank Worden who really deserved much better. As much as I did not like the "Barracuda" (which is on the same DVD) I have to admit that this movie makes that opinion with Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: A Pair of Breasts (They May Belong To Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My Category: F Dark Sky DVD Excercises: Vintage Ads for Various Food Drive -in; and Trailers for "Bonnie's Kids," "The Centerfold Girls," "Part-time Wife," "Psychic Killer," and "Eaten Alive." The DVD also comes with "Barracuda" from 1978
