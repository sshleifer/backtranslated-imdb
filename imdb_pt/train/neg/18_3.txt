This is an art film that was made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely seems to be very indicative of this general time frame - with some camera and pop art work styles that are pure in the late 60s and early 70s. The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot of any kind. Obviously, this was almost like a performatic art form and, like most performing arts, is interesting at first, but quickly becomes tiring. The film, to be even more direct, is totally annoying and would not please anyone, but perhaps to those who made the film, their family and friends, and perhaps some people, be very cool and "with him" to be understood by us. mortals.
