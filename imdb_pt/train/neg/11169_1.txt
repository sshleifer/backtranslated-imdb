Are you kidding me?! A show that highlights someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal? How talented do you have to be to do this? She may be able to cook but is not pictured in this half-hour stomach producing a painful production. I know she has a Martha-Stewart-esquire empire. The same goes for Warren Buffett, but I do not see him with fake handcuffs opening cans of corn cream and Alpo. <br /> <br /> She has a nephew named ... Brycer. Bryce? Stop talking about somebody so stupid a name. <br /> <br /> More time is spent on "table scenery" than on cooking. Who has this time?! The silicon must be in your spatula, not in my TV. This show must be on the Cartoon Network, NOT Food Network.
