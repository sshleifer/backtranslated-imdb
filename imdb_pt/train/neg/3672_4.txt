I watched the entire movie acknowledging the participation of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad I had no idea of ​​Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the movie, I said "Was that Peter Weller?" Congratulations to Mr. Weller for an excellent performance. Weller played an important character, and his performance was such that I did not recognize him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the plot was poor, the writing was poor, and the performances, besides those of Nosbusch and Weller. , were subpar. The scenery and setting were interesting, and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, out of 10 possible.
