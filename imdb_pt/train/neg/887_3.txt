After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to join and make a similar film in anthology based in New York. Unlike the original movie, the stories in this movie sometimes seem to come and go too quickly - by the time you think you're entering a story, it's over in many cases. And often they start and stop and start again - with the stories woven together. As a result, there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and is less formal in its structure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while "Paris, Je T'Aime" was a hit or a failure (mostly hit), most of "New York, I Love You" was miss. The stories tended to be much more sexual in nature, but also much less sweet - and often rather awful. It was an incredibly boring and uninteresting movie with just a few exceptional stories - and maybe the music, often depressing, sounded more like it. Now understand, it was good quality music, but its somber tone really made me feel like cutting my wrists! Among the best was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to the prom, the couple talking about cheating in front of a restaurant (though that was also in the first movie) and the old eccentric couple. This is all very sad because I really loved the first movie - and I really wanted to love this movie. I respected what they tried, but I just did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> By the way, and this is NOT really a complaint, but I was impressed by how many people were smoking in the movie. For a recent movie, this was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you pick up the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the movie. One consists of Kevin Bacon (wearing a fluffy hat) eating a hot dog ... and absolutely NOTHING else for almost ten minutes. The other features a teenager passing the movie filming the world - including a very unhappy couple.
