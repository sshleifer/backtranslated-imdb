garbage misdirected. a mediocre nihilistic sadistic gorefest ... if you're the kind of person who likes that ... see a psychiatrist. even if you are such a person, does not make this a good movie, the acting is really poor, the story full of holes in the plot, the director really should give up and find a real job because he has no talent for this. I can see why people do not like our band ... we've had some of their movies lately and that's the best of them, which is really sad! A complete absence of any kind of humanity seems to suit some people, but here it just irritates. Horror movies can be filled with desolation, they may be miniatures of artwork, they may just be a good preview when there is nothing else in it ... SEED is actually pretty bad.
