Obviously, many talented team members have worked on this film, so do not even look at the credits in the end, you're just going to hold them against them. Nobody seemed interested in watching this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed out after 10 minutes and were the lucky ones. The "monsters" were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected projects for Alien's space creatures. The film's creators obviously did not want to overshadow the third-rate movie monsters, so they hired actors who apparently could not memorize their lines, or in some cases learned to pronounce the words before the filming began. Some scenes are incredibly ineffective in conveying exactly what should be happening if anything is. If you have the misfortune of being in a theater where the movie is being screened and not fainting, you will laugh at what are supposed to be scary or suspenseful moments from the movie. The implausibility of several scenes will only dazzle you, and Stephen Queen's regular vomit of the "Queen Mary of Curse" conveys the sense of who pays to see it. If you need to see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the business box at the store. If there is any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it for you.
