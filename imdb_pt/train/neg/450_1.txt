This show is painful to watch ... <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the creators had no idea what to do with this program, the "jobs", boyfriends and cast ever changing. It seems they wanted to merge Amanda Bynes into something ... but they had no idea what, and they created this fucking show. They climbed her as teenagers, in their twenties and early twenties, and put her in adult situations usually in repeated failed comedy attempts. Soon, they realize that she needs a "clique" and put people over 20 to try to pass as teenagers. <br /> <br /> How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a "family" program, and played on the afternoon schedule on ABC Family.
