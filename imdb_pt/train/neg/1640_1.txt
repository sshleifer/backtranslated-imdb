This movie lacked ... everything: story, acting, surprise, ingenuity and a soul. Fifteen minutes later, I was looking at the screen saying, "How can all these guys get together and consider themselves friends (even without the girl)?" Fifteen minutes later, I was praying as much as I could for Amanda Peet. When a bad movie discreetly shows the ugly head, eye drops are a good consolation. But there was not much of that! Cheated on all fronts!
