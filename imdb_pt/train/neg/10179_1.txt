This movie is a disgrace to the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and can not even believe they played in Cleveland. (Yes, I realized back then that the real Indians were very good, and the twins had taken their place at the American League base, but they're still consistent.) Anyway, I loved the first Major League, I liked the second and always longed for the third, when the Indians would finally go to the series. You can not tell me that this was not the plan after the second movie was completed. What happened? Anyway, if you are a true fan of the original Major League, do yourself a favor and do not see this crap.
