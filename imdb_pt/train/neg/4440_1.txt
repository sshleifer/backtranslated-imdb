Let me be clear. I've used IMDb for years. But only today I bothered to register on the site, only to give this movie the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some of them bad, some horrible. Never, however, have I seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, of great intentions and failure. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is horribly climbing like the princess, but entirely unbelievable as Phocion, a boy. Fiona Shaw is always a fun character, but the dialogue in the film is even worse, than in the insipid French play that is the source (Marivaux has never made it to Hollywood until now, and we should continue like this). To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant and passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from glass to glass, shouting names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is touched even more silly. For this, the couple should receive a joint prize "Clair Danes", which in a fair world would be awarded for free and anachronistic reinterpretation of interesting teenagers of literature as boys of the 90s (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> In addition to the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into filming. For example, there are times when a handful of spectators come in and out of sight of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the main characters. The director wants us to realize that she has adapted a play. Got it. But that does not happen until the movie. At that point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is scary and disturbing. They are kind of like a mob of non-scary zombies, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread. When you see the horrible joke and music that ends this movie, you will want to wake up your own mob of zombies and kill them for the grave injustice of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> -Matthew McGuire
