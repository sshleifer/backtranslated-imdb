I've seen bad movies, but that took p ***. It does not make sense, and all the characters swear every two seconds, ah, and I think it has a low sperm count. It feels so good. A Welsh plays a sweary cockney. Luxury English plays with a sloppy and dirty rice, and some smaller lights play weak pies. <br /> <br /> And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh, yes, somebody has a gun and maybe they talk nonsense while they're high. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague.
