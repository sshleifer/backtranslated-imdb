While "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" is often cited as one of the worst films ever made, this 1959 film made in Mexico is so bad that it makes "SCCM" look like "It's a Wonderful Life." You have to wonder what the people who made this movie were thinking; perhaps they meant it as a third-world allegory on capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Nah. . They just were not very good. The same producer made an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood," in which the wolf's obsession with our heroine has unmistakable evidence of pedophilia. (Maybe this was the inspiration for "Freeway".) Back to "Santa Claus": Instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas resides in a satellite in geosynchronous earth orbit (MST3K tones); instead of elves, their toys are made by chosen children from all over the world; and he had sophisticated spy gear to check which kids were good and naughty. The result is like an Orwellian sweat shop in outer space. It's enough to get you off Christmas for good. This and other films of low-income Mexican children were dubbed in English and widely distributed in the US in the early 1960s; No wonder the sixties became such a turbulent period in American history. The baby boomers who were forced to endure these "family" movies as children would be eager to become revolutionaries.
