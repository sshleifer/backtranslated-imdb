This movie is exactly what you get when you really outgrow your skills, it's like someone who just went through there testing and putting them on a Formula 1 Grand Prix (I should not add, the US Grand Prix as everyone can give up) due to dishonest tires and you may just win), that's how far this movie falls. Now, do not take this to heart, I love B-Movies, about half of my collection is made of B movies, but I do not think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this movie is. <Br /> <br /> First of story (for a B-Movie) is not so bad so has potential to make a B-Movie brand, was not talking about the potential of Friday the 13th, but potential, however . But what really leaves this movie down is the acting, in no second I believe in something, it's like watching the QVC, except that presenters at QVC tend to have a heavier tan. <br /> <br /> In summary, I'd like to say that I've seen worse movies but I can not.
