So start with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who are invited to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, people laugh, jokes etc. This Dr tells them a scary story of this woman and some children. They get scared, they start to feel things. Oh no, a girl sees the ghost. A few more conversations, then this giant ghost comes and so on and so forth. This girl discovers that this ghost killed little children and that she must free their souls, yes, yes, blah blah. She does, but, oh no, she dies like her. And it goes to the sky while this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a guy cuts his head and Elanor (the one who dies saving the kids) says "oh no". The acting is wood, the effects are crap and the set is a couple of rooms used again and again. Basically, if you like to laugh at badly made movies watch it, but if you're looking for a scare, then definitely give this movie a miss. I was extremely disappointed when I saw this. A very big disappointment. My sister (who sagra very easily) got bored in this movie, it is terrible.
