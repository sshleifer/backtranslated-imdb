I had VERY low expectation for this supposed "re-imagining" of the original - and they were not even found! What were they thinking? (Answer: They were not.) Please do not waste your time at this Hollywood trash festival. Clamp your nails, balance your checkbook, do anything but observe it. Remember: if you rent things like these, it will only make sure they earn more.
