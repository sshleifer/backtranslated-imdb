The film has only one flaw, unfortunately this failure undermines the credibility of the piece. <br /> <br /> It begins with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of the disputed territories. It can not address the reason why the Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. That is why Israel "occupies" its lands, because those countries lost it in a war that began. <br /> <br /> The film also states that Israel challenged the UN by failing to comply with Resolution 242. The problem is, 242 was rejected immediately after its creation by ..... the Palestinians, making it void. Many movies are well-assembled, and may actually show images that change their mind, but remember, when watching anything, do not believe anything you hear, and only half of what you see . <br /> <br /> All participants in this film are known critics of Israel, and some have made many anti-Semitic public comments, removing any credibility possible to their words. All participants desperately need a real history lesson taught objectively, not by some Palestinian sympathizer.
