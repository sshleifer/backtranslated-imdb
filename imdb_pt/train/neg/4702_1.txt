I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate almost everything about it. It's so boring and stupid. everyone is saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they will become great. WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE YOU TAKING ??? Eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu nat and alex will end up as hobos or end up like Jane Hudson's "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?". I only managed to spend 20 minutes of this, only 30 seconds of the show, and managed to survive about half an hour of 'Battle of the Bands'. How could anyone cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, I have no idea. days before the film's premiere on Nick, most of the teenage actresses on Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) appeared in a commercial influencing brain-dead children about how incredible Nat and Alex Wolff are. First, they did not fool me, and second of all, Nat and Alex probably drugged them or paid a lot of money to say that and sound convincing, because I do not see how anyone could find this fun show. the music is just awful. The singing of nat sounds like a sick and dying moose in the crack. Alex is the most annoying movie / TV show character EVER. he's not funny, he's annoying, he's very weird, and he thinks he's hot and knows all about girls. This guy is lucky if he sucks. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) do not even exist! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex's cousin, Jesse Draper (they must have had some problem with the budget). Their father is not single, he is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear in the program, making it appear that Wolff's children are motherless. Rosalina does not exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell you, the Naked Brothers will be at some point when their "fans" find out that the whole thing is staged. 0/10
