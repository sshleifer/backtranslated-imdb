When I tuned in for the first time on this morning news, I thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." It was kind of fun for a week or more ... But we have to face it, these reporters (if anyone can even call them that) have a lot of kid time. <br /> <br /> First, I thought Jillian was breathing fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have a bit of a journalist in her. She's very unprofessional. She continues to interrupt Steve as he begins to inform viewers about a particular story. It really does become annoying to the point that I can no longer watch. <br /> <br /> Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. So she instantly turns into a celebrity celebrity she should be interviewing. She is not very professional and possibly realizes her relationship with celebrities more important than being a legitimately insatiable journalist - and that's all I can say about her. <br /> <br /> Also (disappointingly), this program has more entertainment news than necessary news about the world, the government, the US, or something that benefits and / or serves the best interest of the public. They are very focused on the sensationalism that everything they say is a commercial product. On the other hand, his field reporters are curiously tolerable ... <br /> <br /> I believe that "Good Day LA" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and definitely not for people who really care about The news. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE: (I really prefer to watch KTLA. <br /> <br /> However, they try so hard to be entertained sometimes. <br /> <br /> They're still a little boring. <br /> Oh, well, I'm staying with NBC. "ABC" Good Morning America "is also fine ... as long as Diane Sawyer does not become very serious.)
