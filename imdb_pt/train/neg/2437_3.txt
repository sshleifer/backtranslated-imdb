Well, I'll start by admitting I'm not a fan of John Ford. (I watched "The Informer" just because I'm trying to make my way through a list of "big ones.") So if you go, just go ahead because you will not agree with me. /> <br /> What a piece of exaggerated and dated nonsense is this! I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here (this made me think about how few movies there are about the Irish Revolution), but as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under the exaggerated and cheap feeling. I suppose it's kind of interesting to watch for a while to see the less-than-perfect transition being made from the silences to the talkies - the acting styles of some of the directors have that excessive quality endemic to the initial films and movies seem to have better performance with bond titles than with spoken dialogues. (Of course, the title cards would prevent Ford from reasserting every emotion six times.) In general, the dialogue has a "They're always behind me Lucky Charms!" quality that is compounded by the fact that each actor seems to be allowed to use their own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, bad as they are, the accents are useful to remind us that we are in Ireland, because the scenarios seem mostly as if they had been dragged from some German expressionist piece being filmed in the next studio. (It seems that with an eagle eye, you can see some villagers burning Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) <br /> <br /> The techniques change. Tastes change. So I'm not going out on how crazy it looks like this movie was so acclaimed in its day. But it's not one of the classics that stand - rather just a "fair warning" about the kind of simplified malarkey Ford would dedicate its career to.
