Disgusting! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this film was a well-directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original film had a lot to say and did not go out of the way to say it. And there was a naked girl on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version seems to me something that a producer bought the rights and left by disinterest. It seems that a group of individuals consciously decided to adapt it to the nineties and changed the ethnicities and genres just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It's about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason for this movie to have been made besides making me angry ...
