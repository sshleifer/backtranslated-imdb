After eagerly wait until the end, I have to say that I wish I had not joined the whole series in the first place. The final episode was all against the previous seven years. That ruined everything. The trip was 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmen were dying all day long. Why does she want to save only Seven of Nine? Do not others count or what? The most ridiculous part when the team states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As they say, "journey is more important than destiny". Unbelievable. And in the final scene are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about the landing, returning to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst of all time.
