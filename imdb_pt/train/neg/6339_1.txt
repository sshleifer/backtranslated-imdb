All David Prior's films are terrible in every way: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as the lead actor). But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity. The plot of almost all David Prior's "movies" (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Male commandoes from around the world unite to blow up Communist villains. But unlike other types of Cold War-era junk, like the movie Red Dawn, Prior's films are really funny because of their over-the-top assumptions and performances. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene where Becker (or was the other guy?) Is being summoned by General Mitchell for a secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something in the sense of " this is my roommate, I trained him well. " WHAT. Have you trained your roommate? And, apparently, this will be the solution to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these used video gems anywhere, BUY THEM. They're all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of friends for a true MST3K style experience. So far, my friends and I have managed to keep Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout." But the one that I most recommend is the Final Sanction, with Robert Z'dar of bizarre appearance.
