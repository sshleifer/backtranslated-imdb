This film has an interesting plot, but the acting is very bad and the script is bad. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the main character is intriguing, but due to the poor writing and casting of this potentially winning premise is ransacked. Two of the other four people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other two were laughing at how bad the movie was. I held on to the end, but I must admit I played Blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable.
