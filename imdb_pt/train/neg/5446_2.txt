For Duran Duran fans who want to watch a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to be creative and make this video of the '80s something like a science-fiction story, involving the evil villain Barbarella from which the band got its name. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea fail is that, in the midst of some 80's Duran Duran songs, confusing and annoying cut scenes happen, showing the fictitious antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their shows. Not only good music is repeatedly interrupted, but we also have to suffer from a spin-off story hosted by an evil Dr. Mario. It's almost too much to bear. 2/10
