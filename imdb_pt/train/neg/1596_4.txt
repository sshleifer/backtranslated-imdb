Not one of the best pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary pokemon come into the story. You can see how strong Celebi can be, even though he turns evil first. <br /> <br /> Suicune also makes an appearance, he did not seem so powerful. <br /> <br /> The Marauder Do you have lots of strong pokemons except Taranitar? Some fight scenes with your pokemon may have made it better. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak, though they do not realize it. Misty I was thinking I had at the end, but she did not come close. I saw that in the credits. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much here, the worst of the series so far.
