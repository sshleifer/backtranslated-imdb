Spoilers Maybe some details, but nothing much related to the plot. It's not like that would matter to this movie. <br /> <br /> Air Rage blatantly rips the premise of executive decision in mid-air. Ice-T leads a team of four "elites" who wear loose-fitting black shirts that we can only imagine to hide invisible armor while their idiot tactics (similar to what third-graders use when playing Star Wars on the playground) lead them to absorb a rain of shots. <br /> <br /> What most amused me in this film was the use of similar actors. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once acted in a movie you really liked, although it was a long time ago that you probably will not be able to put it (it was Porky's). Here Cyril plays a decent imitation of a Bill Paxton character. The most hilarious is gilker Gil Gerard, who is so fat that you will never recognize him as Buck Rogers on TV. Instead of evoking his slightly heroic character past, Gerard gives us an acceptable performance of the tough, fat person that was clearly imagined by John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a good performance resembling a hybrid like a Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas type. In the 10 years since New Jack City, Ice-T's performance deteriorated noticeably. It is not acting as much as regurgitation of lines that he could have memorized. <br /> <br /> One of the items that reproduce this film is a CD-ROM of classified information. It is being carried by hand, and is apparently and incredibly encrypted, despite the security aura of Gerard's NSA character. What a joke. I'm seriously doubting that the information that was supposed to be on the CD was all put together in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite being in a closed plane without mufflers, the gunfight is as high as the canned air, and makes no one withdraw, so apparently no foley budget. The variety of weapons chosen is quite funny. The use of a coffee maker by the flight attendant is about the more realistic depiction of violence in the film. When it leads intuitively to the mini-Uzi pistol, which has to be one of the worst pistol designs of all time, this is very stupid. A real elite team would take MP-5s for that sort of thing or maybe SOCOMM .45s, or even Hi- Powers customized if they were really old, or maybe something FN 5.7 if new school ... The standard issue lame it 92Fs are totally unbelievable, having lost most of their calm after Lethal Weapon I. The bandits, supposedly experienced soldiers of fortune type, have a varied mix of absurdities, such as the aforementioned mini-Uzi pistol and a Tec-9 with the infamous functional barrel extender that is not a muffler. <br /> <br /> There was a touch of realism in which I would like to correct the other reviewers: Flight attendant and Ice-T lowered the craft at 10,000 feet to "breathe air" before they opened the door. And I also had the impression that the flight attendant could not close the door, which basically gave up on that point. As for the landing, there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before the touch. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only the Dukes of Peril who escaped from Roscoe P. Coltrane on the "pass" were able to embarrass this film by the use of filming. Obviously, they chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they could not stock an F-117. In addition to the fact that they were deactivated as early as 2001, let's just forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the direction of B-2, and that at point-blank range ... Well, I'm not a specialist , but I'm having second thoughts about whether it would be invisible on Radar. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, repeated references to the "F-15s" when they were showing F-16s were laughable. The details of the 747 were very stupid. No airline would put those few passengers on a 747 to begin with, not to mention anything else that was stupid about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Pick it up in stars or something. Do not pay to rent it, but pay attention to laughter. In the dispute for the worst movie of all time, up there with No Holds Barred, which at least had some originality.
