I sincerely believe that ANY person who is considering making films is subjected to this amazing failure. Like the "movies" of Edward Wood Jr. in the 1960s and 1970s, this film is a shining example of why filmmakers spend so much energy rewriting scripts, re-editing their films and remaking their special effects until they finally look to the right. This film is also a decent argument for the studios pre-selection process. If Mr. Hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience, perhaps he would have cut 75% or the walking / running / walking scenes and edited this film for a more bearable 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Film students should see this film as an example of how dangerous to think their work is "good enough" can actually be. Each presentation, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, every filter effect, in fact, each video frame expresses the danger of fighting for mere mediocrity. A beginner filmmaker may feel tempted from time to time to think "At least I've accomplished SOMETHING" or "Finishing it will be an achievement in itself." This movie will help them understand how much a movie can end. <br /> <br /> Critics can also benefit from watching this movie before dubbing the latest summer film as "the worst film ever made." <br /> <br /> Beginning writers can learn from this movie how important it is to rewrite, and perhaps understand the need to rewrite. In addition, beginning directors can learn the importance of a good script and a degree of respect for how difficult it is to write a screenplay that makes the audience feel emotionally compelled by the story. Writers and directors who watch bad movies of the week and think that "I can do better than THIS" can see an idea of ​​this film as it is really difficult to produce mediocre results. <br /> <br /> I honestly believe that this movie can serve as an educational tool for beginner filmmakers. Particularly those who enter the craft in this current post-Lucas and post-Spielberg environment. There is a reason for such filmmakers to be acclaimed for their skill with special effects. The War of the Worlds clearly illustrates that not everyone can. Some can not even get close to it.
