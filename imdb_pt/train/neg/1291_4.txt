I am sad that a period of history so fascinating and so rich in film material can be turned into a discouraging event. Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film, probably the most intriguing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, idem, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who cried for his murdered sister every time he went to battle, was completely absent from the script. Instead, we were forced to watch fictional characters who never became someone we cared about. that sad. The costumes were wonderful, however, as was the local filming in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee makes another film of the period and try again, or some other filmmaker will investigate the tremendous wealth of material to write a play.
