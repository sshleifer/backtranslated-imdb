The fifth Black Emanuelle I've seen has potentially the most intriguing plot to deal with the intrepid reporter investigating the plot of slavery / prostitution that takes her from San Francisco to Rome to Macao and back to her own town. hometown, New York! The film is populated by former veterans of the series who inexplicably play completely different roles, such as Ivan Rassimov (who appears here as head of a United Nations committee for Third World countries!), Karin Shubert (as a rival feminist reporter) and Don Powell (as Rassimov's driver). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (although they are displayed in the dead of night), it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene (described in "Stracultr") in which a slave trader Asian gets its punishment for being sodomized by a dog is not seen here !! Yet a harrowing sequence at the end of the film when a dirty politician tricks a couple of girls (including, of course, Gemser and Shubert) into a midnight meeting under a New York bridge with a bunch of bums (that's how he gets his vows, understand!) - with his high society friends gazing happily - seems practically intact. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous element of this entrance - plus Gems The tendency to completely undress every time she enters a house (even in front of perfect strangers) - is her tour of India to interview a charlatan / guru (George Eastman invented the appearance of Christ!) qu and found a way to prolong intercourse indefinitely; Of course, when Emanuelle calls him, he ends up having an early ejaculation ... !!
