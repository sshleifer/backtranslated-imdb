Yes, this movie makes me feel like a real horror when I realized that I paid for it and spent more than an hour trying to watch it. The bald guy just gives me the impression of being a psychotic actor - Junkie and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me if you enjoy your time avoiding this movie, I understand that a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money, but this is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting. I'm always supporting independent films when it deserves support, but movies like that make a bad name for this kind of movie. I'm still traumatized. I will no longer trust any cool cover.
