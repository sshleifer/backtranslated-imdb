Irwin Allen was great. All his TV shows had a great pilot, or first episode. the rest was basically stealing from their other shows. Some episodes of the Swiss Robinson family were ripped from their older TV shows. An episode of the Swiss Family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the group needs an appendix operation. The show was high budget and very expensive to continue. Irwin lost his contact with TV shows after the '60s. The performance is strong with Martin Milner. Children's stars arrived there with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. One bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes as a typhoon and a volcanic eruption, nicknamed "Master of Disaster."
