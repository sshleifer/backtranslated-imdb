(this may be a bit on the spoiler side) I would like to start by saying that I did not watch the entire movie, nor did I, because it was evident from the first hour that I would be incredibly disappointed. Of course this is the catching issue, which many believe to be an incredible book, and turn it into a Disney movie made for TV. <br /> <br /> A time warp should have been turned into an amazing movie. movie a long time ago. It has a great storyline that can involve kids and adults. In addition, it was built in quality sequences. But Disney was not the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dwarfed what was so great about the book. It's a complicated and emotional story for children. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely "psychic," because that was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a quarrel between the three mrs. W as additional tension, there is enough tension in the story without this. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses ... which deprived us of what could have been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg, which happens in the book. <br /> <br /> I could understand for days about little things. , but I also think bigger things, like the art direction, were out. Take for example the way they did Camazotz, with its strangely darkened skies. The chill that appears in the book is that Camazotz can be the Earth. It looks like dirt. There are people who look like humans. The skies are blue, the grass is green and there are children playing. But something is a little off. The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete one, instead of taking the lesson from the book and applying it to the general direction of the film. The lesson, of course, is that Camazotz could very well be the Earth, that is, if we forget how to love. It would have been much more frightening to have a beautiful afternoon as they walked down the street with the children swinging the balls at the same pace. <br /> <br /> I unfortunately did not watch in the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney spoiled the end too. <br /> <br /> Overall, an artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
