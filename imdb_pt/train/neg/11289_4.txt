Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably be remembered only as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (they have tablets for that now!) Is probably the weakest element of this program. Really continues the weary formula of the Highlander Series - The immortal hero finds another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met, but there is some conflict, and there is a sword fight at the end, where you have a string of cheap special effects. <br /> <br /> So you have the Nick Wolf character. Basically, your typical 90's hero, with the typical plot of "sexual tension." (Seriously, why do you, Hollywood guys, think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) This was a joint Canadian / French production, so half the series happens in Vancouver imitating New York, and the other half in Paris ... as Highlander did.
