Hilary, laughed out loud moments ... and still not a comedy. I particularly enjoyed the planted gag from the ambulance soaking the "filthy bum" who then screams behind them angry "dirty bums", I mean, wow, someone's online diploma in literature is paying off! The worst screenplay imaginable, with plot introductions in a ridiculous, instantaneous movement in history, ZERO character development (even among the characters they meet .. it's as if they've all known and trusted each other for years) dishonest voice with echo added effects and plot holes .. oh god there are plot holes !! To be honest I write this not even having watched the whole thing, but I certainly hope the last 30 minutes do not exactly improve the already pathetic attempt at the movies ... thank goodness we have a good looking to do a little we forget that the movie is a load of ... well ... use your imagination to conclude that particular sentence!
