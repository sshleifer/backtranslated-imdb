I just saw this movie tonight and I have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he turns out to be more annoying than funny here and the film is more than a remake of the 1980s classic, "Santa Claus, The Movie," but without Camp or Sheena's bad music Easton at the end. The story is her run the black sheep mill in the family that comes back to face her family for the holiday type of thing but with the North Pole as a backdrop. It is clear that Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the type of family that comes home after a series of setbacks that include his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a special guest), so he comes home to face his parents and his brother better successful. Claus (Paul Giamatti) and the loud and crazy jacks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarchism that threatens all Christmas. Now, if you think you know the end of this movie, I think you'd be right because it's predictable for the hill. As for acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays, but this time he turns out to be more annoying than nice, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus, but the role is more than a note, Elizabeth Banks plays the assistant to Santa Claus, but she's not much of a character in anything but a neurotic and poor joke. Kevin Spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the movie "Glengarry Glen Ross" but a little more anal. The only two actors coming out of this film with their dignity intact are Paul Giamatti, who brings true sincerity and warmed to his role as Santa Claus, but he seems a bit embarrassed to be in the movie and you can not blame him and Rachel Weisz, who can do much more with a very small role than most leading actors do with theirs, which is a shame because Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved much more than their script. <br /> <br /> To summarize, a big disappointment.
