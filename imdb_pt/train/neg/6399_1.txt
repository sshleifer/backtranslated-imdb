One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two big comic books turned into saps for a spoiled brat. Both were sold in this, worse than the character of Pryor. Two: Horrible, overly sentimental script that could have been used in a Harold Lloyd movie is so clich√©. Three: Choice of a black actor as the toy; the racial subtext of it is unbearable, as never before. There is no message here, Pryor's part could have been touched by any comedy actor. Four: That kid ... I wish I could go back in time and prevent him from acting ... that would mean movies like this and Kid Co. might not have been made ... and my childhood would have been free of his power of bend the mind. So if you want to watch a couple of great comics get contaminated in a sickly sweet movie, go ahead. If you want to see them in something good, see the old standing act of Pryor and Gleason in something better, like the Honeymooners.
