I did not expect it to be a great movie, but I also did not expect it to be so horrible. I so hated the parent character that I had to turn the channel. I came back, hoping it was only part of the movie, but no. And does the daughter sit there, ashamed or almost out of work, or driven mad in the house? Are you kidding me? I was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother, but I would put her in the nearest hotel if she proved it as a bummer in my house. I was expected to follow a set of rules at my mother's house, after all. <br /> <br /> I did not buy any of it. I tried to give it several chances, I really did. Excuse.
