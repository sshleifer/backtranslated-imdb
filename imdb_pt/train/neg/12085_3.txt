There's not much need to start this little review with a plot synopsis. I mean, is it Shakespeare's Hamlet for the love of God ?? probably one of the best-known pieces ever written. I'm not ashamed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet as most people in IMDb have ?? through the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the show may not be the best place to judge a movie, in this case I can not imagine trying to watch it without the comic jokes. In a word, this German version of Hamlet made for TV is sad. 152 minutes? No way! It's very dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours after. I've said it several times, but entertainment is what interests me. And this wrist cutter is far from fun. I will, however, give some points for what I felt was a reasonably good performance. A 3/10 sounds right to me. <br /> <br /> As much as I like MST3K, your comments do not help make Hamlet any more palatable. There are some good riffs here and there, but overall, Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is too crazy to allow the comedy to have some kind of rhythm or flow. As much as it hurts, I have to give Hamlet 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
