Beverly Garland was born at the wrong time. She was an actress ahead of her time, bringing power and grace even to films like the Corman films in which she starred. In Gunslinger, she's the wife of the city sheriff. He falls in love, so she takes over her job to chase after her killers. She's better than the stuff she's working with, by far. The film is gray, flushed and boring. There's some (unintentional) humor with tire marks everywhere, people running behind one building to suddenly appear in front of another (I've heard of fake fronts, but this is ridiculous!), And the storyline really stupid newcomer The sheriff fell in love with the hired guy to kill her. Even if she had not loved her husband, it had only been something like a week or two since he died! And she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end, anyway. No luck with men, this one here. <br /> <br /> The villain of the play is another woman, the owner of the hall. She is planning to buy a lot of land just in case the railroad pass and leave her rich. Your plan of action, if it is not, is very bad - she will steal as much as she can out of town and dodge. Hell, it's just her and she rented a gun at the end against an entire city. Are you telling me these people are not armed? Look at what happened in real Old West cities when bank robbers came to rob the bank, then they were knocked down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous people of the city. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of meaningless talking and walking around, interspersed with some shootings. The ending is as bleak as usual in a Corman movie, although, thank God, it does not have the moral proselytism in the end that was in Conquered the World. The sheriff turns his badge to Sam Bass and leaves for sunset, though the film was so gray that you never saw the sun.
