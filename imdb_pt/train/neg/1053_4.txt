Bizarre take on Cinderella's tale. Script poorly poor, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty decent performance of evil stepmother. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning in some parts, but that's about it. The period clothes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. Go ahead until you see something interesting and save the 90 minutes of conversation. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I suggest "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "Ever After: A Cinderella Story." The Crystal Shoe ".
