I've seen many Sci-Fi Channel Original movies since I started watching them in 2002 (my first was Sabretooth - which is actually one of Sci-Fi Channel's most fun features in my opinion). Its quality varies. Some of them are average but decent (Saber Teeth, Dragon Fighter, Never Lament Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are laughably bad, and then there are some that are truly terrible. Raptor Planet is in the last. Raptor Planet, a loose sequel to Sci-Fi Channel's 2004 Original Raptor Island, is an almost impertinent mess of a movie with a really horrendous acting and a lazy script. The life-giving effects of dinosaurs (a combination of puppets and animatronics as well as CGI images and Raptor Planet images) are some of the worst-looking effects I've seen in a low-budget film. The bloody effects are unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a group of commands that, for some reason (I forgot why), travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs. That's right people, dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in outer space. What comes next, sharks in space? The rest of the plot is simple. The human cast is caught and eaten. So far, we've been waiting for this in the many dinosaur movies and novels that are released, but this is the first dinosaur movie I've ever seen, where I really got bored with all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> There are some laughs though. There is a scene that stands out in that a man is being chewed by a Carnotauro (brought to life by images of the original film) that seconds later becomes a giant raptor. Also, a bit of trivia, this is the scene where Steven Baur is filming on his own death scene from the first movie. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island was not a good movie to start with, it is a masterpiece in comparison to its sequel. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say that this is possibly the worst Syfy movie ever aired. It is almost inaccessible.
