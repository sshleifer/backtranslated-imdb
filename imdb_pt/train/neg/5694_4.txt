I'll be honest - the reason I rented this movie was because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler (most notably Early Edition). Since he usually plays the good guy, I wanted to see him in a different role (out of curiosity). The plot itself also attracted me; a would-be assassin (Tony Greco-a.k.a. Chandler) must kill a person at random before relying on life - or rather the death of a witness who will testify against someone in the "family." The movies were nothing like I expected. I was sick, I hated the ending (if you saw it, you would know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically, it was dirty and made little sense. Yes, it was a Mafia movie, but the guns go BOOM. But there's more to a movie than that. This movie acted as if it did not have time to go into detail - just deal with it and understand. The performance really made up for it - James Belushi was a lot of fun as "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel seem as believable as she could get. She surprised me more. And Kyle Chandler was equally compelling as an eager newcomer to the "family." If only the screenplay would do justice to the actors.
