I was browsing through Netflix and ran into this movie. Having good memories of the book as a child, I decided to check this out. This is a movie you really should get through. <br /> <br /> Not worth seeing. It's very boring and uninteresting. I feel like it would be the same for small children. There is no magic that the book contains. This movie is not horrible, but you will see yourself not caring for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that seem weird. The character of the witch is not very good. The family acts as if it were not a big deal that these strange things were happening. I know this is a children's film, so as an older audience, we should not look too deeply into things, but the whole movie looks like it was written and produced by people who have never had any experience with movies before. <br /> <br /> The DVD I started started skipping the final moments of the movie, and instead of trying to fix it, I simply hung up and sent it back to Netflix. I do not really care how this ended. Skip this movie and read the book.
