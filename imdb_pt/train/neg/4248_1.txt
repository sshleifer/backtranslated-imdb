This film had mediocrity, laziness and impatience written all over. If you're going to make a vampire movie that's been done a thousand times, you better do a great job. I will be the first to say that this film simply did not cut it. Some horror / horror movies simply can not break the mold of "let's do something forbidden and abandoned for fun, because all stories are just lies" clich√©. This, unfortunately, was no different, and like all horror movies, once you take that road, there's no turning back. <br /> <br /> And the end? How do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie, but mysteriously do they get involved at the moment and can not get the job done in the end? The finale was very anti-climatic and spelled part 3 which I will never watch. Terrible movie.
