I can not believe that those who praise this movie are not thinking of another movie. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be horrible, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a movie that is also useless. On the plus side, the general level of skill on the part of the actors and the technical staff is quite competent, but when you have a nut ear to work with you, you can not make a silk purse. Ben G fans should be left with just about any other movie he's in. Dorothy S fans should stay with Galaxina. Fans of Peter B should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's surprisingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.
