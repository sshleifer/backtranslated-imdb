As much as I do not like to say "me too" in response to other comments - it is quite true that the first 30 minutes of this movie have nothing to do with the endless farce comprising the following 90s. Being banned somewhere does not make an assistive movie. Just because it does not resemble a Hollywood product does not make it credible. <br /> <br /> Worse still, apart from no tangible plot (in addition to being many muddy places in Russia and many people, even very old women, drink lots of vodka) a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating that I am in the my second pack of Rolaids. <br /> <br /> As for the spoilers - well, the movie is so devoid of any narrative thread I could not write one if I tried. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money, and do not confuse this with a good Russian cinema.
