This was a silly movie with a predictable plot and a terrible acting! Willy Nelson was as hard as his braids. The film looked like a long ad for the red lipstick Jessica Simpson wore - especially since there were so many close-ups on her face. The premise was not fun and like I said - soooooooo predictable. Any money spent on making this movie was a disgraceful waste. Any allusions to other old Marilyn Monroe films did not enhance the vision of Blond Ambition. It was also so unbelievable - Jessica Simpson being able to get into an executive desk position at the drop of a hat - that was laughable !!!
