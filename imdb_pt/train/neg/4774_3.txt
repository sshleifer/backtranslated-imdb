I'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a Saw-type movie or 12 Angry Men (people gathering the facts to understand the truth). Whatever it was, it was badly made and was not worth watching. <br /> <br /> I do not watch movies because of blood and blood, but since this movie had little else to do, I should have shown the actual murder. More. Most were off camera, minimizing the horror we should feel for the killings. <br /> <br /> It also irritated me that the policeman was among the victims; he unknowingly contributed to the innocent young man going to jail by accepting evidence planted (given to him by MJH) in the evidence room. (And MJH would not be the prosecuting attorney, had access to that evidence - removing it and putting the wrong evidence back - anyway, so she would not need the cop's help?). The others, though often also unaware that it was this particular person they were harming, still played larger roles in their final death. The arms dealer should know that his weapons would be used for evil intent. The insurance guy rejected an obviously needy person, etc. But the police officer's crime seemed minor in comparison, since he did not know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have gone a step further and it would have been him who encouraged MJH to plant the evidence, which would have made him more guilty. And MJH is screaming that he (the cop) put her in that mess makes no sense. <br /> <br /> It would be more intriguing if each person died in a way that would offer others a clue as to why he / she was there and deserved to die. The insurance guy, for example, could have had the requests he rejected in his throat, so he choked on them; the Oriental woman could have had her eyes torn because she was a false witness, etc. Yes, more violent than death from a firearm, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not witty, there was no twist, and the ending was one of the worst (if not the worst) I've ever seen. The ending ended up taking three stars out of my standings. <br /> <br /> The actors did a decent job, especially considering the garbage lines and the motivation with which they had to work. <br /> <br /> Overall, a waste of time.
