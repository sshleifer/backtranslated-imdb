Yes, Madsen's character - while talking to the woman on the TV station - is right: Los Angeles police are a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this movie does not change anything about it. Ok, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even a nigger, who is a Christian, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. Reality is not like that. And most important for action fans: the shooting is boring. Just shoot and shoot and shoot. Just it. Play Counter Strike, so you'll have at least something to do. The only moral of this film is: The LAPD is good now. There are no bad cops in this. If you like acrylic and euphemistic commercials for police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
