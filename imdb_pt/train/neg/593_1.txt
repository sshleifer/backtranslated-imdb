This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most abominable American slag; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American scoria par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot, in fact, he thought it was a good idea. it is not. It is a dirty garbage of many entrails of Satan himself (who probably could have written a better script if he had concentrated on it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, spending our taxpayer money (lottery money people) on this piece of nonsense, should be responsible. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to remake Deathline ??? I ask you - camp like a Christmas Tree, Death Line ... 'Beware of the Doors' is really bad British movie classic, we do not really need a reminder. And we certainly do not need a poor, second-rate, poorly scripted, poorly developed and bad piece of junk like this. All this from the UK funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I rest my case. <br /> <br /> Do not pay money to see this. It's absolute and utter crap - the only grace for producers is that they have a big chunk of money ... our money ... to do it. They should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> I'm reeling in the low and low standard of this movie. Let me know that our national film support body thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry, while idiots run the show. Harvey Wienstein, where are you? Come back, we forgive you !!!
