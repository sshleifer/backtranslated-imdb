- A small moment tricks the local mafia boss of a lot of money. Of course the Mafia boss wants his money back and does not care who he has to kill to get it. Punk recruits his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> If this sounds ridiculous, it is. The whole idea that this buggy driving punk, owner of an Izod, could withstand one of Rome's most powerful mobs is simply silly. Your friend may be good with a gun, but he faces a group of trained killers. The old mafioso is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to facing the crowd. There is also a sub-plot on how the friend's father was killed years ago by the mob boss, but there is little of him and this does not help the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Mafia boss Mister Scarface is played by Jack Palance. I suppose he has the name because he has what appears to be a beard cut on his cheek. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast, doing what he should to get a salary. <br /> <br /> - I've seen some good crime / Italian crime films recently, but Mister Scarface is not one of them. Check out Syndicate Sadists or Revolver.
