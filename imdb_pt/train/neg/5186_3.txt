RKS movies have always been commercial films that fit the 90's, from GHAYAL, DAMINI <br /> <br /> Their last KHAKEE movies were watched FAMILY was crap <br /> <br /> This movie is a decent movie but it could be better <br /> <br /> The problem is in many old cliches and many scenes go out very long and long <br /> <br /> The character of Ajay Devgan is shown very well, but his character is heroic, which can be subtle <br /> <br /> Long flashback can be avoided, since thigns are simply long. <br /> <br /> Even the second-half street game seems too simplistic and hardly a solution The message is well presented <br /> <br /> The direction by RKS is decent although it may be better Music is fine <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks very well and is at ease playing his part mainly though sometimes he seems uncomfortable in light scenes He stands out in dramatic Vidya stands out in front of the media scene Pankaj has a role not well defined and very filmy and he stands out in his part Darshan Jariwala hams as the villain of the old age the rest is well
