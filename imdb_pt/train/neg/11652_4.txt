The script for "Scary Movie 2" was not ready. This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident to both the actors and the audience. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many of the actors are funny people; and so the film is not completely bland. To his credit, the film has several funny moments. But as a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is nowhere near as clever and fun as the original. <br /> <br /> The first "Scary Movie" was a laughing movie per minute. He transformed the smallest subtleties of the slasher genre into comic gold. The humor in "Scary Movie 2" is as heavy as it is not original. They even miss out on obvious parody opportunities. Two of the movie stars are former cast members of "Beverly Hills 90210," and this was a show that was begging to be parodyed! Ultimately, "Scary Movie 2" is like a good bottle of wine that was opened very early. The script needed a lot more time to grow old. 2 stars out of 5
