Seeing all the negative comments for this movie, I realized that it could be more of a comic masterpiece that was not exactly to be. I watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered terribly by Lungren, and all the other Eastern actors played, and I found the movie so horrible that it was funny. Then, Brandon Lee enters the story and the one liners begin to fly, the plot falls apart, the writers begin to drink and the film wears off, is welcome, since it becomes the worst action movie of all. <br /> <br /> Lungren surpasses his earlier efforts in "The Punisher" and others, as well as in all of Van Damme's films, Seagal films and Stallone's non-Rocky films, for this distinguished honor. This movie has the worst performance (see Aunt Carrere's face when she's in any scene with Dolph, which is worth laughing at), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee's comment about little Dolph is the worst of all the times) and the worst clothes in a movie (Dolph in full Japanese costume). Picture "Tango and Cash", with worse performance, meets "Commando", meets "Friday the 13th" (because of nonsense nonsense and performance of Lungren is very similar to Jason Voorhees) in an hour and fifteen minutes of joke film. (that's not horrible) performances go to the villain (who still seems constipated throughout his performance) and Carrere (who somehow says his 5 lines without leaving laughing). Brandon Lee is there just being Lungren's helper, and doing a really horrible job at it. <br /> <br /> A horrible and horrible movie. Theme and avoid. If you watch, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as bright as most non-underwater shots. Speaking of underwater shots, check out the lame water fight scene with the worst ever fight scene finale. This movie has all versions of a bad fight scene for those with short periods of attention and to fill in between nude flashes. A BAD BAD MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
