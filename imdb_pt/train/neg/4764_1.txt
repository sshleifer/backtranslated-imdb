86 wasted minutes of my life. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, and I must say I'm not the type to never sleep in the movies. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a meaningless plot acting so formally forced, and can only assume that the actors were as tough as the lead writer supposedly was in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Everything in this terrible adaptation is exaggerated. And if it's not the wood acting, almost as if you could see the teleprompter, then the set itself, which is super bright and interfering in absolutely unnecessary ways, and oversized to an unimaginable extent, is enough to push you away from the whole farce. <br /> <br /> As for the supposed clash of a disguised detective, anyone who does not see it-like all the rest of this ridiculous plot-wired light years in advance, he should check his sight immediately. <br /> <br /> The bad acting, and two very decent actors, along with the Branagh trademark superdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets instead of blanks. <br /> <br /> Above all, there is a completely homoerotic smiley tone in this, increased by the end of it. All I can hope for is that it's a failure that people do not try to imitate that level of cinema again.
