OK, the picture of stereotypical "Indians" in this story is simply wrong. I agree that Elvis looks really good here, but yes, the color of his skin seems to change during the film. I was thinking, OK, he's never been so tan in real life. It's the most obvious brown makeup I've ever seen. It's as bad as the "Indians" in "F-Tropa" and the old Western Hollywood movies that were played by American Jewish and Italian actors and not by real Native Americans! <br /> <br /> This movie is good, but generally it is lame history and mediocre songs, as in all later Elvis films. He only did it because Colonel Parker had tied him to long-term contacts to get as much money as possible from Elvis! I keep thinking 'thank God' that Elvis stopped making movies forever, not long after this movie came out. It's cool to see the characters actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie, however. <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredith's "Indian" makeup is absolutely horrible. It's the worst of the group for sure. What were the filmmakers thinking? Was Mr. Meredith doing this just for the money or what? I love some Elvis movies, though. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can watch your movie with Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, 'Change Of Habit' in which Elvis plays a downtown doctor. Oh, well, at least Elvis made some good movies, but the mediocre and the bad dominate the decent and good. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you. Thank you!
