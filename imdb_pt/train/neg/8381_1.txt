There are some extremely talented black directors like Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and a number of others who deserve credit deserved for the film industry. Then there are the Wayans brothers, who at the same time (15 years ago) had an extremely funny television program, "In Living Color," which launched Jim Carrey's career among others. Now, we have stupidity replacing humor and gross jokes (toilet humor) as the standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those portrayed in 'Little Man', which could not be. A baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as only being a few months old? Baby comes with a five-hour shadow that he scrapes. It is implied that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind their husbands, Darryl, back. Oh, yes, this is hilarious. As a criminal master, 'Little Man' is the stupidest of planet Earth. He hides a stolen stone that is huge in a woman's purse and then has to chase it. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best phrase: "I'm surrounded by idiots." Based, without credit, on a drawing by Chuck Jones, Baby Buggy Bunny. This is too stupid to even be remotely funny. One clue as to how bad this movie is Damon Wayans appeared in Jay Leno the other night before the BAT awards and he did not even mention this terrible movie. When will Hollywood stop the Wayans Brothers' green light trash? When they overcame the white man's guilt in all likelihood.
