I watched this movie really late last night and usually, if it's late then I'm very indulgent with movies. Although I tried, I just could not handle this movie, it got worse and worse as the movie continued. Although I know it's a comedy, but I did not find it very funny. It was also a particularly unrealistic and tiring portrait of rural life. If that's what you think life in the country is, it definitely is not. I have to agree that some of the cast members were cute, but the French guy was really fake. I have to agree that he tried to have a good lesson in history, but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 years old watch, it's too annoying.
