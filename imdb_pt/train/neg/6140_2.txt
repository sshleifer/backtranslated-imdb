This movie is hilarious. The problem is that it's not a comedy. A classic scene involves Kurt Thomas just happening to find a horse with handles in the middle of a village square (which he uses to beat the bandits.) Another is the journey to the "Village of the Fools". Too bad this movie was not meant to be a scam, or it may have gotten better reviews.
