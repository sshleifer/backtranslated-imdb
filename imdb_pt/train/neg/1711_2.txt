Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be bloody fun. That's what it is, without the fun. This movie is really stupid, is absent from any plot or character development, or any kind of plot. The basic problem with this movie is kills and gore. Basically, every kill seems EXACTLY the same. ZOmbies tearing someone apart. Yeah, fine, but you need some original kills too. I mean, it got really boring, each death looked exactly the same, filmed exactly the same way. That's what killed me. I love gore, and the blood in this movie did not do anything to me. It was just annoying. Without plot, just the same stupid scene repeatedly with a different person. I wanted to like this movie too. I love filming in gore video films ... like Redneck Zombies. But I could not fool myself. This movie has good points, but none of them are in the movie. I understand that many of the "zombies" helped with the flood and there were over 100 zombies, which is pretty cool as they involved so many people and helped the world. But overall, this is a terrible movie.
