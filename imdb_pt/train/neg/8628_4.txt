My 7 year old daughter loved it, as Disney executives figured she would do it. That's the problem with "Air Buddies". It's a strictly childish movie, full of carefully calculated cuteness, a politically correct moral couple and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded G rating. As a parent, or even 10 years old, you've seen it all before and did better before. Think "101 Dalmatians Find Home Alone" and you get the general idea. I am of the opinion that a good children's story is a good story, period. "Air Buddies", which is as original as recycled paper, does not meet this standard. It's not the worst video your kid can watch, but there are better megatons.
