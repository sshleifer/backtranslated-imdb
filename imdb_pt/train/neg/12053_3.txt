As always, this is an imprecise image of the homeless. TV told a lot of lies about beggars in the early 1990s and made them all look bad, and claimed that we all made over $ 100 a day, when $ 20-40 a day was much closer to reality. When someone passed by where I held a sign that offered to work, and offered me work, I actually went and accepted the job if I was physically able. And if I were offered the $ 100,000 I invested in prepaid fitness for at least 2 years, and kept the majority in the bank and still left me $ 10-20000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2- 5 cash games at casinos. I always win and I could win decent if I had a bankroll. instead, I make about $ 1000 a month and I'm playing at minimum buys because I do not want to risk losing everything. I was just homeless because I did not want to risk spending all my money and going broke, sometimes I had over $ 1000-2000 in my sock while I slept outside. Anyone who wants to talk to sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit that i was different from most homeless people because i never drank smoke or took drugs. I am no longer homeless, now I am living for $ 177 a month and receiving SSI and spending most of my time in online poker. Diverse mother and sunflower worked hard to get me SSI. Gladly that my days of hiding on the stage of the casino's convention center at night sleeping, worried about being picked up by security, are finally over. If this TV crew had chosen me, they would have spoken much earlier. It's a shame as they do not choose which ones they choose best.
