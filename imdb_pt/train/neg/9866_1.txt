You want to see Dead Gentlemen Productions' "The Gamers" movie. This is not the movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All the good comments here seem to be written by third parties (barely disguised). The people who made this movie seem to be trying to synthesize a false interest. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a mockumentary well done. Comparisons with "Spinal Tap" or Christopher Guest are insulting. <br /> <br /> The film is so stingy that I can not imagine anyone familiar with the subject who finds it funny. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are the one who is being satirized this way, you would have to hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The film is not offensive because of its quality. great satire of taboo topics, but because of its constant pathetic banality.
