The novelty of listening to Jay Leno with four letter words is the only memorable aspect of this misguided formula of police partners. In COLLISION CURSE, the pelican-faced comedian joins the late Pat Morita to track down a prototype of a stolen turbocharger (has the car lover Leno helped in the plot?). The two leaders try hard, they really do, but Leno is not an actor and Morita's water fishing routine ages quickly. The film carries a bit of cheeky appeal from the 80s, but its moments of value become increasingly scarce as it fills its long 100 minute run time. Fans of Leno's handsome comedic talents will be disappointed; everyone will be bored.
