This was a disappointing movie. People seem to have no substance, the main protagonist, Martin Cahil, has zero redemptive values, in fact, everyone, including Jon Voight, synthesizes the sleeze. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Violence is unpleasant, though artistically made. The footage is black, at least the impression I saw in this category. A disappointment.
