I made some comments about IMDb and this movie is the one in which I've never seen the whole movie. It was so stupidly stupid and bland that I just could not bear it-though I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and any Mel Brooks movie that I call "Honey quotient". In other words, the better the movie, the less you see in the movie. Think about it - The Producers and Young Frankenstein were great movies and he was hardly in them. BUT, movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are filled with Mel and are very doped movies (yes, I DID NOT LIKE Space Balls - but this is not the place to talk about it). <br /> <br /> Second, in addition to cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can not think of a less funny topic than the lack of housing. This is just a comedy breaker. Think about it, people. The most entertaining scene (?) In the movie has Honey making whoopee with Leslie Ann Warren in a bin !! And this is funny in what way?
