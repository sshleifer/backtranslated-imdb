The spoilers of this review are offered as a public service because the only way to enjoy this fantasy melodrama is to know that our protagonist, Lady Barbara Skelton, is raped and shot dead in the end. And not a little too soon. I would have shot the screen myself, but I was afraid to hit James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel, "The Life and Death of Mrs. Evil Skelton" (I think people did not). lament about spoilers at that time), was written by a woman, an English Navy brat who was either troublesome or cynical or both. Your heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things matter, like the fact that Lady Barbara's immediate and unique response to someone's trouble is homicide. She kills three men in five attempts. A serial femme fatale, she has a case of dissocial personality disorder she should have done in Bedlam or Newgate. Lockwood portrays her as a narcissistic vampire, wearing so much makeup that I thought of her as a Joan Rivers of the Restoration era (or an era of restoration Joan Rivers, ha!). Yet Lady B. is irresistible to all three major male characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, all do a good job, as does Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers realize in a short time what a psychotic witch is, but the plot keeps everyone in their orbit until one of them finally detonates her - accidentally, in what is to be irony or just desserts. Given the dramatic scene of death with a boom lifting the camera through the windows and into the sky, I presume we are meant to give a damn for her death. But hers is the first corpse we do not care about.
