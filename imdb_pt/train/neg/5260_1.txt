Normally, I have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that leaves you thinking about figuring out what really happened, when it's done on purpose ... <br /> <br /> But this movie really looks like they have all but the last 15 minutes finished, so I realized they had $ 5 to finish on ... <br /> <br /> I saw this on TBS ... I recommend you do not spend money on it either. If you watch TV, watch everyone but the last 15 minutes, then walk away and make your own ending in your mind. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie would have been better if they had just run away, and come back with the State Poice of Feds only to find out that the city and the car graveyard were gone, and apparently never been there .. . <br /> <br /> "I wish I had more thumbs so I could give that movie 4 thumbs down!"
