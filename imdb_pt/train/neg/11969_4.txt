If you like to have fun, do not go see this movie. If you like to see war heroics, do not go see this movie. If you like to see a good acting and an excellent script, do not go see this movie. If you enjoy typical Hollywood war movies that end well in time to give a public appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war, GO TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I am always interested in war films because I think if they are well done they can teach us something about the paradoxical and useless qualities of war. This film shows a bunch of young men running across the field, saying clich√©d phrases, doing things more predictably, and defending the oppressed with the same force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed. This movie is a disgrace to the movies and to the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or any other country and seeing this, being informed that this is what Americans really are? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, please do not waste your time on this piece of junk; if you need, wait and rent. 4/10
