This is a dry and barren feature filming in one of the most interesting events of World War II and in the history of the war behind the front line. The worst dramatic composition is worse on this film, since the plot to kill Hitler supposes to be a quite dramatic event. There is no development of character and the idea that Tom Cruise supposes that he is a high-ranking commander who questions his deepest thoughts about patriotism and betrayal is completely insane. I believe Mister Bin would play better. Overall, the film looks like a copy of the good German TV movie "Stauffenberg" of 2004, but it can not approach that film in relation to any aspect of the film. However, the film obviously gets its financial goal with the popcorn audience who appreciates the fast-humor and shallow blood values ​​of Hollywood art.
