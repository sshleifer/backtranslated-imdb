* spoliers * do not read anything else if you have not seen this movie yet * Lift up after the depressing "Phantasm II" is over; Tall Man kidnaps Mike while Reggie and the new boy Tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back, and do not end up as slaves on the Tall Man's "Red Planet." This one is really silly: the trio of thieves in the pink hearse was there just for comic relief, and the black karate girl (does not remember her name) was so annoying she could not wait to see if Man Alto killed your character. This looks almost as if it were the character of Tim, who arrives late and is the hero, but ... does not work that well. By the end of this story, Liz is beheaded by the murderous dwarves, Mike receives a silver ball implanted in his skull, the beads take Reggie and the dwarves catch Tim, and there is no one else to stop The Tall Man. The villain wins - now , how's that for a turnaround in the end? <br /> <br /> This was filmed in 1993 and was not released until 95, and the end of this was in the final season, and although it is disappointing and anticlimactic, it was also an appropriate and fitting end to this strange little series. But the room changes this ending and adds nothing more than bad jokes, and an even worse and meaningless ending ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
