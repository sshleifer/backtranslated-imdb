If there was a ZERO rating, I would give this movie. Today was the second time I tried to watch it and I still have not been able to go from beginning to end. I can not believe the multiple stars given by others and I can only assume they know the actors or are advertisers in disguise! The acting is atrocious everywhere, the script is blah, the boy who plays Nichole shows zero emotion even when she's being threatened. The "southern" accent of the actress who plays Amber's mother is laughable - I'm from Georgia and I have friends from Texas - believe me NOBODY speaks like that! None of his emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
