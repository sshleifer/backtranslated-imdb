Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments about this movie should be receiving royalties. This is a horrible movie in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a comedy / slasher video. They would get a D for that. The college kids would get an F or be asked to leave school. Since this monstrosity was made by "Pros", I believe there should be time for arrest or at least a movie ordeal. I like to watch bad movies like "Plan 9 From Outer Space", but this thing does not even fall into that category. The script, acting, sound and direction are so bad that they are virtually impossible to access. If you like watching bad movies that are fun to stay with Ed Wood, blaxploitation, or horror movies from the 1970s. After seeing this, you have the feeling that you lost an hour and a half of your life.
