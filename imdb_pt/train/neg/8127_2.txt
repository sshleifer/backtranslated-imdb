Currently, this movie is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst movie ever made - which is exactly why I rented it from NetFlix. However, I am sad to report that the film, though bad, is not bad enough to merit being on the list of the 100 most recent films ever made. I've personally seen at least 100 movies worse than this one. Hardly a brilliant endorsement, but simply did not reach the expected level of horribleness to be included in this infamous list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their late honeymoon (by the way, they are married in real life too). He is a doctor obsessed with bats and insists that they go to a nearby cave. Once there, they behave very, very, very stupidly (trademark of a bad movie) and are soon bitten by a bat. According to this movie, bats like to attack people and there are vampire bats in the US - both are not true. <br /> <br /> Strangely, after being bitten, the man does not even bother. going to the hospital !! The first thing in someone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical help right away, but not this breast. Soon he is having convulsions - but he is still not interested in seeking help! Again and again you continue to think that this must be the most stupid couple in movie history! <br /> <br /> After a while, he finally goes to the doctor and is sent to the hospital. But then it is too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins to kill people to suck his blood. When it is quite obvious to everyone that the man is a mad murderer, the wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for a brain) refuses to believe that it is dangerous - even after attacking people, steals an ambulance and directs Police car off the road !! <br /> <br /> Now, most of the time, Moss is going through these episodes, his eyes flip over and he looks like a normal person. Strangely, however, sometimes he develops bat hands and, in the end, used some nice prosthetics to make him look like a bat. If this had been really extravagant, the movie would have deserved a 1. In the end, in a twist that hardly made any sense, the wife inexplicably turned into a mad lady of bat and had a swarm of bats kills the evil sheriff. How all this was organized was a mystery, just as Moss and McAndrew believed that this movie would somehow help their careers - though both have had reasonably long careers on TV since 1974. Too dumb. The plot is silly and does not make sense and depends heavily on people who act too stupid to be real. It's not a good movie, but it's also not among the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> NOTE: For some reason, IMDb shows the chart for the three IT'S ALIVE DVDs and their two sequels to the series. web page for THE BAT PEOPLE. While THE BAT PEOPLE was seen with the title "It's Alive", the two films are unrelated. It's easy to understand the mistake - especially since the two left in 1974, but the movie I just reviewed starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starring John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
