With these people pretending so much, using old images and using gas to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a set created with actors, what to believe? The old country film is good, but the abuse and degradation of the native animals is painful to watch in these films. I know, racism is good in these old movies, but there's more for this couple to lose credibility. Portrayed like pamphlets, they never flew from their planes, Martin Johnson was a former vaudevillian, used friends like Jack London to make financial gains while robbing them of royalties, denying his wife's apparent depression, using it as a cute prop, all this makes these movies unbearable. They were not the first to travel to these lands, nor the first to write about them. He was fine as a filmmaker and photographer, but that's about it.
