I can not believe I really sat through the whole thing. This movie has the worst performance since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here's a brief summary of the plot: The movie begins with Jojo and that other girl sitting on the beach, drooling on a thin, blond-haired beach. "hunk", it looks like he was not going to the gym one day in his life. Somehow, everyone knows him, and every girl in the movie wants him. Uh OH! Here comes the competition! The stereotypical "sexy girl" and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. Soon we discovered that Jojo's mother got a job in Australia, which meant Jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, I think I'm going to cry). A huge storm comes and fills your pool with unpleasant water. Somehow, for no apparent reason, the little girl falls into the pool, and comes face to face with, yes, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This is where "history" really takes off. Basically, they want the mermaid to fall in love with the "piece." <br /> <br /> This is a pre-teen movie with such a bad acting that makes the 80's look like the pinnacle of Oscar-winning performances. This movie has all the possible cliches ... the best friends, the "hunk" that everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and their evil friends, the scary old man ... his name is in there. I took one to many people watching this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes as a sacrifice to you. Please do not watch this movie. Do not do it, so I suffered in vain.
