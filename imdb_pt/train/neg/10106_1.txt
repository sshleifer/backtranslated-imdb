Yes, I'm sure it could really be a nation. . . if four of them were in the four corners of the world and the other two were cloned a few billion times. Dude, I'm really glad I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of George Romero's movies and I'm sure if he saw this movie, he'd probably be sick while laughing too hard. I mean, what was with the racoon girls posing like zombies and walking like Charlie's devil? It also greatly helped the composer to choose the fashion show for when the zombies approached the killer, especially the part where they go to the depot, posing as a furniture store / police station / apartment / apartment / any room that was the gong in the background, and the living woman was arguing about the closed furniture store. I could not even tell what nationality the killer was, and the fact that his accent indicated that several nations did not help either. Oh, well, what can I expect from a movie in which they play in a random fight scene without good reason in a warehouse where apparently they send air boxes around the world. So for all those who adore the Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you like to hear bad movies in C (C for Craptastic) then this is the movie for you. . . or not.
