Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything that Brookmyres' first novel had. Everything beyond history, laughter, black humor, political intrigue, characterizations, plot and some semblance of meaning. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from beginning to end. They mocked the plot, had a romance between Parablane and a cop, and what was all this, Dr. Slaughter was portrayed as a bystander, and who the hell was Annette Crosby supposed to be? <br /> <br /> It seemed that they had made a three hour adjustment, then cut to 90 minutes. (Even if the 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please, please do not do this with any other Brookmyres book (especially "Country of the blind").
