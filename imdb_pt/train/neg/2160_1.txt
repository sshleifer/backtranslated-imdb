Gods ... where to begin. I was only able to swallow the first 10 minutes before turning it off in disgust. In addition to the actor who played Robin Hood, the rest was simply terrible. And I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief so far. Since the opening of the first episode, I have lost count of how many mistakes, plots and horrible fantasies there were. It started with some poor peasant trying to hunt a deer to feed his family. Alright and well. However, the poor warrior must have been deaf, because a handful of soldiers, in full armor, on horseback, was able to sneak into him within about 10 feet. <br /> <br /> So as he is running away he will have them 10 feet behind him for a shot where you can not even see them, immediately followed by them about 20 yards behind him again . Then he runs into some bushes, and is immediately abused by two of the soldiers ... who only seconds before were galloping on horseback, dozens of feet behind him. The "armor" on the soldiers is so painfully obviously the cloth that they tried to make it look like maille, and miserably failed. Not to mention, the "armor" of the main soldier is about 5 times larger than the poor. Seriously, it looks like he's a little kid wearing his father's armor! Finally, Robin manages to shoot about 5 perfectly pointed shots around a soldier's hand in the space of about 2 seconds, from what appears to be a recurved bow. No living human could do these types of shots, in that short space of time, with a rifle with aim, much less a bow. <br /> <br /> After that, they escape from the soldiers and stop to help an incredibly well-dressed woman. and clean "peasant" with digging a ditch ... something that all the nobles were willing to do all the time, right? As this sorry excuse for a series having a second season is beyond me. The production costs (at least for what I saw) must have gone up in the tens of dollars (or euros) ... Seriously - I think a school theater class could have a better interpretation. That was so bad, even though Kevin Costner's terrible Robin Hood version was better. <br /> <br /> I suggest you skip this monstrosity and go rent or buy the "Robin of Sherwood" series of the 80s. Much better written, acted, costumed and produced. <br /> <br /> For shame, BBC ... for shame ...
