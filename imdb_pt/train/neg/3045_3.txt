Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" I bought at Walgreens for a whole big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a stupidly lost dollar. <br /> <br /> Scenery and costumes quite incredible. Apparently a lot of thought and effort was made. The designs of the ensemble are very Mexican in stylization. I really liked them. And Santa Claus is awesome. One of the most impressive Santas on the move. <br /> <br /> I'm guessing that the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and joyful for a children's audience. But somehow you're in a lot of clutter. In fact, I was struck by how disturbed he is. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the dubbing in English that makes it look so disturbed and bizarre. One of the reasons I prefer to try movies in the original language in which they were made and the use of English subtitles as dubbing usually creates an unwanted strangeness. The boys' voices were at least dubbed the real voices of boys, unlike women pretending to be children, which tends to sound very, very strange. <br /> <br /> Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing doing? ballet in your longjohns? You did not? Nor did I even watch this movie. One learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth watching? Now, this is a tossup. I can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it is quite disturbing in its own bizarre way. However, its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching. You decide what to do. I do not know ... to me, it made me feel uncomfortable watching demons constantly making cute ballet moves. Now, this is wrong ...
