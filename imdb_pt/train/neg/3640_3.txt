I had no prior knowledge of this movie before buying it but it sounded cool and I was wanting to see a really ass Viking movie for some time now ... oh, this movie was not what I was looking for. I expected the best but instead delivered a boring Nordic novel that seemed to drag on for a long time, despite its 84 minutes in length. The premise of the film is quite intriguing: it is a Viking warrior who defies his God and Odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord's son, named Barek, to death and rebirth as a Berserker. This Barek guy is then forced to live enraged, insane and violent life after life. The film is filmed with sufficient competence, with some cinematic and almost good performances of the actors, but again, I found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end. The filmmakers had the chance to do something quite fun and semi-exclusive, but they dropped the ball. Maybe it could have been improved with some cheap farm tactics, like free nudity and lots of blood ... I mean, we're talking about Berserkers here, are not we? The Vikings should be BAD enough, with all the rapes and looting, so the Berserkers should not be even more extreme? All in all, unless you're a fan of The Young and Restless (etc ...) or, really, be yourself, an insane Berserker who likes self-torture, I'd probably avoid that piece of celluloid.
