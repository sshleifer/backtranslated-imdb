I am a dumber person to rent the DVD REDLINE. Chicago Pictures, who made this film stupid, never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automotive sites, including mine, which has a ALEXA 16K rating. They tricked me about the deal and now I'm out of $ 16,000 and they've lost a lot of my personal time (peter rapport from Palisades Media) you know who you are! <br /> <br /> Please do not rent or buy this movie !!! It sucks and the people behind it are fake performers. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a roster of losers and poor actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
