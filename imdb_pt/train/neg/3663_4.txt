The Spanish horror icon, Paul Naschy, is one of his weaker werewolf movies ... but bear with me for a moment. Most people will be familiar with this under the most common TV title, The Fury of the Wolf Man, and there have been many versions of home videos over the years. If you want to be serious about giving a fair chance, the most viable issue I've ever seen is the title THE MAN WOLF NEVER SLEEPS, and it's an unedited and complete European version that restores some disturbing scenes and contains the original nude photos that are missing in the FURY print. It is also letterboxed. Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet only to discover that he contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife was having an affair. He cares for her and her lover while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy doctor and her female assistant. Apparently the doctor tries to "tame" the werewolf, and there is a strange scene of sadomasochistic love between her and Daninsky, who is under her trance, at least in the original version. Ultimately, we have two werewolves for the price of one as Daninsky battles a wolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film is that the director (according to Naschy's claims) was often drunk, and the results are really incoherent. When watching WOLF MAN NEVER sleeps copy, it is not so difficult to find out what is happening, although the edition remains atrocious in some points. Worst of all is the non-corresponding occasional filming of the voracious Naschy werewolf taken directly from another previous film (LA MARC DEL MAN WOLF, also known as "THE BLOODY TERROR OF FRANKENSTEIN") and mixed with it for no sensible reason! The wolf's clothing changes from black shirt to white and vice versa, as well as his behavior; In a moment, the wolf is walking around, lethargic, in a hypnotic trance from FURY, then he is growling and running wildly from BLOODY TERROR. Really bizarre.
