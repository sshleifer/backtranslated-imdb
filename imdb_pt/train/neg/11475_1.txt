A movie that makes you want to play in a sword. I saw schlock in my time, but after seeing the miserable mess I do not think I can watch another movie again. May God have mercy on the souls who did this. <br /> <br /> Quiet stallion Premise-Ex-Army, model character of underwear model (well represented actually) will look for the girl who sent him a Christmas card while serving in the military. It comes on the scene with its granola-type family and cabin life who are right-timers. The family takes him and it takes 2 hours of our time for the girl to see that he is better than her liberal appearance, drink French wine, drive porsche, talk loud, lazy, city walk, a Jewish groom. <Br /> <br /> The Bad-1d characters, 1d themes. Be hit in the head with the pro-military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> Good trade breaks were long. Peter Jason. Ended.
