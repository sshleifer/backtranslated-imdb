This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is so full of holes, that the story is like a bad remake of a thriller and the actors It seems who were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time. Worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He interprets his character as if he were in "Police Academy" - the same silly womanizer - and this is not suitable for a protagonist in what should have been a thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that Hanson would make "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague ...
