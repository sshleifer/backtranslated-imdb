This movie appeared on local TV here in South Africa recently and I thought I would warn even those who like watching bad B movies (which I do) that this is not at all fun. The plot relates to a couple visiting a home in the country. Some strangers appear and ... The problem is that most of the film, obviously filmed in the early seventies, consists of extreme images of people walking, real-time and very slowly, from A to B. This makes the movie tedious . in the extreme and the expected return of blood and blood never happens. I'm really curious - how many people actually watched this from start to finish?
