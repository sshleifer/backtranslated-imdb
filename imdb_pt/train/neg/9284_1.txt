Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie. This movie does not have enough plan for half an hour, but they managed to prolong it by an eternity of more than one hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are very good, especially in these exaggerated fight scenes, but things like The Legend of Fai Sai Yuk is much better than this sad thing that would be better left undone.
