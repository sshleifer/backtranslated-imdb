Act is horrible. This movie makes the film Fast and Furious look like an award-winning movie by the academy. They throw some breasts and asses in there to try to keep you interested, despite the EXTREMELY faint and distant story. There is a reason why people on the internet do not even download this movie. This movie sank like an iron shit. Do not waste your time renting or lowering it. This movie is and always will be a PERMA-TURD. I'm dumber now for watching. In fact, this title should be referred to as "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Calling this movie is a farce and an insult. abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent abhorrent repulsive, revolting, scandalous, scary, shameful, shocking, sick, terrible, terrifying, impious, profane, cruel
