I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and House, MD .. Tucci's character is brilliant, but socially inept by choice, similar to Laurie's character, House, but without the biting humor that Laurie brings to Casa, Lar. Meanwhile, Tucci's "straight guy", the emphatic Dr. Seger, does not develop into a more interesting character, such as the fake "straight" Cuddy and Wilson. The character of Indira Varma, Adrienne Holland, is very similar to that of the doctor of Jennifer Morrison, Cameron, to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Someone on CBS obviously noticed the success of House, MD, and told his team to take it similar show, hoping mimicry would be successful. However, copying a show like House requires the same balance of humor and suspense, and Tucci and company are not up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> I did not know the show was canceled until I read the comments on IMDb, but it does not come as a surprise to me.
