This movie had so much promise !! What a great idea, a paintball team that is fighting for recognition and personal glory, only to lose speed due to bad dialogue, bad editing and a semi-written story. The characters at the beginning were interesting, only to lose their strength in the middle of the road to become one-dimensional people spitting tired cannons. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spent more time in history and dialogue, they would have been a great film, rather than an almost late effort.
