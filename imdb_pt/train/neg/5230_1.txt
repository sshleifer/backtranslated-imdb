Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. Your movies are asinine and amateur, and not very funny, unless you're 14 and have an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /> <br /> He's certainly not famous, as immature fans would like you to believe, harass people on Wikipedia, or fill the ratings votes here on IMDb. He has certainly not been profiled by any major media, who talks a lot about the fame of his and his creation. <br /> <br /> Benfer has a bit of limited animation ability, but he needs to stay away from his youth. sycophants and learning to write some funny material before he is taken seriously as a real artist. From this moment, though, he's just a kid with a camera, and it shows.
