Isabel Allende's magical and lyrical romance over three generations of an aristocratic South American family was vandalized. The nightmare of a film that resulted - largely due to a magnificent cast of Anglo actors completely unable to carry the Allies' evasive Latin melody, and a bored Scandinavian hand - was so uncomfortable on their own skin that I returned. to the theater a second time to make sure I had not lost something vital that could change my mind. To my disappointment, I have not lost anything. None of Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave were able to break free from the trap set by director Bille August. They all seemed perfectly rigid and resigned, as if, endeavoring as little as possible, they hoped to fade into lovely period settings. (Yes, the film was directed by art within an inch of its life.) Curious that the production designer had a chance to place KFC products prominently in a scene that dates back to 1970 - years before KFC's emergence. At that time, it was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even forgiving this, what the hell is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food networks did not hit South America until the early 1980s. "The House of Spirits" should have been the 1993 film event. Because it was so refined and servilely faithful to its vague idea of ​​what the novel represented , Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was neither an event nor an art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have been accused of rape.
