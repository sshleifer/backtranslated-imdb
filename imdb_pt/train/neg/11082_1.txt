I know it's a Power-Rangers trick and it catered to 7-year-olds, but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie? If they will write a plot with wax chalk, at least take the decency to make it silly. It's kind of funny if you watch this. We have a typical family full of clich√©d characters (the father of a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself for LOLOL), children who try hard to fill the stereotype, but they do not succeed with horrendous acting, and a ridiculously horrible helper who is not good for anything. to the film, but to fill the camera space. Funny things! <br /> <br /> However, the real great moment comes near the end, when the father of war and the villain of bad conduct try to make a sword fight, but then realize that none of them knows how (probably because there is room in the budget for the choreographers) then they come up with this type of American Gladiator setup to run around. LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10 rating because they try to treat this seriously.
