I am partially a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "partly" because most of his films fit into two categories: bright and boring. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the later category. <br /> <br /> This film suffers from the same fundamental problems of Miyazaki's recent film, "Howl's Moving Castle." An intriguing premise is created, but immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it. <br /> <br /> The first third of the movie reveals the post apocalyptic world, the story takes place and, indeed, it seems that a very interesting story is about to unfold. From then things go down the hill. The central part of the film consists mainly of veiled eco-propaganda, and the ending is strongly marked by reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism that spoils a large number of Japanese animated films. <br /> <br /> In general the movie looks like someone ripped off all the other pages of the script before passing it on to the animators. What remains is something that is visually striking (although unfortunately the version I saw was a generation X copy, with little color - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows his bare butt when flying), but does little sense finally made me confused.
