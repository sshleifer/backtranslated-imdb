LAMPOON NATIONAL CLASS MEETING was a failure when it was released. There was not much time in the theaters of my big city. Because? Because it is bad !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way, but bad in a very painfully unfunny way. The entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns and remained unknown after this turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is really great (a parody of horror movies), but the execution is extremely needy in all respects. <br /> <br /> Avoid this "comedy". Your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond to watch this embarrassing misfire.
