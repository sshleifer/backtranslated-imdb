DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE LOVED THE CLASSICS, LIKE TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER AND BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE DISSAPPOINT YOU EVIL! First of all, this movie starts with Bo and Luke running moonlight to Jesse. Bo and Luke would not do that in the real show! This movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and respectful of the law. In this film, he is a criminal who is moonlighting and smoking marijuana with the governor of Georgia. Also, if this was an extension adding to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have a question: how could Uncle Jesse do maenosine when he died before the damn Hudson in the Hollywood movie? AND HOW IS THE CHIEF HOGG LIVE WHEN HE DIE BEFORE THE MEETING FILM IN 1997! FILM AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? Does it seem magical that these characters have come back to life, when they are dead for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family film with the original live characters who made the show the which was and still is compared to this disgusting and disgraceful movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, buy the original series, or go to walmart.com and buy the DVD of 2 that includes Reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! Both are stars of the original cast, and are familiar! Do not waste time on a movie that is not worth the CD it is written on!
