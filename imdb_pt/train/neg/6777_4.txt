Although I recently took a positive look at OPERATION PETTICOAT, I really did not like this movie, despite having so many similarities. Both were made only a few separate years, both starring Cary Grant and both were World War II comedies. However, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME, in general, seemed like a cheaper film - with little writing, little energy and some very large performances - even when compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think at least much of the blame for this is in launching Jayne Mansfield. The combination of his ample talents and limited acting ability really made this budget movie A seem to have come out of a third-class studio. Also, there was not much chemistry or energy in pairing it with Cary Grant - an actor usually loved for his grace and class. It's like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
