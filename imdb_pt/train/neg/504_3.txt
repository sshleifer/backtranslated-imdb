A particularly evil example of Italian cult cinema with a meaningless title to cast (if so, the alternative MARK OF Satan is even less relevant to the plot!), This hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a heavy dose of Erotic) creates a kind of flat atmosphere everywhere ?? really combined with the handling that is downright terrible! Here we have the usual group of people (a troupe of actors) stranded on an island (for which they have been invited by a count) since he fell in love with the protagonist, an ally of the missing wife! The characters are basically stereotypes: middle-aged, but bold hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history has more than his share of violent tragedy), demure heroine, companion (remembering Mae West and emerging the most annoying of Much!), A tame but dedicated stage manager (always reprimanded by one and all for his unmanly behavior!), A lesbian couple, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who, for once, comes into action, you know what I mean), an envious housekeeper (nominal star Femi Benussi though, so it's worth it, this is really a joint piece), a religious fanatic for a butler, an impressionable chambermaid, etc. While the film is not of any unwatchable meaning, atrocious dubbing, snail rhythm, poor quality production (with scenes depicting the raging sea raised from some black-and-white film!) and the fact that murders only occur within half an hour of completion do not help at all. Moreover, Marcello Giombini's score, though agreeable by itself, seems incongruously modern under the circumstances; That being said, the revelation is surprisingly elaborate (considering there is certainly no shortage of suspects here).
