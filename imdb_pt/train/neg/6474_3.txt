This was the first sequel I've seen (in addition to Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought before watching that it would be close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot was basically the first script with some extra characters and the situation changed. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not satisfied with life on land. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her and when Melody finds out she is upset and angry. And she decides to flee, and she becomes a mermaid. Then she is happily swimming around, and Ariel goes looking for her - like a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story does not look too bad written, but the cliches and replays of situations from the first film are just too obvious. And adding to the fact that Melody is overall extremely annoying, and the film becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There are also a lot of other new characters - Tip and Dash being two of them. They are not too bad as characters in themselves - just try not to think about Timon or Pumba! The songs leave a lot to be desired as well, they just do not have the same magic energy as the original songs. The animation, too, obviously did not have the full workload - in parts it is hectic, and little imagination is used for the movements of the characters. <br /> <br /> Another tip - try to forget Ariel's original character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious and curious teenager "grew up" in a boring, boring mother and mother, and her characteristic red hair is all tied up. This is much better seen if you have never seen the original - you will have nothing to compare it to. <br /> <br /> However, after all, it could have been worse - not as bad as certain other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original. But for your collection, if nothing else, but if Disney continues like this, they will lose all their older fans.
