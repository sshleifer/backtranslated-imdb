Before the release of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly had much better table manners in the old days. But does social etiquette neglect the emotions that these early zombies offer to the public that goes to the movies? Judging by this movie, absolutely none. <br /> <br /> The story is about an expedition to Cambodia, whose goal is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication. One of the parties discovers the secrets on their own and begins building their army of zombies. <br /> <br /> This film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But since this is a 1930s movie, these zombies are more like somnambulists than the carnivorous variety we think of today. They seem to respond to mind control, rather than insatiable appetites. And frankly, the "revolt" is a little disappointing as well. The whole thing is really boring. Apart from the lack of horror, there is no exaggerated melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this could have provided much entertainment until 70 years ago. See if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title, but otherwise I advise skipping this.
