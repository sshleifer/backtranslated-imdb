It is considered fashionable to highlight all social evil as a result of patriarchy and male domination, however idiotic this illogical "logic" may be. However, within the story and theme of the film, there is no gray area and the woman who should be called the film's antagonist is the '' villain of the story. '' Under no circumstances what she did was justified. Women's sexuality is just hype in this case, and has nothing to do with the actuality. It's final-type betrayal. The man ended up wasting his resources and time wasting on the sons of another man. To conclude, the weakest of the arguments raised by the 3 female characters 'liberated' at the climax is pathetic. A woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and, worse, there are no other children. So, in essence, his life was wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the unjust.
