THIS MOVIE IS LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It takes a lot to exaggerate about a movie, but this movie sucks at my house !! I have not even finished the movie yet and had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is. I never did it !! As a consumer, do not waste your money on this movie. Wait until it comes out on a cable channel or something. It's just decent TV. I really hate LAUNCHING A MOVIE, BUT THIS MOVIE IS TRASH! Almost above pornography. Must have and X rating! Good plot, some frontal nudity (if that floats your boat), but HORRIBLE at the high school level. I do not know how this movie got distributed. (Must have been a contractual thing.) Really, if you really enjoy watching good movies, do not waste time on this movie. From one movie lover to another. YOU WILL BE CRAZY ON YOURSELF! Let me say that too, if you've ever been through something like this, maybe you can relate and that will have some value to you. In that case, say watch, you can take some of this, if not just see something that happened to you being represented by another person (has therapeutic value).
