Two years ago, at Sundance, I loved Josh Kornbluth's debut show, the Haiku Tunnel. So I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent collaborator) Jacob's, the best thief in the world. This is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower-class New York area. The film is not without its pungent moments. But sometimes it's as if Kornbluth was working too hard to assert the obvious: life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> More subtle, and more important, is our understanding that, despite all these somewhat abhorrent cultural bases and the antisocial behavior they can generate, these characters have no shortage of resources . kindness and humanity. We may retreat into your language and your living conditions, but we can not rule out your intention. And, in fact, their struggles to keep a family under such adversity have a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood, and his compassion for the people is evident in every respect. <br /> <br /> That said, The Best Thief in the World suffers from many painful failures (including the title). The characters are not very believable. The writing is uneven. And the plot is barely perceptible. And for many, the most disturbing thing is that Kornbluth uses two black boys imitating gangsta rap between scenes. For each one: Although I do not question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it hurts me to see five-year-olds talking about sex with a selection of women. It is an unnecessary shock value and is a bit forced of interest borrowed.
