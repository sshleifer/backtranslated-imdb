This movie was sold for a dollar at Wal-Mart on a DVD and so I do not feel like I missed anything by watching this movie except my TIME. He appreciated the performance of Tom Hanks, (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young and gave an excellent performance considering it was a horrible script. The story is about university students who have decided to play the Mazes & Monsters game, only in a very realistic setting. Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game in other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a really cool girl and has a romantic romance with her and once he starts playing, he stops making love to her and acts like a Monk. There are some scenes in the movie that are taken around the old World Trade Center and also on the observation floor and roof area. It's quite sad to see this part of the movie where so many humans have died because of evil in the world. This is not a very good movie except for Tom Hanks trying to keep the movie above the entertainment level.
