This was a good attempt at something, but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above your low-budget pitfalls. The use of virtual sets almost works, but at some points it fails miserably. They made good use of the small budget I think. I just wanted the story and most of the acting to be better. There are many parts where you see what they were looking at and it would be great if they really hit those marks, but they do not make it right. Confused and unbelievable story. Bad DVD transfer too. It does not take much for me to watch a movie at one time. This I had to turn off. It was very boring. I can make slow movies. But just make them attractive in some respect. Visually, in terms of history, acting, etc. This was missing in every department, so it has never been an engaging experience. Maybe the next filmmaker's attempt is better.
