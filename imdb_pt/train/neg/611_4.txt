Okay, 'liking' is a fairly relative term, but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of the caliber of James Glickenhaus. <br /> <br /> McBain is really one of the most ridiculous, over the top. action movies I've seen, without the nasty edge of Terminator. Other critics commented on the suspension of disbelief over the heroic commands of the average age of the film, but what about making a film in the Philippines that goes on in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact, the only character who seems remotely Hispanic is the good old Victor Argo, as the much outraged The President! Oh yeah, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso beating like a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing hymn to the glories of American imperialism.
