I am basing this on my observations of an episode I saw last night (09/27/06). I do not think I'll be watching again. The performance was all wooden, the plot completely predictable, the ending totally unrealistic - I mean, who would believe in a $ 30 million trial for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer? The lead actor (Victor Garber) looked so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role - maybe he realized how bad writing was! I fully understand that the drama offered this season is pretty bad, but they certainly can find better writers. Maybe they are outsourcing writing to India or China! I bet we will not see this next season!
