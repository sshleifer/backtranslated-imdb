A repressed housewife (Angie Dickinson, annoying and annoying), whose body double treats / horrifies us with a close close of her delicate, is sexually bored by her husband and decides to separate. This results directly in a series of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, clearly I'm in the wrong deal if she can take home $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you're going to watch De Palma boot up (sorry, "pay homage to") Hitchcock, watch "Sisters" instead. "Dressed to Kill", though loaded with style and technical skill, is one of the most difficult thrillers I've had the dislike of sitting down. The plot is absurd and tired. It features some surprisingly effective scare jumps and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan as long as they can go through the silly story that must have been dated back in 1980.
