Millie is a sap. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a son. She then picks him up by cheating on her and divorces him ... but lets him stay with the boy she says she loves. At that time, in the early 1930s, she would be entitled to a large child and spousal support, but it would make the guy incredibly easy ... no support ... damn it! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life looks pretty good, he turns out to be a cheater too! Wow, she has a hard time choosing men? As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she's a wild party girl - doing everything she can to distract herself from her bad luck. Suddenly, many years go by. Millie's daughter that she left at the beginning of the movie is now 17 years old and strangely the fashions have not changed at all. An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another bad man!) Now he's pretending to be his daughter's friend, but he has lewd drawings on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll kill him. Guess what happens next! <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a messy and often bizarre mess - a bit like "Madame X" but much less focused. Often Millie's motives and actions seem to make little sense. And the film seems to have a little bit of everything thrown into it - as long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs. Unusual, but not particularly good.
