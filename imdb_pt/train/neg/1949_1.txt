The animation seems to have been made in 30 seconds and looks more like caricatures than characters. I've been a Scooby Doo fan since the series premiered in 1969. I did not think much of Scooby Doo's animated films, (I'm talking about the TV series, not about the full movies), but some of them were really cool, and I like that most people find Scrappy Doo annoying, but this series is pure junk. As soon as I saw the animation, and I heard the characters, (and I use that term loosely) talk, I cringed. In addition, Mystery Inc. was a team, and without all the team complementing each other, it seems that opening a box of chocolates to find someone has eaten the best, and the only thing left is the one nobody wants. . What's new Scooby Doo was better than that. If you're going to have a Scooby Doo TV series, include the elements that made the series last so long. All the cast of characters and animation of quality. They need to put this back under the rock from where it came from.
