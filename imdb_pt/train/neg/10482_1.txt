One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How to define "worse"? I'd rather have the two eyeballs ripped out and then be forced to tap into them, than never see this pathetic drug again. Somehow, One-Hit Wonder Zwick directs a movie that simultaneously offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay salespeople, Las Vegas gays, FBI agents, and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a sloppy and enforced farce that deserves to be abandoned How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the rights to Elvis' real songs to be used in a movie with a central premise that appears to be "The Only Good Elvis Presley Imitator Is Dead" is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mutilated script: in 1958, the words and songs of Elvis that he would speak / play in the '70s are quoted! Worse special effect? That Oscar would go to the idiot who decided that Elvis's grave, potentially the most photographed / recognizable in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold disc glued to the top and situated in the middle of a park somewhere. Potentially, the biggest audience of this movie would be fans of Elvis. However, unbridled stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, not FBI credentials ... and I could go on and on) weakens this conventional wisdom. Ugh I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. This is really a horrible and horrible movie.
