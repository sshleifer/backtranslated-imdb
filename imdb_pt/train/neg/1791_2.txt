What's with the dark video at the beginning and sporadically during the movie? It is as if someone put muddy water on the camera lens. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity can alienate some people, but this, along with misinterpretation, is what makes a good cult movie, I suppose. My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin the Vampire, "Oh, your race is dumb." Okay, no one should ever say "ouch" in a movie line unless they are English and live in the 18th century. The performance of Van Helsing's character and the bad girl "Rally" does not it's bad. I also liked the Little Master played by Ron Little. Bad martial arts! Do not take it too seriously and you will like it.
