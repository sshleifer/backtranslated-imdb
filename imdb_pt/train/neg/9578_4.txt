Can A-Pix always do something right? This film was made to be seen on TV in letterbox format. Since A-Pix does not even believe in pan and scan, we see whole scenes where one shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks with one shoulder on the right side. Of course, not that you're losing too much. This movie is unbelievably bad. It's very difficult to enjoy a movie where the characters are screaming at the top of their lungs for 80% of the movie for no reason.
