When I sat down to this mediocre television, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this garbage? The film uses meaningless plots and planned to deliver trash to the homes of thousands of people. The film takes a political agenda to a new level. The film made no sense, and all credibility was lost for the excessive use of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this movie worth it, but in the end she needs to remember the old adage that you can not polish a dung. I hope you have not wasted your New Year's Day by watching another nonsense movie made for TV. Now I know why the networks started broadcasting series on Sunday night to get rid of the crap!
