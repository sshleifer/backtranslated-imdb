I have to say that I used to be a big fan of the show. The first 3 were great and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a pity, since this was a great series and it keeps getting worse. I know they are made for DVD movies, but some effort would be good. <br /> <br /> There are no laughs, just a few good one-liners who will bring a smile if that happens. There is a lot of nudity and very hot. But neither sexy things nor jokes really work. <br /> <br /> To add to all this, this is also a RACIST or racist movie of a movie that one can do without asking to be called a racist. I'm not one of those people who thinks everything should be politically correct. But the portrayal of minorities is very offensive. <br /> <br /> I would not waste time with this crap. See the previous versions, they will make you laugh not sick.
