Five through the eyes are not worth a pulse, I must admit that at one point I was really worried, for about 30 seconds no one made a noise and I thought my speakers had exploded or that I had been deaf to the constant screaming and loud screaming tone, me and the speakers are fine now, thanks for asking, interestingly that was the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I will not waste your time telling the plot, read the other comments If you bought this DVD but have not yet unwrapped it, No, take it back and demand your money back, I lost mine, Do not do the same. <br /> <br /> I was really screaming on TV "they're here in the car, look at the camera lights, and get the camera man first," I left the bad words out, but you can guess where they go <br /> <br /> If anyone wants to buy this movie (it's very good) it's yours for ten pounds.
