Yes, stupidity! I just watched and I still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too many unnecessary add-ons for a story, too many stupid characters (I presume they wanted to get comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... much of everything. It's a shame to ruin one of the divine stories of "Arabian Nights" like this. Childish, naive (both in a bad way) and with many magic-breaking mistakes, I do not think this could keep a five-year-old child for over ten minutes. Princess is lovely, but must be without language, because the actress does not know how to play a role. Rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. Shame the "good guy" is not better. Only the light in this dark is, of course, David Carradine, who is unfortunately going to be below his level with this, but at least keeps his actor / fighter skills to the top. I'm still sorry to see you in something like that, but happy to have something to watch throughout the riddle, so thank you David. Only, ONLY for him, I give this 2 stars for this fiasco ... I would give more for him, but this would increase the final score for the entire movie. The rest is so bad, I'd like, perhaps, to take note, but there's no lover here, and I think it would be too much.
