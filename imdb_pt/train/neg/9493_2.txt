This ridiculous movie offers the "hippie mentality" pattern of the 70s in a nutshell and bores us in the process. It is an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young and innocent women with sexual demons and laundering of the elderly. A naive young hippie played by the coupling (Kay Lenz) walks and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridicule (Holden), already in old age, drinking distilled drinks and being tormented as an actor, and she decides that she is in "love" with him. If you think it is superficial, the whole film encapsulates these scenes. She goes on to say how much she "loves" him and she only met him, he wears down and really fast. I could not help but laugh throughout the movie. Obviously she's just using it as a meal ticket, but the director is immature enough to think we're going to buy that there really is some love going on. A disgusting scene is when the two are naked and having sex, I had to move quickly because it almost inspired me to vomit. A tacky offer of music from the 70s also spreads through the film. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.
