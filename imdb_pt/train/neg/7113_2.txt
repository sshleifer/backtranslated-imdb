THE CRREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This movie has some cool opening credits (an offscreen storyteller warns that the patrons of the movie will receive a free burial if they die scared watching this movie, a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and daunting music omnipresent), but unfortunately the movie is everything from there. A widowed man takes his new wife to his secluded mansion ... admonishing his servants and friends that the new mrs. He has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in his past. Well, before long she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Your husband assures her that everything is just in his mind and ... well, you can probably see where all this is going. You will have discovered what is happening long before our unfortunate heroine ... because you have probably seen the same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and did better too). To add to the myriad of movie transgressions, most of the cuts in this movie (on several cheap DVD compilations) seem to be missing out on some key scenes. You see the heroine walking slowly toward the window ... she'll open it ... you know she'll see something scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene cuts her sobbing in her husband's arms. So what did she see ??? I think we'll never know
