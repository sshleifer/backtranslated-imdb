The ultimate goal of Big Brother, which we know what to think before we think about it, has been realized. Is it some kind of miracle, or sinister joke, that people wear straight vests of their own free will, twist themselves into contorted shapes and smile like monkeys? The movies, the art, do not risk the unknown anymore, but end up losing conclusions, without life. <br /> <br /> "The Notorious Bettie Page" is an insipid case story, suitable for a college feminism course. His lesson is schematic, straightforward, and linear: "See how women are objectified, exploited, abused, and then thrown into the garbage, by a male-dominated society." <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was supposed to have been the "fifties queen," for whom millions of men ejaculated. (All critics repeat this phrase, "Queen of the 1950s," like a monkey choir.) Her story as an American sex bomb is familiar: southerner, abused by her father, raped, etc. In this film she is a naive, an innocent unconscious of the lascivious interests that she serves and profits blatantly. Although she believes in Jesus, she likes to play nudity in front of a camera lens - only the door-to-door sex slaves who live together supposedly fantasize. <br /> <br /> From the mouth of writer-director Mary Harron, educated in Oxford and ex-punker (do you feel the combined rot of privilege and "hipness" as I do?): "I feel that without feminism, I would not be doing this ... I do not do feminist films, in the sense that I do not do anything ideological, but I think women get my movies better. "What a cozy clique. <br /> <br /> The film simply goes through the motions of telling the story of a human life, the subject and purpose were praised and buried well before the movie began. Mrs. Page has a boyfriend, but we are not shown nearly anything about their relationship. In fact, there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the film. <br /> <br /> You can not ignore its presumptuous simplicity. In New York, where Mrs. Page tries her best to fit in and appease a man's world by letting herself be tied to the ropes of slavery and firmly tied to S & M's black leather boots and bodices, the film is black and white. But in Miami, where she's going to get away from it all, takes off her clothes happily and is photographed by a "liberated" woman, the film turns into color. <br /> <br /> Like hell, Harron does not like it. "making feminist films" does not "make anything ideological." Ideology has become so internalized, so assumed, so programmed, that it is almost invisible. Big Brother must be smiling.
