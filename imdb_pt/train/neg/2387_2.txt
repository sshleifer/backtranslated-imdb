I could not believe how stupid and meaningless this was. Basically, there's nothing to laugh about in the movie, almost no scene for you to be interested in for the rest of the movie. This movie brought some huge stars, but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves must have had some acting classes a few years after that movie before he faced The Matrix. Uma Thurman seemed very simple and humble. Luckily I have this movie for a very low price because it certainly is not a movie to remember for any good reasons. I will not write anything about the history of the movie, but as you may know, it must be the most famous ride in all of America because of its huge thumb. I would give this movie a 2/10. Before watching this movie I was wondering why this movie only has a 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very disappointing movie. Do not buy it even if you see it for less than $ 5.
