When you get your hands on a British movie, you expect some kind of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this movie does the business. It is made by highly skilled artisans. That alone can give you a pleasant half an hour. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you really do not find anything. In addition to making you feel good and advocating a liberal view of the drug, there is really nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst in East Hollywood. In all English comfort, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty." Why did they make this movie? I do not have a clue other than making money, of course.
