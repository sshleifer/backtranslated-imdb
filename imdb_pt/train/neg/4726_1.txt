Yet another film about a self-centered, selfish, arrogant, insensitive, hateful, and self-destructive leadership character that we should be concerned about. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm very open to all sorts of things wall films that have as main character a strongly self-destructive character. What I object to is that there is so little background for this guy. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? If the script had dealt with it further, they might have managed to elicit some sympathy for it. As he is just an unpleasant character of hatred, not tragic, just hateful. <br /> <br /> After taking a lot of effort to make this guy as crazy and antisocial as possible and make his fate as dark as it is possible for the writer to have the courage to make a happy ending ... <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's there giving a good fight! Men! Do not waste your time.
