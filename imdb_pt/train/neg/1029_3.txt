My father is a Columbus fan and I always unlearned the show. I always express my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he keeps watching, though. That's your right as an American, I guess. But my senses were attuned to the series when I discovered that Spielberg had directed the first episode. It was then that I was thankful that my father bought this show that I really can not stand. I went through your DVD collection and put this thing in when I got home for a college visit. My view of the series as a whole was not influenced, but I gained respect for Spielberg, knowing that he started as most of the lower level directors. And that's to do little dribbles until the big fish shows up (take the pun, HA, HA.) Like Spielberg did. of what you would probably like, despite containing little of Peter Falk, I attribute this to the fact that this is the beginning of the series and no one knew where to go yet. .
