I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been affected, but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the DVD. I'm going to say that my initial motive for seeing this movie was Claire Forlani. Although it's fun to watch, I feel that it did not live up to my expectations that I've found in your other movies so far. I really was equally happy to see Arkin turn into a humorous performance. The other two actors I was not very familiar with so I can not compare their performance, but they were also quite nice. The acting is the only catchy quality of this movie in my opinion. The plot, while some might say slightly convincing, lacked direction. I feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. If you like any of these actors for good measure, then I recommend this movie, but otherwise leave it alone.
