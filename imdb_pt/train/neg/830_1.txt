I really do not understand all these positive reviews from users. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this movie. But I do not think it's her fault, but the directors. Somehow he managed to make everything seem artificial; his performance, the idea, the makeup, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I'm giving is just for the idea behind the movie, which was very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this bullshit, go watch a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
