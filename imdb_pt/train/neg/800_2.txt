In fact, this movie, made in 1999, has good production values. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There are not a lot of clowns running around exploding, hundreds of rounds, but never reaching meat. Also there are no fighter / accident with wild cars, where thousands of dollars of beautiful machines are uselessly destroyed. <br /> <br /> The interiors look relatively modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks good. Well, there's that high-tech computer room furnished with what looks like leftovers from a 1950s electronics lab. And pancake makeup on the corpses ripped me apart. Do not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dry pancake dough slathered on exposed skin. This supposedly supports the idea that bodies calcified - although how the virus would perform this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer). <br /> <br /> Ah, yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a horror movie I know of, but I can not. A computer virus that is transmitted through a television screen (or computer monitor) and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Gimme a break. Warp drives to "Star Trek" are one thing, but photons turn into viruses? This is so silly that the desired "scare factor" is not achievable. The movie could have used one of those dreadful dream sequences where the dead come to life, or a cat jumps out of the closet, or something, because the viral thingamajig is not doing it. <br /> <br /> Robert Wagner is supposed to have the same excuse to play in that inanity that Lord Oliver gave to some of his later, worthless places. He needed the money. No other comparison between the two should be interpreted, however.
