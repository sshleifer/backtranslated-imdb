This movie sucks. Something about a heatwave in some European country, complete rubbish. There is nothing for this movie. maybe 30 seconds of sex, but that's it. There's a really boring girl who rides people and really pisses me off. This movie is a complete eruption and you should not be subject to watch it. I regret it, it's very annoying. I would rate zero, but I can not. No body in your right mind should see this. I'm sure you'll completely regret what I did. How could they think of something so bad? Even the mysterious men were better. Mysterious men. That sucks. This movie was not worth doing. complete waste of time. The characters are very difficult to understand and I am very very very bored.
