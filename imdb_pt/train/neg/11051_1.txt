A terrible film containing a bunch of Canadian D-list actors who seem so embarrassed that they're on camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and forgettable. <br /> <br /> This movie is poorly written, poorly edited and misdirected. It is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he's given, but he's the one in this movie to do it - he really has a bad story and a script to work on. It's not even enough camp to be funny. <br /> <br /> I still have to see Van Pelleske act in a believable way, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with their nasal and tearful voice) confirm that we are in a lot in Toronto and not in a barge from Africa. <br /> <br /> Did not the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien costume? The fight between the blue lightning bolts and Pelleske's orange wicks of "magic" (for lack of a better word) is obviously the result of bad actors, without choreographer, covered with completely derived special effects. Was there even a director on the set or editing room of this disaster film (not the good guy)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... do not even waste your time on this, you'll regret it like I did. I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.
