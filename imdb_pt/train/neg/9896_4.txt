The version in DVD consists of two episodes, being the par√≠cide of Caesar the junction. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. So it is difficult for me to review this film in depth because I did not understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, the part is very difficult and I found that for a newcomer, Leonor Varela just plays well. She is strong, but also a companion of soul very supportive and affectionate. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and his novel is the main thing of the first episode. So it's not really a documentary, not a peplum, but a great love story. <br /> <br /> After parricide, a new lover comes (Marc-Antoine), but the taste is gone: we always remember the first love. So I found the second annoying episode and its tragic fate is not said powerfully. <br /> <br /> However, the production is luxurious: the scenarios are large, tastefully decorated; the exotic Moroccan live venue and the splendid closets. Producers have a lot of money, of course, but they do not spend anything on special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, Sphinx) that it's funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would very much like to hear in French or English to make a definite opinion on these two films.
