The most positive thing I can say about this local "comedy" production is that it is harmless. In fact, it is so extraordinarily dull that we wonder how many dozens of re-written by the committee were carried out to completely remove the personality. It's not witty, it's not fun, it's not insightful and it's not charming. It's just a serious, non-laughing progression of four losers who need to change their ways - and their attitudes toward women - to be able to participate in their best friend's marriage. With acting that would be insignificant for the society of local amateur playwrights, such a tirade would make a forty-three season of 'Allo' Allo look fresh, and jokes about watching decadent vegetables, Sione's wedding marked ten (yes 10) nominations in the NZ movie awards recently. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, someone saw sense and gained none.
