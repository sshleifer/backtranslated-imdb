The premise of this film is revealed in the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miraculous fabric that does not degrade. But the film can not move on. Instead, it works for 45 minutes, fiddling with a preamble before making the big breakthrough. Since the audience does not benefit much from seeing a genius kid imagining things, it's a strange choice: the movie was barred from attending any topic. Once the fabric is discovered, the film quickly establishes that both the bigwigs of industry and co-workers want the invention to be repressed, leaving the film with only two fragile motions; inventing the chemical and fleeing from the oppressors. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why anyone would describe this as comedy. The tone is not funny or comical. It is more like a serious social critique of the day: that capitalism distorts supply chains and production. This, in turn, prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, this is probably true, but without some playing around with an attitude towards that fact, the film is simply a serious argument. You will need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find anyone here. <br /> <br /> This is more like a British encounter with John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
