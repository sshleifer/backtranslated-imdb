The "Wrinkle in Time" series of books has been my favorite series since childhood. I have read and reread them more than I can count for the past 35 years. The characters, with all their virtues and defects, are close and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical and spiritual story I so love. To say that I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement. <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book (s), I imagine you will like the movie. The acting is acceptable, the special effects are well made for a TV movie, and the story is interesting. However, if you love books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said about the movie," I hoped it was bad, and it is. "<br /> < I, as another reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again to ward this movie out of my mind.
