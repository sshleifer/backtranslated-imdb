When a friend gave me a box of "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies!" I was understandably a bit wary. But since the item was a gift, I did not really pay much attention to my common sense. After all ... movies for free! So if they are a bit ropey. After much consideration, the Alien Intruder was the first of these films. Ironically, it was the first choice because she seemed the best in the group. All I can say is that if this is the best of them, I shudder to think how others are. <br /> <br /> On the surface, there were some good things going on. Four (count them!) Actors I was familiar with. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I told myself ... "Billy and Tracy were on a good scifi (Star Wars and Babylon 5 respectively) not to sign up for a turkey. Max is a veteran actor who has never managed to turn into a movie .... but not a very bad actor.A Jeff ... well ... he did good and bad for movies and TV. "I soon discovered that Jeff had decided to add" the ugly "to his movie repertoire. <br /> <br /> The first clue was in the opening scenes. Jeff clears his way through a scene of "I'm crazy" before finally killing himself. A fun cameo performance, really. Unfortunately, that is, without much exaggeration, the highlight of the film. He goes down the hill from there. <br /> <br /> Next, we have the mission commander (Williams) being sent to see what happened to Jeff and his busy staff picking out their new shipmates among the ranks of the mission. the criminal element. But this assortment is not so much the Dirty Dozen - more like the Unconvincing Foursome. In addition, one of the crims, a computer hacker, is shown in his cell working on a laptop. Is not that like letting a murderer run a gun shop in jail? Well, if you ask me <br /> <br /> When they finally get the effects they're really horrible. It looks like the spacecraft's model was knocked out one afternoon by some bored 8-year-old boy who had spare parts left over from his Airfix kits. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not stop there. While on the way to the area where Jeff's ship has disappeared, the criminal crew is rewarded for their good behavior by receiving virtual reality weekends, in which they satisfy their male fantasies. Okay, and the use of scenes from his fantasies serves as an introduction to the "alien threat" that begins to appear there. But did they have to drag him to a loooooong lot? Alien Intruder? Alien Boring, more like. <br /> <br /> Finally they arrive at the G-Sector and the alien presence causes them to fight each other for their affections until only good old Max is left. The end, in vein of truly optimistic trash film, suggests a sequel - as if! Also making an appearance in this movie is a character that I will dub "Sweatdroid". He was supposed to be an android, but apparently that fact was lost on the makeup team, which provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity. But do not worry, it's only there to compensate for the body count numbers at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, to be true, do very little in the film. They barely stay awake, the more they act. And, as I mentioned earlier, Jeff makes an early visit to the showers, so his manicure is not allowed to clarify much of the film. Max tries his best as well as some other cast members, but the film is simply too atrocious, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The only imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship's naming convention. They are all named after musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the film is tasteless and uninspired. Made in 1992, I thought, in the initial view, that it was one of the works of the '80s straight to the video. Looks like they even made bad movies in the 90s, it seems. <br /> <br /> It's best to avoid. Even as a beer and fries movie, this movie is bad, but at least you can advance it, I suppose.
