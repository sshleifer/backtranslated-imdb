The husband and wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were big stars in vaudeville, but they made few movies. As is the case with some other artists of their time (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice and Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible work for Fields and Seeley is the biopic on them, in which they are portrayed by other actors: 'Somebody Loves Me 'starring Betty Hutton and the unparalleled music and dance man Ralph Meeker. In its heyday, Fields and Seeley were so popular that another husband-and-wife Vaudeville acts. - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - achieved almost the same stardom by performing an almost identical act, effectively becoming the "second team" Fields and Seeley. Off the stage, however, there was a big difference in the couples' living arrangements. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paying room service fees for every meal they ate and eventually running out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their profits wisely, ending up in a comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this short Vitaphone are occupied by two pianists who use swords. Apparently these two men had some self-worth in the 1930s, though I have never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seely run and start performing. Both have lots of energy, and she's quite attractive. <br /> <br /> I was upset because the two artists continue to make moves as if they were about to dance, but they never do until the third. of the three songs they perform in this short. When they finally start jumping, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two great artists doing their work. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they've never become stars in music movies. My rating for this: only 4 out of 10, and I'll stick with Block and Sully.
