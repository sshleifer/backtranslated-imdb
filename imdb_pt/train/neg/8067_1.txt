First, let me say that this has to be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I want to say anything in this movie is still remotely exciting. Most of it is very confusing and as you progress you just wish it would end !! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" through the whole thing, to which I say ... "More power for you" !! I, on the other hand, just want to have fun. What brings me back to this stink, entertainment is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. It seems that the majority here also agrees. Most of it does not make the slightest sense, and when you think you have a scene you figured out another pussy scene and ... well, I guess you see where that is going. Avoid, this sucks .... bad !!
