This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually praise any movie for some aspect of its production, but the intensely irritating behavior of more than half the characters made it difficult for me to appreciate any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> The most common was the inference that the man who designed the building was missing, a collapsing avalanche. Er okay. <br /> <br /> In addition, trying to ski an avalanche slalom style will not work. Running 10 feet on some trees will not work. Unfortunately this happens here. As mentioned before, the innate stupidity and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous. In an enclosed space, with limited oxygen, a four-year-old could say that starting a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation. However, if you have a modicum of intelligence, you will also find most of this film difficult to tolerate. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that many quality stories are not produced and yet someone pays for things like this. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? Well, to give you a hook, you have to keep watching to see the latest avalanche techniques. Absolutely invaluable.
