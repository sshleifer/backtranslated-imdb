If this book remained true to the book, then we can only assume that the author was ignorant of the story. Mark Anthony never died of wounds obtained in battle as described. He died a coward for committing suicide and yet he asked his slave to do it for him. The slave preferred killing himself. In actual history, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the great value of the slave and decided to copy it. But even in death, Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed in his own suicide attempt. He cried for Cleopatra and was carried to her, bleeding. She pulled her stretcher into ropes and Mark Anthony died a little later. If you want history, do not watch this movie. If you want romantic drivel, then you'll probably have fun!
