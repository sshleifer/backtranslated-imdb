I have Mirror Mirror mostly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought she was great at American Gothic) but unfortunately she did not play a very big role in that movie. It all starts well and the pace moves very well ... but in the end it starts to get a bit tedious and monotonous. That's not to say that this is a boring movie, but it's just very average and nothing spectacular. I did not like the "ownership" side and there were no decent scenes. Also, the 'main' story was very confusing and the ending does not make much sense. However, I liked the story about the goth girl and how she got revenge on her tormentors. <br /> <br /> I particularly would not recommend Mirror Mirror for horror fans - it's nothing to get wet at.
