My wife and I just watched BÃ»su AKA The Booth. She fell asleep for some parts of the movie. I really wish I had a nap with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the voice of the main character is so loud and annoying that it was impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, I feel like listening to Regis Philbin and William Shatner singing karaoke. He also has no redemptive qualities. I was hoping he'd get hit by a bus five minutes after the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love Asian horror movies, but The Booth is extremely annoying and full of scenes that really do not make any damn sense. If you want a good Asian cinema, check out a two sisters tale or in the mirror. Avoid Booth like the plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
