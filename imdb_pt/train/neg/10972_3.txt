This was not a Trainspotting movie or Guy Ritchie. It was a great wannabee. He wanted to be an affirmative movie, nervous, laughter, affirmation of urban life, but it's more of a silly camera, mess. It's much easier to imitate something other than creating a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I could not care less about the characters or what they were involved with. They were always always pounding, pissing or crying at each other. But there was no substance in what they were doing. The dialogue between the characters should be hip, revealing, instead it comes out banal and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are spectators out there who really liked this movie so I might be wrong.
