(This is a review of the latest Disney English release with Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and Co.) <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Serious serious. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews about this previous Miyazaki movie, I was looking forward to seeing it. But I was shocked, shocked, I say, at the quality of this film. These later films feature well-crafted frames, three-dimensional characters, and the best movie music since ... well ... always. This movie just does not come close. <br /> <br /> It may well start with the positives, though. Like all Miyazaki movies, this one is still very imaginative, with a bizarre fantasy / science fiction setting, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast of animations far superior to other films of its time. (although not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki's later films). And the dubbing in English is very well done. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... is not ... well ... The characters are all cardboard - from sweet and sweet Nausicaa, to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians, to everyone else. After seeing each of them for 30 seconds, you have seen everything that exists. And the fact that the plot just goes around does not help. <br /> <br /> So there's the song ... Now, Hisaichi is my favorite movie composer, but Nausicaa does not do him justice. Half the music has 80's overdrive keyboards, and it usually comes and goes so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them. I highly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a large part of the song before even seeing the photo. <br /> <br /> But wait! There's a great message with this movie, right?! Let's all save the environment! Too bad this movie hits you on the head with it like a sledgehammer. There is a scene where Nausicaa hugs a tree. Not even. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> It makes me a little sad to talk about how this movie is lame. But for some reason, all other IMDb reviews seem to love it. And when the characters have to speak to themselves in extended phrases to tell what's going on, this is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you are the type of person who cultivates anime, likes music from the 80's and plants a tree every day of the Arbor, you will probably like this movie. Otherwise, save your money for your later movies because they have a lot of fun.
