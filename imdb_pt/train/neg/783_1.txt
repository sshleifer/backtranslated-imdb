I watched this show and I just did not find it funny. It may have been the first episode. Lately I realize that ABC is doing a lot of stupid gigs nowadays and it's going down like a season. All the characters in this show are very bad actors, but even if they were good, the jokes and scripts are horrible and would still bring the show down. I would say that I believe this show will be canceled, but seeing how ABC is getting horrible with the quality of the shows they are playing, they can simply keep this simply because it is an average compared to them.
