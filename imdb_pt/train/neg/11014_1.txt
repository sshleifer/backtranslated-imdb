This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. That's saying a lot, considering some of the choices I made in movie rentals. <br /> <br /> I have this in Netflix based entirely on the fact that someone I went to school topless in it. The topless scene lasted about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was as much fun as having walking sticks under your toenails while you were forced to hear Roseanne sing Big Spender. The "satires" are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile toilet humor and jokes in the locker room, and it's so blatant (and poor) the Kentucky Fried movie that you're going to beg for Big Jim Slade to fall through Wall and save us from the stupidity of "Vince Offer." <br /> <br /> Unless you're a masochist, avoid that pile of crap.
