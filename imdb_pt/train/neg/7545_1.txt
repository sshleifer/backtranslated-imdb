It's unfortunate that you can not go under a star. Before attending The Wicker Man, I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only film that really deserved negative stars. In all fairness, The Wicker Man does not diminish the pleasure of an earlier film, but there remains the fact that my cumulative pleasure in the movies was reduced upon seeing him. <br /> <br /> There is a cheap trick too. often used in Hollywood when producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfying conclusion: slap in a more shocking ending and expect the public to confuse it with something artistic or meaningful . It is a play that is rarely successful, and in that case it only manages to embarrass a good actor and ridicule the producers. Even more so that the "carefully crafted" conclusion (or as they say) does not seem logically to follow the plot (which of course I can not elaborate without introducing spoilers), and instead denies what merit the plot had up to that point. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that can logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles and possibly stubborn fans of Nicholas Cage, but only to some of the top readers. If you really want something along these lines, I highly recommend The Night by M. Night Shyamalan. Missing some sort of memory-wiping pill, I suppose I need to watch something better to force it from my mind, say, Assassin's Tomato Attack or Pee-wee's Great Adventure?
