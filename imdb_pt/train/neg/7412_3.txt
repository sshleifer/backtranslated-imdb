I love cheesy horror movies. I do not care if the acting is insignificant or if the monsters seem gross. I liked this movie, except for the confused feeling from the beginning of the movie to the end. Look, I do not need a 10 page dissertation or a poster with big letters explaining a plot to me. But Dark Floors takes the "about what is this movie?" thing to a new (boring) level. What is this movie? <br /> <br /> This is not exceptionally scary or exciting, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused, rent that winner.
