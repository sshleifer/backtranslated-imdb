This movie is a huge yawn, proving that Americans do not have the clue of the farce. Even when it was already written for them! The original film "Hodet Over Vannet" is a comedy of mistakes that I would rate 8/10. It's not just a linguistic translation, but certain absurd chains of events are totally ignored, stealing the film from its original clever farce nature and turning it into a cheap farce style "oops there my pants go."
