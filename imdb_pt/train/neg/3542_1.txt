After reading the comments on the site, I feel compelled to write for the first time. It looks like this movie is like Marmite and divided the audience. I have to say that while I agree that movies do not have to make sense to be nice (see UNIVERSITY OF MULHOLLAND) they still have to get involved with the characters. Now, while I was totally absorbed in the murderous case of lesbians in Lynch's work, I have to say that I could not be angry with Mr. Green or the other cardboard gangsters who inhabited this dayglo world. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, although many people seem to try to say that you did not like it because you did not understand it, I would have to disagree - I did not like it because I was bored. I wanted the film to end and to constantly listen to these quotes repeatedly did not help. Call it smart if you want - I think it's repetitive. <br /> <br /> However, my main reason for writing is to ask a question to all the other reviewers - there were no final credits in the printing of the movie I saw. Just music on black. Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR's claim? Or did everyone involved in the film watch the abrupt cut and had their name removed?
