Ho-hum. The deadly biological weapon of an inventor (Horst Buchholz) runs the risk of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly, his son (Luke Perry) has been working on the antedote all the time. CIA agent Olivia d'Abo enters, and the chase of cat and mouse cars begins to fire. Also in the cast are Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an old Roger Moore. Moore seems to go through this mess is definitely not one of his best efforts. Perry fans will be accepting. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but it's nice to look at.
