*** SPOILER *** Do not read this, if you think about watching this movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: The plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference whether you read this or not) <br /> <br /> If you're wondering if you'll see "Coyote Ugly" or not: no! Not worth the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick", you might say. The plot itself is as shallow as possible, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American dream. The young and pretty girl from a small town became a big hit in New York. The few desperate attempts to give the film any depth fail, such as the father's "tragic" accident, the "difficulties" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to arouse public pity and the sadness placed has no chance of success in this attempt due to poor script and superficial acting. Especially Piper Perabo failed completely in convincing one of the "Jersey's" afraid to sing in front of an audience. The only good (and very funny) thing about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents the small ray of hope in this film. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised, that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. First "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now this ... what happened to great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? THAT was true Bruckheimer stuff. If you're looking for a shallow movie with beautiful women just to have a relaxed night, you should go and see "Charlie's Angels" (it's a lot funnier, fun and self-ironic) instead of this movie. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
