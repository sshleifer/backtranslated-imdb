Relentless, ignorant, ill-conceived, career-killer (where is now the talented Angela Jones?), Deep junk dump. It's no wonder that Reb Braddock has not directed anything since - anyone who has the chance to make his first film in his own rules, based on his own script, with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself, and create something like THIS, anyone who feels THIS was a story worth telling the world, does not deserve a second break. Under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they are told to do, and do well. It's just that they should not have done it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 4.
