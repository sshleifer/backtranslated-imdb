In relation to other films Columbus, this can only be classified as 1 (horrible). I really do not understand what the other reviewers saw in this tremendous clash of a movie. It was only through the morbid fascination that I continued to observe him-to see what a bizarre or inept decision the director would take next. Another critic suggested that it was the only way out of Falk's board because it interfered with his performance. Function. In fact, I think the real reason is in the heads of the studios, who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money. It's a wonder they did not murder him.
