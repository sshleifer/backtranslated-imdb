The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. I always heard how awful it was. The film did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's clothes. The worst parts were, well, almost everything else. My 12 year old son and I just squirmed and could not look at the screen when Shaq started to beat and we wondered why Max did not want Kazzam to fix that front tooth! But even though it was terrible, we just could not stop watching, the story sucked on you, like a black hole, a quicksand or a tar pit, it was hypnotic. But it was worth the laughs and only to say that we actually watched "Kazzam".
