Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. <br /> <br /> He also has a terrible dialogue, unconvincing characters and an absurd, or rather, non-existent story. It just goes from bad to bad in a cynical effort to wring some kind of emotion from a hysterical-insincere and uncommitted part! <br /> <br /> And HEDGEHOG !!!! How many cheap pictures can a movie make? By the way, the hedgehog made the most convincing and watchable presentation at this time of nineteen years. <br /> <br /> If you considered watching this movie, do not do it. Sorry, I can not find a single rescue feature in this movie. He marks a big fat ZERO with me. Strictly for sub-dogma sauces. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> Still, if you liked Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
