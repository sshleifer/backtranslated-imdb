This movie is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can not save it. A poor story, an even worse script, and a bad direction makes it a truly remarkable horror film, being the only horror movie I can honestly say I would never see again. This garbage makes Plan nine out of outer space look like oscar material.
