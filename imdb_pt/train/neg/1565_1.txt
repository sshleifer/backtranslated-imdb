The movie uses a cutting-edge title for a lame story. Kill Kill, it would have been cool. The film incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back into their seats. The scenes are unnecessary and hectic. The movie is something a novice screenwriter could have conjured. Just a waste of film props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to criticize this movie when it's not worth 10 lines of my time, but I have to push to let people know to avoid the absurd. If people are counting on you to choose a good movie for the night of the movie, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not damage it by subjecting yourself to such filth.
