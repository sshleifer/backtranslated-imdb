I really can not believe this movie is not in the worst of IMDB 250, it is absolutely terrible. When I first saw her, I remember talking about it in a college class, and two other people saw it. We were all telling other members of the class not to see it because it was so awful. By the time we finished, some others wanted to see only because they could not believe that something was as bad as we said. Do not be like them, just pass it on. I'm sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer that you never see them in this movie.
