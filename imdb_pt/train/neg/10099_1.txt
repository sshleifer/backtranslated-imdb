Thank God! I did not waste my money renting, but I downloaded it! This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, with visual effects, nudity and unnecessary nudity! Far from other zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are many holes and mistakes in the movie. Ok, if you have time after reading this review, check out the profile of the director (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I have a self-explanation because the film is like that, I mean that every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. And now I'm not willing to research what types of movies are directed by him, but I can finish all this by saying a strong sentence. Even for fun or spending time or even in a boring extreme situation, please do not watch this movie.
