I knew my resume would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you've lived in the 70's or 80's, you probably will not be able to understand WHY someone would like a New Coke or have a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL do not fully understand it). They are just a few things that seemed to make sense at the time, but really frustrated the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and her band. At the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough influence that the studio starred with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this film. However, if you did not live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this type of "entertainment". After all, Kyser and his bandmates are incredibly unpleasant and their mood is very, very broad (ie, unsophisticated and tacky). Frankly, I could not stand his antics nor did I appreciate there were too many musical numbers in the movie. Because of these factors, the big cast of support has been put in the background and fans of these actors are likely to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film involves Kyser and the band going to a mansion where a young girl and her crazy aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed and strange events begin. Eventually, it culminates in a few attempts on Sally's life and a (sorts) session. It's all played to laugh - and it's not really a horror movie, despite the cast. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is passable entertainment at best. As a fan of Lugosi and Karloff, I certainly felt cheated having to watch Kyser and his idiots.
