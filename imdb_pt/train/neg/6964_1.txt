I usually take a look at MTV's movie awards to watch a witty and entertaining show that offers a unique award (Chewbacca winning a lifetime achievement award as an example). So this year was no different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny - though stupid - to me. I laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies, and I even liked him in Cara, where is my car? But the awards for the MTV movie were simply horrible. Nothing was consistent, humorous or funny. Justin Timberlake should continue singing and dancing; he certainly can not act. <br /> <br /> I'm curious to know who the writers were for this show. Last year's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely funny (the Lord of the Rings parody was worth watching the whole show), but this year was completely different. Someone understood Timberlake's comments about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They're looking at a movie together, but they never met! Here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke just got into their stupid dialogue, never making reference to Timberlake's "joke". And Seann was completely wasted as a talent, not even making me smile, though I just laughed. And what was the purpose of Harrison Ford's one liners? Did they make any sense to anyone? Maybe the MTV writers realized that young audiences would only know the aging Ford as Han Solo, Indiania Jones or the President of Air Force One. I'm stumped. And someone would tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how old is he? The guy looks like 30, trying to act 19 again .... giving up, showing a bit of class (as in his best actor Academy award speech) and acting his age! <br /> <br /> I give this show 1 star of 4, simply because of Gollam's speech for Best Visual Performance. This was very creative, extremely well done, and caused the only genuine laughter of the whole night.
