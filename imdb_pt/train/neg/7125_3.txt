VILLA RIDES (1968) ends up being a great disappointment! And even though Sam Peckinpah took part in the script, along with Robert Towne, it still appears as a movie written on the left, directed dryly by the indistinct Buzz Kulik. First, Yul Brynner from top as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His performance on a note lacks the fire and enthusiasm that Anthony Quinn or Roland Gilbert could have brought to the role. Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed like a Mexican bandit who is in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian. Also, second-billed Robert Mitchum is totally wasted on the photo! Its part as a biplane flying ace flinging homemade air bombs into the cause of revolution is a poorly written role that could have been played by any minor star. Mitch does not have a decent line throughout the film and brings to mind his other Mexican revolution portrays the distant superior "Bandit" (1956), which unfortunately no one seems to have any interest in releasing on DVD. Besides not having any kind of style "Villa Rides" also suffers a lot without the presence of a female star! There is the star Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican woman who gives Mitchum the cheerful look, but her cast is merely superficial. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could have added some necessary points to the faltering history. <br /> <br /> There are two good action scenes in the film, but some good action scenes are not a movie and unless perfect picture quality from Panavision plus the repetitive song of the Maurice Jarre theme does not help at all. <br /> <br /> As Paramount does not have, there are no extras - not even a trailer! Yes, a disappointing presentation of film and DVD that could have been and should have been much better.
