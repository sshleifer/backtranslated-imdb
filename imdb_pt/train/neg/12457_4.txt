It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this film: part of it is a very weak thriller (and I say very, very weak), and part of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been attempted in psychological thrillers, but in this case the film can not keep things together due to poor surface routing, poor acting and a very dark, very dull cinematography. I would say that Salvatores did his best in other genres and in other settings where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. In general, a B movie, hardly worth your money ... Vote: 4/10
