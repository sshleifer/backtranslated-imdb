This adaptation positively assaults a classic that is loved by its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochester's character. I have the feeling that he did not even read the book, just walked on set with his pants too tight and received a summary of the character who said: "Past grumpy, somber and gloomy." He interprets Rochester not as a character or as a real person, but as a grumpy man who never gives a smile until he engages in a time when he miraculously turns into a perfect love. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited me was disbelief and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, who is definitely turning into her grave. Go and enjoy the book. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY. AND IN SHAPE: A "PASSIONATE" LOVE SCENE DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU MUST EAT YOUR FACE.
