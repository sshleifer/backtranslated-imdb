Remakes (and sequels) have been a landmark of Cinema since the beginning of the media. It's pretty much a hit or a lack of risk though. If you take what's good about the original and build on it and update the key features of today's standards, you can succeed. Note that films like THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) succeeded in their attempts. Others like KING KONG (1976) fail miserably. <br /> <br /> BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945) is the model of this film. It is as perfect as could be done on such subject and we classify it. The story is simple, love, innocently found by accident and tragically lost. Now, it happened only for the two (2) principals involved at the wrong time. These are portrayed convincingly and sensitively by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. None of them are conventionally taking material from the Star, but quality Character Actors. For details, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, what went wrong? A TV movie, remade practically scene for the scene with the names of the actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should at least have been quoted in IMDb. Both actors, though they seem disinterested, just showing up to punch their time clocks and get their checks. None of them are involved with their characters or with each other. You do not believe they are in love or when they finally separate, it is a great loss for any of them. This should not be and that is why it fails in its intention. Sometimes it's better to leave things alone.
