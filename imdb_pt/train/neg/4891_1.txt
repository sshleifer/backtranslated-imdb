I want to clarify some things. I'm not familiar with the Ming-liang Tsai movies and I'm very familiar with art cinema; I grew up in the seventies of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Art films were really ART; as inks. People did this to express their inner feelings, not too worried if other people understood something. They were beyond commercial values; just look at an old Antonioni (or the first Picasso) and you will understand. <br /> <br /> Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. It is an opportunistic film, intended to deceive the judges and critics of the festival, throwing many things without saying anything. <br /> <br /> History does not make sense. The lack of water causes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate. A girl in despair, stealing water from the toilet in the public toilets. There is also an early porn (neighbor) trying to make a movie with an actress with whom he does not seem to feel comfortable. There is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porn star. The confusion ends with a sexual (non-pornographic) scene that many people feel shocked, but I believe it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie or History of Violence. <br /> <br /> The two main characters never talk. Sometimes a musical style of number 60 appears and explains (through a song) what is happening in the minds of the characters. These video clips are really welcome because the previous scene, without dialogue or music, just people looking at each other, sometimes takes 4, 5 or even more minutes, which in movie times is VERY MUCH. <br /> <br /> There are also some details about "the difficulty of having sex without love," the "selfish mind of the pornographic industry." <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this film was meant to (cheat) it to deceive the judges and critics of the festival. There are some pseudo-shocking scenes (within the limits of Taiwan's censorship) and many subjects are opened, but nothing is completed or going nowhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks meant that the film needed some (important) prices at movie festivals and made the film an undeserved commercial success (I watch the movie in France and the theater was packed) . <br /> <br /> However, please do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie. It is boring and empty; really a fraud to the public. Boogie Nights (which I really did not like), Intimacy and 9 Songs are much better movies.
