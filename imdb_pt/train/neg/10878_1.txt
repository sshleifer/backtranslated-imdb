This movie is much more of the "demons" type of the masterpeice and this is the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. The acting is terrible, the action scenes are accelerated, the script is almost painful and the budget does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, then you have not seen a real horror movie, skip this and get a copy of the movie's demons.
