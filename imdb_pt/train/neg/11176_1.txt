I saw this movie in a preview, and I can not emphasize how bad I thought this movie was. From the beginning, the audience was moaning about Pacino's dreadful southern accent. Poor Al looked really depressed, and I can not decide if that was purposely part of his role as a drug addict, or maybe he just could not sleep before coming to the set. Much worse than Pacino's closes, however, is the miserable excuse for a plot. At the beginning of the movie, we received indications that Pacino's character is gay, and I suspect that's what the screenwriter originally intended. Later, however, we must suspend our disbelief and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both sleepwalkers in lame papers) covet that effeminate, elderly, half-dead man with the ridiculous accent. The worst part overall was the plot of the main plot, which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and never, never worried at all. Since this was a preview, I will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of re-filming and editing, but you can bet that I will not pay a penny to see it in theaters.
