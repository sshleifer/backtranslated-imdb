Dreyfuss plays a mafia boss who has lost his mind but is now "fixed." Lane is his girl who is playing with his Number One (Goldblum), who should have something with Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With what anyone could consider a supporting cast of stars (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance of Richard Pryor) can not help in this plot, as Dreyfuss proves that he is not "fixed" and tries to kill almost everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> You know, it's not like you do not know what's coming. The first ten minutes were nothing more than guys trying to tell Goldblum what was in store for him when Dreyfuss left, but I would spare all the trouble: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The real reason why I chose this movie is because I've been in a Diane Lane kick lately and have been trying to see all of their movies. The real disappointment for me was not only the terrible plot, but also the fact that it did not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (though we heard about it throughout the movie). Even being a fan of more than half the cast can not help me enjoy this movie. The parts where the suspense should be made me laugh at what was really happening. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
