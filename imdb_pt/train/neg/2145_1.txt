I have a question for those who thought of this idea. Because? Which made them think of making a second film of it. If memory serves, Cinderella did not end with "Everyone lived happily ever after"? I'm sure it is, or it was implied. Wait a minute, if everyone lived happily ever after, how could there be a sequel? Unless they were trying to make the story more boring in history, there could not be a sequel. I mean, they could have Cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours, but why? A movie that ends in "happily ever after" can not have a sequel; if this happens, they will not live happily ever after! Something has to go wrong, which causes problems with the first end! Because? That's not right, it's bad. That is my last word on the subject.
