Working at a video store, I get to see some movies and every so often I try to watch some of the not-so-great movies. Proud happened to be one of them. The initial idea of ​​telling the story of a basically black manned ship during World War II had some merit. However, in less than 10 minutes watching the movie, you discover that the main purpose of the film was to tell about racial tension in World War II. The underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. This main point is hammered at you to the point of excess throughout the movie. I commend the men who served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and the difficulties they faced. A film should have been made with a focus on the accomplishments these men have made for themselves, the Navy and their country, and not to make a film that focuses on racism during World War II.
