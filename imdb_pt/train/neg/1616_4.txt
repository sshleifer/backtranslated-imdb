CLASSIFICATION STAR: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning This second part of the Che films takes the story for the late '60s where the man now moved his resistance fighters to the hills of South America, surviving without enough food and water and tensions between the group. Everything comes to the fore as he crosses the border into Bolivia and government forces intensify their campaign to overthrow him. <br /> <br /> Without the flitting between the time and places of the last film, Soderbergh's second installment focuses exclusively on action in the hills, and manages to be an even more dull experience. And, more pretentiously, the punctuation was muffled, giving the second installment an unwanted air of arts that is as alienating as. There is only one air of unwavering boredom for the movie that never stops working. You can not blame Soderbergh's ambition or Del Toro's drive in the lead role, it's a shame that at some point in production things have gotten such a disappointing turnaround. **
