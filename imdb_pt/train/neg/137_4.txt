It's clear to see why the creators of the movie Scary Movie found it so easy to imitate these 'teenage slasher' movies. They are so incredibly stereotyped. And if Valentine had been released about a year before, I'm sure they would have spoofed this movie too - if they found some original material to distinguish him from the Screams, I know what you did last summer, and Urban Legends . <br /> <br /> Valentine offers nothing new to this genre except a better than normal ending, which, of course, leaves plenty of room for the inevitable continuation. As always, a masked psycho killer chases a group of young, beautiful women, killing the main character's friends one by one, usually about the style above. Lots of T & A on display, no character development, poor acting and overly elaborate bloodshed. <br /> <br /> What I can not stand in this type of movie is that they pose as' who made yours? '. The thing is they are not because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked, and tells the main character that now all friends have been murdered. Generally, something that was never made clear during the movie anyway (for example, the fishing partner of the main character's uncle's uncle kicked the dog of his friend's father). Everyone who is still alive throughout the movie is a 'suspect', but they are more 'Red Herrings' than suspects. As we all know, at this point the main character gets an implausible escape and kills the psychological killer unmasked after the motive is revealed. Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (mini-spoiler anyway) *************** In Valentine the motive was not revealed, but more, there is left for you to think about, given that the film did not finish in the typical ' teen slash 'way. The issue is only partially resolved, and the main killer's goal may or may not have been met by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everyone. Does the killer want more, or were the demons really beaten? <br /> <br /> That still did not make Valentine a good movie, but it simply saved him from being as bad as usual, which still does not count. to much. For anyone thinking of making another film in this direction, please do not. Originality is so important, and it's hard to see any originality coming out of this genre.
