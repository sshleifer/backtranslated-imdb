For those of you who have never heard of (or have seen in A & E), Cracker is a brilliant British TV show about an overweight psychologist, inveterate smoker named Fitz, who helps the Manchester police department head in two violent. criminals. It's considered one of the best shows in England (and that's something), and it was tremendously successful in England and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> Now, the original stars have re-teamed with writer to bring down yet another 2-hour episode. I have loved this show since I first saw it, more than a decade ago. The DVD box set occupies a place of honor in my collection, and I can cite a good deal of Fitz's interrogation scenes practically word for word. The idea of ​​Robbie Coltrane joining Jimmy McGovern for another TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute joy. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the good. One of the many things that struck me about the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a character. Five minutes in the first episode? with his lecture (throwing the books in the air), his drink, and his cursing of the guy behind him in the queue of the gaming machine? and you knew, you just knew, who this character was. You can feel it "clicking" in your mind, the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a large paper written by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Coltrane, of course, remained great throughout the show. , but I always felt that some of the later episodes ?? those not written by McGovern? mistreated the character. <br /> <br /> So the good news is this: Fitz is back. So you see him at this show? making incredibly inappropriate comments on your daughter's wedding? you will feel this "click" once more. It is him: petulant in one moment and truly sorry of the next, always insightful, sincere to the point of being tactless, but brilliantly funny in the process. If you love this character as much as I do, you will be delighted with how it is portrayed in the film. And that extends to Judith and Mark: in fact, all that has to do with the Fitzs is treated perfectly. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with this movie revolves around the crime that Fitz is trying to solve. In Cracker's standard fashion, do we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes? the suspense lies in watching Fitz figure it out. In this case, we have a serial killer that is out of American blood. And the reason for this, unfortunately, is not due to any believable psychological trauma? instead, it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write this, as I truly believe Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers. in the world. Nor do I have a problem with films that are about current issues or films that take a political stance. But in the Cracker universe, we expect to see the characters behaving like humans, not caricatures. Instead, the Americans in this movie are all portrayed in a totally stereotypical way. Are they know-nothing talkers who complain about everything, treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives? one of them can even do all the above in less than 5 minutes. I honestly thought I had changed channels by mistake or something. <br /> <br /> But it does not stop there. Do we have constant reminders of how badly the war in Iraq is going? reminders that have nothing to do with history and appear almost out of nowhere. The killer is so busy talking about how Bush is worse than Hitler that he almost forgets to continue the murder; but more to the point, he is a spokesman for the political views of the writer that he forgets to act as a credible human being, and so we? as an audience? Do not buy your sudden transformation from a happy family man to a serial torture soul. <br /> <br /> I can not say that ruined the show for me? it was still good TV, better than almost anything in the genre (mainly due to, once again, Coltrane). But her constant politicization made it impossible for her to be as good as the real Cracker classics like "To Be A Somebody" ?? an episode that was so "problematic," but was treated with much more subtlety and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other small points: Panhandle not being around is a disappointment, but what's worse are the substitutes for it. . The whole police department? which for so long filled with great characters - is now full of vanilla. Completely interchangeable cops that lack any and all personality (how you can drain Richard Coyle from Coupling's personality is beyond me, but in fact he's missing here). <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some times when the show has lost. your credibility for me. One such case revolves around Fitz having to shrink the whole population of Manchester from 1 million to 100 based on some very strange criteria (French windows? How does the computer know if I have French windows?) ?? Not only can he do it, but he can do it in less than an hour. I do not think like that. <br /> <br /> So, after all, I was a bit disappointed. It is recommendable to watch, but be sure to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. Still, if there are new series to come after that, it would all have been for good: I am convinced that McGovern can still write great things, and perhaps now that he is taking his policy out of his system, he can again write about people .
