Thanks to a monotonous and unadorned script by Neil Simon and Robert Moore's unsightly direction, Chapter Two becomes a raucous showcase for Marsha Mason, who received her third of four Academy Award nominations for chapter two giving her the same performance as her gave in Cinnderella Liberty. 73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81), but this time she does not have a child to drag. Chapter Two is Moore's third and final feature, which has directed Neil Simon's The Cheap Detective (78) and Murder By Death (76). Caan is mischievous, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is overly analytical and there are virtually no details about the establishment. The first time is a timid and captivating romance between a Cain and a Mason, and the sad second half makes you miss the first half. The NYC venues, just like Joe Bologna, and a painfully thin Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide some welcome distraction. And last but not least, there's a horrible song played during the credits.
