This movie was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. I'm not joking. It was badly done and the actors could not act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie my friends and I could have together on their own. The case in which the film arrived is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie in front of the case. It seems the director or makeup artist just put the black eyeliner under someone's eyes and called them a zombie. The credits at the beginning of the film occupy almost 20 minutes of the film. Watching the credits was the best part of the movie. This was honestly a horrible movie and I could not believe how much it was put together. Scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes you were like "what's going on?" The audio was horrible and the action scenes looked like a couple of teenage pranks making a fake fight scene. <br /> <br /> IF you are thinking of renting or buying this movie, I advise you to at least watch the trailer because it shows how awful this really is. I wish I had watched it before renting it.
