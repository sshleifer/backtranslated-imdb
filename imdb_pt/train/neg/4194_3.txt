This movie started very promising with the story of a director who loses sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him. However, somewhere in between it seemed that the writers did not know where to go from there. <br /> <br /> An unbelievable event followed the following (Russia must be very small, because they are all bumping into each other). all the time), the motivation of the understandable female protagonist (why does she still follow him after they leave the ship? Why does not she try to get a cell phone on the ship to call someone?), the side stories were completely ridiculous Story with Mom and Boyfriend should be funny? And what was the story of the younger sister? Yet with all this apparent arbitrariness of the plot, the film managed to be completely predictable. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is that there was so much potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were also good. So this could have been a really good movie ... but it was not.
