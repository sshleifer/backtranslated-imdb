Poor Paul Mercurio. After getting the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to find himself doing a lot of trash. None of the characters in this movie are very unpleasant, or even that can be seen, but Mercury's leadership is the kind of person you'd rather ignore - completely unworthy of him and he uses TOUCHES. Big mistake in the wardrobe, that one.
