I did not what that other review was talking about. This definitely is not a bimbo movie, in fact, I do not think there was a decent-looking girl in it. No, it's just an Ed Wood-like science fiction movie. And it's bad. I can not even begin to say how bad it is. I saw late at night in the cable, and I was in shock. The fact that this movie was released is an insult to us all. The actors were producer's friends or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke and the rhythm is insanely slow. For me, music is the best. A monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you see it on the cable, watch. You'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be.
