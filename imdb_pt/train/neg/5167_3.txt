I classified this movie with 3 skulls, just because the girls knew how to scream, this could have been a better movie, if the actors were better, the twins were fine, I believed they were bad, but the older brother and younger , they sucked very badly, it looked like they were reading the scripts instead of acting ... spoiler: if they are vampires, why do they freeze the blood? vampires can not drink frozen blood, the sister in the movie says we'll drink while she's alive ... but when they're moving to another house, they take a refrigerator with frozen blood. The end of the spoiler <br /> <br /> It was a huge waste of time, and it drove me crazy because I read all the reviews of how great this movie was, how many awards that movie won, and that movie was f * * ing s ** t !!!!
