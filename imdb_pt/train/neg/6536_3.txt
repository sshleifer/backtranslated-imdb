This DVD seems to be directed to someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background. It is organized as a series of Grand Canyon music videos with various songs from Tangerine Dream. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, TD's music is monotonous and the download to the DVD seems a little blurry and obscure. A very expensive DVD for what it is.
