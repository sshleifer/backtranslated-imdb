This movie was so bad that I could not sit down without doing anything else. There was no plot and no point. I was completely bored and for a movie about a comedian, I could not remember a joke or a funny line worthy of the description. Politicians without talking technical jargon could not be less entertaining. <br /> <br /> So how was it done? Is there no quality control in the movie? Watching the bikini girls was the only distraction during that horrible experience. <br /> <br /> It is hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who became popular and appeared in beautiful comedies, managed to survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny at all in this film, so it proves that writing is so vital in effective comedy.
