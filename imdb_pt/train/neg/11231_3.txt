I love independent low budget movies and had high hopes for this. But this movie is static. No matter the value of production, which is very noble to your budget, but the pace is deadly. Admittedly, these people achieve a lot with little, but the film fails at the most fundamental level. It's boring. Editing is glacial and rhythm stops. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde, who is not seen nearly enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we have to suffer with hesitant Baltimore babblings through an endless and exhausting exposure. It looks like a retrograde play committed to the video. <br /> <br /> Everyone's noble efforts in production, but such a tired story needed a kick in the pants and a new low-budget technology should have given her a new voice. Instead, it's just a retread.
