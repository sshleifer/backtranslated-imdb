Based on Michael Chabon's novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer wandering with two friends. The year is 1983, and young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) stands at a crossroads. Completely contrary to his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually invented with painful attempts to create a beautiful indie cinematography, the whole movie looks like the director - whose previous effort, Dodgeball, was funny if it's commercial - is desperately seeking independent credibility by assembling aspects of other independent films but sprinkling with stars like Mena. Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like so many of the star studios at Sundance this year, it looked like this was a studio-sponsored vanity project secretly to help the director gain some indie credibility points - he failed in that regard and as a movie by itself.
