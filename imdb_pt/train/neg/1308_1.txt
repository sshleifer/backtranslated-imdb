What really impresses me in this movie (that is, the thing about this movie that makes me physically sick) is that someone actually paid to do it. There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this film. It's not scary, it's not thought-provoking, it's not fun, it's not good. It is a sleeping pill made of cyanide. The DVD case compares this with Blair Witch, Evil Dead and a few other decent films, making the filmmaker's desperation clearly obvious. It's nothing like any other movie of all time; is much, much worse. The claims of an "extremely shocking end you will never forget" are the equivalent of a ton of fetid horse droppings. Please never waste your time watching this piece of junk because it can make you sterile. The man who wrote this movie must be removed from the list of members of the Writer's Guild, and never again allowed to film anything again. Because if he thought this was a movie worth doing, he probably does not have much to offer in the future. Zero stars. Let Grod pity the soul of anyone who has the misfortune to see it. I'm going to throw up now.
