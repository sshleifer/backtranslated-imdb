This is a high quality cheese recipe from the movie B kung fu flicks. Bruce "wannabe" Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, we'll show Bruce's quick clips and do close-ups of his eyes and if you quint at the right angle during a certain period of the day during the winter solstice, it looks like Bruce. You will laugh admired of how the film's splice is not very good, but some deleted scenes of Enter the Dragon are thrown into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think this may excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce even though his character is Bruce's brother (who for some reason still mimics Bruce's fighting style and style - very POOR). Watch Bruce come face-to-face with the cowardly lion. The props department stopped by Kay-Bee, you see. Bruce also finds nothing wrong in beating a crippled man violently. In the end, the director decided "let's do a flashback" to a scene shown 3 minutes ago !! They must have thought that only unicellular organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
