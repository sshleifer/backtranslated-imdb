A few years ago, the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME., Which was imperfect but very nice (my rating was 7), created this junk over New York. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I Love You (J'taime) created a feeling for Paris and was made in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this current movie, I did not recognize New York City, I did not feel I was in the city of my birth. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 districts, I have not seen scenes in the Bronx, or in Queens, There is a scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scene of the beautiful hotels or theaters. She has a great cast, most of the artists were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lower type. <br /> <br /> The very few moments of humor are all sexual in nature or very insulting to the many. New Yorkers we all know and love. <br /> <br /> Some of the films nominated for the razzie awards were much better. <br /> <br /> In my way of thinking, I think the title should have been <br>. /> <br /> NEW YORK, I hate you.
