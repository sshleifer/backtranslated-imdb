In contrast to my fellow reviewers, I always try to find something that will result in any movie I see. Yes, the quality of the dubbing and lighting is terrible, the acting is wood and the opening sequence is highly misleading with all those lascivious lesbian vampires. with dripping blood. Something must be lost in the translation of the Italian word "leech" into the title; almost as if the producers were originally filming a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up on their dramatic opening sequence, so they put it on the film anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie made in 1975 was recently released on DVD and comes with its own theatrical trailer, which in some ways is bolder than seen in the movie! Now, anyone who buys this movie has probably read their synopsis and knows what to expect - Italian softporn from in the mid-1970s. I bought it because I'm attracted to Christa Nelli (more often credited as "Krista Nell"). The absence of a cast of characters that I find more frustrating in many of these Eurosleaze films of the 60s and 70s. I had hoped that Imdb would show the cast of characters as if they heard their names in the film but without a cast list, difficult to connect them to the actor in question. I think Krista Nell played "Cora", but under that style of massive hair, costume and makeup it's hard to distinguish her for sure. <br /> <br /> There is mostly a two-dimensional picture by the actors in their parts and no one really stands out. Maybe something is lost in the dubbing process. What were the good points? the music was atmospheric and of course if you like soft lesbian pornography is there. The outside sites used were good and I wonder where they filmed the castle on their island. It is intended to be set in "Ireland" (North or Republic?) In 1902, then all costumes for period sports pieces. Some of the scenes I found unintentionally funny, especially those sex scenes !! Anyway a nice joke. I rated it 4/10.
