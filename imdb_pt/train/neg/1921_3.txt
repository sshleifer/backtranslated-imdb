For some strange reason, the world of cinema is fashion driven. Someone makes a movie about a killer shark, and suddenly the oceans of the movie world are filled with giant squid, murderous octopuses, and sea monsters of all kinds. A man is chased by a former lover of hell, then each character in the movie is chased by a hellhunter or a roommate from hell or a nanny from hell. So when a big Hollywood company produces a big-ticket blockbuster about tornadoes, other movie producers jump on the tide, the fact that they do not have the budget to do that does not stop them. Tristor Night is a case in point. What struck me about this, made for the movies on television, is the fact that he tries to hide his lack of budget by cutting the advertising breaks. Every time a tornado appears, the camera blocks the horrified expression of the actors as they shout things like "Oh, my figure is coming here" and "Run for their lives," so the screen goes black saving the producers from the need to increase the special effects budget. Unfortunately, the NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS budget should have been increased to include better actors. The cast is not bad at all, but it is inexpressive and does not have the ability to perform a character-driven movie. Where are Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word about being a TWISTER clone ..... Yeah, NOTT was released two months before TWISTER, but TWISTER had been sensationalist for several months as the summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT has a feeling for him that leads me to believe he was made and released to tie with the hype around TWISTER
