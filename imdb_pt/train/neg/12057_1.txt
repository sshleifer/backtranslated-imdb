Charles Bronson continued his 80's with what could be his worst movie of the decade, if not always. In it he plays a detective who makes a great effort to find a pimp who has kidnapped an Asian girl and is currently selling it for the highest bidder. It's a shameful attempt at action and is possibly the most depressing film ever made. Many people consider the Death Wish sequences as the worst Bronson films. The Death Wish sequences were not great movies, but in most cases they were made competently and very much watched. Kinjite, however, is an extremely tedious thriller that is punctuated by witty racism and child sexual abuse. It really is a refractory movie and everything gets made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a "Law and Justice" mentality that is too exaggerated to actually say anything. In fact, the movie begins with the underage sex being interrupted with Bronson, then raping the pedophile analically with a vibrator. The Chicago theater I watched this in just gasped at the strangeness of this scene, only to gasp the strangeness of the pimp rape the girl in this movie. There is no other point but to explore and really the film was not well written enough to rise above the level of exploitation and deliver something that would work. Bronson seems more into things, but clearly this is too repugnant to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor of all time, but that effort is the worst. The action sequences are also bad. <br /> <br /> 1/2 of 4 (horrible)
