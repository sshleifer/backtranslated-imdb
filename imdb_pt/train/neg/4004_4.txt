As a big fan or Cracker series, I waited 7 years for the next addition. This episode, unfortunately, does not correspond to the legend. Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughter's wedding and gets involved in a homicide investigation as a soldier, plagued by flashbacks from his shift in Northern Ireland, goes on a killing. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way that everything is set up and how Fitz is taken to the killer. It's all too fat to go far. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some good scenes in flashbacks from Northern Ireland that are filmed as great.
