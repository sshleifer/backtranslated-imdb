An Italian / American co-production co-starring Linda Blair and David 'Hoff' Hasselhoff: how could any useless horror fan resist such a treatment? Well, based on the monotonous, extremely tedious, and totally meaningless, the first forty minutes or so, I would have said "very easily"; Fortunately though, things end up getting a little more fun with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a handful of nudity as well (unfortunately, my copy was edited optically to remove this offensive material Hoff star as Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) in a decadent hotel on a seemingly deserted island to take pictures for his latest project, a book about witches, while there, in frustration, Gary also hoping to try to cure a bad case of blue balls, relieving Leslie of her virginity. Her nookie plans are destroyed, however, by the unexpected arrival of real estate developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), his pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son Tommy (Michael Manchester), beautiful nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and real estate agent After explaining his unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are greeted by the new owners of the property, and when a violent storm suddenly picks up, making it dangerous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, without the knowledge of the hotel's new guests, the place also houses the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef), who demands human sacrifices to return to life. One by one, the victims are pulled into a red swirl (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughter) before finding a terrible fate. <br /> <br /> None of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff proves to be one of the best artists, who talks a lot about others), but those spectators who go through the sad first half are rewarded with some decent moments of gore: Rose has her lips sewn together before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by witches and impaled on a swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and Gary is stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed (again).
