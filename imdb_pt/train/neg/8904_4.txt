I personally enjoyed The Prophecy from 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film was not perfect, it was a horrifying and highly original Horror / Fantasy movie that entertained immensely. This lower continuation of 1998 is still worth watching, but mostly due to Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again notable in the role of the fallen archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the son of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could be the determining factor of the celestial war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. In addition to Gabriel, however, "The Prophecy II" unfortunately also includes a lot of terribly annoying characters. Valerie's character was annoying enough, and Danayel bothered me even more. The biggest pain in the butt, however, was Izzy's character (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who does not shut up. Still, Walken's performance is not the only redeeming quality of the film. The whole film is quite sad and well etched in dark colors, which adds a lot to the atmosphere. The scene of Gabriel's resurrection in the beginning is also quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the "Prophecy" movies. "The Prophecy II" is, however, the weakest of the three films "Prophecy" with Walken. Definitely a one-man show by Christopher Walken, fun, but nothing more.
