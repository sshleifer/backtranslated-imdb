This movie was absolutely ghastly! I can not understand how this movie came to production. Nothing against the cast of the film, of course, this is all the fault of the writing team. You take the old middle storyline - let's dance our way to be poor and indigent - or STEP in this case. But this bears no resemblance to a true plot - or at least one that one would care about. With actors who speak Canada in what is supposed to be an American environment - this film is very flat. On a positive note, the direction was very good and the cinematography was pretty decent too. It seems that the production budget was also very generous. My only request is for this team to leave the writing alone and find real writers to help them bring words live in the film. Net result - how she moves is how shitty she is.
