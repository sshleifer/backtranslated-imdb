There! They are not much worse than this horrible adaptation of C. Lewis's beloved novel. While the adaptation is very true to the novel, the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. I read that the budget for this miniseries was the largest that the BBC ever gave at the time, but surely they could have put together a bit more than the $ 2 that seems to have been filmed. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know the effects of the computer were not at the required level or even cost effective at the time, but the man in the costume shop in a suit looked awful. Better to have just cut the movie character than to do it for the role! Avoid this at all costs.
