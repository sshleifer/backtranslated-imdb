This movie was definitely not one of the best movies of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I really did not like it and I was kind of disappointed with the movie. For some reason, it seemed like it was a movie that they created very fast. In some places it got so annoying that I had to move quickly. There were no mistakes or exciting parts like the other films.
