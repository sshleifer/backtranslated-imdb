Steve McQueen certainly has a lot of loyal fans out there. He was certainly a charismatic subject, one of the most charismatic that the big screen ever knew. But even McQueen can not save this turkey from a movie, filmed with what appears to be a brownie camera at the actual locations in St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new kid with no criminal background brought in to planning a bank robbery by one of the other gangs. There is more than a hint that there is a gay relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. He did not like all the other members of the robbery, mainly because of his lack of criminal resume. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a girlfriend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something in progress, especially when he starts hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas, as well as Clarke, all very rude characters. That would surely arouse my suspicions. <br /> <br /> The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery had two directors, Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim made mostly documentaries and Stix did not do much. One of those two pranksters decided that Steve's performance would be better done by doing a poor imitation of Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This movie may be the worst ever made by Steve McQueen. I'm willing to bet Dick Powell and Four Star Productions have already signed it for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can not believe they would if they saw it. <br /> <br /> Or they would have seen something the public would have forgotten, except for the sauce for this turkey.
