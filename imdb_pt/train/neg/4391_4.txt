A young scientist, Harry Harrison, continues his father's scientific research on regenerating members in flying colors, but his dominant mother and doctor want to sell the serum. When he finds out, there is an accident involving Harry losing an arm. Then he experiments the serum and what happens is a genetically disordered arm that has a mind of its own. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen it so many times before, but the thing that raises this is too much exaggeration. A little rubber is the performance of the movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. In fact, it's not a bad movie from Fangoria movies; there are only the best out there that are similar in vein. "Servered Ties" simply does not have its own style. The eccentric nature and the nasty splatters seemed "Re-animator" and even a touch of clowning stood out as something of "Evil Dead 2". <br /> <br /> The comic is really a madness of black humor, but it can get melodramatic and a bit dry in the fun factor. Surprises arise, especially the final result of the film. Which is well accepted, as I thought it could have been dropped with something more affordable. For a low budget production, FX makeup may seem rigid and very goofy, but there are some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually shrink. Even a touch of sexual tension simplifies history, thanks to the juicy performance of Elke Sommer as the mother. Oliver Reed is quite expressionless humorist in a perverse sense and he takes it very well. Both were immensely fun as the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is delightful in an erratic performance like Harry. Director Damon Santostefano quickly evaluated the film and orchestrated some stylish scenes of engaging and deceptive horror. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is juvenile and basically silly nonsense, but you have to give a little entertainment.
