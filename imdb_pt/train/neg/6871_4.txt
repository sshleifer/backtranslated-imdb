A great concept went wrong. Poor acting, even worse writing .... After watching the first two episodes, I was wondering why he reached the second season. The characters are forgettable, the writing is bad, the sets are just OK. The special effects are simply sad - much better done in the same time period - where is the money? The first episode begins interesting and descends fast - the precept of the whole show is simply silly. Now do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of science fiction and 'geek' - but this show just does not work. As I said at the beginning, I'm really surprised at the second season - much better was canceled after just one season (Jake 2.0, for example). This show was just bad.
