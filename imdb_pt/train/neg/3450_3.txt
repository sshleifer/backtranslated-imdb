Someone here actually compared this movie in some way to High Noon. Now that's a real stretch! I'm a big fan of Sinatra, including some of his acting roles, but maybe the only person who could have played that role would have been Don Knotts. First, as someone pointed out, Sinatra simply does not have the compilation for an aspiring Western villain. He is very "light" at this point in his life. Maybe he was about the same height as Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a pretty solid constitution. Sinatra appears as the great talking boy no one should take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is uninspired and really unreliable. I do not want to ruin it, but I think the end and how the people of the city react in this story makes no sense. Another thing, these people constantly allow themselves to be completely dominated by some "bad guy". This is just a small town, so I do not understand the attraction nor understand why people would let themselves be dominated that way. There is a 'love interest' in the story and if I followed it right, she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was, so some other bad guy would not kill him. Now there is true love for you. 'Stand up! Tell him your name so he can kill you! I LAUGHED A LOT. Stop, you're killing me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the film is not good enough and no matter how they tried, this story does not have a logical way to go beyond trash. . Want to know why you're not in the video and never show up on TV? Critics apparently criticized it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is very bad. I almost bet Sinatra paid someone to get as deep as possible. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a good western where a city faces a bad guy? Try Tension at Table Rock, or At Gunpoint - two really good westerns with that theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer of all time - but you do not belong in a movie like that.
