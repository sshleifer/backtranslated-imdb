America needs the best man possible to win "The Game", so who hires? A gymnast (Oh brother!) Played by Kurt Thomas, who has the necessary skills to win in a game involving ninjas, a village of madmen and Richard Norton, who is said by Kurt Thomas "to keep his hardware in his pants." (Your Exact Words) I missed this in theaters and it's a good reason because I probably would have been kicked out due to the laughter I invaded at regular intervals. The first thing that went through my head was how weak these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their asses. Kurt Thomas is like 5 feet 4 and he hardly touches one as "The Best Man for the Job" As for Kurt Thomas's acting talent, well, if you can not say something good ... With all the seriousness you have who knew how much cocaine was being used to give such a stupid idea. Only the decision to climb Tara Reid as a scientist overcomes stupidity here. For 18 years, however, he retained the title of the most idiotic movie I've ever seen. Not to say that I did not find this unacceptable, I was laughing so hard I almost choked with death. Twice. Only in the 80's, a movie with such a bad idea can be made. Although for the record is the only film that has ever featured such a weak hero, he can not even pull a sword stuck on the ground. This is the most wimpiest action movie ever made, and one of the most hilarious ones as well. <br /> * out of 4- (Bad)
