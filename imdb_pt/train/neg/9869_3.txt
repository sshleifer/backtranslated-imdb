I did not care about the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** This was my first visit to your site ... just found the answer to my question. so now I look like a mannequin, but I think I'll still send my comments. and yes, British Columbia is lovely *** Or why did they take the scenery out of the South Carolina Coast? (this question remains) The place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the film. I just read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here's my other big problem with the movie. Kim Bassinger was very insipid and nothing of what I imagined in the book. I know, the book was the book and the movie; well not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathic. In addition, the book evoked rustic and almost primitive images of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was much more visually stunning, it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters.
