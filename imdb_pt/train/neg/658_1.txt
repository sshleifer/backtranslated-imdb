I wish I could give this movie a zero of ten. Before going to this movie the next day, I joined IMDb to check out the comments. One comment drew the predictable and tacky film with terrible dialogue. I never go for other people's opinions, so I lost seven dollars for this crap movie. It had to be one of the WORST films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff. Since when do horror films have sentimental scenes? I swear, I'm surprised there have not been moments of GROUP HUG ^. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And that's why I jumped, thinking of my research work in English. The clich√©, birds / cats popping out of nowhere when you THINK that something was going to happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost burst out laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, "I have to get my mother's shawl !!!" You idiot. Screw the shawl! Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mother's shawl (which did not fit the dress) is more important than my health and safety. And on top of that, they take her back home, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also anticipated the movie WHOLE. And not just the, I bet he's hiding under the bed moments. It was the "steal the messenger's clothes and sneak out of the hotel" and "It's the detective coming down the aisle, not the killer!" moments. Movies should NEVER be predictable. Disney movies are not even predictable. <br /> <br /> I will complete my speech by saying that it was a terrible movie. Glad I went to see the theaters so I would not buy it for $ 15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing had happened. If, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen in the same position in which he was shot. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on her way down. Oh, how lovely that would have been. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money. Go see a good movie.
