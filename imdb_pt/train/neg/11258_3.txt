I've said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, yet no one will give a shit. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a keen eye for the 1930s art deco (which I love), and I think the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds and such might actually be the wave of the future at the movies. However, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital rendering of his film, that he forgot to shoot many scenes that would have helped enormously this surprisingly thin film. (SPOILER) To cry loudly, they forgot to have a villain in this thing! Okay, they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years when the movie happens. Conran misses the point of having a villain. As for the action, let's see, Captain Sky (Law) knocks down a robot, two or three agitated winged planes (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop firing on them !!!), and some robots , but mostly he spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted on this film (the reviewer commenting on her lack of chemistry and Law is so correct) and I at least got a little sick of seeing repeated photos of top of your camera. showing that she only has two fingers out, both of which she subsequently misses in the movie, an unusual one, a very funny one, though I've seen it coming from 70 years away. No one, except Law and Paltrow, has any significant time on the screen, and that's the real flaw in the movie. An audience does not identify with robots, they need a hero to cheer and a villain despicable and visible to hate. Without this, plus a good story to go, the whole CG in the world will not help.
