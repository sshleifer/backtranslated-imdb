An endless frenzy of intelligent visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film. Half of the movie "Blonde Wig" never took off, perhaps due to too much self-indulgence on the part of its creators. <br /> <br /> Half Wong Faye (with a very playful, if Karen Carpenter looking, Faye Wong) holds much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however, the girl-boy story element lies in the back of the artistic cleverness. Character development is uneven. The emotion is missing. For music lovers, Wong Faye's "Mung Jung Yun" (Cantonese version of Cranberry's hit "Dreams") is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin version called "Zhen Tuo". Both are on CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" is found on the official CD of the movie soundtrack.
