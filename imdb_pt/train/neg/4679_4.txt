What a horrible movie. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but aside from some interesting pieces, the film is mostly used with hysterical subs screaming, crying, sweating and panicking when something goes wrong. Take this with simplistic asides to make sure the public still understands what's going on (the scene in which Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairer how he should be like Scotty in Star Trek is just a joke) and you have a dumb thriller that is not worthy of acting. <br /> <br /> Let's just hope that the real US nuclear armada is not in the hands of such a script! <br /> <br />
