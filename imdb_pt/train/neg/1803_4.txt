Here's one of those educational short films made to learn the unfamiliar people out there about the facts of life. This time, the target audience is pre-teen girls, the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some sponsorship from Kotex. <br /> <br /> Start by explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animation and a narrator, it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why it all leads to menstruation. It's almost incredible, making it the comical note here, as the subject of sex is avoided. Even the word is never mentioned, although "fertilized" happens once. I do not really know why I've seen this, but since it's one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to give it a try.
