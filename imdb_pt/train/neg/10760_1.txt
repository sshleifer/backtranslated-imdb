This "movie" is the culmination of all that is bad in modern cinema. unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary jumps / somersaults, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue ... basically unnecessary. (is that a word? well, it was just invented by me, Robot). <br /> <br /> What happened to practicality? (ie car garage, skin spray), the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the passage of the card in the cafeteria. <br /> <br /> What happened to showing respect for women? (that is, Smith's character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the movie, and yet she "wants" him.) WHERE IS THE TENSION? I'll tell you where, good looks and no admiration or basis common) <br /> <br /> What happened to a detective detecting? Smith did nothing but sit and feel sorry for himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something that triggered a thought he was out. this is such a bad way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc ... that was OK once, but not several times in a row. (speaking several times in a row, what was the phrase "I'm snoring and I'm not listening to you? Twice in a scene?") <br /> <br /> What happened to the small parts of a movie being something significant? and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes? Shia LaBeouf (the boy) is in the movie for a total of TWO SCENES, we know that A-he degrades women, and B- he knows Smith ....... then DE <br /> <br /> What happened to the hero? Let's forget that there are people, women and children everywhere being attacked by robots and selfishly saving the single My opinion that I know and why he had to push his bike through the air, showing off, while the doctor was able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot. <br /> <br /> do not get me wrong evil, I'm all for the show, but I'm also all for an ounce of realism and meaning. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I've never laughed quite so hard in a movie that I long ago. so thank you Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray that the swing of the social pendulum will return to simpler techniques, simpler and simpler stories in all the films, but mostly simpler techniques. <br /> <br /> Budget Action movies: "you have to die"
