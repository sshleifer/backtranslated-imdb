... this seems to be fooling people to see qualities in this movie that simply are not there. <br /> <br /> Near Dark covered the same territory, but with much more class and action. <br /> <br /> Why the script kept its "big secret" for so long was a mystery to me - I imagined it on the breakfast scene at the beginning of the movie. The moment it was revealed to the viewer, it was just a case of "big deal, tell me something I do not know". <br /> <br /> I thought this senseless movie might have challenged the genre. conventions, unfortunately these conventions are that horror films are tense and full of genuine sense of horror. This was unfortunate.
