This was a new all-time low among Westerns. The writing is terribly bad, the characters are impossible to emphasize and are disgusting or bland, violence is terrible and technically not very convincingly executed. And Tobey Maguire shows us the other side of his talent, sleepwalking on his part with those expressionless eyes and that husky voice of him that reveals only mannerism here. 'Ride With the Devil' is among my five worst movie experiences of all time, a western never to be outdone on the downside.
