I watched about 30 minutes for this movie before I finally got tired of being beaten in the head with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called "plot," and each actor. It's as if they all thought they were the main part of the movie and shouted "WARNING!" again and again. The bad guy has his bandit music going on and he says sinister bad guy stuff if you do not know. The good guy does brave and noble things just in case you do not know he was the good guy. And oh, sir, the plane scene. "MY HUSBAND IS MISSING! OH MY GOD! IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE LIES TO STRETCH THE LEGS OR GO TO THE BATHROOM OR ANYTHING, HE SHOULD BE BEING MISSING!" (And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and started to panic before she even had time to look at the damn seat where he was.) <br /> <br /> As a religious girl, I want to apologize to the world for wasting the film that was printed. <br /> <br /> And I want my 30 minutes back.
