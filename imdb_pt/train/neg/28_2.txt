This movie is terrible. You really do not need to read this review further. If you are thinking of watching it, just say - no (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie). <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible ... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out who he really is! A new bass even for him !! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. People who claim it's original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even with the standard of Hollywood action movies, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Do not watch !!! Go for a run instead - at least you will not feel like killing yourself.
