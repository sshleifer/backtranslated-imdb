Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, motivated career woman looking for working-class Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the field, they are brutally attacked. After the recovery, and after a casual encounter with one of the attackers, his thoughts turn to revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought "Straightheads" was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynist and unpleasant. If I did not dislike the phrase, I would call "Straightheads" an unpleasant video. Certainly it was the kind of movie that would have a budget-less release for the video during the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly I do not know how "Straightheads" has a movie release. <br /> <br /> I'm not prude. I do not care about sex and violence in movies, but they have to be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straightheads" had neither. No progression in the plot or in the characters and much left unexplained and unspoken. Luckily "Straightheads" did not get anywhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It was a shame because there was the germ of an interesting movie here, with an especially interesting twist on the plot of the last third. How many times do I say this, but it could have been good if it had been done correctly. What a pity. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they were in a hiding place for nothing with this movie. She, especially, is greatly underestimated (and is still particularly fit). <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows' "Dead Man's Shoes". It is a small work of art. Last weekend, I should have seen "This Is England". Ce sera sera ...
