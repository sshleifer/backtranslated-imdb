As said before, the visual effects are impressive. They are breathtaking. I personally use Blender and graphics like this are not at all easy. But that's all this movie is. It's not just the messy plot, but the global conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo are trying to get away from who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when they enter the room from the abyss, Proog explains that "one step out of place and (you're dead)". Here, there is a more precise conflict between careless man and nature. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly, there is a conflict between man and man when Proog, out of nowhere, kills Emo. Proog immediately changes from being a caregiver looking after a lost child to being a "sick man." He betrays us. This is not only depressing, but we do not care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed. It is not a story about someone, through the struggle, emerging stronger. It is depressing and makes no sense because there is no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light as a great drama does. In my opinion, the film is severely underdeveloped in every respect. However, the graphics are impressive, but a movie is much more than a simple eye salve. There is no truth, no struggle and a final bad surprise. In conclusion, an underdeveloped film without a dot. ... but the graphics are good.
