This is certainly a comedy I probably will not forget for a while. <br /> <br /> Usually, it would not bother to comment on this movie: it's so insignificant that nobody watches it anyway, but as it happens, it's very popular in p2p-sharing networks like Kazaa, and so this production of saaad must be exposed for what it is. <br /> <br /> So what is it then? Well, of course it's not really a comedy; instead, it is intended as a horror movie - "intended" being the very key word here. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess, special effects are special just because they are especially pathetic, and as for acting, well, let's just say that if this was my graduation party in elementary school, my teachers. We started crying with our talent. <br /> <br /> Of course I realize that this is a very low budget film and that in such cases we should lower expectations, certainly with regard to special effects. In addition, although I am a big fan of the horror genre, I am aware that these films are rarely places to look for interesting scripts and high-level acting. <br /> <br /> But still. B-movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humor. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear are in the ridiculous presentations. If you can find humor in it - and I could for the first 20 minutes or so, gradually dozing off after that - then that will be the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh, that's two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is not even try to convey anything: the victims use drugs and / or are involved in serious crimes. The lesson: Watch out, boys and girls mischievous, because one day you will have to pay for what you did. <br /> <br /> I rest my case. <br /> <br /> So, after all, a little sex, a good amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll. <br /> I rate this 1 out of 10, but would go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I do not: it deserves a 1 to correctly spell the names of the actors in the titles. I mean, this is something, right?
