Tony Scott destroys all that may have been interesting in Richard Kelly's clich√©, unequal and exaggerated script. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who gave up and became a bounty hunter. This is your story ... more or less. <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that there is not much history and the extreme graphic stylization of each Scott scene acts as a distancing mechanism. This leaves us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You just do not care about Harvey. Knightley interprets her as a cynical and unpleasant brat who did nothing to ensure our respect. She punches people she does not like and loses her clothes and inhibitions when the situation demands, but she's not at all real and Knightly is not at all convincing either. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. It's also loud and handcuffed to one of the most annoying scores I've heard in a long time. The final twenty minutes are a poor reprise of Scott's "True Romance" climax, with Domino's gang going to two groups of villains who are - surprise! surprise! - intended to shoot with others on top of a Las Vegas casino. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is totally misplaced by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, nonsensical exercise in celluloid masturbation. . This is not a work artistically brave or experimental; is a failure at all levels because it gives us no starting point for the lives and dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good as a graying bounty hunter, but he disappears in the background as the "narrative" progresses. Chris Walken turns into another embarrassing apparition and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underused. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the multifaceted surface and full of tricks of this film. Still sucks, no matter how much you polish.
