My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I also like him, but I generally thought he should "keep what he does best" and focus on comedic roles. My thoughts have been confirmed with this movie. I was completely bored all through the movie. The story was predictable. I realize that it was inspired by a true story. But my guess is that there might have been some suspense or intrigue, even keeping the truth in the story. Neither character was well developed. There was a parallel story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could have been explored further. More important, however, would have been a deeper exploration of the "boy's" mother. His psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into. She obviously has a long history that was not touched except in the most superficial way. If my husband was not a big fan of Williams, we would have 20 minutes off. Too bad I can not get my 20 or 2 hours back.
