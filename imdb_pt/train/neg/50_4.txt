Three "horror" movie with a guy in a board house begging the viewer not to go "out there" and (sadly) gives us three short stories to prove why. <br /> <br /> The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet two psychopaths. This leads to two totally predictable twists. Still, it's fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well done. Predictable but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large sum of money. His car breaks down, he is attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, poorly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes, this is too long. Good acting though. <br /> <br /> The third is just a horror story. It involves a beautiful and lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful scenery, a good erotic feel and a good sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely scary. <br /> <br /> Everything ends very stupidly. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's worth watching the first, but that's all. Tune in and turn it off.
