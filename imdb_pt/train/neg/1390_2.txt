I'm a big fan of the B5, having just picked up at the end of season three. I faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was distributed, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought-out story arcs that ever hit television. Even the filling episodes were interesting. The films, too, were well-produced and as entertaining as anything to get to theaters. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the 'River of Souls'. Of course, after seeing everything else, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen seems to be working on an Ed Wood movie instead of a serious science fiction story. The story itself may have looked good in outline form until it hit the story board. However, he obviously suffers when it comes time to fill that notion in a two-hour film. There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story. There are places where they obviously have little time and only improvise the dialogue to fill the story. If that had done the regular season, would have ranked among the worst episodes.
