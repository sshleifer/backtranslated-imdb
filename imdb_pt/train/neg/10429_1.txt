The first half was OK, but the last half really disappointed. It's funny the producers even admitted they did not have a clue to the end, and this actually did show. What's really sad is that I have to write ten lines of minimal comment to be able to post this. I really did not want to include spoilers to qualify my comments, since the show is not worth much. When Battlestar Galatica appeared for the first time I was very excited about the prospect of a better remake, it did not happen in the first season being a space porn. They eventually cleaned up a bit and really had a pretty fair drama, so I started watching again. But to end the series with kara being an angel cyclonic god, the same with baltar and six was very dumb.
