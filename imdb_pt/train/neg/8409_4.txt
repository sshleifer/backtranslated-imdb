Eddie Murphy for Best Supporting Actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) goes through this movie as a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? Was that acting ??? <br /> <br /> This movie pales in comparison to CHICAGO or any other recent musical. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the great singing and performance of Jennifer Hudson, I would have given a ZERO. <br /> <br /> And no, I've never seen the play, so I'm not doing the typical rap vs. Broadway. Hollywood.
