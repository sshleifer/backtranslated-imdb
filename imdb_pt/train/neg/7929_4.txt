I think if you like science fiction and horror stuff, it might be interesting. The acting was good, but not great. The two pregnant girls were supposed to be fifteen, but they are played by obviously older actresses, who were twenty-one at the time. The plot is good, but the story jumps a little, leaving one guessing whether you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the fold speed between the two. The Catholic church is portrayed as having a secret sect to investigate events that happen only to those of that faith. What if the two girls were Protestants? Do Catholics care? So some who planned. Who knows, one day the Catholic church may even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this one, do not feel like you've lost anything.
