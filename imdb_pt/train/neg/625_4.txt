With all the excessive violence in this movie, it could have been NC-17. But the gore could have been pg-13 and there were a lot of swearing when the mother had her stupid boyfriend. There was a lot of character development that made the movie better watch, so after the child came back to life as the scarecrow, there was an irrational hour and ten minutes of it killing people. The violence was excessively excessive and I think the number of people was greater than twelve, which is a large number of movies like this. Almost all the characters in the film are stabbed or have their heads cut off, but the teacher who called him "white trash" and "thug" (although the lester character is anything but a thug, not even close, I know hoods and I do part hood , they do not draw in the classroom, sit there and throw things at the teacher). The professor deserved a more horrible death than any of the characters, but was only stabbed in the back. There were two suspense scenes in the movie, but it did not last long enough to be scary. As I said, the murders were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with history cut their heads off. If the gore was really fun to watch, then it would be NC-17. Two boys describe a body they find in the cornfields, describing it as much fatter than it really was, they explained to the police officer that there were worms crawling in their intestines. Her stomach had not even been opened, so there was no form of worms in her stomach, though I'd like to see that. The acting was pathetic, the characters were losers, and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastic acrobatics. I suggest renting this movie for the death scenes, I will not see it again so soon, but I enjoyed the excessive violence. Also, do not worry about the sequence, I watched five minutes and was bored to death, looks good, but it is not. The original scarecrow actually kept me interested.
