OK, my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and about 30 minutes into the movie, we exchanged a lot of "ehhh, about what is this movie and more importantly, I care to find out what ends with" looks and decided or needed of drugs to keep us interested in the "plot" or just end the pain right there and watch something else. We opted for the latter. <br /> <br /> I really liked "But I'm a Cheerleader", but Mango Kiss is very silly and surreal to my liking, sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> -Sorcia
