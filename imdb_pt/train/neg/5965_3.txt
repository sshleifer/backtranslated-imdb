In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is beheaded and his lover Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. Nowadays, Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and their beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a session where they evoke the spirit of Alaric of Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade, a property of Hugo's family in the countryside, to look for a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the demon possesses them, bringing Mabille back to life and running the places in bloody sacrifices. After her father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he has the Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a pit; along with Maurice, they try to defeat the demonic Alaric of Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a box of horror with five DVDs of Paul Naschy for $ 9.98; despite not having references, I decided to seize the opportunity. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a B (or C) movie that immediately reminded me of Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is revealed through scriptwriting, directing, acting, cinematography, decorating, special effects and editing, plus many naked women. The result is simply hilarious and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
