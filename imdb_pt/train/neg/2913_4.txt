Of course it is great to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, however, I would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. from the script, which I believe was not a wise writing as some may think. especially the brawl of dialogues, which put the public in a position that, as if it were not intelligent enough to understand situations, which, most of the time, makes the film unbearable. also has an obvious end; you can easily guess the killer from the beginning. the weaker part of the scenario is that the inability of patients with severe mental disorders to act like normal people, as professionals immediately! they have already looked for the possibility of patients who are in heavy medical examinations, act as professionals and use all? The medical terms that even normal people can not use also in the scene where the team was looking for the most dangerous patient without any weapon to protect themselves was another strange point of the film. and this scene was so appropriate for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! these are not the only weak parts of the film. there were also many gems in the film. The most dangerous patient representation was an exact copy of Hannibal, also the appearance of Togan in the end is obviously the worst mistake he could have made in his first film! the fuss about the greatness of the film and the interviews the actor gave only made people curious and forced them to see him. Gen is a total disappointment. I would have asked myself, had Sahan not been so famous, would Togan be able to film this movie with this much of budget value? I hope Togan realizes that it is not fashionable to play a directorial role, as he said in an interview. it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is neither Hitchcock nor Shyamalan yet, hoping he will be more careful and creative next time in this great industry!
