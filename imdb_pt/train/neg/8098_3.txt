This is one of the most atrocious re-writings I have ever seen. If they want to make a movie with a bad story, they should refrain from giving a title to a good book. There is virtually no relationship between Wolfe's book and this film beyond the title. I do not mind changes if they help the flow of a story on the screen. At least the changes should not hurt the final product. The last scene of the film is painfully unconvincing. The actors are wrong. The director and / or scriptwriter obviously could not decide if he would make a faint comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon. <br /> <br /> If you saw this movie and did not like it, try the book. If you have seen this movie and liked it, read the book.
