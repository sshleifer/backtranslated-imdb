Be warned: this movie tells a lot of love stories without any consistency. <br /> <br /> The only intention of this movie seems to be to show love in many different ways. <br /> <br /> Each story takes only a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no plot. Just an incomplete idea of ​​a plot. The writer attempted to construct turning points that were intended to surprise the viewer. However, this did not work out because you did not know the characters before or these "jokes" were silly. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about love that does not reach your heart. . A dozen times. Or even more, I do not know and I do not care.
