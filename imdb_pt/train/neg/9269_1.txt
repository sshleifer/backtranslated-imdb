Well since seeing 1 to 3 part I can honestly say that they should never have been part 4. Everything from the tacky, and I want tacky punctuation for really bad acting, I challenge anyone to see this and not be bored out of their minds. <br /> <br /> I mean, parts 1 to 3 kept the vibration strong in Damian's plot, but without him around, it's not the same thing. Of course at the end of part 3 I was getting a little tired of the continuation of the story line, but it was a good closing at the end of the third. Again, there was no reason for a part 4. Even if there were they could have done a MUCH better job than that, I had to sit down, lol. There goes an hour and a half of my life that I will never see again.
