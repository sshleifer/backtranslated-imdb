After the success of the terrible movie achievements on Gilligan Island TV, several TV movies were made in the 1980s bringing together the cast of classic shows. Most of these movies completely missed the boat as much as recapturing the mood that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is one of the most disappointing because it is a Laurel and Hardy comedy style that really was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful and essential comedian for the series, is completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90-minute movie than in a single 30-minute episode. And since the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and reshaping them? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of Munsters' scary relatives was a nice touch, I did not like Sid Caesar as the wacky scientist mainly because there was so much of him and not enough of the underused Munsters (ironically that same year, 1981, Caesar's former partner). in the comedy, Imogene Coca, was also improperly cast in an important part in a TV movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange inexplicable part at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures in a local horror wax museum. Why would they be there when they should be a "typical" (though strange) American family, not famous monsters? This was the last Munsters project with the original cast in their roles, there was a terrible revival of the series in the late 1980s with a completely new cast and a 1990 TV movie that featured DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick in roles as a family dinner.
