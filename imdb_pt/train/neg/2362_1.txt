The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horror movies of all time. This is the most crappiest. When I sat down to watch this, I was really thinking how bad the fourth and fifth were, this would have to be good after the terrible previous ones. Boy was I wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first ten minutes, I was really tempted to turn it off, but I thought not, maybe it will get better. This did not happened. <br /> <br /> Not only is this just a ghastly movie by itself, it did not need another sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) had already been terrible enough! Also, how often can you bring Freddy back? The acting on it was TERRIBLE, the plot was predictable and crap and also had flaws in it. The way they did Springwood was totally wrong. Does not respect the first in everything. To add to that, the whole thing seemed really exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Some people are saying that this movie was "funny". This movie is not "funny" at all. Since when was Freddy Krueger supposed to be "funny"? I would call that a crap. This movie is supposed to be a horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, that information would not have popped up like the first !? The ending was also just stupid and tacky, just like the rest. It completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first. It just shows. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Wes Craven has created something so good at first, even though it has been dragged down because of that garbage that belongs to the trash. They should not even bother making this movie. Nor any of the other sequences, except the third. The third is the only decent of all sequences. If this were a DVD by itself and it was not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD I had, I would have thrown it out when I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A pathetic and poor attempt at a sequence. <br /> <br /> - a complete MOCKERY from the first movie <br /> <br /> So, please, do not waste time on this worthless junk.
