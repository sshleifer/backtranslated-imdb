Even for a weary film model like the nature versus man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s, ants fall far short of being effective even though for amusing reasons they did not mean to. It's so absurd. Apparently, these ants that have been demolished near a lodge have been eating poisonous garbage for decades and now have adapted by issuing venomous stings - hundreds of these bites are fatal. Watching the actors of some notoriety falling awkwardly amidst tiny black spots is painfully funny in a not so good but very bad way. So many scenes look ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into a bin while under attack, Suzanne Sommers screaming in horror as she rests on the bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through wallpapers, Bernie Casey pretending to be a toy leg, and the list goes on and on. to be continued. The danger shown varies from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls. The cast of the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seems to believe the material. Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror. I hope she has found a good use for the money, as it is obvious that was the only reason a woman of her pedigree would be absurd. Although it's a very bad movie, it's watchable - once for me, and has many of those 70's qualities of bad movies - start-studded actors embarrassing themselves, who made for TV feel, and fearful nature creatures sniffing revenge on men. This time, the man must push his hand on a pile of ants to be affected. Really very terrible.
