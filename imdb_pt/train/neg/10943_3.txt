This is a very bad movie, with bad acting and a very annoying pace, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! All the characters are just annoying (except Lamas), and there's absolutely no one to cheer or care for!, Plus the action is pretty boring. The movie gives us 3 villains who should find it threatening and upsetting when in fact there are annoying, laughable and just a bunch of idiots that I wanted to shut up! Besides looking very cheap and amateurish. Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but he can not save that crap, and believe it or not, the opening was really cool, as well as the end, however, the medium is incredibly annoying, and made me feel like pushing. the fast forward button!, plus The dialog box is especially laughable! There's a cool bar scene that I really enjoyed but once Lamas heads to the dock it all collapses, plus the scene where the villains torture Jennifer's family and kills them. It was to be considered disturbing when in fact it's laughable! . This is a very bad movie, with bad acting and a very annoying rhythm, however, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool !, but not enough, not recommended. The direction is very bad. George Erschbamer does a very poor job here with mediocre camera work, bland location and keep the movie at a tedious pace. The acting is very bad (except for the lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is incredible here, and while he is not required to act, he is very fun to watch, and has a very cool character, and had a lot of charisma, however even he can not save this, and he had no chemistry with the cast too! (Lamas Rules!). Josie Bell is terrible here, and although it sounds decent, she's not very convincing and did not have chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but there is not much to do but scream and scare, she did okay. Robert Scott is INCREDIBLY annoying as the main villain, and was not threatening, he was laughable as were the other two. The rest of the cast is bad. Overall, avoid! Avoid! Even if you like Lamas (like me). * of 5
