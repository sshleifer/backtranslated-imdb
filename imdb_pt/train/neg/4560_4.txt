Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment for me. Although the actors have done a good job, especially Smith, there is not a cure for a bad script once in production. The film actually had a "sequel" feel, producing partial events from the first film. The story was, in a word ... bad, at best. It was not well thought out, and it seemed very unstable and inconsistent at times. <br /> <br /> In the first film, the MIB Organization had a kind of elite force. You had some special agents and had a "clandestine" feeling. In the sequel, the MIB Organization has a JROTC summer vibe. <br /> <br /> The film was nothing terrible ... just lacked the "freshness" (for lack of a better phrase) of the first film. movie. Much of the same old humor was recycled from first to second, and really did not add any originality to the MIB Universe. <br /> <br /> A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 for the first 3 movies. Was it decent? Yes. Is it worth the title? Not really.
