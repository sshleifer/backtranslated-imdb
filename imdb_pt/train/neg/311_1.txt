I just watched Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send each copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I even tried to get a blind woman to watch and she hung up in 20 min. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for writing, if that's what you want to call, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell !! I believe somewhere I read that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and they were way down. Wallmart got a good deal on that? Every store has a huge box of that shit on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a coaster, or swap it with a friend, but they may no longer be your friends!
