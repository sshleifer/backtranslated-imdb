I could not agree more with another reviewer who mentioned Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be totally boring and uninspired to be "wise in terms of content." He can produce eye drops (and I like candy), but his pretense and his fundamental artistic emptiness diminish all joy. <br /> <br /> I fear that many people do not distinguish between similar works (but really only on the surface) of Jodorowsky or even more linear filmmakers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love 2001 Odyssey and I've never been bored in the final scenes ..) .) Such art as that of M. Barney adds to the confusion and alienates viewers who might begin to enjoy experimental cinema. Typical postmodern "conceptual" art. And check out their interviews. I just do not buy, sorry. It's so boring. <br /> <br /> I've never been bored watching Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, while Drawing Restraint 9 was an absolute disappointment. Especially while offering the possibilities of being something, to actually say something in a non-linear non-linear way (like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and the preparations for the ship to leave. as a valuable object (if it was feces) Those divers "pearl" ... Everything could build a great surreal film with some content. vain and false and philosophically pretentious, but can it be empty? <br /> <br /> I have great picturesque scenes, but the whole movie has become so boring and pretentious and totally empty and false that it made me physically sick. > <br /> And it does not have good rhythm, I like slow-paced movies, but this was boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and false - so I was forced to witness extended scenes of artistic vanity ... <br /> < > <br /> This kind of movie only kills the art and spiri In my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
