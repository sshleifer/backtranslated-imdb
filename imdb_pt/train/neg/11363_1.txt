This movie was announced on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every issue. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But, oh boy, how sad this movie is! It's a Hollywood movie about a movie in a movie. Shades shows so clearly we are not ready to produce "big Hollywood movies." I'm not movie critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As my subject line says, it's nothing and then looping. You could just look at the television too without actually seeing anything. That was the feeling we had when we saw Shades. Shades is a bad production !!!
