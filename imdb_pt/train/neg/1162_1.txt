I went to see this movie in our college theater thirty years ago, because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still the most foolish movie I've ever seen. He simply went on with no discernible point and then - it was over. The lights came on and I watched everyone looking around, confused. Had the projectionist lost a reel? I never had the urge to find out. All I remember about the movie is that it was a non-drama about some annoying college basketball players and their trainer. The most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the thoroughly mystified audience afterwards. Luckily, this was only an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
