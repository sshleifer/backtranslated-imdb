Basically, take the concept of all Asian horror ghost movies and smash them into one and you'll get that movie. The story goes like this: A group of college students receive voice messages from their own phones that are predicting their deaths. There's some shit going on with ghosts, which if you've ever seen some Asian ghost movie, it's not scary right now. This movie was quite disturbing because it's too cliché. It's the same bullshit, different movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good. Unfortunately the actors are put in a very squalid situation, so it's nothing we have not seen in the past. However, the two leaders did a solid job. <br /> <br /> As far as blood goes, there is not much going on. We get a cool string that includes an arm twisting a head out (I do not know how to explain it) but it has been hacked so you do not see anything beyond the end result. You see some blood sometimes, including decapitated arms and a zombie (which looked pretty cool I could add), but this movie is not very bloody. <br /> <br /> The scares in the movie are few and far between and it really is not that scary. You will get some scary pictures at times, but it is not enough for me to consider scary. It's nothing different from Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water, and none of them scared me either. That's really the downfall (and most Asian horror movies) is that if it does not give the scares, then it's not so good. <br /> <br /> As for the direction, Takashi Miike still did a good job. job. He seemed a bit tamed in this movie compared to his previous films, but he still portrays much of his confusing style by which he became famous. Many pictures were very similar to Miike (including a scene with a lot of jars of dead fetuses), and the last 15 to 20 minutes looked much more Miike than the rest of the movie. Still, the film is flawed by its lack of originality. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this only to people who are huge in Asian horror movies (even if you are, I recommend it much better) or great Miike fans. Warning for those who want to get into Miike, this is not their best job. <br /> <br /> I will give a 4 because it is mediocre. Maybe if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher rating. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to talk about Asian horror films very fast. How is it if an Asian horror movie is automatically supposed to be good here (US)? MANY of these movies are the equivalent in Japan to what Scream, Urban Legends and I know what you did last summer were here in the 90's. If you saw one that saw them all. And many of these films depend heavily on scares and images that, if they do not result in scares, then they are not so good, and nothing would change that. More Asian horror movies need to be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two films that, if they do not scare or scare you, at least they have great stories, acting, direction, cinematography and more to support them. . Two movies that are not only great horror movies, but great movies in general. More Asian horror movies need to be so instead of the cliché, "A ghost just wanted to be found, killing people using their phone / video cassette / house / appliances / water pipes / google search engine / vibrator / grocery / etc"
