A story of incredible disinterest kills "The Psychic" over and over again. The characters and plot are completely uninteresting (such as Fulci's crazy camera work, which is usually a redeeming factor in his films), and any understanding of suspense is nowhere to be found. It is to an unbearable degree - in the end, you will not complain of excitement, but rather of boredom (and, like me, perhaps an uncontrollable desire to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves more occupancy in a better movie. Fulci gorehounds care - there is not much happening in "The Psychic". <br /> <br /> 3/10
