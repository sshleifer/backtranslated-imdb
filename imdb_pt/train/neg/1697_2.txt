I'm a big fan of David Lynch and I have everything he did on DVD, except at the Room Hotel & 2-Hour Twin Peaks movie. So when I discovered this, I immediately got it and ... and ... what is it? It's a lot of roughly drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and dirty and dull. Maybe I do not know what's good, but maybe it's just a load of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of David Lynch to win some change too. Let me make it clear that I did not mind the improper language part, but I had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors could have it. In short, this is a highly disappointing launch and may well have been left in the luxury box as a curiosity. I recommend that you do not spend your money on this. 2 out of 10.
