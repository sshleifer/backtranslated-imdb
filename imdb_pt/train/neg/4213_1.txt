Wow, I'm a big fan of the Henry VIII / Tudor era and, well, that was ... interesting. The only one I saw was Catherine of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I've seen bad acting before, but this has hit new heights. When was the actress who played Catherine crying? She moans and screams and I have to admit that I rewound many times ... over and over ... funny and funny things. The only person who showed a little talent was the actress who plays Ana Bolena (I can be prejudiced, I have a slight obsession with Ana Bolena, she was a woman who really pretends, read about her, it's worth it!) I also read a lot about the Tudor time period and I think the characters were not very well displayed, they were all very stereotypical.Just see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important period of time, and the important lives of those involved have become a laughingstock.
