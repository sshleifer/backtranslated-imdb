Was there a single positive for this movie? Critics who knew nothing about video games could identify the gaming mistakes they made. No damage received with clearly visible damage to the beginning is a prime example. <br /> <br /> And I may have missed something, but it was not Super Mario Bros. 3, suppose it's a game I'd never played before? Well, if that's the case, and I did not miss anything ... how does Fred Savage's character, and even the girl, know a lot about the game? We are talking about things that some people do not know in their second or third version. <br /> <br /> In addition to factual errors and gaming errors, there is the overall poor quality of the film itself. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The kid was not so good at playing video games on the movies they were showing. Many children I met at that time were significantly more experienced. In addition to all this, the acting and plot are mediocre at their strongest points. The characters are soft and completely uninteresting, the 'Mago' (the youngest son) is a very silent and completely dry children's clich√© of a child who almost never speaks because of a trauma. Not that this is unrealistic, is the fact of having to be played in the movie to really start forming a plot that would exceed 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only value that should be found here is that of a nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie, you'll like it if it was good or not. It was about kids playing video games, and by the time you saw them, you probably had an obsession with the NES as well. But unless you love her as a child, there is simply nothing that will keep you interested and very little that will stop you from turning it off. <br /> <br /> No, sir, I did not like it. .
