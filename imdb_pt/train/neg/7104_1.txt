The producers of this film offer to pay for the funeral expenses for those who die of fear while watching this film. They should have offered intensive psychotherapy to anyone who really liked that stink. A young couple moves into a house where a woman who looks like the couple's wife lives. Extremely annoying and very predictable. In the end I did not care about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
