I think I was drawn to this movie by both the sound of the story and the lead actor, so I gave it a go, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is raised by the police, especially superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to flee by forming a gang and go against them to clear their names and those of his family. That's all I can say about the story, since it did not pay attention to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger does a good performance, so it's worth it, and the film has compelling moments, particularly with an armed battle at the end, but I can not say I liked it, since I did not look at everything. OK!
