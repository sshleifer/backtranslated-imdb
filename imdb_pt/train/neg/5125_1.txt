As a youth pastor, I heard good things about this movie. So I watched. The performance was not the best. This is forgivable. It is the message that is not: give Jesus your life and everything will change - you will face better, you will make incredible catches, you will stop hassling, you will begin to make passes for the touchdown and you will even make the playoffs. All because Jesus magically transforms smaller fights into American athletes. I laughed out loud when a coach quoted the scriptures to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. But wait, that's not all. You'll get a brand-new truck, an increase of $ 6,000, and your and your wife's struggle with infertility will end suddenly in pregnancy-twice. So you're going to win the state championship because God helps a weak man kick the winning goal 12 yards more than he's kicked before - and the wind, not less - all because "God wanted him to do it." Then you will win the state championship again next year. None of these good things would have happened had the team not chosen to follow Jesus with all their heart. <br /> <br /> Here's what I got out of the movie: God can do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. He picks his favorite team and helps them win games. Which bible is this story based? I bet St. Stephen wanted to know the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. Someone should have made this film before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. That would have saved them all from a lot of trouble.
