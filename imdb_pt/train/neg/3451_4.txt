Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for Westerners. He was a great actor, from Here to Eternity and The Man with The Golden Arm are proof of that, but he did not have the physique of a Western hero, you identified him as an urban guy. But he tried to do his job well on Johnny Concho, the fact that the movie was a flop at the box office was not his fault. I blame two factors: a) The story was very unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie. In a genre where people expected a certain pattern, to get away from it, the movie has to be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole city will allow Sinatra to do what he wants just because he is afraid of his brother. Also, when a man shows you a special holster that opens on the side so he does not have to pull the gun, you wonder if that would make him invincible, why did not all gunmen adopt him? I think this movie should not have been taken away, because any movie with Sinatra is worth seeing, and despite its flaws it's still nice
