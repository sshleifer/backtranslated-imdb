OK. So there are not many great movies out there. Recent gems like American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 usually do not come that close. But boy (!) Makes this movie counterbalance the quality. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people thought they were doing. Are the financiers of this world so easily convinced to fund this pot of shit? I can only see now ... Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes.He's cute as a button and was very good at Shakespeare in Love.And we have Rhys Ifans, who is not cute but it was cool in Notting Hill, let's mix in a really mediocre track, some forgettable post-Britpop songs, hemlock root and lizard brain, and hey, ready, you have the worst movie of the new millennium And believe me, it's going to be hard work to do something as bad as that in the next thousand years. "<br /> <br /> The Bank -" I like it! Any unnecessary sex? Bad camera moves? And what about the worst accents of this Devil himself? "Producer -" Yes, we have a lot of these. "<br /> <br /> The Bank -" Sounds great, where do we sign? "<br /> <br /> Please.
