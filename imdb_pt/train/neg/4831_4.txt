I rented this movie on Netflix after it won all the Oscars, to see if it was really good. <br /> <br /> The Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrait (for the most part) of a group of soldiers rotating. in Iraq. The film revolves around Will James, a reckless soldier who takes the adrenaline to risk, and disarm bombs. <br /> <br /> Where this movie seems to be missing, in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie. This movie has no clear plot unlike other films like Black Hawk Down. What this movie tries to do is to focus more on the characters and their different attitudes towards the war. Bigelow does a good job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the movie where the dialogue seems to drag on. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, but looks like a 3 hour movie. <br /> <br /> A scene from the movie that was particularly horrible, and ruined the perfect credibility of the movies, was the crime scene in the middle of the film. It was both unreal and very long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought the movie was fine, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was because it was a big disappointment to win the Best Picture award. at the Oscars. I felt that this movie could have been a lot better, considering that Private Ryan's Rescue lost the Best Picture, but it was a lot better than this movie. Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down, which won only 2 Oscars. I honestly do not know how this won the best picture. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an action-packed action movie, rent Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.
