Is not it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happening to him, turning his life upside down and causing him to learn some valuable lessons along the way? That formula never gets old, does it? It's such a safe way to make a classic movie! Just look at great hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... This must have been the line of thought of Rob Schneider when he made Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and followed him with The Animal. Since I have already traced the plot through sarcasm, allow me to color it in more: Schneider plays a loser cop who is suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery ... by a loopy vet who carries it with parts of animals, making him neigh as a horse at improper times, running like a cheetah, and so on. This movie is a bit more enjoyable than other films starring Schneider (as another lame follower to the same plot, The Hot Chick), but it almost seems like they want the audience to hate this by launching a reality show star as the romantic protagonist (Colleen Haskell of "Survivor") and inserting a special participation of Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... it just does not exist. Sorry - nothing is memorable except the production value. I just want to finish this review by saying that small references to other movies in a movie may be fine, but when it comes to lines being delivered exactly the same way ("You CAN DO this!"), There is a word for this - "Milking ". In fact, here is another word - "cheap."
