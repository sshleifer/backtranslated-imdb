A fairly obvious thriller-by-numbers, in which the only possible twist is hiding out of nothing. I was watching mainly for the presentation in English of Isabelle Huppert. It was not great, but it was a weird part. I would not be surprised if half of his contribution was left on the floor of the editing room along with several last minute script rewrites. <br /> <br /> Acting is the least appealing thing about this movie. . Steve Guttenburg looks like he's trying to develop his role with the charm that everyone told him he has. There is a sensationally stupid sequence in which it is suggested that your sexual prowess will be able to help treat PTSD. It's an uninteresting performance. Elizabeth McGovern is another draw with charm and genuine character, but it's a little consolation. 3/10
