Yes, I sat through the whole thing, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was very cold outside, okay, those are ragged excuses, but they are the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of 10 possible - I've seen worse movies, but this one is definitely right there in the old dumpster of bad cinema - poor screenplay, poor acting, poor lighting, and extravagant special effects . The plot, which never makes complete sense, revolves around this small, simple family, Daddy, Mommy and Little Girl - which I assume the viewer should be "identifying", all three were tedious and annoying . You just want the dark side to get each one of them. <br /> <br /> Dad is a cook whose hobby are cars. Dad meets a rich man named Rubin, who collects cars and who also owns a being that he bought in the "mysterious" East. Rubin keeps him in a cage and refers to him as "The Darkling". During the course of the movie, Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us and in the Devil. So choose any of those explanations you like - because, believe me, it does not really matter. <br /> <br /> Darkling's main problem seems to be the desire to have a mate. You get a human companion - and eventually become dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the human who connects with Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us - this leads to a very long and tedious film. . <br /> <br />
