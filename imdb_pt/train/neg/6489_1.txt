What seemed like a good premise for a movie ... unfortunately, it fails on almost every level. Very hard to follow, at the beginning of the film, I really saw myself struggling against the desire to turn it off. The biggest problem of a visual aspect is the fact that the work of the camera is simply exaggerated, with so many splicing and semi-artistic effects. subliminal cuts throughout the film that really distract him from the overall story. It really does try to immerse you right now and build a suspense ending, but the film has so many half-conceived characters and a non-relevant script that leaves you disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go that deep.
