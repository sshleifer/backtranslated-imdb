Steven Seagal seems to be sleepwalking through a horrible movie filmed almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. Picking up technical flaws - the F / A-18s and F-14s of silver leave a carrier for an air strike, and miraculously become F-16s camouflaged for the attack - would give this film more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the film are credit titles that disappear and disappear in a flash, presumably available to all Final Cut Pro users. Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category than Marcel Mandu.
