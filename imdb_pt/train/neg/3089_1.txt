This movie is so bad, it's comical. In fact, Mystery Science Theater 3000, the television program in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used that same movie to mock. I suggest watching (maybe on YouTube) instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch Hobgoblins if you are not prepared to stop at the first scene. In fact, I do not see this movie, period. Please. At least not seriously. Your jokes are not funny (to say the least), and you will have a lot of fun parodying or watching a parody of it, then watching the movie. <br /> <br /> You may feel sick while watching, so spare yourself. Read a book. Wash the clothes. Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
