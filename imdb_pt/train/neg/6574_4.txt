(Avast, small spoilers ahead) I received this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I went once to the town of Matewan, West Virginia, and in a small museum there. I saw the schedule for the city theater in May 1954. The movies changed in the theater every day. As there would be no TV for another decade in those parts, this was a lot of the entertainment available in the city. "The Raid" seems to have been made for cities like Matewan in the 1950s. Although not listed for that month, I'm pretty sure I showed some Mondays or evenings to an audience that was probably not that picky. The historic attack - bold and incredibly successful - does not seem to have been very well researched, so the film is full of Hollywood decorations, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to practice being Liberty Valance. And St. Albans seems to have had more Yankee soldiers coming and going through the city than Washington DC had. <br /> <br /> What really made me laugh was when the invaders became Confederate uniforms. Only in Civil War cheesy paintings do the rebel uniforms seem so immaculate. When Anne Bancroft's son catches Van Heflin in his uniform shortly before the attack, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And then there's Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie, I actually looked in the IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. The actress hired by the studio does not look anything like her later films, and does not have the presence she would later have in "The Miracle Worker," "Agnes of God," and, of course, "The Graduate." <br /> It is worth to see if only 1). you live in St Albans and 2). you have a few hours to kill in a Hollywood fiction the greatest story of your hometown.
