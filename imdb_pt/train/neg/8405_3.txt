Before seeing this movie, I was expecting a fictional drama loosely based on book ideas; instead, it is the book, interrupted by dramatic scenes illustrating the different "diseases." This did not bother me much, but it disrupted my pleasure in the movie. A story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed in the film would have been preferable in my opinion. If you're going to base a movie on a psychology text, you'll have to find a more interesting (and preferably more accurate) text than this. The film drags on for parts where it is little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be completely intolerable if it were not of a sexual nature (because "sex = interesting" to most of us, even to me) . Fortunately, there are several stories with real character development that draws us. <br /> <br /> But, disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's theories of sexuality have not been contested for the most part. I was hoping he would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology are still held by many to this day. <br /> <br /> So in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of some fetishes and orientations, with some slightly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of some "sexual deviants" before being cured. For most of the movie, the movie moves with the tracking speed (and mood) of a wake. And, as an obviously low-budget film, cinematography and acting are not exactly top-notch. Although I was * satisfied with the music, the costumes and the interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt that the subject of this movie was my way, and I still feel it is a below average movie. Deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if I was feeling extremely generous. I can not imagine anyone liking this if they no longer had an interest in sexual fetishism.
