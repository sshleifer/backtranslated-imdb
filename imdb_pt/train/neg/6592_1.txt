Brief summary: This movie demeans everyone it touches. That means you. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that I am not a purist, and this may have been funny for a few minutes. Imitations are not bad. But overall it's just boring and unbearably not funny. Some simple jokes are repeated over and over again. <br /> <br /> Of course this movie exists only to extract the last few dollars from the now-recognized Laurel and Hardy brand. Producers can not have any real consideration for their place in film history, or their talents. That's what offended me the most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I'm also a failure as a parent;)
