It's rare that I come across such a horrible, annoying and annoying movie. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot, when it is not a confusing and pointless blur about the flashy edition, is ridiculous. Why did Domino become such a tough bitch? Because her golden fish died when she was a child and this "traumatic" event left her emotionally atrophied and hating everyone. When dialogue is not clich√©d or banal, it is filled with laughable lines such as: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else." At one point, bounty hunters have a guy tied at the back of the bus that has a combination number tattooed on his arm. Because of a confusing phone call, instead of rolling the sleeve up and just reading the number, they let go of his arm with a shotgun. Elsewhere, bounty hunters take a bomb to an organized mob meeting and threaten to drop the bomb unless the mob lets them go! Clearly not going to the meeting would have been too easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is not convincing and has a very bad rating. Mickey Rourke can save some credibility from this mess. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films being True Romance One, but all I could think of while suffering from this nonsense is that it must have been made by a complete idiot.
