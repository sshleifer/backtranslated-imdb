I thought My Favorite Martian was very annoying and pulled out !! It was not funny at all. The audience was seated throughout the movie and did not laugh at all !!! Neither the kids laughed !! This is sad for a Disney movie !! I thought they might have found someone better to play Martian instead of Christopher Lloyd !! He was very stupid !! And he was not funny !! I thought the talking costume was really stupid !!! In the original television series, the costume does not talk and moves !! In my opinion, they should not have wasted their time on this movie !! I give you two thumbs down !! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend the movie to anyone !!! Thank you!!
