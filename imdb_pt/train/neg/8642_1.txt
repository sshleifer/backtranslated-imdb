I have to say that this is a horrible movie, for the simple fact that when you see this movie in the guide, it is listed as a documentary. As I watched, I started to laugh, thinking to myself, does this guy really expect me to believe this is real? So I had to look, and now I see it's a movie, but now, as it's not a documentary, it's a shoddy movie right now. So, anyway, it's too bad. I really have not come to an end. I had to turn it off. I am a NYC cop, and I felt that someone was trying to fool people into thinking this is a documentary, with the intention of making money with a terrible day for me and my coworkers. So, I took a little personal. Maybe I've gone blind with it, and it's not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
