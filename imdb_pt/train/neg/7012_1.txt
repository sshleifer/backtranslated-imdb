Me and my girlfriend went to see this movie as a "Premiere Surprise" that we bought in the ticket for a movie premiere before being opened here in Denmark. We sat for the first hour or so and then we left! The purpose of the film seemed to be simply to portray the era (and club 54), but it did so in the expansion of the development of the character, of which there was none, and the plot of which there was little. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I been so indifferent to the characters in a movie! <br /> <br /> The music was good. So, if you like listening to good music and getting a feel for the 70's mood, I think it's okay. But do not expect to get a plot of credible characters. <br /> <br />
