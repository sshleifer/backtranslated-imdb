I saw an early screening of this movie in New York and I, along with my friends and virtually the entire public, were very disappointed. The movie was not that bad, it was good; He was as lifeless as a snake bite victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired for the most part and the snake's effects were lame. It reminded me of one of those full of science fiction movies, except that the fight in this movie was not funny or even exaggerated. Everything seemed worn, flat and overtly stereotyped. I'm shocked to say that I really think Anaconda was more fun. It is easy to understand that SOAP realizes that it is a piece of it and plays along with it, but what the movie can not upload is a script that has any suspense. It's the worst kind of lame movie: it's no joy.
