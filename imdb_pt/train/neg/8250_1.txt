I ordered the Korean movie because I was an extra and was interested to see how it was ready. <br /> <br /> After watching him, I can say that I'm ashamed to have had a part of him. I feel ashamed not only for myself but for all those who have played a part in producing this scorn in British comedy. From beginning to end, the film is predictable, boring, tedious, monotonous, and I hurried to the point where on several occasions I actually looked away from the screen in disbelief. Until you really see the movie, it's difficult to conceive how a romantic comedy can be romantic and not comical. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad story, but a bad movie. In a scene, you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the S.As you move around. I'll post details of this in the 'Goofs' section. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it filled me with emotions (disappointment, anger, embarrassment?)
