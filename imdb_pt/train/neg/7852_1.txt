I'm not a fan of horror movies, but my wife's nephews and nieces are. So I saw the first movie. It was awful and tense, but not my taste. Still good though. For similar reasons, at this very moment, I am being exposed to a sequel. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is beyond the absurd. I can buy disasters in the desert. I can buy mutants there. I may even believe events can be so strange and strange that the military can decide to get involved. It is unlikely, yes, but I am willing to suspend my belief. <br /> <br /> However, under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the military squad designated to recognize such an area would be unable to defend the mutants. As a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that while new recruits may not have the experienced eye and experience of combat soldiers, these recruits would be integrated into a capable squad. <br /> <br /> A squad of armed soldiers are not about to be taken away by some mutants with knives. That's how it works. Squadron moves, vastly superior firepower, and of course radio support, would guarantee nothing less than total victory. I'm not saying you would not have casualties, but once the area was checked as hostile, military training would take precedence, no one would go out alone to use the bathroom. <br /> <br /> And if it were discovered that the area was so infested with enemies that the squadron was unable to deal with the danger, they would seek support. And believe me, your radios would not be bogged down, if there was a chance normal radios would not do, the squad would have a satellite phone for military matters. Chances are, if they could not check in every hour, a search would be made. <br /> <br /> To accept this movie, you must accept that our soldiers are fools incompetent, with incompetent leaders, and an incompetent chain of command. While it is still true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with map and compass, our military forces are full of intelligent, well-trained and competent soldiers. Mutants with knives are far below our ability to cope. <br /> <br /> With all the running of the movie depending on the impossible, the movie fails. Instead, we are expected to believe that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are unable to cope with the most mediocre threats. <br /> <br /> As a combat veteran, I find the movie insulting.
