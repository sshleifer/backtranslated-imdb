I must admit I've been a sucker for the Samurai movies as long as I can remember. I used to watch quite indiscriminately, be it "elitist" works like The Seven Samurai or the bloody variation of comic strips like Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked American and Japanese "Crossovers" like The Bushido Blade. And of course, everything that contains Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I practically watched each Samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993, I watched Kabuto for the first time on video, even Samurai movies can be boring. At first I was anxious for Mayeda to arrive in Europe and the clashes that would come from it, but when he actually arrived in Spain, I did not really care so much about the film. <br /> <br /> I would not do justice to the movie to call it "bad." Technically, it's a clean entry into the genre. But it just never gets quiet enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as a director and actor and has only a fraction of the charisma of the Japanese actors mentioned above. And speaking of Sho Kosugis son Kane, who appears in almost every Sho Kosugi film as son of Shos: he inherited little or no of the limited acting abilities of his parents. Adding to the negative points is the absence of blood and blood that until then was a trademark of all Samurai films. This was obviously meant for a younger US / Europe audience. <br /> <br /> Let's just say it's such a movie for fans of historical action adventure, but a boring one for fans of Samurai cinema. Fans that are in the genre "Samurai meets ??" - should prefer to watch Red Sun (1971), featuring Charles Bronson as a cowboy who has to team up with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to retrieve a samurai sword from bandit Alan Delon. . It's practically how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> So, even if the film is only 100 minutes, it seems like a much longer movie. <br /> <br /> The reason I gave this honorable 4/10 points instead of 3/10: First time I saw this movie, I saw in the German version synchronized. In this version, Kosugi can actually be understood. I must admit that your 'Engrish' is sometimes funny, but it gets tiring after about 30 minutes.
