The writing on the screen is so stupid that it disturbs me to lose 2 hours of my life. I'll never come back (where I've heard it before). That's how it works. Things change often enough to keep you watching and expecting something horrible to happen. However, there is not a single original thing in this movie. While the first Cube was a nerd horror movie, it did not make much sense in the end, the zero cube learned about it and tries to recount exactly the same story except that this time it's a detestable point to try to spoil-feed explanations for every detail that the first film did not respond. The comic book is that the director recycles the exact scenes of the first film that were somewhat strange and tries to explain them. But the scenes are simply copied, there is no coherence at all. This script is so useless. I can imagine this being written by a 15 year old boy with a baseball cap and a beer package for a class project. The best part is that in the end they cripple the "good" type of prodigy, and he becomes the retarded subject in the first movie, and you see him when they find him ("this room is green ...") in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, clap clap, what a turnaround. First of all, what happens if you have not seen the first one, this does not make any sense to your director. Ah, another great idea: instead of the numbers to identify the x, y, z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time are 3 letters, each giving one of 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. Except now permutations no longer make sense ... so he lets the cards disappear before anyone can use them ... I want my money back. <br /> <br /> I think I had to write this as there are just so many bad, inconsistent, or stupid ideas in this movie. Directors / writers should be required to possess some talent.
