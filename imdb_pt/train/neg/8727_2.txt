Let me start by saying that I can enjoy any bad Italian horror film or the 1970s jungle exploration film. Seriously. This one is absolutely awful. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that Martino tries to inject and none of them works (except the thing that has already been done) very well. There are some ignorant westerners, of course, who set up a jungle resort somewhere. I do not even remember where this happens ... how sad is it ... Basically, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its' ceremonies, but eventually they disturb the 'Alligator God' of the river which then proceeds in a riot, killing tourists and some members of the tribe as well. Sounds good, yes? Well, do not be hopeful. There is a minimum of violence to the end, the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class presented them and the love story involved is laughable. <br /> <br /> There are seriously some scenes in which it looks like a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator, like a dart, in the water and that is supposed to be the alligator attacking. I'm not kidding. In another wonderfully crafted special effect, a Matchbox van is targeted by the incredible plastic alligator sinking, which is suddenly five times the size of a van. (A few minutes ago, it was big enough to eat a human, but now it outperforms a full-size cargo van ...) It's really pathetic. The only other film I can think of about where the effects were so bad that I was taken from the story was Bruno Mattei's masterpiece, "Rats", which with the plastic rats on the treadmill and all that CAN NOT be terrified . /> Normally I would say anything that Sergio Martino was a solid must-see, but this is a must-pass. Waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the $ 15 + No Shame sticker price. This is a SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
