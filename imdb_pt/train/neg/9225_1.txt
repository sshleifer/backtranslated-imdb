CQ could have been a lot of fun. But he commits the only unforgivable sin: it is b-o-r-i-n-g! The pace is very slow and the plot is quite confusing and so artificial that it's almost impossible to care where you're going. The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class for a sensitive and sensitive eighth grader, but this video should have a warning tag: "CAUTION: Student film. Apt to be seen only by the filmmaker's relatives."
