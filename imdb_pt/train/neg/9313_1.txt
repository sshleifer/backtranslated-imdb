This was by far the worst low budget horror film I have ever seen. I'm an open-minded guy and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I'm renting movies, I specifically look for some good, understated horror movies. They are always good to laugh at, believe me I know, I have seen many. But this movie was so terrible that it was not worth a laugh. I was thinking of turning it off in the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. There's nothing good about it, first of all, the film crew suck A $$. The introduction was stupid as was the ending. Acting and special effects were terrible. Please, I'm begging you, do not watch this movie, you're going to hate it.
