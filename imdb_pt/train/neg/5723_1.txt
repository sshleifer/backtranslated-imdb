Whoever said it's better than Hostel is talking crap complete, believe me I'm not a Hostel fan, but this is just ridiculous. This is just another shot on the camcorder, straight to the DVD, with few ideas wasting your time, I can not believe how many of these movies there are and I'm still to see a decent one. In the '80s films, horror and gore films were made without budget, but with a great story and a lot of new ideas and, most importantly, the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they seem to be pumped in an attempt to fool people who browse Blockbuster to rent a copy, until people stop doing it, so I think those movies will continue to show up. This film is so low on ideas that it is simply amazing how it was never done, the acting is also terrible, the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying that it lives the belief. This wasted time has absolutely nothing to lose unless you're looking for a list of the worst movies of all time. My best / worst part of the movie is when a female character is aiming a gun at someone and threatening to shoot at them if they do not back down, you can see that she is not covering the trigger with just her finger holding the firmness. An absolute joke.
