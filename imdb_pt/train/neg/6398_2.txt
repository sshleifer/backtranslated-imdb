Richard Pryor's incident in the early 1980s, racing down the burning street, must have affected him in some way. In his stand up, he jokes about it with great laughter. He seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose. The Toy is about the roughest he has ever chosen, plus I think Another You. <br /> <br /> A movie in which a white man buys his son a black man? A little political imprecision before you was such a thing. It's to see Richard getting all sentimental that made me finally leave before the end. I wanted to see Pryor balancing himself with this brat, instead he would become the bad-tempered misunderstanding boy! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or anything else from his' 70s. This is a waste of time for any movie watcher!
