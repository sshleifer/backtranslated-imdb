Imagine, yeah, say 12-1am - your at home, your bored, your not tired. This scenario occurred around 4 years or more. I turned on the TV and took a look at some channels and found that the movie was on. OH MY WORD this is the worst movie I've ever seen! An unruly car that can not be stopped (because the brakes were cut or something) in caning it down the road - what will happen?! This movie was so bad that it's really funny - I think stunts cost about $ 2 to make, there was an example where a baby / toddler is being squeaked from the car by a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - conveniently located The bridge is approaching ... THIS IS THE BEST BAD BIT OF A MOVIE EVER - shows the child narrowly missing the bridge, but it looks so bad - you can almost see the mark of the mannequin they used - low budget classic total! I can not remember the end of the movie, but I bet it was EXCELLENT <br /> <br /> I doubt they ever show this movie again, so I'm glad I saw this piece of crap!
