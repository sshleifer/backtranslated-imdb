I love John Saxon in whatever he is. The only time he takes the camera, he directs a movie that should have been appropriately titled "Please do not watch this movie called: Zombie Death House". The $ 1000 Shock Insurance Certificate is the tricky way for Fred Olen Ray to make you spend $ 14 on a filmed dump produced by a great 1970s cheese legend. Ray is the front man of RetroMedia. Ray, by the way, makes the Charles Band look hotter than the stucco ceilings of a Ford Falcon. Just bad now, both boring and beyond. It's great that Ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it's in the public domain, like the rest of the street vendors, but in the case of Zombie Death House - the word "Zombie" superimposed to add ownership and interest to the party . of FOR) THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SERVICE TO THAT TRIP IS TO RELEASE YOU IN THE DOLLAR MARKET FOR THE CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND FANS OF SAXON !!! If you want to see real Saxons, get Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
