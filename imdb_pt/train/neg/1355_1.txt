I saw "What is this?" From Crispin Glover at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. Admittedly the film was at least appropriately called because I have the distinct sense that even the writer / director could not provide any response. In the question-and-answer session after the screening, Glover said the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with down syndrome. However, this is not enough reason to create a movie. Actors are, in my view, the foundation for a broader view - a larger view that seemed confused at best and absent at worst. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said he wanted to address taboo subjects. Well, he does it. But why? The film seems to have no posture, no reason to address anything. Does he think these things should not be taboo? The film does not even give me an indication of that. Taboo because of the taboo is not interesting. It can not even make the taboo upset or incite at any level because it did not make the public care at all. <br /> <br /> Ignoring problems with the concept for a moment, what most shocked me was how badly the film was assembled. Editing, cinematography, and other technicalities seemed to be extremely amateurish. Glover said that $ 125-150,000 went to the film, and I feel that money should have been spent on different designers (Glover actually did some design himself - I know I've seen at least the sound design in the credits). The painted sets are ok (not great), but used poorly. The pieces look like a play on the picture - which would be great if that were for any kind of purpose, but in Glover's hands that seems sloppy. Other parts are filmed as a sort of Home Movie, of inferior quality to many of the things I see beginning filmmakers in iMovie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem with "What Is It?" is that I can not even understand how the film should be taken seriously. There are some parts that look like Glover is screaming for you to think seriously. At other points, he seems to have his own joke. Maybe he wanted it to be ironic, or meaningful in some way, but I felt Glover could not even give the film any serious attention. <br /> <br /> Glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film. If only it had been. At seventy-two minutes, the film is left without images and ideas in the first twenty years, and it is debatable whether the ideas were formulated enough to state that they were there until that time period.
