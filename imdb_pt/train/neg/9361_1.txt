When I saw the preview for that on TV I was thinking, "Okay, it's going to be a good werewolf movie," but it was not. it was not scary at all! acting was good, plot was horrible, military supply was just stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could have done better than this piece of junk. The movie made it seem like Arron would turn into a werewolf, instead he became a psychopath and bit a doctor's throat. If you've read some of my other reviews in other movies, there are all positives, but this is not simply because the story was terrible. One in 10 max. I'm sure everyone was expecting some werewolf movie, but I bet you did not expect that. Besides Loch Nes was much better than this movie, the movie is better than this movie.
