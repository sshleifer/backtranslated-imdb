Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties, he also tried making movies. But this unbelievable piece of crap ended his acting career once and for all. He also finished the acting career of Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who became a football wife, TV presenter and programmer. I actually saw this in a theater (almost empty) because I used to be a fan of the Koen Wouters band, Clouseau. I regret spending money on it. It seems cheap, it's a terrible story and it runs in every way possible. Some people think it's so bad it's funny. I'm not one of them. I found an incredible loss of time and money.
