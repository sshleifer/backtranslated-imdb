I gave a 2 instead of 1 because I think "The Wild Women of Wongo" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There is no plot. There is no logic. Certainly there is no acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We did not ask ourselves about anything. We do not know how people got where they got it. It's always amazing to me how things like that are released. I agree with the previous writer that it's not even funny. I know. It takes about 90 minutes and this will take up all the space in a DVD collection. It's like a paper weight. Or a bad painting that you bought at a sale of hungry artists. It covers the crack in the wall.
