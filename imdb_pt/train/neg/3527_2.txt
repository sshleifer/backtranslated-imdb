had to see this because it seemed like a great scary premise - prisoners finding magical books, oo err! claustrophobic terror sets in, etc. <br /> <br /> But there did not seem to be a story to follow that great idea. instead of psychological horror, he relied on effects on open terror and OTT's body - which did not scare everyone if you were more than 12 years old. The logic at the end is ridiculous, with characters being killed for nothing other than bodycount. Waste of good characters - they were the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously low budget, which does not spoil, the film really does not get you anywhere, and - believe me I'll say it - needs a Hollywood remake. you simply lose interest in this version. definitely not in the same league as other French films casting in recent years like Crimson Rivers that were at least watchable / entertaining, Malefy is not watchable until the end to be honest. and I bet you can guess the ending before watching the movie. really very disappointing- impossible to recommend.
