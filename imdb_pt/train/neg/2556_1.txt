Well, everything has already been said about this movie and I hate it when I write reviews where everyone has already said what should be said. But the thing is, I've seen zillions of movies and I'm working on writing reviews on every movie I've seen. So, I have to write something. <br /> <br /> The acting is stupid. It is really stupid as the presenter expresses his sadness about the plane crash. The nun is good and the professional assistant who takes care of the child. The three main murders in the film are so weak that you can imagine how stupid the creators of this movie are. Do not they realize that even thefts can still be scary? We do not see how the granpa is dead. The dentist and his assistant made me feel like they deserve to die, you just do not sympathize with them. And Tony's uncle in the garage dies in a way that could have worked better. We just hear him scream and we see nothing!
