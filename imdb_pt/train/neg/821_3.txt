Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two main things: action and excitement. DOMINO PRINCIPLE presents Gene Hackman as a convict who has been released from prison to perform some mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his agents - they are supposedly working for the government, but this, like most of the plot of the film, is never clarified. Hackman asks many questions that are NEVER answered, so the movie is not going anywhere. While striving to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, the DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is extremely well photographed, but even this works against it. Kramer's direction is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> The acting is good with Hackman proving that he is virtually incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are suitably unpleasant, and Albert is well-scaled like Widmark's cruel footman. Even the normally offensive Mickey Rooney is very good as Hackman's partner. One curiosity, however, is the choice of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. They tell us she spent time in jail and she seems to be trying to put some kind of southern accent. Kramer's idea of ​​making her look like trailer trash is to make her wear an ugly brown wig. It is a more suitable role for the likes of Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
