I did not like the movie, Joshua. Maybe it's because I've seen another, much better, similar movie titled Orphan 2 days before, but maybe it's really just because this movie was not very good. I'm going with the ladder. Of course, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original, but that does not mean that the movie does not succeed. It might have been suspenseful, fun and creepy, but instead it was slow, boring, monotonous and really did not leave me thinking of anything more than "that was not very good" when it was all over. <br /> <br /> In the end, Joshua's motivations are revealed. I will not give up on this, but the reality is that he has not really realized his goals since despite Vera Farmiga as his mother, Abby, disappearing about 3/4 through the film, all arrows point to her coming home soon . She was committed to a psychiatric institution because she was losing her mind but then Joshua's father was accused of tampering with his medication telling the audience that the institution realized she was not mentally ill but was being medicated with medication. So ... should not she be coming home soon? Has not Joshua failed? Will not your mother live with him and his sister and possibly his father soon? I question the father since his future is left open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, I did not care about the characters. The devilish evil child Joshua was not really scary. The plot moved slowly and when it caught it was still annoying. The suspense diminished every moment. When it was all over, I could not believe I had sat the whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the acting was good from the parents, especially Vera Farmiga as the mother, but if you want to see a movie about an evil 'child', see Orphan. Now this is a movie that took a little original concept and created a brilliant movie.
