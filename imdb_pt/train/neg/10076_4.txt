The tenuous link between this film and the first Grease is established early in the film, when Didi Conn, one of the four cast members to repeat their roles, approaches young Maxwell Caulfield, a British exchange student. Although in the previous film Olivia Newton the foreign speaking standard of St. John is not explained, it is explained here that Caulfield is his cousin. What Conn is still doing at school, I think she just likes to walk around Rydell High, even though she's a beautician now. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is a smart boy, so it's clear that the types of hoods led by Adrian Zmed label him as a nerd. And this is especially bad when Zmed's girlfriend decides she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd simply will not cut it. <br /> <br /> That's when Caulfield decides to put on a modern Fox act. He picks up a kneaded bike and puts it back and teaches himself to walk. He gets a leather biker outfit with a set of glasses to hide his face. If Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield will have no problem making friends at any gay men's leather bar the way he is equipped. Grease 2 featured Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started them on the successful career paths they have both enjoyed. If you've seen the first Grease movie, a much better movie, you definitely have an idea of ​​what that movie will look like. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all faculty members of the original grease return in their roles. The score is not remotely as good as the songs that come from the original. <br /> <br /> It's not that Grease 2 is bad, but it's not that good.
