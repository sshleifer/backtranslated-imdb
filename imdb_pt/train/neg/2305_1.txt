This movie made me feel like I had missed some important scenes from the beginning. There were continuity errors and charts that stopped as abruptly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, plus I have always trusted and respected the taste of Danny Glovers in his choice of roles, "Grand Canyon" for example. I just could not finish this movie, after what seemed like an eternity, but it was probably just over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evocation of emotion about this movie and the clips from their past were poorly edited, confusing and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama and not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love seeing white people freaking out and starting acting like complete idiots, makes me laughing) has become a waste of my $ 1 credit on the video store.
