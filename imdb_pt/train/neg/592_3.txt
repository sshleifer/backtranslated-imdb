All logic comes straight from the train window in this British horror film, set in the underworld of London and starring Franka Potente, Franka plays Kate, a businesswoman on her way to an office party to find friends. falls asleep at a subway station, only to wake up and find out that she has been arrested and finds herself being chased by "someone" or "something" with murderous intentions. <br /> <br /> Fissure and unbelief are plentiful. there are very few moments that are truly scary / scary, but many that are simply boring. <br /> <br /> In the end, an unpleasant movie that should be locked underground forever and do us all a favor. <br /> <br /> The only good point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who did better than that ?? this even includes the "Erasmus Microman!".
