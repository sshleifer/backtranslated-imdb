If you enjoyed watching Mel Gibson at Million Dollar Hotel then you can watch Burt Reynolds in another such bad movie that could never be distributed. I can only vouch for the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is of better quality, but the night of the movies and the dark scenes were so poorly made that everything looks red. At first I thought my DVD players were messy. It was not. If you insist on watching it, I recommend that you adjust the color of your TV until it turns black and white. If you do not, you'll never get through the movie. If you do, you'll simply remember a poor movie as students try to relive the Pulp Fiction style.
