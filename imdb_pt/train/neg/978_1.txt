I watched this movie recently along with my sister who likes the performances of Sophia Loren. I'm a person they call a cultural barbarian. I hate art in any kind of shape or form. Rambo is more my kind of movie, action, kills, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this, avoid this movie like the plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, none of this. Let me give you a summary in a few sentences. It starts with 5 minutes of Nazi propaganda in black and white. Every Italian in a housing block watches a parade in honor of Hitler, except for a housewife, an antifascist and a janitor. The housewife who is deceived by her husband knows the antifascist. She falls in love with him, wants to make love to him, but the anti-fascist is gay. Despite this, they make love to each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book of her gay lover and the boy himself is deported by agents. The end. Do you want an even shorter resume? BABY ... Is that short enough? The guy should have used his gun at the beginning of this movie and shoot himself to save the public from this atrocity. On a side note, my sister loved this movie. Like I said, I'm a cultural barbarian ...
