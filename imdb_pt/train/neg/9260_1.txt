The only connection that this movie has to horror is that it is terribly bypassing. I'd rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit again. Even for a TV movie, it's flat. The cast is boring. The script is as exciting as a bowl of sand. As two directors conspired to create a movie of the type nothing will remain one of the great mysteries of the twentieth century. There is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the Omen franchise, and it is filmed in slo-mo and interrupted with the prepayment. If you are tempted to see it, put it on your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfortable. With any luck, you'll doze off quickly and the alarm will wake you up when the worst has passed. That is, this movie.
