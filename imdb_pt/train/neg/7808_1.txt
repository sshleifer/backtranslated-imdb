I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, so needless to say, I bought this movie without even renting it or something ... This movie was so horrible, I did not even take it back to the store, I would not want to no one else to be subjected to this human poison, I just threw it in the trash, no matter the money, it was worth the price to be able to throw it away. The performance was not so bad, it was not good or nothing. The story was horrible and the ending was something I despise. He was a broken man, an alcoholic. Your life was a bunch of crap. I thought his horse, peanut, was a terrible device to show his innocence in childhood, a dog would have been much better. I also hate religion, so this end undoubtedly irritated me. Jesus heals everything ... I hate that I know such people, who are great Christians and Catholics, and time will show that God does not cure everything or anything. It was a horrible movie, if you have the option to watch it, spend it or, better yet, buy it or rent it, throw it in the trash and leave the coffee grounds in the morning.
