Patricia Hunter: Ah, professor, do you also have the habit of collecting coffins? Dr. Lorenz: Why, yes, in a way. I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed. <br /> <br /> Interesting vehicle of Bela Lugosi (Glen or Glenda, Dracula) where he plays the crazy scientist. I was especially frightened when he appeared in the rooms of his guests when they were asleep. <br /> <br /> Luana Walters (Girls in Prison) was really attractive as a sexy reporter, Patricia Hunter <who was to be a victim, but the power of the woman beats the evil scientist every time. <br /> <br /> 2'11 "Angelo Rossitto and the creepy Frank Moran who liked to increase the women's hair added to the film. <br /> <br /> Interesting look at a 40's horror film .
