This review may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds begins well. In fact, he is well represented and the plot moves very well. But even a big Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original plot was more believable. For those who do not know, the original plot had thieves working as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them? But even with a change in almost every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final scene of the chase, the part of the 74 version that made it great. The version of this version is diluted, only 10 minutes, and culminates in a special monster effect that takes away all credibility from the pursuit. Where the original chase was very believable, the star was a stuntman who did all his own trick, the remake fell in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase movie, fine the original on the bargain box at your local rental board and stay clear of the new remake.
