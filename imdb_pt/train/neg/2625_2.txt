This film is terribly represented, written, directed and produced. But it is so exaggerated that it is actually semi-assisting. This is watchable SEMI. <br /> <br /> The plot (what little there is) makes almost no sense. The character Barney Drum is the only real comic relief of the film and gets tired after 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of the Canadian support cast can be found in TV commercials. None of them went to anything else I know of. And, of course, Sly Stallone's even less talented brother, well ... == Curiosities: It was filmed almost entirely in and around the small village of Claremont, Ont. (approximately 20 miles north of Toronto) I recognized many landmarks / intersections / local buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed on the now "Oshawa Drive-in" demolished just before being demolished.
