this by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I gave up watching it after an hour and regretted it very much. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. My guess is that someone came up with a strange form of an animal and started to make a story about it. lending some ideas from films like Resident Evil and Aliens does not result in a movie like them. If this is a top Korean movie, I'd rather not bother seeing even a Korean movie trailer ... By the way, this movie is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means that the film is promising. I think that every Korean who has internet for online gaming has evaluated this movie over the course of 8 years, even though they have no idea what it's all about.
