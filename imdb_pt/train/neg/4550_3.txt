My dear Lord, what a movie! Let's talk about "special effects" first. Do not get me wrong here, I'm not one of those fanatics by purposes, but I was really thinking that overlaying was a practice of the long past, especially the 60's. So for some time, I thought they might have recorded that movie there long and it took forever to cut it and launch it. But as far as I know, they did not have cell phones in the 60s ... What I'm looking for in the movies is mostly a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary, the effects are secondary, nor do I care about some minor inconsistencies. However, in movies like this, agility, incredibility, etc., become a bad movie even worse - that's what happened to me with Prophecy Celestina. <br /> <br /> My wife said that the book was really good and even though I'm not in all these spiritual things, I can somehow see that this can be brought in a believable way - the movie could not. <br /> <br /> There could be only one reason to watch this though. If you really love cheese movies, it will be right for you. If the stars of the IMDb were because of quality rather than quality, I should have rated this movie ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worse films, like "Critical Mass." (look for comments on that - hilarious). Celestine Prophecy is at least amused to some extent.
