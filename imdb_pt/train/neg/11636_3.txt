I will not waste my time writing an essay and wasting my time. I would like to say, however, that all those who are tense about this film, even being made, are being totally ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can not play that card, and I mean patriotic nationalism card, to make people not watch this movie. this is a film that expresses his free will in this country (oh yeah, I played that letter) even though the director is German and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he takes a camera, but the world is full of controversy, and it's the same thing you've heard before, like the GTA controversy. It's a comedy, laugh and feel disgust, not angry all together, your black humor and obviously you do not have the heart to take it, the past is past, yes people remember those who were lost, but it's time to move on, that was it !!! 7 !!! years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Besides me being crazy, and who needs a soul?
