Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this film during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem and does not remember much of it. That would explain why she made this movie, but it does not explain why anyone else in the cast or team did; I can not believe that EVERYONE had a cocaine problem. This has to be one of the worst absolute movies ever made, and that's saying something. The blame can not be attributed to the feet of "director" Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this photo was not written or directed by anyone. Apparently, it simply came together spontaneously, as there is little evidence of consistency, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else. What is really incredible is that there were some professionals who were involved in this glop. Co-star Robert Joy has done a good job in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and director of photography Arthur Marks are both industry veterans, Marks also having been a director, not a bad one. Why they got involved in this steaming stack of offal is beyond comprehension. Tim Kincaid, the so-called "director," has made some horror movies and low-grade science fiction, and having seen most of them, I can say none of them are good. This, however, is by far the worst thing he has ever done, and that is a great achievement on his part. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this movie is 12th rate - at best. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the "special effects" make "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Spider-Man", the story is banal, derivative and stupid. Do not waste your time looking at the cover of the video box, let alone renting it. A complete failure, total, boring and total.
