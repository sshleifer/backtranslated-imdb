- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something. - I went to see this movie because it was about non-WWF wrestling and then I thought it would be funny. It was not. It's excruciating to watch. Embarrassing. Any and all opportunity for comedy is mercilessly wasted. <br /> <br /> I admit that I do not like Jack Black anyway. After that, I've been thinking of a good role he's played. The only thing I can think of is where he was o.k. was like a necessary role for John Cusack's character in 'High Fidelity'. Jack Black is one of those horrible, relentless boring guys (like the fat guy from Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that being arrogantly dumb is not the same as being funny. <br /> <br /> It's not even clowning. It's just annoying. It's not even foolish, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I've heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite too, but if that's something I will not rush out to find it on DVD.
