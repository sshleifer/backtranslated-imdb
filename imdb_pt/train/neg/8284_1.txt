Who write this? A guy named John Cohen. I think this was the first script he ever worked on. Someone should have told him that you should write a dialogue that sounds like something someone would actually say. <br /> <br /> And who directed that? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut fell away from the tree. Someone might want him to know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a taxi in New York, and it will look real, and you will not have to pretend with a blue screen for no reason. Maybe he also wanted to let him know that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he has learned that lesson now. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... of course she can not act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she's starring in this movie. Oh wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, that's why she got the part. That's really the only reason I can think. <br /> <br /> So should I be surprised that it's bad? No. Should I be impressed by how bad it is? I think a lot of people would see it as much as I do. I mean, you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this ... not bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic movie. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this movie is as bad as the movie is good. It's Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did not pay to see, I stopped watching ten minutes at home, but I could not continue. No doubt I would have left the theater earlier. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw the theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The movie starts ridiculously bad and then goes to the point of being so bad that it becomes a kind of Chinese torture by the water. And then, when the first act is over, you realize that it will only get worse, and that's when you want to get out, or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie goes to the category of being so bad that it should be used instead of the embarkation of water in Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer the water boarding.
