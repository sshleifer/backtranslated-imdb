The character's acting is a bit harsh, as if it were the first time the actors appeared on screen. Unfortunately, one of the best actresses, Jean Simmons (played many roles on TV, as in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night), dies quickly and later his performance can be markedly lost. <br /> <br /> The leading role is Mr. Ballard, as portrayed by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to take this film with his body language for most of the time. It does not do a bad job, but it's a bit too much to ask an actor to turn the oceans to blank screen time, during which the characters pass the time without speaking and also not acting. Robertson's most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last three Spider-Man films (starring Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. A husband kills his rich wife for his money. after that the wife seems to come back and haunt her husband by leaving him insane until he leaps from a high window (fearing that the specter of his deceased wife approaches him) on the day that he is expected to die no less. <br /> <br /> The second driver Mr. Ballard hires looks a lot like an English Hamill brand. Weird really! The only thing that stands out is total disregard for dialogue. Many minutes pass in silence, no one speaks and few act. It's a shame the MST3K guys have never taken this movie. It could have been much better, if not as predictable, with more dialogues, or shorter scenes of 'nothing'. I waited for G'Mork's red eyes to come out of the shadows and proclaim that he works for the "nothingness" that inhabits this film.
