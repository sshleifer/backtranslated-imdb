This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams fit the part as a rhino would fit into a tutu, yet his performance was still regrettable. Kurt Russell was more believable, but still horrible. The plot left much to be desired and the rest of the performance was also terrible. The only thing this movie had was the trailer, which made me miss 90 minutes of my life, which could have been better spent trying to lick the back of my head. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it. If not, just be happy not to.
