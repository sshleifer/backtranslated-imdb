I saw this movie once and I thought everything was fine. So my friends at work said, "Look again, it's better." So I did. And to my surprise, it was worse the second time around! There's a word limit, so I'm going to kick start here. <br /> <br /> The bombing scenes were all so stupid. Why on earth would anyone wait to trigger the explosion? -No of the characters here is not even remotely nice. Not the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> -Ah, and the last time I checked, a car does not explode from a single shot, nor can such a large fire be done with a small fire extinguisher ... viewers above 3 / 10 really watched the movie ??? "The camera is so unstable I can barely tell what's happening." That opening scene with the robot had my stomach twisted, the rest of the movie was not much better. <br /> <br /> -The shooter scene. The McManus brothers (from "The Boondock Saints") rolled their eyes, it was so stupid. First, why the guy planted his gun where a person was shot? Besides, why would he spend a lot of time cleaning the bullets, recharging, aiming and NOT being shot when there was so much chaos going on around him? -YES guys running instead of staying and fighting back ?????? There is????? Are the soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not mean to sound homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Long time for your own good, but too short for the amount of material that was accumulating in it. Bigelow seems to think that the more action, the better. It looks like she's wrong - the movie is full of superfluous action scenes played there to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know the Watchmen has more than 163 minutes, but at least that movie did not drag on. This film, on the other hand, seems, and to him, seems longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, which was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favor, just skip that, and do not give in to hype.
