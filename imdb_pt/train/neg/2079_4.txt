I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman, I loved Evolution and who did not like Ghostbusters? From the trailer, you already know that the character of Uma will be abandoned by Luke's. So the buildup is obviously to the moment when it releases its superpowers into it. But the pay is not there. The shark game got a (slight) giggle, but again, it was all in the trailer. <br /> <br /> Nobody is out of breath just as Uma and Luke feed Owen on his good days. If it was not for Riann Wilson, you'd sit there. with a constipated smile until her cheeks began to sag. This is a comedy, right? <br /> <br /> It's not horrible, it just stands there like a cracker behind the fridge. This could have been a brilliant release of superhero and feminist films, but failed in both cases. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save the family name.
