I left about 6 movies all my life. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not know how I sat for an hour. I must have been in a coma that night. I saw it in the theater when it came out 8 years ago. I could not even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred. It must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today. Yech! To vomit! Barf!
