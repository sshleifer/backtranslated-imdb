Where to start? What is the best way to describe how horrible this movie is? <br /> <br /> Let's start with the countryman's mood. It's not very funny. Add a lot of musicians representing actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Poor and poor Art Carney, who should have known better than doing this movie. <br /> <br /> And then there's the plot. A roadie whose life purpose is to work on an Alice Cooper gig finds a girl whose life purpose is to be a groupie of Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, just when the movie should end, they can not present a scene more plausible than one - well, I will not spoil it for you, if you really want to see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are certain actors who report that this will be a "B" movie or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them to me - and he has a more prominent role. This is a clear sign that the film is not likely to be very good. If nothing else, the movie lives up to the low expectations - it exceeds them even though it's worse than bad. <br /> <br /> Let's just say that. This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. And none is worse than Roadie.
