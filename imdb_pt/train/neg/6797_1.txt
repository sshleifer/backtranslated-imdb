What can you say about a grainy and poorly filmed 16mm deer film, in which the best and most attractive interpreter is a German shepherd? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this farce at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the United States. I strongly suggest that IMDb re-visit their weighting formula to establish ratings, since a rating of 8.8 for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! I am by no means a puritan and spent many hours enjoying the classic pornographic films of the 70's and 80's; but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the deer (then illegal) loop.
