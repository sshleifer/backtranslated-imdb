I bought this very cheap ex-rental video, thinking that the cover looked pretty good. And it was cool, but the movie is crap. I can deal with B-grade, sometimes even enjoying a good B prank (ie 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre may be), but that was just mild bland. Incredibly dull scenes were sparsely broken by good cheap porn and fun dream horror sequences. This movie has very little to offer.
