Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in a bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good picture .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Not a good reason not to see this movie .... <br /> <br /> Or so I thought ........ These people did not do JBJ ... <br /> <Why did I forget it? <br /> <br /> For all the criticisms the first half of the movie is not so bad ... <br /> <br /> There is some intrigue and YOU FEEL A LITTLE MIXED IRRITATION WITH EXCITEMENT I FEEL THE SEE THE RITCHIE OF THE MOVIE INDIVIDUAL AS A STOCK OF LOCK AND SHARING. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is sizzling on a very thin type of model. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar as only he can be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying, but funny, YOU ALMOST FORGET THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU CAN NOT UNDERSTAND IT. <br /> <br /> Saif is ala ala Khiladi .. once again. <br /> <br /> There's the occasional chuckle and some chuckles, and some chills during the kareena-saif love story (kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm). <br /> <br /> BUT MORE MEAN PROMISES MORE THAN IT DELIVERY ..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was almost one praise when the break came not only because because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things to come. <br /> <br /> ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN TREATED TO MIND NUMBING TORTURE THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PLACE IN WORDS. <br /> <br /> Saif suddenly looks like a comic helper ... <br /> SUDDY SEXY KAREENA LOOKS ANOREXIC, YOU MAKE THAT THE SECOND LAST FLOOR IS NOW EMPTY AND YOUR FACE LOOKS GREAT FOR YOUR BODY (only girls can realizing this and making other guys notice that the second floor was my observation ANIL KAPOOR AND HIS SIDEKICKS PLACE ON HIS NERVES. Akshay Kumar is the only one that drives the madness to a certain extent, but even he makes it intolerable after a while <br />> WHEN YOU ARE SUBJECT TO AN ABSURDMENT AFTER THE OTHER <br /> <br /> WHY? WHAT? !!! WHEN? !!! WHERE ?! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO DESERVE THIS ... <br /> <br /> A collective sigh ran through the audience before every second semester song, which was common even without the movie around. <br /> < you can no longer alleviate the trauma .... CONCLUSION. THIS FILM STARTS LIKE A ZUMBIDO WHAT YOU FEEL MAY EVEN BE BACK TO A HIGH, BUT IT FINISHES SLOWLY MOVING FOR A HEADACHE AND THEN QUICKLY SHOOTS IN A COMPLETELY ENCOUNTERED ATTACK. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s Cast, Akshay Kumar, first semester. <br /> <br /> What, when, how, who to much confusion. (You need a book to fill this out). <br /> <br /> Every second semester (needs many pages to fill this). <br /> <br /> total 3/10 (I'm trying to avoid the 1s and 2s also does not seem extreme, but make no mistake this movie is unwatchable no matter how decent the first half is).
