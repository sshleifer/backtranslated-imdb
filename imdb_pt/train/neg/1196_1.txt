How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel have ANYTHING funny in that? Believe it or not, "House Bunny" made it better and funnier. I hope the directors have had a good holiday and some money - this film is an embarrassment to all of them. It's a cliché from beginning to end. Clichés can work well with a script, or at least an idea. This movie does nothing but use cliche cliches instead of ideas or script. It uses the preexisting personality of the actresses instead of developing characters. Bad, sad and trash. Now, apparently, I have to have ten lines of text for a comment. Same? Because? As an IT operations manager, this is another example of sloppy coding.
