When I first saw this movie, it was called TERROR ON A TRAIN and it was the back of a double movie. Glenn Ford, an armament specialist, is called to disarm a bomb hidden in a train loaded with explosives. The tension is slow and steady; and this black and white movie runs only about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on TV; tension and drama lost most of the impact. This is still a good movie with regard to early 1950s standards. Along with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / saboteur is played by Victor Maddern.
