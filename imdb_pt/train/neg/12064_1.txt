This is one of the most boring horror movies I have ever seen, since it is absolutely horrible, John Carradine has a very limited screen time. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see the two twists in the end coming up miles away!. The great setting and the scary house would definitely have helped if it was not so boring, and there's not a character to cheer for either, but I hope it's 100, because it deserves to be there. In my opinion. When John Carradine finally appears at the end, it's a very good scene, but it's already too late, and the only other screen he's had is in flashbacks, and the only really bloody scene in the movie is when a character catches his face. messed up by Bee, as it was bloody enough. I have this in a Horror DVD set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion, plus it is lucky that this was included in a set that I bought otherwise I would have threw it out the window!. This is one of the most boring Horror movies I've ever seen, since it's absolutely horrible, John Carradine has a very limited screen time, and I say avoid it like the plague! You do not want to go through the torture. The direction is absolutely terrible!. Carl Monson is absolutely terrible! work here, making everything seem cheap, wasting its potential in creating a scary atmosphere and just keeping the movie at an incredibly monotonous pace. The acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but others he is hardly in the movie, then flashback scenes. (Carradine governed !!). Merry Anders overflows terribly like Laura, since she did not convince me. Ivy Bethune is OK, and a bit scary, but also overacted, she had a scary smile at the end. Rest of the cast, I did not pay much attention either, because I had a lot of difficulty in going through this, but they were all very bad. Overall, please avoid this, it is not worth the agony!. BOMB of 5
