if my grandmother made movies, they would probably make a much better figure than this ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are fine. Especially the mother she is a good actress and the boy also proves to be a good one especially in the scenes where it should be frightening. But does the director know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller, and Good Script? the script has no evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing. If you enjoy being chased by trees, you can probably have fun, otherwise stay home and sleep. ah ... Actually, there was something funny: the 2001 film, but we could not figure it out, as the picture is as bad (as in the mini-dv) and the cars are as old (like the 70s and 80s).
