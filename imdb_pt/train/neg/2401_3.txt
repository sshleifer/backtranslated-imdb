I've seen better werewolf movies in my time, this one, however, takes the cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts the "c" at the cheese party. The quality of the star in this movie is not bad. Only the way it was made just sends rolling down the hill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a 1950s footballer who does not grow old due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the film was the violinist. He took all freaks out! Ed McMahon plays his ultraconservative father, who found his own bullet. Adam's father, Alan, plays a psychiatrist who does not seem to be at the top of his game. After all these years, Tony seems to be out of place due to the attack, and then he will have the chance to pick up on his estate. More laughter than bloodshed, this movie is only a beginning in the 80's, "Teen Wolf" was an improvement with that! 1 of 5 stars Cleanliness
