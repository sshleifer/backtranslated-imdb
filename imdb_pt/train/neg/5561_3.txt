I saw this movie under the title of "Moored". Overall, I enjoyed the Dolph movies, so I tried this one. Not worth it. I read some of the previous comments on the box attracting viewers. Do not be fooled. This is a bad movie at best. The performance is non-existent. The plot, the little that exists of one, is very predictable. The movie in some places seems to be cut together. This simply stinks up. Nor is it worth the price of a cheap nightly rental. As a fan of Dolph, I kept waiting to see him in action. By the end of the movie, you will still be waiting. Best to avoid this movie and spend time watching almost anything else.
