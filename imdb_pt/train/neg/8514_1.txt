I give this movie one, because it's a really horrible movie. The DVD soundtrack is so bad it actually hurts my ear. But vision, no matter how disjointed, shows something really chic in Italian society. I will not go into detail about what really was so shocking, but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal. So, for the value of twist, I give one. Otherwise, the video, photography, acting of adult actors / actresses are simply precarious, a practical athlete for people who love foreign films. Robert, the main character, has full spectrum of emotions but to the point of being unbelievable. However, the children of the film are mostly three or four years old, and are genuine and the film provides insight into Italian life.
