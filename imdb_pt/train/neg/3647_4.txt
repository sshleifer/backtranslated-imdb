It's a good thing I did not watch this while I was pregnant. I would definitely have cried my eyes and / or vomited. It was kind of awful, mostly disturbing. I personally thought the baby was adorable in its own distorted way. However, as a mother I cringed when Beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when Virgina aborted the child during her third trimester with no rusty utensils, no less. Also, as an animal lover I almost cried when she scratched the cat for a pulp bloody. However, as scary and sinister as the baby was I was hoping for him to live. And as twisted as the movie was I am extremely intrigued to see the sequel ..... ......... Eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu
