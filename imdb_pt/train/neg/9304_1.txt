I've seen many stupid movies in my life, but this is arguably the worst of them all! I usually like stupid movies, if they are a little fun, but I can not even think of anything good about this movie. I like "Teen Witch" for the love of God. But S.I.C.K. has horrible acting, lame porn music throughout the whole thing, and even the sex scenes suck! I would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys" or even "a Very Brady Sequel". Although, this is far worse than any of these. I beg you, do not waste your time. Believe me, its 2 o'clock you will never go back.
