The premise was intriguing, but unfortunately this movie simply does not do it justice. The cast was very good, and was filmed beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized fast editing was done with no effect .... I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run the credits followed by a commercial), the characters were identified exclusively by the use of on-screen coke (and practically everything left for Boogie Nights for character development), and no character to lure the viewer into the story. A very forgettable film.
