No need to redo, and can not get close to capturing the charm of the original. The extreme length causes more than a few yawn induction parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film has no style, and most of the time it lacks talent, not just acting, but the direction, the scenery, the costumes, etc. are all below standard. It has a blatant disrespect for the period detail. Vanessa Williams is the only member of the cast that shows any talent, Tyne Daly is not so bad. They should have done well enough alone. The chant varies well (Vanessa Williams) for the poor (all others). Watch the original 1963 version and skip this one. There is not much here to recommend.
