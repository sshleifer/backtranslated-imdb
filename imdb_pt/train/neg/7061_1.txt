I'm still trying to figure out if there was a spot for this movie. For content that is supposed to be so "rebellious" and "controversial," the things Maddox distributes to students are very bad. Students seem to be easily influenced by anti-authoritarian sentiments and fragments of words unreadable in pamphlets. Rebel, everyone. <br /> <br /> I suppose it would have been too much to ask for a teen rebellion movie where a school fire alarm is not triggered. <br /> <br /> Apparently, a 'huge fight on the football fields' is a fight that consists of two people. <br /> <br /> Character characters seem to wildly vary at random. A footballer who Maddox was struggling (and who later received a staple in the face) is all smiles and apologies the next day. <br /> <br /> The fact that it does not come to a real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been put in half an hour after the special lesson. If they had cut off most of the attempted pseudo-soundtrack.
