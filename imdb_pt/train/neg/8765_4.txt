I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day. The quick summary of this movie is MUST AVOID. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did none of those works well. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan's 1999 attempt to capture part of India's disputed Kashmir region. . Supposedly based on facts, you have a hint from this film about the difficulty the Indian army had in recapturing the area of ​​Pakistani troops - who occupied the high ground. But instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story, all this makes the Indian military look ridiculous and stupid, which I know is not true. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with almost completely Indian audience, which was very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie, but also saw himself laughing at scenes that were not supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely lousy. It gave the impression that Mr. Dutta knows nothing about how an army works and was using bad war movies as a reference. The result is a script that is brainless and repetitive. The acting of most directors was not stellar, but given the script they received, I find it hard to criticize them too much. As for the supporting cast, all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs. <br /> <br /> The issue was also very bad. It was very difficult to keep up with what was happening most of the time, and the music abruptly ended in scene changes. Good things: Cinematography was very good, although it was a bit hurt by the fact that the film did not seem to be color corrected (color balance usually varied significantly within scenes). Also, the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable - at least in the first half-dozen verses, at least. Unfortunately, they lasted much longer than they should have. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This mess is four hours long. There is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good movie for 1.5 to 2 hours from what was filmed. Unfortunately, a good editor was not working on that film.
