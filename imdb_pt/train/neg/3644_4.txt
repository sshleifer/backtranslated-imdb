This movie is very poor. The performance is abysmal and completely forced. Also, while filming the film as a docudrama does not necessarily make it more believable, you can not get out of it so easily. Do not let my reviews fool you however as I recommend you watch this movie as it sheds some light on the psychology or psychology that does not exist behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However, the climax of the movie is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to put it! It simply can not capture any sense of atmosphere! What happens does not bring me any sense of despair, panic, fear or dread that one would surely experience in such dire circumstances. No, instead, it makes you jaw-dropped "Was that?!" pouring out of your tongue, and by no means are you haunted by these boy actions. Instead, you just feel embarrassed by yet another movie that started with potential but ended up falling on your face at the most crucial point. Zero day, in fact .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
