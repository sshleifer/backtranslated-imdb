Having read many of the reviews here, I'm surprised no one has recognized this as basically a remake of an episode of the 1960s Twilight Zone called "Mirror Image" starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job of creating a scary tale in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious nap. A small piece may be effective with a mysterious and inexplicable ending, but in a feature film, there must be a little more substance and the story should make sense. Unfortunately, substance and meaning are two things missing from "The Broken." Yes, there are a few moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some additional remarks: Although this is clearly a contemporary story, no character in the movie has a cell phone! And even if a car accident is the event that continues the story, there is never any reference to an insurance company, the person who was driving the other car or the police who would have been forced to report. My advice: skip this hole and note the original!
