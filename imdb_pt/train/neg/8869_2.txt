With the release of "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry really hit the bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has lived in recent years a quiet life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund). One day an old friend of Stefan arrives with a favor to ask him. Stefan is going to do a little courier job. He was supposed to bring a suitcase full of heroin through the Sweden-Germany customs. Unfortunately things in Germany do not work as planned and Stefan is now in big trouble. It is always good to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional pattern of family drama. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea how a film should be written, filmed or cut, the result can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiot dialogues. The only highlight in the film is the unprovoked sex scene with the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. This lasts only a few seconds, leaving about 90 minutes of pure, let's say what it really is, crap.
