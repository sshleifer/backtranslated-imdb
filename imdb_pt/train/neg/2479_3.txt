I first heard of Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's "Scary Stories": According to this story, the Wendigo - after calling his name in the wind - drags you and pulls you to the sky and sprays you . Although it seems a rather bizarre notion, Schwartz's story turned it into a fairly coherent idea. <br /> <br /> The movie "Wendigo" does not. It basically consists of every horror movie clich√©: the family moves into a new home and strange things start to happen, anyone who harms them is asking, and it's best that everyone listen to the old Indian. I've seen these things so many times that I do not bother to tell. <br /> <br /> Either way, avoid. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey in "Malcolm in the Middle") did much better than that.
