John Huston's Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could imagine. From the absolutely terrible acting performances (and you're not, "Oh, that was done on purpose, you just do not understand" me!) For the musical score that was best suited for a Rockford Files episode, this movie was revolting. I saw him reluctantly at first and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the characters from the south, from the ridiculously fraudulent Southern accent to the funny and comical way of portraying their faith, was inexcusable. By the end, which was completely devoid of any sense of character, it failed everywhere that O'Connor's book shone and resonated. The actors who play the "southern" cops may also have eaten hot dogs choked on street stalls in New York and quoting Godfather. The only redeeming performance was the living and deadly portrayal of Ned Beatty from Hoover Shoates, a religious artist who hears Moates preaching the Christless Christ Church and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is best known for its sinister religious current that mocks the seemingly lifeless corpse of "Faith." Mr. Huston's film is a shameful shame on the author's intentions, as they are understood by me and most of his fans, if I can be so bold as to say it. Although I acknowledge that I do not know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works for wanting to remain fans. If I saw Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For the love of Flannery and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. Forgetfulness ... this will take some time.
