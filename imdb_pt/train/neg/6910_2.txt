I've never seen this movie, but I can say one thing about its production. While I was a comedy / oldies DJ in 1988, I got a call from the producer. They asked if I would write and record a little that they would put on the soundtrack as sounds emitting on a TV (the television screen itself would never be shown). I said yes, I wrote a parody of clich√©s of science fiction monsters from the 1950s, put together some sound effects, and called another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. While she was on the air at the time, she put on a long song, joined me in the microphone in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in one go. Laughing, she then returned to her show while I mingled the silly sound effects. We would never have done it if we had known that the "Woodchipper Massacre" would be a turkey - but again, we were never paid for our efforts either! - Gary Theroux
