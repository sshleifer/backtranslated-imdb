(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie, after hearing that it was intelligent and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: to describe how the relationship between a man and a woman evolves through all the problems and difficulties. that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the whole movie were two things. <br /> <br /> First, the film was so realistic that it seemed to describe the problems a couple needs to solve in a day. Each day, it became common and monotonous. <br /> <br /> Second, the general lack of production, with dialogues that were difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
