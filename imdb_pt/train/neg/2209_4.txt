If you've read my review of SyFy's "Dinoshark", you know I can appreciate the low-budget problem that these television movies can offer. They are stupid ... they are silly ... but still they are very funny in a "so bad, it's good" way. So, still pounding with guilt over liking (and recommending) the undeniably cheesy "Dinoshark", I sat down to watch "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy," a SyFy Original Movie about a half-hammered, half-hammering monster, terrorizing people in a island. . With SyFy Channel's infallible recipe for creating B Movie Creature features and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could this go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it really misses the mark ... not much, but enough to make me not recommend it. Because? Well, first of all, his titular monster, the dreaded hybrid human-hammer, sits in the background in front of a band of faux-military thugs who really become the movie's main villain. Although the hammerhead shark does the body count, it (or what you call a thing) only comes shortly before someone is chewed and left shortly thereafter. The rest of the movie is padding, putting our heroes against the soldiers mentioned above. That, to me, is not as convincing as watching a hammerhead shark eating people! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
