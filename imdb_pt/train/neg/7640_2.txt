I basically found the Curve of Eden very badly built, which made it difficult to observe. However, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of scenery and clothing. The "back to earth" philosophy and interest in sexual exploitation and drugs that were not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 1970s, was the pseudo- "do not ask, do not tell." fraternity liberalism composed of East Coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought this was more likely in a New England school than in Virginia, where I imagine that the "good boy" mentality still dominated even such elitist schools. 1. Another thing I enjoyed and could relate to was that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leather men or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles unrelated to these terribly overused images. I felt that it was very unfortunate that the "gay culture" took on certain standardized forms in the 1980s on Castro and Christopher streets and they defined the movement and left out a large number of gay men who were more subjugated in their lifestyles. I appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without "the scene".
