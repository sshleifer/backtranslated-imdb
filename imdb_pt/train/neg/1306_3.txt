(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian TV, although filmed in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the previous DEMONS films. It was to be simply titled, THE OGRE, which is how director Lambert Bava had pitched. <br /> <br /> An American family rents an Italian village for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a girl descending into the old cellar of the village and finding this cocoon-like structure hanging from the ceiling. It shines and is covered with cobwebs and has what appears to be a spider or insect leg hanging on it. He drips what looks like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course the husband does not believe in any of this. The village is old and creaking and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she must simply ignore her. <br /> <br /> But then the OGRE itself appears in what appears to be a sort of 16th century costume with what looks like the head of a wolf attached to it and is attracted by the scent of orchids. <br /> <br /> The movies are not that bad and at least the dialogue is kind of smart without the ridiculous clumsy phrases that dubbing would bring. . There is no real blood besides some rotting skeletons in an underground lake that really looks like the bottom of a modern pool. The OGRE itself simply disappears after being hit by the family's Jeep Cherokee. The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective, with the image turning black for a few seconds, about half an hour into the movie, a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected. The extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava, where he explains how this was not a sequel, etc ... etc ... along with some trailers for other Shriek DVD releases. This is quite normal material. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
