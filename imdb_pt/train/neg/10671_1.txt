MST 3000 should make this movie. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. First of all, you discover that the shooter does not have a bank account and has no history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash. There is no way in hell that such a person would ever be allowed to be so close to a president not to mention a high-level job. In addition, the POTHUS security chief would not be so emotional that he would start filling up if the president was shot. This movie sucks. I can not express the extreme that this movie was. Each single actor was terrible. Even the girl in the trailer park. I bend in this trash. What a waste of time.
