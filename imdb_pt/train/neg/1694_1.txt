This movie may seem scary in commercials, but the actual movie was a cause for vomiting. This is one below below average, (even smaller than that) and has no plot. I mean, every house can make you feel scared and sure enough, a dead Japanese woman would scare the shit out of you, but so what? Make a movie that attracts observers and not just show images of scared people and hair (Japanese woman dead). Can you say "horrible robbery of Samara (The Ring)"? Do not make me start with the "dead child." Not even scary! And? He has a cat and he can imitate you, big deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential to be harmed by Grudge! 1/10! Disgusting! >.
