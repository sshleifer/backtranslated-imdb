I really can not believe I spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a big zombie fanatic and I thought the movie could not be that bad. There were zombies, right? I was wrong! To be honest the movie had its moments ... I found it cool when the guy ripped off his head, but that was about it. Overall, I think it would be nicer to slip a razor slide over my bare tree bark into a barrel of vinegar and watch that movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob, but I had to watch the trailers of the other movies produced by this company to see this. Buyer beware ... unless you are into masochism.
