Marlon Brando has long lost interest in acting when he made this film. His performance as "The Swede" is the worst of his career, and that is precisely what he intended it to be. He does not exaggerate. Instead, he simply acts in a bizarre way and mocks his embarrassingly gigantic waist. The scene in which Brando rises in the bathroom cabin is probably the worst and funniest moment in movie history. As we witness him fall headfirst into the bathroom, it's hard to believe we're watching the same actor who starred in a streetcar called Desire, Seaside and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I think the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in his later years. Was he tired of the movie business? Did he just like to make a complete and total fool of himself? I think we'll never know But this movie serves as a fascinating study on what is bad acting. On that note, watch veteran actor Donald Sutherland as he struggles to deliver his speeches, ashamed of himself for agreeing to participate. in this farce.
