This is an incomprehensible piece of horribly low shame. <br /> <br /> I do not even have the vocabulary to say how terrible, turgid, boring, confusing, and simply strange that effort is (Hey, what d 'you know I do ....) Defined in a post-apocalyptic America some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue - it was all so incomprehensible that I could not make head or tail of any of it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, as this was caught by the National Lampoon totally defeats me: it's really horrible. <br /> <br /> And it's not so bad that it's a good way to worship. <br /> <br /> It's just horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still do not believe me, then watch him with every intention of loving him, come back here and tell me what you think. Even acid gerbils could not hope to understand this. <br /> <br /> Avoid or even destroy better ...
