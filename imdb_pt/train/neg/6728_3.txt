This movie is not good, it's not good. Some memorable scenes and the unfortunate choice of Norma Jean pairing with a real actress. Jane Russell has everything working for her, the smallest woman and / or actress of Marilyn. One can only wonder why this is considered one of the highlights of his lame career. 3/10
