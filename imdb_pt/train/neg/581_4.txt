Before I go any further, I have to admit that I'm a big fan of Bon Jovi. In fact this is what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place. I probably would have bought it anyway being a big horror fan and having enjoyed both the first Vampire title. <br /> <br /> But this is not so good. Not even Jon could save this movie for me. My main problem would simply not be scary. In addition to Jon's character, Derek Bliss, none of the other characters impresses and you would not mind if they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / drug addict. The female vampire is simply not scary or sexy. On the contrary, she looks like a 14-year-old anorexic girl, no wonder she's so desperate for blood then. Another big problem is that everything is just "very clear". There is no atmosphere or feeling of dread. I know the first Vampires being set up in New Mexico were not exactly the twilight zone in terms of strangeness, but they still managed to be dark and sinister when they needed to be. This movie does not have tension like that. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as it was before. Vampire wants Berzier's cross to be able to walk in daylight. However, the story has fewer cool bits this time around. There is no decisive factor in knowing that this is the master of every master - the original vampire, as in the first film. You really do not care who or what this is. There is no army of masters. Instead, she hides in some ancient ruin that looks more like a Disneyland attraction than a scary temple. <br /> <br /> So you really have it. The lack of scares, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting history. A real disappointment for me personally.
