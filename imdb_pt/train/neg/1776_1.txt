This movie has its share of negative comments and I have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made. It is true that most of the films based on King's works are very bad, but this film goes beyond evil into the realm of the horrible. There is not a scary time, unless you consider scary stupidity. It's typical King's trash - distorted myths that did not make sense at first, mixed with so-called obvious, "scares" that are as shocking as the PeeWee Playhouse (which, at least, is fun). It's full of ridiculous moments, the least of which is Alice Krige's character. When she goes into fury and starts playing as the villain on an old Batman TV show, it's so absurd to get sick. All the people who participated in this (including John Landis) are lucky to still have careers. But the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes at the end, which look like cheap rubber clothes someone bought at K-mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats that really outnumber the people in the movie.
