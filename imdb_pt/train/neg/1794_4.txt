Not your typical vampire story, nor bram stoker or anne rice here. a truly unique story of vampires. these vampires are genetic mutants that the sunlight does not bother. they are pure evil to. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect. many of the actors are clearly amateurs. the two protagonists who play van helsing and reunite the vampire girl are very good. the film is intensely violent, which can upset some people. It is also loaded with scientific details that many will find difficult to understand and can get bored. I was sold on the clever plot and on the good performance of the couple. it is not possible to say how successful this movie could be if they had a larger budget and had mass distribution
