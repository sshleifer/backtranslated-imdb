No laugh whatsoever. Yes, I watched this wrecked train, but only to not ask me later if Cleese had regained her mind in the last part. (No, he did not.) <br /> <br /> This may be historically interesting to you young people out there to see that the British "mood" included such black "jokes" as these thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What surprises me, though, is reading the comments of the other reviewers, who acknowledge that this is not very good, but then turn around and give high votes. If the vast majority of comedies you've seen are even worse than this, then I certainly pity your tormenting existence. <br /> <br /> The mood level of this program seems intended for small children, but the subject does not. So who is this for? People who enjoy repeated and prolonged tirades, cash jams, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to 1977), and another "down" mood. The Three Stooges are still funny, and they were like a child to me as well. They have put some effort into making the jokes work. This, however, is discarded by schlock. I fear it will be the end of civilization if this material is really accepted as valuable. Then you'll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular. :(
