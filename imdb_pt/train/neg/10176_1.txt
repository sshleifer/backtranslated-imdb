Starring: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and Directed by John Warren 100 Minutes Rated PG-13 ( for language and some violence) Blake French: Believe it or not, in John Warren's new comedy "MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS", there's a funny scene . It consists of a sequence in which an infuriated trainer throws a baseball against the wall behind him, just so that it hits the cement and throws himself backwards, crushing him in the face. It's not much, but with the exception of a few one-liners, that's all this movie has to offer ... enough is said. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally impaired, characteristically underdeveloped, predictable and poorly written, but also simply bad. Even uncritical members of the audience will hate this movie with everything they have received. It's so familiar that it's not funny. <br /> <br /> How many times does the same movie about sports have to be done? In recent years, we've seen that same material on "Air Bud: Golden Receiver," and as bad as this movie was, that's even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family oriented. "Major League Back to the Minors" is very common for a healthy family to see together on a Sunday afternoon. It is very childish for adults. So who is this movie? Teenagers Older People so desperate for entertainment that they would rent something like that? <br /> <br /> The film, like many others like this, has a basic point it tries to do: teamwork beats everything. Yes, and what a great moral try to prove. It's a shame we've seen and excited so many times with so little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in ballerina costumes. Where foolish announcers form their own "comedy routine of friends" muttering to themselves, as "They suck," "That quick ball of children is timed with an hourglass," "This guy left the ball for a while to find something that he lost - maybe it was his mind "" Someone needs a nap "and" already saw a sunset as beautiful as this game ". Where the characters have so little importance to each other that we never know them by name. And where the only honest talk about teamwork is so uncertain that it's almost funny. <br /> <br /> "Major League Back to the minor" is so bad; it prevents your banal ending well in the middle of a good closing sequence. The good baseball team is back, they are about to win and the energy is gone. I was thinking for a minute that this piece of crap had come to a conclusion, but in reality, its final fake scene only exists to add minutes to the runtime. The film basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that make so many putrid jokes that are not funny. There is another funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking about why a longtime champion is no longer wanted in that position. The coach's response: "You're too old, too slow and too fat." The player's reaction is to die. But this scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of its time, and certainly not worth a penny of your money. <br /> <br /> So here's another terrible entry in this genre of film, another one that is doomed with its own script, which is a failure before seen, and another one that is so familiar that it seems deja vu once more. <br /> <br />
