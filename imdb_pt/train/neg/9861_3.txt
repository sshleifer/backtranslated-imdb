I just sat down at GenCon just because I was quiet and I could take a nap. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF The woman who played Flo and Abe Vigoda was busy or something? <br /> <br /> Truly, a bland piece of garbage. The characters were stereotyped senseless (I think ...) and wood, most of them seemed to be on autopilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other so-called "magazines" were so banal that I insisted on the writers. <br /> <br /> I'm confused about how anyone might think it's worth, seriously. I'm only giving 3 out of 10 because to be a 2 or 1, it would need to be five hours or have more Kelly LeBrock.
