0.5 / 10. This movie has absolutely nothing good about it. The acting is among the worst I've ever seen, what's really amazing is that EVERYONE is terrible, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the low budget is irretrievably evident, the score is horrible, I would not say that the movie was edited, brutally cut would be a more appropriate sentence. Combines serial killings, voodoo, and tarot cards. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. It's nothing scary, special effects are hopelessly lame. laughably bad all over. The writing was terribly bad. Cinematography is really cheap and sometimes very grainy, and the camera work is terrible. Again, what really makes the movie is how bad all the actors are. Cheese
