My son makes videos better than that! I feel stolen from the $ 4.00 spent renting this thing! There is no date in the case of the video, apparently created by Wellspring; and, what's worse, there's no production date for the original movie listed anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, prompting an unsuspecting tenant to believe he is making a recent movie. <br /> <br /> This film was so bad from the point of view of being outdated and irrelevant for any length of time, but precisely when it was done. , I'm amazed that someone would spend the time and money to market it as a video. It may be of interest to students studying the counterculture of the 1960s, anti-war culture, anti-establishment, attunement, activation and withdrawal; but when you read the back of the video, there is no clue that this is what you are getting. If you make the mistake of renting it, it will probably be best viewed while you are drugged, so that your mind is closer to the wavelength of the directors' minds, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching, I can say that it does not improve after the first scene; then, knowing that, I'm sure you'll be sleeping well before the end.
