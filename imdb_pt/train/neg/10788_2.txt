And I mean ultra light. This movie features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing more. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say about this stinker, moreover, although it does have a couple of really good bits, most are not very funny. It does not even work like a novel. How about a romantic comedy? Not in your life. Most of the dialogue is too flat to be sophisticated, much less fun. <br /> <br /> What really is the shame is that the premise is not bad at all. This movie could have been much more, especially with any recent focus on some of the false ways in which movies are promoted, complete with false critics' quotes. The film reveals the unexplored territory of the press conference - all those paid trips with expenses for journalists who almost always write good reviews. But instead of exploring what should have been a mother's joke, he devotes about three minutes to this territory and moves on in search of the movie's lame romance. <br /> <br /> The same goes for Catherine Zeta-Jones. character - the glittering and egocentric movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she gave, but she did not give her anything. It's all homogenized trash that looks very pale compared to some of the things we've heard about the stars over the years. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's hard to understand what Zeta-Jones did, Julia Roberts. John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship, which sinks as a reprise of "The Boat of Love". In fact, as the old joke says, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. Probably make a better story. So, go ahead and tell us filmmakers, what do you have in these stars that made them appear in this?
