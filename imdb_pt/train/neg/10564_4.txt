The true shame of "The Gathering" is not in the bad acting, nor in the contemptuously superficial plot. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series that started, despite having a main attraction: Takashima. I would love to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even for just five minutes. She has this sarcasm, that intelligence, that double-edged personality that is both volatile and lovable. Unfortunately, though, the pilot film "Babylon 5" has an incredibly tedious story about murder. Patricia Tallman - who never seriously returned to the series until much later - fortunately got much better at the age of Lyta Alexander, who here is little more than a weeping and tearful telepath. I'll leave you with one last thought - why does Delenn look like some kind of outer space frog man (even if she's a woman)? Thank God for the way Minbari looked at the show later.
