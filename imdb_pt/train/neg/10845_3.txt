Surprisingly had a plot! ;) I've seen movies with less plot (I do not want to mention Asian movies, but ...). I thought the camera was not bad for a cheap movie like this, and also the atmosphere was not so bad. There is no real reason for most of the things people do and the way they react to what happens. Although I think of many movies, in this case it was awful, of course. <br /> <br /> He ripped some movies so badly for individual scenes. The acting was bad, but I've seen worse. The movie was bad, but I've seen worse. Watching this movie is an experience between boredom, lust, death wish, sadism, horny and entertaining on a low level. <br /> <br /> So if you like bloody movies with stupid plots, this is the right movie for you. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10 because it can be fun if you do not expect to see a good movie and you're in a good mood.
