The basic premise of this film is a political cartoon. I suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military, this is probably a "well-being" film about gender equality. In fact, a recent commenter has stated: "It allows women to know they can do whatever they want." What a claptrap! No one, man or woman, can do whatever they want, and unfortunately Demi Moore "polishes" SEAL Hell Week at the start of the 27-week BUD / S program for a few sessions at the local gym and her desire to be a SEAL simply will not go do that. There is approximately an 80 percent dropout rate in what is arguably the most violent military training program - those who voluntarily abandon, can not compete on a physical level, suffer frequent physical injuries during training or are unable to cope with the psychological problem. harassment. I have never been beyond the superficiality of the planned and pretentious message of this film. In the real world, Demi would not last the first 24 hours in this hard and continuous physical training. Wishing alone will not do that. Skip this movie as a wish, and spend your time reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York, 2001) for the best description of what really happens in this training. Ring the bell, Demi! <br /> <br />
