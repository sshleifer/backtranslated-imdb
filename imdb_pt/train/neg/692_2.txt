One of the many slashers that appeared in the early eighties, Pranks is notable only for an initial performance by Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); his character dies quite early, and the rest of the film is totally forgettable. <br /> <br /> During the Christmas break, a group of students volunteers to clean a building from their college furniture. A crazy killer, however, throws a wrench at the works, beating the boys methodically, one by one, in a variety of horrible ways. Exploring every stalk 'n' slash clich√© in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a tedious and uninteresting horror that made me pray for the characters to be killed, so I could continue to watch something more interesting . Most of the deaths (which, let's face it, that's why we usually watch this type of movie) are brief and not so bloody; the only truly horrible picture arrives well at the end, when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor (there is a remarkably bloody body dismembered - the film could have done more). <br /> <br /> At the last minute, the film gets saved from the shame of receiving the lowest possible score from me for having a beautiful unexpectedly pessimistic ending, but this is only one for slasher finalists.
