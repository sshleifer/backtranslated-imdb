A non-inspired and indistinct "new" Columbus who sees the Mac-man attending his nephew's wedding, only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates ... <br /> <br /> And it's about this: indistinctly plotted and surprisingly loaded with a flat script, given that it was written by Robert Van Scoyk, who wrote the very amusing story of Columbus "Murder Under Glass" at the height of the detective; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity that Columbus offers to Columbus is the reduction of suspects through the photos taken at the wedding, which include everyone who was there! <br /> <br /> Devoid of all possible Columbus traits, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the story of the series, with appropriately novel acting style. Very avoidable things.
