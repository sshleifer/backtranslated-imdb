I was not sure if I should laugh or cry. Porretta was good-looking, but he looked like a Mexican porn star, not an English outlaw. costumes what suits a T-shirt with black leather straps. it was Marion's clothes - or the lack of them - that really got me. fans of this stench really believe that women dress like that in medieval England. the Mongols and Vikings were inaccurate and stupid, but the episode with an ALIEN was the worst of them all. Especially since her makeup consisted mostly of oatmeal on her face - an old trick. The hedgehog monster was pretty funny, as if it were climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows - as if. the American accents sounded like the initial dragged voice about 'RAW-bin Hood and John LIDDLE'. The second robin and Marion were really looking pretty and what was left of the show was totally discouraged ...
