This movie is for the story of F.B.I. as Knott's Berry Farm is for the Old West. Shamelessly sanitized version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation fighting crime. Hoover's heavy hand (does he have any other type?) Shows everywhere with quality screenplay actors, cheap sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart with 20% of dramatic ability, Vera Miles chewing the setting, the movie features all the c-lister known in the mid-fifties with just a hint of irony or humor, from the 'Amazon jungle' to the 'barbecue backyard', everything smells like sound stages and lots of background . Even the shots are canned and familiar. I imagine Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night. Except for some (very few) interesting exteriors that lay plans, nothing here of note beyond a curiosity.
