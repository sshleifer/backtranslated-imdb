Jason Lee's kisses are back! If this is what you are looking for, look no further. If not, better to move on ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s in abundance, some badly filmed but exotic fight scenes (used JKD) and lots of poor quality and cheap effects. Poor Lee seems like he's in pain throughout the movie, and no wonder. It is not a pleasant return. <br /> <br /> The film is not even a B movie - sure enough, there was a bad white guy, white and loquacious, but no free sex scene or even a single estate shot. None. Zip lock. Anything. Even in Starship Troopers 2, they had the good sense to include the nudie compulsory scenes (as for the rest of my comments on this excellent piece of classic movie excellence, please see our next review on this amazing sequel ... ). I had the feeling that the writer was taking revenge on someone else for it - so I'm not going to get into the "plot" of the movie or into just about anything else related. Except he had some non-heterosexual implications, so 'nuff said. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has one thing to do - not Jean-Claude :)
