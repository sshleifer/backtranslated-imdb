the more I think about it, there was nothing redeeming about this movie. I saw this 9 months ago so my memory could have gotten worse what it was but I know it was at least as bad as 4 of 10 <br /> <br /> after seeing the film, I met the director. he seemed so ignorant about what he was doing or what he had done, and as far as I could tell, he did not care about the movie either. even he agreed that he did not really know what he was doing, and was forced to do certain things because it was digitally filmed. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was trying to fit in with the formula that he built for himself: "9 people have to be connected in some way." <br /> <br /> We can go from the ' A 'to point' B '- then to get from the prostitute we see at the beginning and back to her at the end, they 10 minutes into each character's relationship with another person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < That 's how I say ... 4 out of 10.
