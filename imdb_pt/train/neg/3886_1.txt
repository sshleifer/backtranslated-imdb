Is this a stupid movie? You bet!! I could not find any moments in this movie that were scary or scary. Stupid moments? Very. Stupid characters? You bet. Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have done bigger and better things, that's not one of them. Well, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheesed. He's the cryiest doctor I've ever seen. He has a melting man running in Ventura County somewhere, he's not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because she's 55 and weighs 90 pounds) and there are no crackers to be found anywhere. In addition, he has the not-very-useful general on his hurdle wanting to find the astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on, even though Mr. Nelson can not tell you anything. There are also some random characters thrown in for good measure who find the man that melts. Eventually, the movie ends and the monster is thrown into a trash can to become composed. In the end, that's exactly what you need for a great episode of MST.
