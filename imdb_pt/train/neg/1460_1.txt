If another Hitler comes up, it will be partly thanks to nonsense like this movie, which spreads the absurd notion that he was a visibly disturbed lunatic from the start. Far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office on earth, sane people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would have died in a ditch, nameless and unknown. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads the accounts of Hitler's close associates - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge, for example - will be impressed by the fact that people consider him a gentle, intelligent and generous man. He was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches seemed exaggerated and irreverent to modern ears, ignores the times when they were made, when widespread pomp was common in political speeches. Same exaggerated anti-Semitism, which was not even a central plank of the early Nazis - who were mostly anticommunists - neither unusual nor unusual for the times. The film makes it appear that Hitler's only ambition from the beginning was the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person that will cause the death of tens of millions, you can ignore the fleck-lipped ravers. the life portrayed here. Instead, look for a charming and charismatic man whose persuasive speeches inspire the whole nation and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. I'm afraid his personality is much more like that of Barack Obama than that of Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I expected a lot here and I got nothing more than caricature. The fools who did this thing perpetrated a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of "Reefer Madness".
