I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget movies, so that was not my problem with that. My problem with this is that I felt like I was watching my neighbor's home movie next door. IMO all about it looked like a guy wrote a quick story, got a camera and started filming. I understand how hard this should be to do effectively, but when I pay to rent a movie, I expect to feel like I'm watching some kind of professionally made movie. <br /> John Schneider has a huge resume, is a great actor, and was fine in this movie. The other people were not. I understand how fun and cheap it should be to use friends and relatives as cast, but that does not contribute to a compelling performance. It looked like the way it was filmed, it was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look, but when writing, plot and acting are there to begin with, that kind of style is not necessary, and it's a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also on a technical level, I had digital artifacts all over the place. In the first scene of all those beautiful cars, when they did a slow sweep of them, they seemed to move a little back and forth. The problem is not in my display equipment, (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonal), but somewhere in the production.I have never seen this kind of artifact in a professionally made film before.Then there was the sound. did no voice-overs, which may be ok, unless it sounded like the track in this movie. It looked like the built-in microphone in the camera.
