"The Second Coming Of Suzanne" is one more of those surrealistic movies that try to be extremely sophisticated, but all it does is put the viewer to sleep. Like other such films, dialogue is limited. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetics of shooting. However, cinematography stinks, so there is nothing to keep your attention. <br /> <br /> The video box states that this movie is "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen in the movies". Yes of course. It's up there, watching events as stimulating as a bucket of ice melting or a tortoise walking a mile. 1/10
