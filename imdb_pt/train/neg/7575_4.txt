A retired diplomat, played by Michael York, goes to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who murdered the diplomat's son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian police officer who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> I remembered the old 80s action movies that always portray the Russians as evil villains to undermine. the US government fair. It's interesting to see the Russian guy this time as a hero. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, it's typically a "B" action movie. Michael York lends a bit of class to this mediocre movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop, is kind of "blah," but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Facing him, Michael York is such a good actor that he would have chemistry with whom he is making a scene. Regrettably, the beautiful Adrian Paul is killed in the first 15 minutes of the film. Now, if Adrian Paul were in this longer film, it would have been an above-average "B" action movie. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he's really cool to see himself in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is his typical villain. He is very blond and very villainous in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if there is nothing else on the TV to watch. It's ok. Do not suck too badly. The action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could have moved much faster, but hey, you can see how Russia is today!
