I would have appreciated this movie a bit more had it not been for Jason (Herb) Evers constant harping in the experiment. Many of the early critics of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of exaggerating. However, as more and more critics saw this film, they saw it as being purposely done. Jason Evers obviously is not Toshiro Mifune, and his exaggeration is just that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this classic B were good actors, minus Evers and the dancers. If you watch this movie, you would have noticed Evers screaming almost every line, that is, until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coldly through his nose. <br /> <br /> Special effects were par for the course in a B movie like this. In hindsight, there is not much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie.
