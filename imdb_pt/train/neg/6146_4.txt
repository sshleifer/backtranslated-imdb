How this movie escaped the wrath of MST3K I will never know. "Gymkata" is a ridiculous, full-fledged action movie (or is it empty?) With fine plots like paper, silly characters and absurd situations. But take it away from me, if you like watching poor but silly movies, you will really like "Gymkata". <br /> <br /> The action revolves around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see his father was another quasi-government agent, who disappeared competing in this game, eloquently called, "The Game". Then the gymnast (played gently by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost father. <br /> <br /> It looks promising, does not it? Ok, so this does not happen, but still, that sypnopsis of the skeleton storyline does not begin to describe the joys of this film. They can be found in the strange details of the movie. As the mysterious Asian girlfriend of the gymnast, who does not speak for the first half hour of the movie, then suddenly starts talking, and do not shut up for the rest of the time! Or the really tough shirtless thug who likes to make and break the nonexistent rules of "The Game" whenever he pleases. And, of course, there is the delightful joke of our hero through the "Village of the Crazy" (Evidently this is the real name of the place!). Good place to visit but I would not want to live there. <br /> <br /> But where this movie really shines are the action scenes. As our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thought it best to put gym equipment in the alleys and squares of Middle Eastern cities so that our Gymkata master could better use his gymnast skills to counter the scourge of evil in parallel. bars and pummel horses. It has to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> An interesting note thing. A lot, I'd say half the cast dies from being shot. Interesting because arrows are the only believable effects or actions throughout the movie. If these were indeed effects, my highest compliment to those who invented these very realistic arrow wounds. More likely, this was the movie's way of not paying extras. However, "Gymkata" deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some nonsense that is an easy target for riffing. <br /> <br />
