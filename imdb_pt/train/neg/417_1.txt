I get to the movies every week or so, and I regularly check out this site, but I've never felt compelled to comment on a movie before. <br /> <br /> To my list of shockingly bad movies - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - Now I can add the drivel that was 'Hollow Man'. <br /> <br /> From the terrible opening titles - a ridiculously long run of cast and crew together with alphabetti spaghetti - to the end insulting - a record world number of clichés and some of the most absurd dialogues and performances that have come to cinema - this film is bleak, and only the impressive graphics of the computer prevent it from leaving before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> This is not just my opinion - it was that of my friends and everyone around us. When large sections of an audience are laughing and moaning during and after a serious thriller, it becomes clear that the film is useless. <br /> <br /> Not only that, he was also sick. The director took action beyond the limits of the realistic fare for a violent film, and into the realms of a blood-soaked B-movie. It is hard not to imagine the director as a kind of dirty old man because the length of the invisible man's incursions out of the laboratory and into the outside world extended only to two attempts to feel some breasts. Perhaps sex can be the first thing done in a man's mind, if invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasures of the women involved, he hardly makes entertainment movies. <br /> <br /> [spoilers follow] <br /> <Go through the exterior of the movie, and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job of acting more and more like "hollow man", the rest of them - perhaps undermined by a mediocre script - does an even better job of being cast. A long-time member of the team is found strangled in a closet by the invisible man, "He's finally been attacked" shrugs a colleague's shoulders without a hint of emotion. That goes for the course, and the lab staff swings between sheer terror and complete indifference so fast you wonder how they got into the action. They walk down the aisles of the laboratory in terror, their guns pointed, but seconds later one of the crew jumps happily back down the corridor to get blood from a wounded colleague. The main woman treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humor even after he has insulted her and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to her escapes, even after he drowns the Pentagon chief, "He drowned in his pool at night past "same woman, spectacularly failing to put two and two together. <br /> <br /> The script is filled with poorly executed pedestrian dialogues, and the rest is just an AZ of movie clichés, faster as the movie progresses to the point of disbelief and fun at the end. <br /> <br /> The eureka moment on the computer, the woman undressing in the window, the looped security video - the list really is endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars, but only to place them in a place of probable imminent death and leave them to their fate, the good boy almost dead emerging from nowhere to save the woman, the bomb and the ubiquitous Timer Tdown, the explosion of the ball fire that only burns before reaching the heroes, the elevator that simply stops before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy. The invisible man is burned to a fragment with an improvised, electrocuted flamer, struck around the head with a bar he had just cut directly through one of the smaller actors, and then apparently having survived the blast, fireball and total destruction of the labs, has more than enough life to climb through the fireball to a last pop in the movie heroes - at which stage the unbelieving public is shrinking and looking at their watches / from them. <br /> <br /> That this exceptionally bad movie really made it to the movies is amazing. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even stunning special effects even come close to saving this movie, which should be avoided at all costs.
