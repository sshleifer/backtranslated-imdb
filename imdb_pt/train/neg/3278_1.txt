I have to say that many people have argued that some of us need to stick with the times because the new movie "Dukes" is a modernized version. OH, PLEASE. If this is what you consider modernized, Hollywood can keep you going. Many people on the MSN site also said this (and I quote), "You, old fogies, need to get over this, except as they are." Well, let me tell you one thing, I am 24 years old, so I am far from OLD FOGIE, and I will not get over it, it was a DOOM FOR ALL WHAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The only certain thing in the title of the movie was "HAZZARD". All the swearing, smoking, and drinking were really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has been to several morning shows to discuss the film and, frankly, I believe it all went to her head. She's not at all a Daisy Duke, maybe a coincidence, but she's definitely not Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not like Bo. They should have included the original cast as at least apparitions, but even Hollywood knew they would not approve the script. I mean, come on, until today actors and actresses are expressing a negative opinion, so why are some of you making positive comments?
