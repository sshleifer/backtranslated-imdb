I've been looking for the right words to describe this movie. At first I was inclined to simply jump to more significant subjects, since the film does not reach a deserving level of commentary. <br /> <br /> However, I stopped, puzzled over how to describe these things and a bit puzzled by the challenge presented by the question: "What can you say about such a movie?" Garbage? No, it's not trash, trash can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, it's not greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants grow big and healthy. <br /> <br /> Finally, I found "Not even bad," a rephrasing of the phrase "Not even wrong" sometimes used in theoretical physics. to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed or even worthy of correction. That's right, Georgia Rule: Not even bad.
