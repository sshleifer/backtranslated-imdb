I just saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was REALLY unimpressed. Despite all the Oscar buzz, this is nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed by this movie never bothered to see any of the true movie classics. Except for Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV movie with no style or style. Just a bunch of amateurs singing to each other! <br /> <br /> Now the first half hour was good, but I was annoyed at how Eddie Murphy's incredible performances were truncated and interrupted by mounts. These were easily the best songs and best performances of the movie. And the "climb to the top" part of the movie was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any time. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, disjointed, unrealistic, or fantastic enough mess to be interesting. It was also visually monotonous and included many songs similar to sounds. <br /> <br /> Condon did not try to turn any of the songs into big pieces like I expected them to. Each number in the second half was just one close after another of people "singing" in each other. And the way they recorded the large number of Hudson's "love me" was criminal! Condon just shot his stage around the stage - no drama! God sucked! <br /> <br /> And note to everyone involved - that the material of the "talking dialogue" can work on stage, but DOES NOT WORK IN THE MOVIES (see Evita and Phantom embarrassing failures). All I'll teeeell youuuu something Efff-ieeee! crap should have been left on the floor of the editing room. These are not "songs". <br /> <br /> Once again, the film - apart from Eddie Murphy's incredible performance - was nothing more than a glorified TV movie. There must have been megabucks behind the RP work for this movie! I wonder how much money was spent to give you this pre-release "one to beat" Oscar buzz? As a whole, this movie was, with the exception of Eddie, NOWHERE NEAR, an Oscar-caliber movie! (Except Eddie) I would rate it right there with Grease 2. Big disappointment, especially after all the hype (very expen $ I've)!
