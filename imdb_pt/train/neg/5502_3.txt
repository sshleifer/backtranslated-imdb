A silly joke, often ridiculous, involving the landing of a spacecraft and the resulting devastation that this causes in Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people in their orbit. <br /> <br /> I'm always impressed with Daniels. He showed such depth and promised in 1983, "Terms of Endearment", as Shirley MacLaine's son-in-law's wife-in-law. Over the years, Daniels could not get his hands on a good role of flesh. Instead, he's in innate comedies like "Dumb and Dumber." <br /> <br /> As for this photo, it fails because of the subject. At least the television show brought a variety of situations. In the movie, we have constant clowning and people turn into monsters when the government is barred from capturing the Martian-Martin. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Brown's part is a perfect example of the movie's non-success. movie. On television, Pamela Britton portrayed a servant individual trapped in situations with the Martian leaving her perplexed. In the film version, a blonde bomb like Brown tries a romantic engagement. <br /> <br /> Does television star Ray Walston play a small role as a government agent, or is he really like this? <br /> <br /> A big disappointment for those who liked the TV show a lot.
