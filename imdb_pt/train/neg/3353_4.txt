A really bad movie does not offer anything new. The usual groans and moans try to make up for a confusing but thin story. Acting is just above pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed for this is a guess. Owen Wilson really turns into one of the worst performances in the recent history of horror movies. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to watch and not much else, although Lili Tayor has done an above average job. The special effects were quite memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and breathtakingly beautiful. However, they can not paint the bad acting and the plot that seems to have been played at the last minute. Do not bother yourself.
