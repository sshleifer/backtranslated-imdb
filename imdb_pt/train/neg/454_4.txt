Usually more rated movie that features a strong cast and some clever dialogue and of course Dean Martin songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost compensates for this with his reactions to Cage's inconstant accent and out-of-control body language. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and presents himself as an actor instead of a real person and this is what is needed in a love story. Cage had these same performance problems in other roles requiring more than one Jimmy Stewart-type character. Cage continues to take these roles, perhaps because he likes this kind of film, but his own acting energy does not lend itself to them, although he has improved with repeated attempts. He must leave this kind of role to less interesting actors who are totally committed to the film and spend his considerable energy and talent on more improvised roles and films in which he may be a very crazy and interesting subject.
