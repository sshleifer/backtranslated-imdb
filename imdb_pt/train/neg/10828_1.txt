This is not just my verdict on this movie, but also on most of what was written about it. Now, do not get me wrong here too, I'm not a total philistine, I did not hate the movie because it was not enough like 'police academy 9' or anything, I like it more than my fair share of tall eyebrows or artistic things , I swear. <br /> <br /> Magnolia is poor, and I'm honestly confused as to why it's apparently so acclaimed. Nonsense long, self-indulgent, meaningless from beginning to end, there is so little that could be what people love in the film. There are some high caliber players who are fair enough, and none have medium or worse performance. In addition, my wife (a self confessed Tom Cruise hater) tells me that his career is performing better by far. But the plot is so uninteresting, wandering through the stories of several loosely connected characters in the rhythm of a snail that, even when significant life-changing events are portrayed, they seem so meaningless and uninteresting that you end up crying over someone being blown up or something like. It does not help that neither character is very easy to identify or sympathize with (well, I do not think so, but I do not like most people admittedly). They all play their somewhat uninteresting life stories, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever more intricate detail and throwing their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many soliloquies on the way. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack is awful, too, with that annoyingly annoying quality that I had previously thought to be Alanis Morisette's only song. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was as enjoyable three hours as being forced to watch an episode of 'Friends' repeatedly while intermittently being poked in the ribs by a disgruntled asshole goat. The bit with the frogs is fine though.
