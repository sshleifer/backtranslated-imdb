this movie was a big disappointment. the level of cruelty and ruthless violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and petty. the main characters were impossible to identify or even sympathize with. the main character's character was as viscous as they came. the room / sick room environment lent itself to exaggerated theatricality. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish Civil War from this movie. Fortunately, I've been to Spain and I realize this is not realistic! In addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a shocking "horror" was also very offensive and poorly administered, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess. I think if you enjoy seeing children and animals being brutally killed, this movie may be especially appealing to you.
