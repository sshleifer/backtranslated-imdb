Watching this was like getting a big mackerel on your face again and again. Even when you thought, "That mackerel certainly can not go back there," * slap * there it was. Not sure what they were thinking. This is the kind of pilot I watched and I asked myself, "Did the actors know they were on a doomed ship meant to never be turned into a series?" Not only the black stereotypes, but also the Swedes and Indians. And while "Blazing Saddles" made these stereotypes a mixture of comedy and discomfort, those stereotypes were downright offensive. There was no plot, the end was stamped and the jokes are not. Still, if you're a comedy student, watch this pilot to see what you should not do.
