I love horror movies that bring a real amount of mystery as the "silent hill" (which I found to be very good but still missing something) and movies that keep you guessing, I thought that was one of those movies. At first, the film begins with a very good suspense and builds a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that, it descends the hill and from there, it only descends faster and faster. I mentioned silent hill at first for a reason, because I can see a lot of "stolen" themes of the movie here .. All in all I would say, watch the silent hill instead of this, it's better, it's more scary, It has much more suspense and also the end is much better .. And best of all, you will not feel robbed like I did with this one .. This just seems to be one of those "I like this movie so I'm going to re- do it in my own very bad version "half movie .. Oh and one more thing ... Lordi .. in a horror movie ... this is like trying to scare a child with a care bear who has" hug me and I'll love you forever "written on his stomach ..
