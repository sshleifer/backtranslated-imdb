Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with some top quality credits on her resume. I'm certainly happy that she has recovered from this movie that seems to have her fans. I'm not one of them. <br /> <br /> I've seen better acting in high school than in Smithereens. The plot, as he is involved young Susan Berman, who is ambitious to do so in the music world and is willing to do just about anything to get there. She even rejects the heartfelt advances of a young artist who is living out of her van in the East River played by Brad Rijn. <br /> <br /> Young Mr. Rijn contributes the worst performance of the film, actually one of the worst acting jobs I've seen in a long time. No wonder he has not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> I will say that Seidelman's eye to the camera is good for capturing the familiar locations of the East Village where the film was filmed. But her work with live artists did not compare. I'm not sure if she had too much raw material to work with. <br /> <br /> Look fast and you'll see a young Christopher Noth before Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street hooker. If you like punk rock, you can sit with this for the soundtrack. I'm staying with Bing Crosby.
