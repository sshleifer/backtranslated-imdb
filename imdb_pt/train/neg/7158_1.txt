This is one of the worst performances I have ever seen. I love Nadja from Almereyda, but that's just an absolute dreck. In addition to a few moments of interesting cinematography and music, this film is just an uninterrupted act and a mute material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one in this is remotely good. The plot is a joke, but not the haha ​​type. I do not even know if you can forgive movies that are so bad. Please erase the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director do Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
