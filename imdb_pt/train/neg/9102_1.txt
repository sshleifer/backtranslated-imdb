I was willing to go with the original Crucial Intentions. She followed the plot and remained true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this movie was, in my opinion, a crass summary with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices. I honestly do not care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) are the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I was not clear until I read the IMDB that this movie was made to be a prequel, especially since the title included a "2" number, I expected a sequel but then determined that it should be a complementary piece. Above all, I must say that this movie read, at least for me, as a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
