I wish I had recorded the MEN IN WHITE so I could watch it again. <br /> <br /> "What? You mean you really liked Theo?" <br /> <br /> No, I mean I could watch it again to see if it was as retarded, stupid and as embarrassingly bland as I remember. <br /> <br /> Many people have stated that it was made for children. May I suggest that it was also done by children? because the whole structure of the script does not have any kind of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and many of the scenarios seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time. <br /> <br /> The cast does not help, but I really started to feel sorry for them. Honestly, you may believe that during the filming, the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard pornographic film, such was the embarrassment of having to appear in something as gloomy as that. To give you an idea of ​​how bad performance is every time BAYWATCH's darling, Donna D'Ericco, disappeared from the narrative, I waited patiently for her to reappear, seconds later I forgot she was in the movie. Got that ? A BAYWATCH star appears and seconds later you forget they are in the movie. That tells you everything you need to know about the MEN IN WHITE pattern <br /> <br /> Just enough, it's trying to be a live action cartoon similar to THE GOODIES (Although THE DISMALS is a better adjective for this movie), although perhaps the film deserves some credit for never descending to the bathroom mood, but considering this is a children's movie (This did not stop ITV broadcasting at 11 pm) so it should not be close to the mood of joining in it anyway
