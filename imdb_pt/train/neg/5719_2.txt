This movie is very much like the movie Hostel, except with * BAD * acting and not much suspense. The gore elements are there, but you feel nothing for the characters, making violence not very effective. Some parts are just weird ... like forcing a snake in someone's throat. What is up with that? Is this supposed to be scary or bloody? It's kind of stupid. As for torture, there really is none (except for the guy being hurt in the beginning, which they do not show anyway). The main villain keeps saying "make them die slowly," but the butcher kills everything very fast. The killings are all relatively fast. Yes, I watched the "unrated" version. So overall, not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not good either. You will not miss a beat if you skip this one.
