I wonder how the actors acted in this movie. Annette Bening was really herself, half in and half out, was she pretending or being natural? It did not make any difference, considering that even if she was walking on the ceiling, it would not have changed the pattern of the movie. Brian Cox acted very well. I almost thought he had always been this way, complicated, dishonest, in a dirty environment where no one cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what she was doing in this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty disgusting and disgusting. Who would pay to see this crap?
