The most horrible recount of a great series. It should not have been called Battlestar Galactica, because it's just the same in name alone. Too many changes to just have changes. You have characters transformed from males to females, blacks, Asians, and Cylon, all to "attract the female audience," when there were already strong female characters who could have grown stronger. Gone are the Egyptian sentiment. Gone are the search for land. The lack of cylinders to go to the reject terminator takes out the film, especially when making a fembot. Granted the original show had a lot of cheese for him but had a large following. They tried to hold on to the next, but they did not give anything to the fans to work on and basically spit in their faces while making it their own story. The changes are good, when they do something better, not just to do them.
