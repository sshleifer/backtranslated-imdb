I had high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth. I was not satisfied with this movie. I liked Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago so I figured this would have more of a bang for it. First I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. He looks like his eyebrows have been reformed for that. His performance was not convincing. It was not as good as one might expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The Gama thing really did not fit the original story line, I do not think. I think the best part of the movie was the end. Had some legal action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not so long but got a little annoying at times. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this really cheap movie for sale and I always wondered why? I know now. I was hoping to be surprised, but I was not.
