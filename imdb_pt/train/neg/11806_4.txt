It was hard to watch this movie and be totally fair and objective, since I am a big fan of the original 1944 film. This, for me and for many others, is one of the greatest noirs films ever made. Realizing this is simply a shortened movie made for TV and that most people had destroyed, I did not expect much, but you can not help but compare it to the 1944 movie. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking, and remembering how it happened with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was all over, I thought it was not as bad as I expected but it was no match for the original 1944. The two main areas in which this movie made for TV was not so good were ( 1) the electricity between the two links was missing and (2) being only 90 minutes, they ran the story with little time to develop the plot, characters and chemistry between those leads. Crenna and Eggar were plans, and simply were no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson", respectively. <br /> <br /> Where this re-achievement has remained, it was in the other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton". Cobb was great as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It was also a bit interesting to see the timeline changed, so the houses, cars, phones, dictating machines, etc., were all from the early 70's rather than the mid 40's. Otherwise, the plot was very similar , just rushed. <br /> <br /> However, one preview was enough and I'll be happy to get back to the original version for the rest of my visions of this classic story and movie.
