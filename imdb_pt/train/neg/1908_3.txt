One more insult and a slap in the face of gays everywhere. This stupid attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it. Once again, we have an attractive "straight" hero who supposedly can not get any woman interested in him. Okay, right! And we are also presented with the gay friend "nice and attractive" who is actually a fat, bald and ugly old man that the leader must find attractive. Even I did not find him attractive and I am a fat gay, ugly and old (but fortunately not bald) gay! Whatever the acting talent that may have been here, it was thrown out in a bad script and in the really terrible direction. Sneedeker should be banned from the movies, but no different from the many hacks that work at Hollyweed.
