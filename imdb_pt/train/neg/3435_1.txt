I asked for this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on ebay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for that movie. As a lifelong horror fan, from fancy American slashers from the 1980s to European zombie movies, I told myself that would be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it would be a lot nicer than it really is. After all I heard about this movie, I was almost afraid to watch it. Murders are boring. The acting ... forget it, there is no performance! The story, even if we do not mind, is unbelievably bad. It seems they've tried to get your attention with some weird sex scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately, in this case, that does not help the movie. Because? There's no atmosphere, and that's the worst thing about this movie. It's just a bad movie from point A to point B. Although it's extremely funny and fun to watch with your friends and lots of beers, make no effort to get your hands on it. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste your time watching Necro Files!
