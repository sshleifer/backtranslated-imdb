Words can not describe how stupid this story is (and therefore bad, this movie) is! Basinger, Del Toro ... what were you thinking? So there is a mall and its parking space is totally full. Basinger's character comes in to buy a cup of tea and some paper for packaging. <br /> <br /> When she leaves, the whole place is so empty, that no one hears two shots fired nearby? Even if she lives there, when she drives away from the bad guys, does she go to the most remote and abandoned place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place? LET'S GO !!! I will not even get into the infamous red toolbox, since other people have done this before. Much less how she kills the dumb idiots one by one. <br /> <br /> This is so stupid, without the least logic, I can only warn you watching, it is a total waste of time, honestly !!
