I had a hard time getting through this movement. It was extremely slow and sometimes he wondered when the plot of the movie would actually come to life. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to flow slowly and I wondered when it would end. I'm usually a person who likes a good indie file from time to time but this does not satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> It seemed like they tried to take advantage of this movie. At one point, it seemed to turn into politics, which I'm not much of a movie fan. If you are looking for a slow moving movie with little or no plot then this is the right movie for you. As for me, I felt that I lost two hours when I could do something else.
