I was in second grade 12 years ago. I remember that clearly. We were learning about space. All little children want to go into space, right? Well, after I saw this, I was so scared that I would be 'accidentally' thrown into space by some psychotic robot with a mind of a clue. I had no idea that this was a movie. I thought it was some news show or something. I think it was my own version of when people were scared by the radio show 'War of the Worlds'. So recently, I get this movie again to watch, realizing that my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even more at acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, she moves in slow motion, have you noticed that? I do not think being in space makes you talk so slow or think it's slow. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank, and begins to float backward while the security doors close. . Little Max is trying to pull her inside. Suddenly we get a great close-up on Max's face when he screams (in slow motion) "Whaaaaattttssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
