As a big fan of gorilla movies in general, I predicted this would be great - and as for gorilla effects, they were pretty good, though - that's the only thing I can write about that failure. The film claims to be based on a true story, but actually does not even come close to what really happened to "Buddy" - which in real life was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. by our so-called "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known to many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had the welfare of her animals in the best interest. As for Buddy being portrayed as aggressive, this was total fiction and at no point did the gorilla, in real life, resort to such behavior. In fact, Buddy escaped from his wooden box (not from a cage room as shown in the film) during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which scared Gertrude Lintz to sell it. No, Buddy was not released in a family of gorillas surrounded by lush trees in a zoo paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden crate at the bottom of a garage for some time with only a lamp for comfort and then sold to the circus - where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla in history, by the way) before a show in Miami. Also notice, in the movie, how Buddy ages, but chimps never grow old. (Chimpanzees, by the way, were not raised simultaneously with other animals, including Buddy, as portrayed in the film)
