A very common product made for TV, "Tyson" attempts to be a serious biographical film, while lengthening the moments of distress to the effect, advancing quickly through the esoteric of boxing's corrupt sport, and confusing the sensationalist stuff that is the only thing which makes the Tyson still remotely interesting. A warm watch at best, which is more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans.
