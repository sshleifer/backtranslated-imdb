Okay, so Chuck Norris somehow found a way to produce that sequel. I have a question: why? Who read this script and said: "The sound is great! Original!" This film is a regurgitated crap that I would not stain my bathroom with gut. Of course it's another story, following the tradition of MIA, US Invasion, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force and so on, in which Chuck Norris, of course, is the only man who can be equal to America for some bad guys. He does not even need a gun most of the time. It's a stupid patriotic jargon that invades the mind. Big surprise that the only one who will direct these Norris movies is Chuck's son, Eric. Eric Norris has worked primarily on all of his father's movies and TV shows. Does not that seem to anyone as a sign that he has no talent for driving? After all, it's targeting the same people as before in the same stories as before ... the only difference is the characters' names. If this is to make me a patriot and cheer for the USA, that our country is in a much worse state than I imagined. I hope this is the nail in Chuck Norris's acting coffin.
