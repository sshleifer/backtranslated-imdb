OK, another movie bought by me and Joe Swatman. Okay, this is not the worst movie I've reviewed this week, but it's still shit. We had so much fun watching this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> The monster puzzle is a crazy mix of all these dysfunctional student ideas, you just know that you are in trouble when someone equips you with a buzzsaw and a shotgun saw, the movie does not was as bloody as we expected, I mean about the deaths is a heart attack. Again I think acting is crap, the sum of the actors should be porn stars and one get into their panties for any reason. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part is the end, it leaves open for a bit of a Jigsaw 2, but this never happens happen leaves face to it. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br/> <br/> funny 4/100 simulated (how much fun we mock it) 73/100 acting 8/100 usually 12/100
