Do not misunderstand me - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as the movies, but enough comes again: Death On The Nile. Everyone already did it! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough! Mr. Suchet could have used this incredible talent in another of Agatha Christie's novels. I will say that the acting of all the actors was superb. The scenarios were wonderful and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was surprised at how 'awful' he looked. I hope it does not look like this in "real" life! I honestly can not remember other movies if the ending was the same. Somehow I do not think so. I thought this was a very bright touch, either. Christie wrote it that way or not. I'd rather this ending end up in jail!
