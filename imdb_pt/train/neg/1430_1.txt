While flipping through the canals on a Saturday night, my friends and I came across this movie. First of all, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American? Seriously?! His accent was breaking a lot, although his character was apparently Scottish. Then I was shocked to discover that this movie was made after he had already played James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice. This film reproduces the stereotypes, with the teacher's inspiring figure. The girl who played Pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut. And this movie won a prize? I can not believe this. Brosnan is a handsome man, but we wanted to seriously evaluate our eyes after watching it for only 10 seconds. We switched from "Kicking and Screaming" to that, and we wanted to go back. We watched the 1995 children's classic "The Indian in the Closet" earlier in the evening, which also discussed the Iroquois. The following line represents our desire to flee: "Take me out to the earth." From "Gray Owl": "If you do not like it, you do not need to watch it."
