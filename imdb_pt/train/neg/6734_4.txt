I found this movie a great idea, it was not delivered. It seems they found a way to create suspense, but they could not organize their payments very well. In one case, police are on watch to find the kidnappers' hiding place. They go meticulously from dentist to dentist to match a dental record. At the same time, the hijacked man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After the whole process, the police arrive at the same time that he is free, which is very anti-climatic, to say the least. There are also great narration scenes that take us "inside the thought" of the terrified husband and wife, which lessens the suspense rather than increasing his interest. We are fully aware of his tension, and the narration is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock has proved several times, is much more effective. The biggest disappointment is to sit through the movie and get the fast and bland ending. I mean just ... "ends" in a snore.
