this movie had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck was seriously trying not to act in any way, shape or form. He was completely sucked. Nothing about the movie was believable. The first problems were in the intro, where the man gives everything of value to the Salvation Army, Santa Claus, but does not show why. And then the grandmother stuck her head in the oven - very pretty, and has absolutely nothing to do with the film - not even the tone of the film. There was no explanation for the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose; there was no credible reaction from the family he chose; and people are swayed here and there for no reason to be influenced (Example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck characters walk down a steep slope - this is the incident that causes her to suddenly fall in love with him.) There was a funny moment or two, but they were a rarity in the movie. Another rewrite (or 4) is seriously needed. I hope you enjoy!
