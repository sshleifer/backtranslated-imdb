Has anyone edited this movie? Or was it just the DVD release that took huge thirty-second intervals between scenes? All right, I fell asleep watching for the first time. So I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is not really the worst I've seen, but it's close. The acting is not the worst I've seen ... but it's close. The production .... well, I can honestly say it was the worst I have ever seen in my life! Not trying to be spiteful, but Unhinged could have used more production. <br /> <br /> Please do not think that I am a horror movie hater, or even that I did not like this movie. I just felt like I was laughing at the movie a lot more than I felt I was laughing along with it. The horrible moments were not too badly done, but they could have been done better even on a tight budget. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, the end of the twist was pretty bad, and the exposure took forever without exposing too much. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
