Snuggle up in your favorite chair and turn on the play-station while you throw it at the garbage disposal unit. Spend 90 working minutes. living their favorite game. Disarticulated - poorly filmed - waste not directed. It takes a few bits of several other "science fiction" movies and bad attempts to piece together a pathetically weak story. There is nothing new here, filmmakers do not seem to realize that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game, but a touch of ingenuity and skill are needed to turn it into a good movie. Any money spent watching this is a waste, and personally I would like my 90 minutes of life back.
