This has to be one of the worst movies of the 90's. When my friends and I were watching this movie (being the target audience for which it was directed) we just sat and watched the first half hour with our jaws touching the floor as the city was really bad. The rest of the time, everyone in the theater just started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying in their popcorn that they actually paid the money they had earned working to watch this faint excuse for a movie. It must have seemed like a great idea on paper, but in the movie it seems like no one in the movie has any idea what's going on. Crap, crap outfits. I can not understand how embarrassing this is to watch. Save yourself an hour and a bit of your life .........
