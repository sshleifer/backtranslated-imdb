I went to see the Omega Code with a group of other Christians, totaling about 15 people. We were all expecting a good piece of Christian film production. What we got was a terribly painful, prolonged, and tedious attempt at a movie. It has good production values, but it also has bad acting, a weak script with a bad dialogue and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes, we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated it, and some people in our group put that film with more cheese smell than "Anaconda". None of us could believe that the film lasted less than two hours. Flamboyant effects and crisp-looking cinematography can not save this bad and bad movie. I would give it a 3 out of 10, and the rating is just as high because I rented the abominable "Werewolf movie" (1996) the night before this movie.
