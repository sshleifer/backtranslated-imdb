Terminus Paradis was exceptional, but "Niki ardelean" arrives too late. We have enough of that and we want something new. <br /> <br /> Great directors should have no trouble seeing beyond their time, not back. Why do people see Romania only as a post-revolutionary country? <br /> <br /> We have just not reincarnated, and no one else regrets the old days. Most people do not remember or do not want to remember, and the new generation of movie consumers do not understand. This must be the first day of the Romanian film not the last song - priveghi! Maybe younger directors should make the move.
