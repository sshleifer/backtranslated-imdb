Nowhere near the original. It is a very precise copy that brings nothing new to the story. But the direction is very poor. Basinger is weak - with no good direction. Baldwin is simply just a second league compared to McQueen. I watched this out of curiosity, being a big fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and got what I thought. Almost a B movie with acting and direction of second category. I was not even disappointed, just do not know what they were trying to do. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it is not a homage and in fact it does not have a very good actor of its time. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of a wonderful photo. This is a complete waste of your time. Save 2 hours or watch the original (again :)))
