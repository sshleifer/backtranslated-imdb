First let me be honest. I did not watch the whole movie. I watched the first five minutes and when I realized I had almost fallen to sleep I decided that I might as well move on and see if it got any more interesting later ... It did not happen. This film is just a collection of useless attempts to make a story that is already uninteresting and badly told in something that would never become: a decent horror film. Because I feel it's important to say that even a movie with bad special effects can still be good if it's done right. This movie is not and will only put you into a deep sleep if you try to watch it. Finally, I feel it's important to say that I think this movie is in the public domain, so if you think you should watch it, then a little search on the internet will surely show you a place where you do not have to pay to watch. pile of film manure.
