I've seen this movie many times (and I recently read the book the movie is based on) and every time I see it, I just want to slap them all. The fact that they give no clue about the fact that Tom Hank's character is plunging into his D & D (oops M & M) :) persona ("Oh, he's just acting in character") outside the session game. That is the fact that after three months of therapy, we will destroy all this and feed your delusions! This kind of person is what gives RPGs a bad name. <br /> <br /> Also the 'ballad of love', and the music made by 'cat on the piano' and 'stop us if we get annoying' are almost enough to put our teeth on the edge!
