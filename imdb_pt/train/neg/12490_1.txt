I own this movie. I bought for $ 3.99 at a major video retailer in order to make some sort of "indie" type of movie search since I had just finished my own feature and was editing. I feel down on my skills as a director I Sit down with a plate of biscuits and Severed. In a few minutes I feel great !!! <br /> <br /> I hate talking to another filmmaker, so I'm going to use constructive criticism : 1. Find good actors 2. At the time of video recording, brighten your scenes and darken in the computer later in the post 3. Close up is best for Video 4. When an actor comes on the scene, wait a little before /> <br /> have them talking so we know what's going on and who's talking 5. Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to open it, which is well worth $ 3.99 True horror would be getting Severed's reviews here on IMDb and you have to give credit to these characters. ras ... they were distributed.
