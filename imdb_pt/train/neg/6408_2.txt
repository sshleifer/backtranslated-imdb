UPA movies are surprisingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the quality of the animation is light years behind that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM at its peak. Unfortunately, because of the increased cost of creating beautiful cartoons with high frame rates and beautiful backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted in 1950) began to dominate in the late 1950s and 1960s. After all, the movies were too cheap to be made and they received several Oscars to "prove" that the cartoons were now popular. So as a result, bad animation was becoming the norm and this trend was not reversed until the 80's. This UPA film is one of the first. The characters are very simple (any simpler and they would use figures) and the backgrounds were ugly - drawings of simple lines with colors added in a very superficial way (often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items). <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's a story with a strong jazz attitude. Some will love this, others will find it very, very loud. It's the traditional story of "Frankie and Johnny" and because of the shootings and everything else, it's probably not a great movie for kids. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, is not a particularly good movie for me either! Some will read my review and will undoubtedly think I am a crank (which I am to some extent). However, I love animation films and some of that minimalist style of UPA is very, very long, and you can not consider them seriously great works of art - just very, very fast drawings. Ignore the Oscar and try to watch some classic cartoons or something - anything else!
