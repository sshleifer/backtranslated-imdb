This movie was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, f√©minin and I recommend you watch this movie instead. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements and these are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Besides, what strikes me the most is the endless stream of foolishness. Lena Nyman has to be the boring actress in the world. She acts stupidly and with all the nudity in this movie ... it's unattractive. Compared to Godard's film, the intelligentsia was replaced by stupidity. Without going very far on this subject, I would say that this stems from the difference of ideals between French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> A film of your time and place. 2/10
