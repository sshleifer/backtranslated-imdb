Style but no substance. It's not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as you want to be. <br /> <br /> This is another in the genre of movies about the difficulties of cinema. A young filmmaker is hired to complete a 1960s science fiction movie called Codename: Dragonfly. Think Barbarella, or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Davies is an anguished filmmaker. He's not a hack, he's an artist. The movie he wants to make is a diary of his life. Hardly original. <br /> <br /> All the characters outside the Jeremy Davies filmmaker are as thin as rice paper. Characters that might be interesting, like his father, his doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzmann as a director hack are introduced and then show the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of sweet eye candy, but when compared to other films about filmmakers like Stardust Memories or 8 1/2, it pales in comparison. These movies are funny, provocative with well-developed characters. These films have lessons that apply from the outside. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be comic and eccentric, but it's just a derivative and there's a funny scene. Filmmakers describe this as a performance, but what is the satirical target? The actors say it's a tribute, but I think I prefer a full version of Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly entertaining with the setting, as is evident by the visual humor of the science fiction movie. inside a movie. But he does not share why we should have fun. <br /> <br /> Out of the science fiction movie, it's just a mess. There are errors of continuity, the filmmaker chooses a science fiction weapon after it has already been chosen. What? <br /> <br /> Just because he has a scene where the filmmaker is confronted by critics complaining about the lack of history, missing a point, a scene in which he admits that empty cunning does not mean that he has addressed these critical <br /> <br /> I think if your Roman Coppola you can get away with making a movie about an anguished idealist filmmaker who does not know what he means and so ends up saying nothing. In this sense, it can be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> I'd watch you on Circuit City on a wall full of TVs if I had a choice. Watch the 15-minute Codename: Dragonfly movies included in the DVD as extras and send it back.
