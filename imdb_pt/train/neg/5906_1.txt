This movie was terrible. The plot was a drug, the acting was bad, the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to tear out my eyes. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie back. The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack was a drug, I did not see chemistry between the two tracks, it's full of stereotypes, a special "celeb" stupid participation ... the most notable was Del " I'll drive as fast as I want .. "computer idiot. The worst thing is that these actors had to play on the spiritual side and even ruined everything. This film helps create a long line of lackluster efforts to turn LDS beliefs into Hollywood. I.E. The RM, the church dance, etc. etc. I would stop watching this movie and instead run first to a brick wall. You'll have more fun than watching this excuse for a show.
