Thanks to an infamous home video distributor who brought the so-called German independent series, Four For Venice is not only terrible but really horrible. So horrible, I got dumped in the second-hand merchandise store for extra money. Nick and Charlotte are a couple who reached an agreement to have sex only on Tuesday because of their hectic schedule of their profession. Eva and Luis are a couple who live from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly makes Eva lose the waitress job. Luis and Charlotte had a case in the back of Eva and Nick. Luis betrayed Eva by lying to her that he would be flying to London to do something related to his art, but the fact is that he is flying to Venice with Charlotte for a holiday of adultery. Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her two children to Venice for the showdown. The trip to Venice ends with Nick and Eva falling in love. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the trip from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy. Not only does it seem meaningless, but also dragged. In the film, Nick tries to get help in various ways, but ends up in vain. It's the strangers around you who act like idiots, or just stupid. The comedy also tended to add unnecessary scenes to prolong the story. While some of the problems can be solved with good judgment, no one in the movie is using common sense to solve the problem. They would rather go through a big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad that even the beautiful venues in Venice can not improve the film's reputation.
