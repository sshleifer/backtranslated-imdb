The pakage indicates that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are making a big bank robbery, but that's not what I got! I did not get anything! In the first half there is a new character (no introduction) in all other scenes. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just a long, boring and poorly lit chase scene. There is always an annoying sound in the background, be it a tall clock, a shrill siren, a whistling train, or even the horrible soundtrack of Quincy Jones. There are many ridiculously bad parts too. Sort of, the bad guys chasing Beatty on thin ice with a CAR! Or the police coming to the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
