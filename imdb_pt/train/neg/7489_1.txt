American films about war and Nazis simply can not be good. They can not refrain from becoming an idiot and following an agenda. All Nazis are evil, crazy, too proud, and Americans are so modest, but capable, sensitive, and human. Come on, stop this bullshit. The main character says something like "by this judgment, we have to make aggressive war a crime". America is a peaceful nation with its "defense" budget of the world # 1 $ 420 billion (# 2 China with only $ 51b)? Is it simply spent on it without any ... ROI? Why portray America as a peaceful nation when it is not? I do not much like movies with an agenda - they throw art into hell and try to persuade us to believe in something. Hollywood should put a label on the movies, just as labels have this label of "parental advice." We should have a "propaganda board," "propaganda," or a label of "politically correct advice" in some films. This is one of them.
