I understand the jokes very well, they just are not good. The show is awful. I understand, and that's another awful thing about it. The only cool character that NEVER was on the show was that bum in that episode, but then I watch the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible. Not funny, not funny! I do not want people to say "Only intelligent people understand" because if they are so smart, why do they judge people they do not even know and say they are not intelligent or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying "the sky is red" but never looking out. But anyway, this is absolutely the worst show I've ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they are horrible, your controversy is very stupid, your fart jokes and other jokes fluids are really stupid and usually consist of really bad deeds. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this program, but judging others when they do not even know anything about any of us is not exactly a smart comment.
