This was a truly insipid movie. The performances are of the third category, and the dialogue is so flamboyant that sometimes it seems that it has just rolled and died. My reason for renting this was simple: find a movie with script. I needed visual help for my presentation, so I figured why not use a clip? Boy was I wrong. After looking at my video store, I came across this, where it was suspected entitled "Starstruck". I thought, "What the hey," and decided to give it a try. Well, I was very unhappy with my results. There was perhaps one scene that I could use and meanwhile I was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the movie. So ... I got back and got Ed Wood. There's a movie I can use as an example. Then again, anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is "Starfucker".
