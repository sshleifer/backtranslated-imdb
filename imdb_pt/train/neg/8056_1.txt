Inept, boring and incoherent supernatural thriller in which college student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can not begin to say how bad this is ... nothing of importance happens, nor is there any kind of real entertainment value. I did not like this cast in this particular movie - they are all sadly unconvincing (so again, their roles are not good). Promoting this as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the scares? There is no sense or suspense - there are some good songs, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> How did this project receive the green light? Writer-director Steve Carpenter has no discernible vision or talent I can sense. Worst of all, the conclusion actually makes the whole movie meaningless. <br /> <br /> The alleged "killer cut" I saw is 86 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> 1/10
