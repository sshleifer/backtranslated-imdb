I hoped the movie was completely stupid. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but ridiculing the absurdity that happens in the singles rooms was also fun. <br /> <br /> That said, there were a lot of things about The Singles Ward that were completely annoying. The whole movie was poorly dubbed and made mouths watching while listening to their very annoying voices. This lack of professionalism has been superseded only by the appearance of Mormon celebrities who have no business. <br /> <br /> This movie will do well between Mormondom, especially in college communities where there are single rooms. However, the conclusion will not offer hope to the poor losers who are single. (Only the beautiful girls of the Singles Wing marry, the fat, the ugly, but all the ugly men do). Finally, we realized that the whole movie was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com.
