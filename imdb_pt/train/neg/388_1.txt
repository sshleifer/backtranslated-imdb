I can not stand most reality shows and this is worse than the one with Paris Hilton, and it sure is your company. But "are you fired" or "are you hired" for how many seasons now? After watching the show I would not like to work for the guy with his ego and everything and I think watching dry paint has more valve entertainment. <br /> <br /> I'd love to hear just one person get up and say, "Donald, I stopped, got some of your money and bought a decent hairstyle." I see he's really trying to get fame in WWE Wrestling. I hope he gets hurt, so I do not have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and not have talent and make of yourself an attempt to buy it. I would give this show a negative note if I could, but it earns 1 and it does not deserve this.
