Waitress: Honey, here are the eggs you asked for. Honey, like a bee, you understand? This is called useless foreboding. <br /> <br /> Edward's basket: Huh? (On the road) Basket: Here's your doll back, little girl. You really should not be so careless with your belongings. <br /> <br /> Little girl: Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! Bang! Whoosh! Crackle? Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What?? ? (Tears open letter.) Wow! My ex-girl's handwriting has improved a lot. And look, her missing daughter seems kind of like the girl with the doll that I accidentally was half responsible for being killed in a way. And she kind of has my hair. I wonder, should I torture myself and go find her? Let's see what my friends in the police station think. <br /> <br /> Male Police Officer of Basket: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (On the island) Basket: What's in the bag? AHHH. <br /> <br /> Crone with a tree name: It's not her daughter. <br /> <br /> (In the taverna) Cart: Can you balance it? Big name and tree-name tavern girl: Huh? Basket: (crushes a bee). It's all right. <br /> <br /> Sensually beautiful, promising actress who plays a luxurious maid at the tavern: That's good. Honey is not a plant, however. <br /> <br /> (On the lawn) Willow: Oh, yes, and I forgot, you're the father, my son, Conan, er, I mean, Rowen. (Yawning.) I could have stayed and have had a life with you. But I did not. I wanted to be a princess of the hive. I mean, it does not matter. (He withdraws, shakes, opens his eyes to anime proportions.) Mwah, kiss kiss. I love you! What are we talking about? Cart: Who burned it? Who burned this? Who burned this? Who burned this? Who burned this? Willow: Edward Fungar. Blink. Because. It is. You. Screaming. In. I? Is it because I raised your Vicodin? Fungar. Snoring. What are we talking about? Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. Willow: My lips ache. <br /> <br /> (In the classroom) Rose: What is a man? Unappealling twins, in unison: Phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> Rose: Echo? Eco? Basket: Get away from the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm the good twin. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> (In hives) Basket: Hmmm. Hello? Ow, ow, ow, oh bother. Silly and old bear. Snoring. <br /> <br /> (In the Queen Bee's mansion) Sister Summersisle: You have a lot of potential. What are you doing here? Were not you the stallion that Cher slapped Moonstruck in the face? (Licks lips) Basket: I was about to ask you the same thing. Where's the girl? Sister Summersisle: How do you speak? Let's talk about the meaning of my superfluous "s." Cart: Beware of the truck that is coming our way! Aaaaah! Oh. Never mind. Damn it! (Puts another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back to the tavern) Big, shaggy taverna: I tried Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I still went up the size of a costume since last year. <br /> <br /> Crone with tree name: HAHAHA. Best to bake that nosy cop, my dear. <br /> <br /> Big-boobs maiden: Totally. <br /> <br /> Basket: That was the last straw that broke the back of the Basket Case! Take this, lass! (Slugs her.) (Edward Basket is mysteriously attacked from behind) Voluptuous wench taverna: EEEE! Get out of this! Leave the island and take me with you! Do I have to deal with you or what? Get out of it, I say! EEEE! Basket: Take this, lass! (Boldly kicks her in the face. Her eyes roll back and turn into cartoons.) Voluptuous Girl: Snoring? (At Nicolas Cage's Roast) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where the Basket cell phone rings in the middle of its bear suit scene and then the call is interrupted. It's like a wireless ad: help me! Can you hear me now? Haha ha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: And remember when I produced the bullets that I lifted from the Basket's gun? He looked so surprised. You should be more careful about your belongings, Nick. Hahaha And your movie choices. <br /> <br /> Everyone: The drone must die! Basket: (shouting) Oh, yes, you sluts? Well, baking me is not going to help your damn sweetheart! Aaah My legs! Honey, (dear, do you understand?) Lower the torch and move away from the Basket Case. Honey! Bear Smokey says do not play with matches. Hahaha What ??? Look out for that semi-truck Ahh! Oh. Damn, these flashbacks from my drug experimentation phase in the seventies are getting old! Where is my heroine? Ai Ai My watch is not fireproof. Ai I think something bad is about to happen. Can you hear me now? I'm ready for my close up Damn! (Six months later) Voluptuous little girl in modern-day slutty outfits: I told this namesake spouse to take me with him. <br /> <br /> Innocent young drone: I like to help people. <br /> <br /> Voluptuous vagabond: So get me out of my contract for the sequel! I think something bad is about to happen. EEEEE!
