... when he remade Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Bing Crosby's reworking as DAN BROOKS did not help a script that was "dated" at 34 and far less than 50. This sad movie has entire scenes taken from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles unless they were dead. Although being older did not seem to matter to the director. Nor did the cars and clothes on the 1934 backdrops also appear to be compatible with the 1950s standards. Not even the der Bingel chant can salvage that effort. <br /> <br /> We rated both the original and remake IMDb Four Stars. Frank's touch was gone, and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. That did not stop Mr. Capra away. After debating the 1950s by making some educational documentaries, he finished his career making the remake LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Once again a good cast was disappointed with the effort of the Six ****** Star IMDb in comparison also the original Eight ******** Stars. Sometimes it is better to give up while you were still ahead, right after the STATE OF UNION (1948).
