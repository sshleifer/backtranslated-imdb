The acting was horrible, just like the script. It was misplaced and made you almost want to laugh at the various horrifying scenes of murder. The ending was even worse. Everyone continued to die, but somehow the end made it seem like everything was perfectly alright! They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. The film needed more time to maybe develop a better plot. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I feel bad for the young actors. They needed better training. They could have really made it an OK movie, but the script and acting failed miserably.
