A young man gets into a lot of money and promptly starts to live it. Unfortunately, the man whose money really is too bad. He wants his service back. When he finds out who has the money, he begins to try to get it back. He continues to be frustrated by this child who is lucky not to fall into the hands of the evil man. It looks familiar, I bet. Very predictable, nothing interesting. Come up with something a little different, okay guys?
