After leaving the first, you think the wayans brothers could make new jokes. Although I do not think so. If the first one was not bad enough, this is so bad it hurts to watch. With all the actors they've had in this movie, you think they could create something a little smarter. Although they could not, they had to get all the same cheeky, not funny jokes from the first and somehow put it in the movie thinking people would laugh about it again. Although the thing is I did not laugh the first time. They tried to turn these films into parodies, but they failed at all levels. Most of the time, it's just random jokes, so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch and enjoy. So when they try to do scenes that are parodies of movies, they end up doing a 20 minute re-creation of the scene with maybe a joke throughout the scene. Also for people saying that it is not for the younger and real young audience, well I fit into the age group that is supposed to be funny for. While people say different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you find this funny, then you probably are not one of the most mature or intelligent people around. It does not take much skill to write this kind of script, but if you want a smarter and funny movie, watch the movie Spaceballs. It's a parody movie that is really good and well made and does not have to use nasty and cheeky jokes to make it funny as well.
