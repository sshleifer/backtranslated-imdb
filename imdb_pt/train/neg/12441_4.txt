Some things need to be clarified. The image of Mark Ferris is not Mark Ferris, who starred in this film. I know that because he was my father. Please remove this photo. Also, Mark Ferris was the writer, at least one of them. I've been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It's been years, and if anyone can point me in the direction of getting a copy, that would be great. The movie was not that bad, and trying to compare it to today's world of Star Wars and other high-tech sci fi is futile. If you watch it, just enjoy it for the rediscovery and humor it has. Brighten up movies and have fun with less creative and innovative movies.
