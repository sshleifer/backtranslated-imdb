This is superficial hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about the scheme of a jealous young woman to separate her father and her fiancee. Is it incest or just a vision through the eyes of a daughter with an Electra complex? Who cares? All the characters, except for Anne (Deborah Kerr), are empty and vile. Seberg is poor (I agree with the "boys with breasts" review from a previous review). The plot dragged on. This predictable material was enough for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half! If you want to see great dresses and jewelry on the Riviera, I recommend "To Catch a Thief" - in which you will receive the additional bonuses of a fun story and friendly characters. <br /> <br /> I like movies to entertain myself. I personally do not care where the movie is set. Whatever the time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some nice characters. It does not hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr performs typically well, as does David Niven in a despicable role. <br /> <br /> The "2" rating is only for Kerr and Niven, and for cinematography - the scenes of rich color and dark and ominous black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great cinematography in the world can not save a poor story with unpleasant characters. The ear of a nut is still a pig's ear. Consequently, watching this mess was a serious waste of time.
