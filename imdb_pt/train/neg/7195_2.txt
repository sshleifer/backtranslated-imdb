Disney did it again. The company that made "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" made another film that hardly remembers the cartoon on which it is based, and does not retain anything of the spirit of the original. Inspector Gadget "was one of my favorite drawings when I was young, and for a film to exist it might have been a dream come true at that time. Now that this movie exists, I was seriously disappointed, until even outraged. <br /> <br /> First, we have the characters. <br /> <br /> Gadget itself has the gadgets that made it such a fun original character (with special effects well done accompanying them ), and he still has some of the ingenuity of the original Gadget, but now he is more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain just watch. <br /> Penny has little to do; while she played an important role in the cartoon, uncovering the crime and stopping it, and occasionally being captured by the MAD agents, now it is simply introduced and then forgotten, although it at least sneaks into Claw's base. Claw is the movie version of Dr. Claw, which er to a rather sinister man with a hoarse voice who wore metal gloves and sat in his chair, his face hidden, while stroking his cat and supervising various crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw by a hand, with no mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> The Brain and the Crazy Cat exist in the film, but they are quite insignificant for him. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the drawing are not spared in this massacre. The famous expression "Wowsers!" was mysteriously changed to "Wowser", and Gadgetmobile Gadget now looks different and speaks. <br /> <br /> There are even endorsements of products everywhere. Why Yahoo!? advertised on a sign? Why does Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M or Skittles? <br /> <br /> Cartoon fans will hate you, others will probably find the movie under par, and when all is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some quick cash out of another old show .
