I saw this movie "hot" when it came out in 1986. It had an X rating for a brief scene involving oral sex, but it played in mainstream theaters (it was an "art" movie). It's supposed to be the first movie to show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story about a high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) in love (understandably) with an older woman. (Maruschka Detmers). As mentioned before Detmers is very handsome with a good body, but she also gave a very good performance. Pitzalis was (to say the least) very poor. No wonder he never made another movie. Still, despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicit, but brief), this is a monotonous and slow story that bored me. The good performance of Detmers only helped at some point. Mostly I was looking at my watch waiting patiently for it to end. If I did not have this sequence, this movie would have been forgotten long ago. Dizzy and slow. You can skip this one.
