Having read the novel before watching this movie, I was very disappointed with the acting of wood and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot. I feel that this film does not reflect the brilliance of Bronte's work, and gave the impression of a superficial love story. In the condensation of the film within a short 2 hours, the film has lost many of the key features that make the book understandable and progressive, resulting in a somewhat nervous plot with little foundation. There is no way to build the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so it seems a bit abrupt and unfounded, since the two characters have such an infrequent interaction that you can not help but imagine that your "love" is superficial. This is such a gross injustice to Bronte's novel: you have no idea of ​​the daring and daring of Jane that attracts Rochester to her, and her arrogance that draws Jane to him. <br /> <br /> Despite poor scriptwriting, I think some of the characters were portrayed very cunningly, namely Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, however, overall, production was poor. Given a better script, the film might have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for excellent production.
