Guy is a loser. You can not get girls, you need to get back together, you get picked up by stronger and more successful guys, etc. He saw, he saw, he moved on. I have to say that Rob needs to get through Adam Sandler's part of his life. And get out of Adam Sandler's plots. There are two funny parts throughout the movie. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I was getting bored. "The Animal" is a great movie. I usually like Adam Sandler movies that have the same plot. But this was trying very hard to impress. The jokes are very old. So, trust me. This is not a movie that most people can get into. But some did, so I'll be cool. <br /> <br /> 3/10
