I really have had hopes for this movie since I've seen Kari on some other things and I think she has some talent. Unfortunately, this failure is a case study on what not to do in a road map. Completely undefined characters without a drop of likeability, and no plot whatsoever. Is it a road / buddy / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea, and neither do we.
