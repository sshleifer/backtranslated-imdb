On the face of it, this must be a great movie, a great cast, a plot with many possibilities and one of the best Hollywood behind the camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try to direct a movie again. This movie fails on many levels. In a movie where there is not much action and most scenes are filmed in some locations, it is imperative that the suspense and continuity be provided by the director. Not so here, the great cast is horribly underused, no more than the great, late John Spencer, the plot is so run and nothing you have not seen in hundreds of other TV movies. There is so little character development that you end up not caring about any of the characters. At least we know that spacey has many partners and influence in Hollywood studios to run away with such a weak movie
