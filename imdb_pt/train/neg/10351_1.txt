This movie barely followed the story line of the movie. All the fascinating points of the book did not even exist in the film. They eventually turned it into a "passion" story of Disney movies between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad it must have been Hillary Duff doing the part, or one of the likes. This film was nothing more than an insult to the book's intelligence and mysticism. I can not believe that Disney could get away with doing such a basic and cheap version. If you've read the book, I think you'd agree it could easily be turned into a "Lord of the Rings" equivalence movie. This movie should never have used the title of A Wrinkle in Time. Badly done.
