The acting is good, the women are beautiful and the men are beautiful, so if you're looking for a well-represented soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you are wasting your time. The motivation of the main characters, especially the lead of the same name, is often a mystery. She could have just told the truth - the truth presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared from prison for a rape she did not commit. Was she protecting her father, who was half embarrassed when he impetuously instigated malicious action? Was she shielding herself, with her suddenly preoccupied reputation, when until then only her art seemed to matter? During the trial, this woman of willpower turns into porridge before our eyes. On the other hand, her lover, who starts out as a narcissistic idiot, becomes an altruistic hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself out of love. Of course, since no good deed is to go unpunished, we are told that she never sees him again.
