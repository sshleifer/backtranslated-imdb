Gday Mates! I just watched Croc Hunter in the movie. All right, but the show looks more real. This sounded like a long episode of AnimalPlanet with funniest lines and more characters. Some things: Steve described snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! For real you know it hurts. and they can not jump up high? all pick up by the tail and other things. There were two scenes of MAJOR cleavage in this movie. when Terry finds that baby joey, she says, "We have to take care of them, like a baby." Woah! I thought she was going to get up and nurse that kid. which would make a PG-13 though. While in Terry, someone noticed in the movie and much of Terry's knowledge about the mating ritual. she knows her sexual things. movie takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, a dingo and a joey! <br /> <br /> Steve's dog, Sui, really has a purpose in this movie. though a small one who proves worthless against the dynamite-wielding hottie. <br /> <br /> Oh and if anyone looks at this, try and agree with me on saying that the fat country cowboy lady with the herd of dogs was RIGHT in by shooting at the crocodile. he was eating his sheep !! I would be crazy too!
