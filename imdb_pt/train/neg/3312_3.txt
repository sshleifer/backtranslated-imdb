... but I regret having seen it. Since IMDb ratings are relatively high (and they must have been relatively high on Netflix too), I think I put it in my queue because it's billed as a gentle British comedy, a category that has produced many movies that I liked. immensely. "Saving Grace," on the other hand, falls into the category of laughter-less comedies generally populated by Hollywood films produced and directed by the untalented. Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress, and I liked her in other movies. The concept - a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the hardship she faces after her husband's death - does not offend me. Despite the strenuous efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor, the film falls flat on the floor (hang-up may have been funnier) as far as my wife and I were concerned. Be warned, oh gentle reader, not all British comedies succeed. This is a failure.
