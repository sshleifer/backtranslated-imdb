This is the worst piece of shit I've ever had to watch - it was actually so bad that I just had to watch it :-) <br /> <br /> CGI is so bad that it's fun! It's not even close to the fucking CGI animations in Spawn, that's how bad it is, har har har ... <br /> <br /> I'm impressed that some distribution company actually put money in to release this on DVD, but I think they will have more money with this, because the cost of doing this may not have been more than a few hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It's so horrible that a Kindergarten class could have gotten it. <br /> <br /> Watch and laugh!
