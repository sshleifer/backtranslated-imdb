If I could have rated this movie by 0 I would have! I see some people on IMDb says this is the funniest movie of the year, etc. etc. Excuse me? Are you ppl smelling LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie N O T H I N G! I really want my 27 minutes back from my life that I spent watching this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> I read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stop watching after 30 minutes, I understand that in fact I would have seen snakes on a plane for 2 times instead of watching this one movie turn! <br /> <br /> DO NOT watch this movie, do something more useful with your life, do the dishes, walk with the dog, hell ... anything is better than spending time in front of the TV watching to the hot rod.
