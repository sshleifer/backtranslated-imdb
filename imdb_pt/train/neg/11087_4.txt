The American leader Guy Madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this Spaghetti Western ?? which, having very modest credentials, appears as essentially routine (though with a good enough score). The plot offers some moderate interest: the title, incidentally, refers to an injured man involved in the murderous assault by gun runners on a farm? the property of the family of his pursuer, the agent of cavalry Madison. The younger siblings of the latter order that the injured party, now in charge of them, take them to the head of the responsible gang; in the final analysis, the identity of any mysterious man proves a surprise? and both, ironically, get involved with one of Madison's sisters (another is raped during the raid). Rosalba Neri, star of Euro-Worship, appears as a hostess of the hall, and formerly calls Madison.
