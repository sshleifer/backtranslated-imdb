I seem at first an interesting film, a Spanish thriller in an interesting nowadays Madrid, but it is nothing of that, it is actually an interesting film only for future film directors learning about what not to do making a movie, can`t be worse in other words, even the presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 spent to see this movie, the acting is horrible and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the movie daily shots to go home, leads nowhere and is boring, weak and poor, do not spend time or money on this movie.
