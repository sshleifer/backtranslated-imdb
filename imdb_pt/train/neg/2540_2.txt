I thought I'd seen this movie twice, actually. So I read all the other reviews, and they did not match very well. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study alleged sightings of bigfoots. I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw, despite the discrepancies in the comments. So, I'm putting my comment back: If you like the occasional movie 'B', like I do, then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you! Whether you're setting the sleep timer and waving to your favorite movie, or just hanging out with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, and you have a fun-filled improvisational night. Be careful! Is the legend true? I think we can figure it out, along with a not-so-stellar cast. Will there be any malfunction of the equipment at particularly important moments in the film? Does our young, virile hero have any hair on his chest? The exceptionally high tech Technicolor will last the entire movie? You will have to watch to find out for yourself.
