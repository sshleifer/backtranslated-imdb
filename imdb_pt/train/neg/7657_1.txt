There must be a rule that says clearly that films like Resident Evil should be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything that is possible. RE was a survival horror game, and a damn effective however, Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie. Alone in the dark is essentially the same kind of spirit as Resident Evil, so of course there is the slight hope that the director will get a piece of brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark only proves that there is no longer any hope that video games will become movies. <br /> <br /> The plot, despite the fact that it obviously is not important, is the biggest of many problems. with the film. The movie begins with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important because after one minute the audience stops caring and sits on the rest reaching the nearest object. Then there is something about an orphanage, some artifacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy, and some demons, all of which get so confused that viewers really can not keep up with what's happening. The characters enter and exit the plot as if they were sweet, some having large accumulations of meaningless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons were released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage who failed him. He finds an artifact involving the demons and takes him to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist (Reid), who obviously succeeds in having sex immediately without good reason. So, out of nowhere, hell explodes, and the two end up with a military team led by some dumb commander (Dorff), who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> It's all ridiculous, and the reason I really do not understand it is not only because it's complicated and confusing, but leaves no room for anyone to care. Instead, I recommend that if you need to see this movie, bring a tennis ball or something to take care of when the plot can get you confused. <br /> <br /> The action scenes in a movie with a plot. so terrible as that should at least bring a little bit up, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined crap of all time, with enough quick cuts to decapitate a chicken coop. Since this is based on a horror game, not on an action game, it is especially annoying. <br /> <br /> The first scene of action involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I've ever witnessed. and the rest is not so good. The demons seem a bit cool, though the fact that they turn into dust when dead takes away all effect. Scenes involving many weapons, which should be cool to see, involve the fire of the muzzle as the only source of light and the camera approaching faster than the head of a crack addict. It's all kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps the kids in bed at night. <br /> <br /> Acting is what I like to call actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing but sound important to the whole movie, although he seems to have more talent than he's letting on. The same happens with Dorff, who receives an ungrateful role, although he actually has some talent (something that happened a lot with him). Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be, as whenever she tries to act, it is a disaster (as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has at the beginning). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the kind of movie that worries me about future video game movies. If they continue to ruin the spirit like this, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing the Middle East with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squad of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this does not deserve a second chance, since I do not think anything could help me forget how terrible this movie is. It is bland, uninteresting and uninteresting. This is the film equivalent of diarrhea; it's all thrown together, nothing really fits and in the end, you're glad you're done. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: 4%
