Recap: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deeply loving and sure that they are perfect for each other, even though they have only been found for a few months. Todd, Ron's brother-in-law to be is not so happy. He fears that marriage is a threat to his comfortable work in the family business and decides to organize Ron's bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromising situation, get evidence and break Ron and Mel. <br /> <br /> Comments: Supposedly, it would be a continuation of a comedy classic, but it's not funny at all. It's mostly a puberal show and a juvenile excuse to show half-naked women. In fact, in a way, it is almost awesome to have many that you can put there because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, this is also one of the signs of a film that can not sustain itself. It just is not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, it has three redeeming points, or actually three actors that are worth a better script than that. It's the lead actor Josh Cooke, who can actually give an impression of some common sense. Sara Foster I know has more talent than to make movies like this, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have a lot more talent than this movie. <br /> <br /> What is suspiciously absent are good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are pretty meager as well. It just is not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
