John Leguizemo, a wonderful comic actor, is a New York Latino who can enter a myriad of characters, both men and women, to show off the bizarre weaknesses of an ethnic group trying to deal with an alien culture. He is not, however, Italian. He does not look, think or behave Italian ... Especially Sicilian or Calabrian, groups of immigrants living in Bensonhurst or Brooklyn Bayridge. All the scenes in which he interacts with his "Gumbas" sound fake, as if he had left a university production of "West Side Story" while the other guys were doing a low-income Mean Streets. This is just a problem with this ill-conceived and stingy movie. Spike blew it out a great time. Btw, CBGBOMFUG stands for "Country, Bluegrass, Blues and other music for uplifting gourmets [or possibly Gourmands] Ask Hilly Crystal who founded the club."
