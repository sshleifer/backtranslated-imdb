I got it on Showtime tonight and was amazed at how a movie with such an interesting premise can end up being so incredibly awful. WHO IS YOUR FATHER? brandon Davis as a adopted high schooler Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the heir of a porn empire left to him by his biological parents. Although the premise sounds as though the film could be a lot of fun, it has been ruined by the inept direction of first-time director Andy Fickman, a cliche and predictable script, and acting that is even bad by direct video standards. Even the normally funny Charlie Talbert turns into a surprisingly sad performance as the best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this limp and bland failure. 1/10
