Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this movie is still probably one of the worst movies ever made. It has Bruce Lee die as a result of falling from a helicopter after being hit by a kind of ninja knife in the back of the neck, but this does not explain how he came to be in a helicopter since the previous scene left him close but not in the helicopter that is already 200 feet in the air. This becomes absolutely absurd from then on, as something out of a cheap comic book. Perhaps the idea is not so bad, but it is not made with any degree of art from the point of view of cinema. There are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there, usually all done in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam has improved the genre by adding plausible stories in his films and having filmmakers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are much better than 90% of the martial arts trash films made during the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. 'Game of Death II' falls into the category of junk movies in my opinion, although Bruce Lee is in it.
