Unfortunately, this movie does not believe the original. Nicholas Cage, rather wood, as far as the actors go, pervades the screen with a range of skills ranging from the non-plussed to the top. The support cast is not better. <br /> <br /> The plot remains very much like the original in terms of scene progression, but it is much worse. Not enough details are given to allow the public to reach what is being sold. It turns out it's just an account of poor assets. Unbelief can not be suspended, nor can there be any doubt. The only saving aspect of this movie is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whoever has looked at the place should be commended. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter in the audience and several boos, literally, the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to hit the television, pour a whiskey, and enjoy.
