I was really looking forward to seeing Planet of the Apes, but it was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The settings and masks are great, but that's the only good aspect of the movie. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting, he's just in the movie, looking stupid. The other actors are not very good either. <br /> <br /> But the worst of all is the story. It's absolutely ridiculous! For example, monkeys are unconscious on the ground, but humans do not attack them, no, they wait until they are back! This is just an example for the stupid story, but it would take a lot of time to tell everyone.
