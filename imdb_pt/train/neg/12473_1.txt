This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, everything about it is weak and incoherent. The acting is absurd, the costumes are even more crunchy and the story is non-existent. The sword and adventure movie of the "poverty line" was made to capture some of the successes that "Beastmaster" and "Conan" liked, but that does not give us any reason to move on. The main character is tepid and bland, he can not even fight a sword and the sword is from the 16th century. All the action sequences are thus slow and unreal, not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music, whenever are riding a horse. Do not bother with this crap.
