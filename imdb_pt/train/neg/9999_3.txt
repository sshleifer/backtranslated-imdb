This is the kind of movie my enemies watch me all the time, but it's not true. I just watch from time to time to make sure it's as bad as I thought it was. <br /> <br /> Some kind of mafiosi kidnap a Boeing 747. (This, at least, is an improvement over having Boeing kidnaps a good part of the Pentagon.) The plane descends into the Bermuda triangle and sinks under pressure on the bottom, a sort of post-facto submarine. <br /> <br /> There's one of those star castings. , the stars either falling or barely above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We're on our own!" says pilot Jack Lemon. He's so right. Except for George Kennedy. He's in all these disaster movies. <br /> <br /> Watch another movie. Oh, not "Airport" the original. This is not good either. Instead, watch a decent movie about jammed planes like "Flight of the Phoenix."
