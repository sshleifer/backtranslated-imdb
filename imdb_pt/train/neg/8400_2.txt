Not even the most fervent fanatic could like the movie, (I am one of them) stooges just do not get any material to work with. It's really a shame too, because this is the only long-lasting movie the Stooges have done with Curly, and that effort for them is painfully dull, when it could have great potential. Terrible musical numbers do not help either. The short they did with the same title has more laughter.
