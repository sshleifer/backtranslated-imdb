While most of the film is very amateurish, the Kosher slaughter scene is played, but it is not fake. Kosher law says that an animal must be aware when the blade touches your skin. The scene of the kosher massacre is accurate because anyone knows who saw one, or saw the movie Peta showing a kosher massacre, in which the throats of animals are cut and the esophagus cut while still alive, conscious and obviously suffering. We must remember that the story is written by the victors. Can anyone even think that maybe the Nazis were right? <br /> <br /> Does it say nothing that the Nazis have banished this cruel religious slaughter, and the Jews still practice it to this day?
