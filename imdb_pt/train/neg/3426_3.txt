Being a fan of manga and anime by Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc), I was looking forward to this. I did not see the manga nor the anime, so I had no preconceived notions. Good thing too. What we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the sort that used to appear with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night. Although it is tame compared to what is struck by the throats of regular viewers (the impertinent bits of our hero are beautifully hidden behind a strategically glued scarf or stamped with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are prolonged scenes of slavery and torture lend the procedure just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for children. Although I have nothing against naked female heroes, I do not like amateur movies (there are at least four in this series). On the plus side, there's at least one gorgeous actress in each of the four episodes I've seen. No wonder the Nagai TESTICLE BOY has never done ...
