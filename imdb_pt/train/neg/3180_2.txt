What an annoying movie! To summarize, it was basically just Nana Patekar beating Karinda Kapoor, her daughter-in-law, while trying to escape the village with her son. Can anyone say boring ??? The concept was not so bad, but it was poorly executed. The Canadian locations and some scenes of the village were well filmed. However, overall, cinematography fell short. The story might have been great, but the movie seemed to drag on. There is so much stupidity that one can endure, let alone three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was the song "Ishq Kamina" which lasted only five minutes. Other than that, this movie sucked.
