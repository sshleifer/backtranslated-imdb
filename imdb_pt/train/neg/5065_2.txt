This movie is just plain bad. Weak history, weak direction and below-average performance. The thing that really pissed me off was the blatant publicity - constantly - of a well-known internet provider. It's obvious that some scenes are written to do just that, publicity. This movie is a slap in the face of who paid money for it. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, it's not worth your time.
