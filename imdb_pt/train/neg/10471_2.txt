Quite honestly, the Omega Code is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. For the first 30 minutes, I sat dazed in the seat, trying to decide if I should demand a refund. But since I did not pay to see it in the first place, I figured I might as well stay. And I did not think it could get any worse. <br /> <br /> He did. I'll quickly go over the basics (including some spoilers): The awful miscastification of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two PhDs. The characterization was inconsistent; for example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete idiot. Then there is the false description of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies; we see a lot of sensational news programs accompanied by ridiculous computer impressions of the translated Bible Code. In addition, terrible sequences of "action": Lane escapes difficult situations without explanation, and the only time Lane really seems to be in danger, ends up being a dream sequence! That's cute for elementary school writing assignments, but it's an inexcusable plotting device in a movie. The pace was bad: after a long opener, the first third of the movie changes scene every 90 seconds. Later, the pace improves, but there are still unnecessary jumps. And as someone mentioned, years pass and no one (not even Lane's young daughter) ages. That was disconcerting. <br /> <br /> There are some good things, though. The quality of the film (for example, lack of graininess) is high and very attractive. The outdoor shots were well done and the local footage added a touch of realism. Also, there are a few moments in the last part of the movie, when Lane asks God (finally) to help him - this proved to be quite exciting - even for me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked that because it seemed like the only genuine scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it was followed by a great incomprehensibility. <br /> <br /> The characters, the dialogue, the direction and the acting were all badly made. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just weird. I think the producers wanted to do too much; If the plot had been firmer and more focused, and the characterization more detailed, the film would have been much better. <br /> <br /> In short, the Omega code disappoints. Definitely do not pay to see this. I give him ** ten stars. <br /> <br />
