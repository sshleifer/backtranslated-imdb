I usually like zombie movies, but this one was just bad. <br /> <br /> The good parts: Topless swimming girl with thong, Sonya Salomaa topless, and Ona Grauer's breasts swaying in a top when she ran. <br /> <br /> The bad part: many video cuts, lots of slow-moving Matrix (drags action), insufficient blood and guts, bad acting and no story. The only other person in the theater was smart and left shortly after the topless swimming scene. A total waste of $ 6 and time. I give 2 out of 10.
