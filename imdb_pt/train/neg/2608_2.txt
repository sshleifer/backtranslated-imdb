My 10-year-old daughter, Alexandra, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very annoying, and I thought it was just a repeat of "101 Dalmatians" stuff. I could not wait for the end of the movie. The best part was the credits in the beginning - they were cute and well made. The rest of the movie is not worth watching. Thank you.
