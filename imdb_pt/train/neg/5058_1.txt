(When will I learn?) The ecstatic reviewer at the NPR made me think that this turkey was another citizen Kane. Please allow me to vent my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I admit: the setting, presumably New York, has never been so ugly and unpleasant. I remember that the '70s were a bad decade for men's fashion and for automobiles. And all the smoke! If the plan were to cheapen the characters, it would be successful. <br /> <br /> For a movie to work (at least in my simple estimation), there must be at least ONE sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty came close and I could not expect him to end Nicky. If a lost shot had hit Mikey, well, that may have caused a shrinkage of indifference at most. <br /> <br /> I do not remember when I hated a movie so strongly. I suppose I'm a country man who does not like "art" movies. Oh well.
