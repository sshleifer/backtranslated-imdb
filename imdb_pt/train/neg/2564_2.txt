When I go to see movies I would stay up and watch or if I did not like it, I would go to sleep, but that was sheer crap, I actually got up and left! ... This was poorly written and put together, I hated it. Besides, they should not have taken Brendan Frasier, he was much better. This was not as good as I'd expected, considering I really liked George of The Jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first one, for example, the bird, and when it collided with a tree. I hope the director of this takes care, and the next films he does, he needs to reconsider ... horrible! I really would like to give Ursla a job well done, since she made the film worth it (until I leave) ... overall I give this film a 2 out of 10
