I figured the whole joke of the movie would see a rich white guy acting like Chris Rock, and then seeing Chris Rock react to people's reactions. Instead, you see only Chris Rock being himself and people not understanding him. There are maybe two scenes throughout the movie where they use their trick. That should have been a lot better.
