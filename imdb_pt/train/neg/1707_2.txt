and a budget of $ 30,000 and this movie still seems to have been made for $ 50. You can tell from the first frame to the last that he did not care at all about the continuity or plot of the movie, he was just happy to be making a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> What the end result shows is a lazy filmmaker who loves zombie movies. It could have been great if he'd only been careful. The end result is infinite zoom ins poorly made gore, and even more poorly produced metal plays on it. <br /> <br /> What happens when you combine high hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work, and an idiot behind the camera.
