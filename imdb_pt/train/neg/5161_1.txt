My life is about saving animals. I do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I have not been able to kill an animal or to support my life. I can not even kill a spider, I put it outdoors. The scene in which children throw stones at the bird until he dies, with Sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and haunted me ever since. It simply convinces me that humans are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The end - adoptive parents adopt Sooner - does not rescue the depiction of animal cruelty. Why would anyone want their child to watch this movie?
