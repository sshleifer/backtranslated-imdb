Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and $ 2 for rent in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the greatest regret of my life. Anyone who has ever thought about this film, or funded it deserves a kick between their legs, because that's where they were thinking when they made this film. It's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious nonsense that tries to pass as poetry. He joins his loving friend on a trip to the coast. Where they find girls and such. Only the fat one does not have a girl. The skin movements do not bother me, I accept them by face value. But this movie tries to be more than a skin movie. It's about the fat guy looking for love in some girl, but then meets another girl in a silicone bikini who likes his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball, who gets money for his family and impresses the ladies, only he has his lady anyway. The dialogue is super awful even for a C movie. It supports a ton of black stereotypes, no character development, it's a glorified porn movie without any pornography in it. Never watch this movie.
