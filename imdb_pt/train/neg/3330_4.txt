This movie features an okay. punctuation and not a bad performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The initial and final credits are displayed along with most of the actors and the "special effects" that this is a low budget movie. There is nothing in this movie that you can not find in other horror movies, comedy or low budget movies. It is not special for any bare scene buff or bad movie lovers as well. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to cheer on either. If you are curious how I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the summary of a line.
