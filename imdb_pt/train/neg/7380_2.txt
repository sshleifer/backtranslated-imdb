I think it's time for Seagal to go quietly through the night. What I've just seen makes all of your direct video releases in recent years look like your first hits from the '90s in comparison. <br /> <br /> A secret biochemistry lab is creating a new type of drug that stimulates a human's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. Somehow, Seagal should stop the infection or it's the end of the world ... or something. Seagal also went through attack squads like gum balls, every time I look up he was commanding a new face, so it's difficult to keep up with the character's development, just as Steven's stunning keeps him from screaming at the top of his lungs, but even though He constantly being nicknamed by people who sound nothing like it? Usually the plot of the movies and the action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time, but that was not even close. Like I said, it was more a horror movie with a lot of blood and cinnamon, instead of fighting straight. The problem was that it was not really scary and Seagal seemed completely out of place because infected people should have light-speed movement, but Seagal, 40, killed them all by himself. I think the only highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes that the new recruits asked Seagal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
