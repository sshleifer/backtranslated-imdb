The easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire. The aim of satire is quite vast, from the US government to corporate America. Nor is it a spicy satire, but a fool. <br /> <br /> Think of this movie as a mix between the Kentucky Fried movie, the Airplane and the Police series, made on a much smaller budget and not as funny. I can see how this movie is a satire of many science fiction disaster films of the 50s and 60s. I see this movie as a great influence on Tim Burton's Mars Martacks. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. The genetically engineered giant tomatoes get "crazy" and start attacking people and cities. In the beginning there is a cover-up and then it turns into a complete war. <br /> <br /> The film features a range of characters and characterizations: Lois "Fairchild" (a clone of Lois Lane), a very ambitious president. The press secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (an FIA agent who does not work from the Bay of Pigs), a useless president (who seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York), an inept Congressman, a crooked CEO of marketing and Mason team consisting of an obese swimmer from East Germany, a diver, a deranged parachutist from World War II and an African-American disguise specialist (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally as a tomato). Did I also forget to mention many tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes, from small tomatoes to giant plastic tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, tomato juice, and finally people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, you have a couple of tomatoes. musical numbers as well. They are not so good and seem to be nicknamed. The best song is by far the theme of the film ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It's very catchy and you can end up humming or singing in public. Be warned. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is quite entertaining and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various genres of entertainment. I can not believe I was induced to laugh, but mostly I smiled and scratched my head. I would definitely recommend this movie to fans of B and C level movies, but only as a rental. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
