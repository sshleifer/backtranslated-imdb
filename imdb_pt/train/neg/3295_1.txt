... so you better not watch this movie. They completely ruined the premise of the show. In the movie, the Duke boys are idiots, Daisy is unstable, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are loyal to the original characters. At least Enos is halfway there. <br /> <br /> At one point they open the doors to enter General Lee-nuff. <br /> <br /> The original show may not have been great TV, but it was fun and the characters made sense. This movie is how Dumb & Dumber meets the simple life.
