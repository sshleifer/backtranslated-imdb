Even though it is a production made for TV, there is absolutely no excuse for the results of the finished product. This movie had a budget and had a casting department, so if you are to make a movie about a real life story, and really put "the true story" in the title, should not some effort be made to try to capture some realism? First of all, this movie is absurdly released. These actors belong to daytime television soap operas, or those ridiculous Lifetime Channel films, and not to a real-life tale of gangs / criminals. All about them, from their looks to their mannerisms, just screams from the 90's generation - shopping-mall-alt-rock-listening. And the script? Two words describe this - stupid and insulting, and again it's a 90-year-old sound. I do not think the real Clyde Barrow has uttered the words "I'm out of here." It's as if a bunch of "New Kids on the Block" fans come together and decide to make a "kewl movie" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one that would be totally radical and rock. Well, this sticker is not even graded on the rad and rockin 'scale. Whatever may be wrong with any kind of movie is wrong here, from the cast and the interpretation to the editing and the music. Every thing is grossly wrong ... and it is infuriating that those responsible for this heinous turkey have the courage to put "the true story" in the title. It certainly is NOT the true story, but, even worse, it's not at all as fun as an irrational popcorn movie that is accepted on its own terms. As I said in my header, it is simply awful beyond words, at every imaginable level. Trust me or watch at your own risk.
