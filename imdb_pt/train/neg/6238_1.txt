Oh man, it's amazing how one can claim that global warming is a science, well, I think this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to make this issue seem complicated, although it only takes sense to see that all this is a big hoax of a man with his own money-making agenda! <br /> <br /> How did scientists estimate historical temperatures on this planet? Estimating the activity of the sunspot. Has anyone ever questioned whether this method was accurate? No, not even Gore himself! So how the hell would not it be necessary to predict future temperature with sunshine activity if it was so accurate in the past? According to the activity of the sunspot, the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be. How did the temperature in the entire universe rise (relatively) as much as on Earth? Do our utilities raise the temperature on Jupiter? <br /> <br /> Use some good sense! You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this could be nothing more than a HOAX. Please search for yourself. What did Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (the banking family that organized the event of the Living Earth) gain from it? Well, the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits, which is imposed on everything that gives CO2 omissions, and it is easier to get rid of these taxes if people are drawn to thinking that it is to save the world when it is just about money, centralized control and more power for elitist bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Is not it noble to voluntarily pay carbon credits to save the world, especially if it's for your own company? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to blindly believe me, please do your own research and use your good judgment and I'm sure you'll come to the right conclusion!
