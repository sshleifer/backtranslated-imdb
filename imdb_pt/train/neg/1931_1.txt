I went to see this with much expectation. Very unfortunately, the dialogue is totally stupid and, in general, the film is far from inspiring admiration or interest. Even a child can see the logic missing from the character's behavior. Today's children need creative stories to inspire them, which would make them "daydream" about events. This is precisely what happened to films like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many kids wondered about becoming Jedi Knights and lighting their own lightsabers?) Seriously, do not waste your time and money on it.
