Clarke as Candy, a desert resident who takes a bank robbery with her boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr) ). He ends up in a southern border jail, run by the sadistic Chief Screw (an exaggerated Robert Englund in a wig). She and her beloved poodles end up hiding in a gas station convent until they are transformed by a new fallen meteor. The dogs become nasty drag queen whores and Candy develops a very long, talkative and murderous tongue that she can not control. Hugues seeking stolen service and numerous other shortcuts add extra complications. <br /> <br /> First of all, Clarke is fantastic and does what there is to do with this movie. You watch her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and VERY sexy in various wigs and disguises, including a creepy skin latex outfit ... and wondering how this actress did not is a huge star. It's a shame the rest of this sect attempt does not keep its promise. Sciamma, the guilty director Sciamma, who thinks the exaggerated premise is enough to sustain the laughter ... but her vulgar jokes, annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogues are no substitute for a true sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film seems cheap, many colors and extravagant scenarios are strangely silenced by muddy photography and dusty desert locations. Fortunately for Sciamma that Clarke is in her movie, because she alone keeps you watching.
