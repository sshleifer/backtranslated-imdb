I usually have a lot better things to do with my time than write reviews, but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour registering with IMDb just to get it out of my chest. <br /> <br /> You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a trivial bet ... well, this movie was just terrible. It is almost impossible to "suspend disbelief"; I tried, really, I wanted to take advantage, but Justin Timberlake just would not let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake must stick to music, what a terrible performance - NO presence as an actor, no character. I can not blame everything on Justin: The movie also has a terrible plot and badly timed editing; is definitely an "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I have to wonder what really motivates the actors. I mean, certainly Morgan actually read the script before taking the part. Did not he see how poor he was? What then could motivate him to take the role? Money? Of course acting is sometimes more about who you are seen than actually developing quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; He earns much more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really strives to come to terms with the poor script. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience says, "What the hell is going on here? You expect me to believe this crap?" <br /> <br /> In summary, in addition to Justin, a great lineup performed - very disappointing.
