Years have passed since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first film) stumbled in the terrible plot that involved replacing humans with machines, but since then a war between cyborgs and humans has arisen and we have lost, now a kind of superwoman who is the daughter of the character of Olivier Gruner (She also inherits only half of her minimal acting ability) which I think is the minimum connection of the film with the first, but when the superwoman is created she hides in 1980 while a hunter of rewards of the future pursues her. this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis became a cult hit, which I can see why people liked it, even though I was not a fan of that movie. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a handsome look and provide tons of action, almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have that ambition, it's a cheap feature of The Terminator with a muscular woman who is so weak in her acting skills that makes Olivier Gruner look like a master and the action sequences do not have the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original. I admit I was not a fan of the original, but I deserved better follow-up than that. The original also featured a good cast as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley, this one does not feature anyone and this time it's just a boring movie with a pretentious vibe. In fact, after I saw this, he inspired the addition of a half star to the original. <br /> * out of 4 (Bad)
