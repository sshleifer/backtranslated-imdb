I saw this movie opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite Heath Ledger's excellent performance in the lead role, the plot was very thin ... which did not inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There were a few other positive points, Edgerton's support in particular, Jordan's assured direction (confirming his show talent at Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real hint of harshness to the Australian bush as much as the Irish Immigrants of the early nineteenth century must have seen it. But I can not help but feel that another opportunity has been missed to tell the true story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?) ... in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and the sale of photography in the United States. Oh, well, at least Jordan and the producers did not agree to lose their beards just to please Universal ... I think I'll have to settle for Kelly's excellent "Secret Story" Peter Carey Gang. "
