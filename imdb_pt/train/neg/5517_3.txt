I'm just evaluating this movie as a featherweight 3 because it tries to be worth it. I love to praise a great movie and I'm not inclined to "male" movies. Legally blonde was an excellent movie. Georgia Rule, on the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written, and unrealistic example of making movies at worst. at the end of the movie I did not care who was lying or if something was solved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a movie is a good story. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject is deep does not mean that the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one who experiences a major character change and is prepared for that change throughout the film. At Georgia Rule, character changes were abrupt and underdeveloped. Second, there were many dynamic characters ATTEMPTED. Taking a really good dynamic character is hard work and takes time (you only have a few hours in a movie). This means that many dynamic character attempts will receive little attention to your personal change. Even if I ignore the poorly written history and the rubbish of weak dynamic characters, I can not even say I liked someone. Each character was a mess. It's okay if you're writing American Beauty, but not when you're trying a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no, I'm not cutting any slack because she was molested, crap happens to everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions). The Mormon boy "Dudley Do Right" should have had the courage not to compromise his religion and commitments ... and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of guy lets a 17-year-old girl who has been molested occasionally (unless he is an actor or politician). This movie is worth watching if you want to remember what is good to do a movie NO!
