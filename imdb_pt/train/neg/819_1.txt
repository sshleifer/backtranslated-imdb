"The Domino Principle" is undoubtedly one of the worst thrillers ever made. Hardly any sense can be made of the complicated plot and in the middle of the way you will want to raise your arms in frustration and shout "I give up !!!" <br /> <br /> As Gene Hackman and director Stanley Kramer have never been involved in this mess should only be summed up by their paychecks. <br /> <br /> I hope they spent their money well.
