This classic tale of movie passion in 1997 has reached the well-deserved legendary status as one of the greatest sagas of a condemned and hopeless love. The penetrating, progressive and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and her name is sure to leave the hearts of many onlookers with memories of their own passion. The brilliant script shakes this embryonic future in front of the ecstatic audience, sitting paralyzed while the abstract and almost expressionist cinematography focuses deeply on the desires just beneath the surface that come and go between the directors. You can cut off sexual tension with a dull tire iron. <br /> <br /> A small drop of perspiration at the end of a nose captures the bright sun, and leaves no doubt as to its meaning. Scenes like this are plentiful and watch again and again. As with "Jane Eyre" and "Rebecca" (for whom this masterpiece is so often compared), the close-ups of the faces of the actors, as they experience the slow dawn of great love that is not to be, will To haunt you forever. <br /> <br /> RC's now classic soundtrack, with its unique and creative use of solo synthesizer, emphasizes the emotion that flows everywhere like a punched-out crankcase. <br /> <br /> If I had some criticism By mentioning what I consider a small flaw (and daring to risk the ire of millions of fans who own this classic so dear in their hearts), I would say that the trademark of "Runaway Car" - your sense of sexual tension mounting - is briefly broken by the road scene, which now after repeated views seems a bit overlong (and probably even unnecessary?) To the eternal, bitter tale of Love Interrupted. <br /> <br /> Dare to advance what I perceive as the tiniest of flaws in this triumph of critically acclaimed modern cinema? 'Citizen Kane' had his 'Rosebud'. . . 'Runaway Car' should also have its word of order. Perhaps the film could have been opened with an extreme close-up of Judge Reinhold saying something like "A car is an extension of its owner!", And the rest of the plot could be devoted to analyzing every syllable, subtlety and nuance of the sentence. . If this plot had been made, that movie could have led "Titanic" at the Golden Globe that year, I'm convinced. <br /> <br /> My only regret? That I did not read the novel first.
