When I first started watching this movie, I saw Buffy's guy, Xander, and I realized how good it is that he still earns his living acting in movies. Now a strange movie that I can bear, since it is a good deal of strange things, such as David Lynch films, twin peaks, lost roads, etc. And you kind of have to be in the mood for one. This, however, reminded me mockingly of the crazy sites about conspiracy theory that make absolutely no sense. I mean, come the Nazi people who conspire with the United States to make a profane trinity of evil powers? I was surprised they did not mention the hollow earth in this movie with Hitler flying saucers and lizard people. Maybe if you had 60 grams of heroin with this movie, it would make some sense, but seriously I do not tolerate drugs like I do not tolerate this movie. It must be burned, ripped and forgotten, so good that Xander can get another acting job. It was not his acting, but that was fine, but the script did not make the slightest sense. Excuse.
