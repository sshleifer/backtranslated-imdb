What the Bleep we know is a deluded and casual look at the mysteries of the universe. We are introduced to a parade of apparent specialists (none of whom are called) who ramble and pontificate in a completely unscientific manner. Their interviews are divided into aggravatingly small segments and scattered by some flashy cgi and banal mini-plots. The film pilots themes of science, philosophy, theology and politics, undermining them together without any regard for precision. and then somehow draw some prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult to answer the question that the filmmakers would like to point out. <br /> <br /> These are chronic and logical errors. not sequences. How do we get started in quantum mechanics and get rid of this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying "two plus two equals four, so I can move objects with my mind." <br /> <br /> There is nothing original about this film and almost nothing that is accurate. Any discriminating viewer will be bothered by the heavy editing, intrusive and useless special effects and general lack of substance. Educated viewers will be frustrated by the violence done to science and all the other issues covered by this film.
