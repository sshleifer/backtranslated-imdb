I was looking forward to seeing "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. What I did, however, was a nap of an hour and a half. The premise seemed nice: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, owner of a business called "Mr. Fix It," where the abandoned men ask for their help to get their girlfriends to take them back. <br /> <br /> Among the problems with this film are editing, screenplay and acting. Although I found Boreanaz charming in his other roles in the movies (with the exception of the movie "Crow" he did), this was disappointing. At times, his character was interesting and others, plain. The supporting cast reminded me of players from the day of the novel. I realized it was not a big budget movie, but some of the cuts of scenes and songs just did not seem right. <br /> <br /> My advice: watch at your own risk.
