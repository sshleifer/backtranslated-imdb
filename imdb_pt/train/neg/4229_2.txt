I'm a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S @ # t I've ever seen! I ignored the comments posted on this site imagining that it would fall into my horror tastes, but I got bored and hung up. Let's see: The wardrobe: It consisted of cheap cushion clothes and clothes from home depot painters. The masks were made from what appears to be tin foil. <br /> <br /> Gore: Gore was very good, I must give it. But Ittenbach's Burning Moon was better for a low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Performance: It was horrible! I did not mind the dubbing. I find this funny as in "Ittenbach's" Premiers (great movie). The sequences of struggle and action were poor. <br /> <br /> In short: Do not watch any of Schnaas's films. There are much better directors, like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach, with films of the same blood and subject. Check out the Premiers, House of blood, Schramm and the nekromantiks.
