It's time to see a movie that remains unbiased about these ancient Indian traditions. At times, it becomes clear how most "doctors" are quacks, even lying about how they do not charge their customers. While they are wearing their gold watches, the "donation" box is mandatory. Note that there are only a few people who get 'healed' while we see some cases. <br /> <br /> Remember to note that ingesting mercury is non-toxic and that the smallest Indian note is 5%. Rupee while the average salary in India is 1,700 ru / month.
