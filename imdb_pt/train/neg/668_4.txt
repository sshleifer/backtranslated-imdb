So Prom Night should be a horror and suspense movie. I'm a big coward and I was scared to see this movie at first, but upon seeing it, it's neither horror nor suspense. <br /> <br /> I was basically making fun of the movie in my place because it was so predictable. You could predict what would happen next. The young actors were good at interpreting their characters, but I would have to say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting smart. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will support the plot because it was good, but it is neither exciting nor scary. There were almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scenes. So, do not spend ten dollars watching it in theaters, wait until it comes to DVD.
