Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates going in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - who are the successful middle class white belly types that appear in many of his films. <br /> <br /> Generally find something to have fun in Woody Allen comedies, but here he really falls flat on the floor. Even those in a line seem to have abandoned him. The truth is that there is no plot (pieces of bar and bits of Shakespeare cod) - but Allen seems to use the place to allow a semi-mystical air, which only makes the thing even more bland and half cooked. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on any level and it's just a giant hole. The best thing about this movie (aside from the final credits that are coming up) is that the bad reviews seem to get you to wake up and realize that just playing along a careless script together and tossing your mates into it is not for entertainment.
