Did Ron Howard direct that? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville full of greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine the script would ask the most unpleasant person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is the magic of the movies. Much like Danny Devito's penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so completely unpleasant that any degree of comedy that can be extracted from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon showed a Grinch that we could all identify with, Carrey's Grinch is the grumpy, soulless old man we've all seen from time to time sitting in a parked car grumbling to himself or stumbling on children in the supermarket. his cane. This Grinch is completely devoid of any degree of humanity, humor or insight, and his redemption at the end of the movie sounds fake. The whole movie sounds fake: There's a stupid Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt to explain why the Grinch is so dumb as he investigates his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery about why some of the Whos have that strange lip extension, and some of them do not. Unlike the 1966 cartoon, I would have imagined that the children found this movie tiresome, annoying and full of contradictory messages. Do we really need to see Slutty Smurf, also known as Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his unrelated relatives. Add the necessary jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes and other compelling Carreyesque humor and you'll get a movie that is as distant from the 1966 cartoon (or book that inspired it) as George W. Bush's. rational and lucid thinking. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.
