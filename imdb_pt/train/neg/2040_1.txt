This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not exaggerating, I told Blockbuster's guy that they should get him off the shelves. The only interesting thing about this movie is the box. In the box it says "the boggart director" so I figured ... whatever it is, if it was done recently, I'm sure the direction, at least, will not be VERY bad: - \, but after I I saw the movie and looked at what "bogeyman" they were talking about, it's some nonsense from the early 1980s that it did. Great way to fool unsuspecting viewers. <br /> <br /> In any case, I think they just liked the name "Zodiac Killer", and did not bother to search for any of the crimes of the Zodiac or its MO, or even the years in which it was active . All the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the "stories" about the original Zodiac happen several years after the crimes of the Zodiac. They also compare the Zodiac to the "Vampire of DÃ¼sseldorf" Fritz Haarman throughout the film and talk to Fritz's "son" quite often. The Zodiac and Haarman were nothing like it, and it makes more sense to compare him to BTK, who also shot people, not a man who killed people chewing their necks. None of Haarman's facts is correct, just a bunch of confusing nonsense. His son even says, "Do not forget, your name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t's" ... Your real name only has one! I think the writer / director simply typed a google search for serial killers and the fastest ones that came out were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. "Ooh these sound like cool names, let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research! Great idea!" <br /> <br /> Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this film is the way the experts and the young people The killer describes the suffering of the DSM-IV and healed of it. "I was also diagnosed with DSM-IV and have since recovered," etc. For those of you who do not know, the DSM-IV is the psychological handbook for mental disorders. If someone suffers with the book itself, then they must have some serious problems! Haha. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my point is that this goes to the bottom of my top 5 films of all time, and it's rare for a movie to come to that. But if you are interested in watching a totally non-fact-based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring, full of inexperienced actors, and not completely rational, I'd say check out this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I liked how the killer "lacrified" some of his victims with dry ice. Good touch ...
