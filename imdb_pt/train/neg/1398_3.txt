I bought it (it was only $ 3, okay?) Under the title "Gray Matter". The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non-DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me. As the other reviewers warned, it is a very annoying tale of a secret government experiment that went awry. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are many plans to settle down, especially from a house with a pool in front of it. Some of the characters and interiors are so indefinite that I think the filmmakers were afraid we could forget who's who, so they keep telling us first by showing the outside of the buildings. It's actually kind of funny. After some time, the photo of the pool looks like a station identification logo of a TV channel, remembering that we are watching "Gray Matter". <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed two episodes of swearing. At one point, an irritated test subject insults someone in charge, calling it "scientific bitch." It's just a very inadequate insult. Several scenes later, a different subject ventures to grumble about that "scientific end"! It sounded very strange to me. <br /> <br /> Someday this movie will disappear forever. In a decade, it will be impossible to find copies of it. Almost like never happened. <br /> <br />
