The first scene in 'Problem Child' has a baby peeing on a nun's face. For this movie, this is witty. A malicious and malicious comedy, it's inept on many levels and it's unbelievable. John Ritter is the gentle father who adopts the child of Hell, and praises him for maintaining his dignity in attacking around a note, annoying performances and childish humor. And what the hell is Jack Warden doing in this mess? Vaguely directed by Dennis Dugan and obnoxious in his attempts to activate sentimentality when done with crudity, the film is done so poorly that it is a rather bizarre experience. But it does not matter all that. The downside of the whole thing is Michael Oliver, the most disgusting and nasty kid actor ever to hit the screen? believe me, you will want to hit his mouth.
