Redline is an imitation of Fast and Furious, with none of the redeeming qualities. No need to have a complicated plot with multiple twists and surprises, but you need SOMETHING! This is the equivalent of a porn movie, where plot and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the end at the end. Only this is worse because you do not get the value of your money. Narcotics, impossible racing sequences and a terrible waste of beautiful, expensive cars, which almost get negative points for appearing in this movie. Of course, she's hot, but who's so desperate for a woman onscreen? I feel that the director sat there with a hat full of dialogues and plot excerpts, and rocked an 8 ball every time they switched scenes. No serious person who runs or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the racing scenes.
