The Band Camp was horrible, The Naked Mile was a little better, and this third straight disc for the DVD of the American Pie franchise seems to have the same quality as the predecessor. Basically, Erik Stifler (John White) separated from his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now he and Mike Cooze Coozeman (Jake Siegel) are joining Erik's cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) in college. With the promise of lots of parties, lots of booze and lots of hot girls in the Beta House, they only have fifty jobs listed to become privileged official members. But a threat comes into view with rivals, the GEK ("Geek") House, led by Edgar (Tyrone Savage), a power hungry nerd who offers more and better than Beta. To solve it once and for all, Beta and Gek go into battle with the banished, for forty years, the Greek Games to hit each other with the loser moving. The last game champion, Noah Levenstein, also known as Jim's Dad (the only Eugene Levy) commands the show, which shows people unbuttoning bras, a duel of gladiators floating in the water, picking up a greased pig, Russian Roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk, wife carrying and drinking a barrel full of alcohol (with vomiting not disqualifying). It all comes to sudden death, with a guy dancing stripper, and they have to resist to enjoy, Beta House wins when Edgar enjoys with a girl dressed like a sheep on his lap. Also starring Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italy Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The amount of nudity is a bit heightened, as is the rudeness of the jokes, and I think she was rated a star in five, but I like that. Suitable!
