I agree with everyone above who said anything that will convince you not to miss a bit of moments watching this incredibly amateur movie. Very poor acting, improvised production values, totally pedestrian direction and a script so inept and futile that it should never have been written, much less produced. Even Hollywood "professionals" seemingly only work for a salary, though no one should have been paid for this bad job. Instead, the careers should have ended with that irrelevant move. <br /> <br /> OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so frighteningly bad. And Chad Lowe is terribly and consistently bad.
