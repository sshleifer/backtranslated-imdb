I saw this movie at the Sundance 2005 and was shocked at how bad it was, although based on the catalog description I was excited to see it. Supposedly a "mockumentary" of two high school students making a documentary of high school life, he presented poor acting, bad direction, completely the lack of engaging characters as written, and all-around is a total failure. I love good movies about high school, and that's not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and self-consciously "legal", although they should be excluded. You get the general impression of a lot of people sitting around making a purposely bad movie to show off to their friends, but somehow he joined Sundance. Mystifying.
