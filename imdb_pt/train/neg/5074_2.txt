I saw this movie two weeks ago at the festival des nouvelles images du Japon in Paris. Although I was not expecting much from this, I have to say that I was disappointed as many people in the audience ... if I wanted to summarize how I felt, I would say that I have compared this with princess mononoke and nausicaa from beginning to end. Of course it's silly. But I could not help it. The stories are very different, but the worlds portrayed are very similar. And from this point of view, "a palm tree" definitely does not support comparison with Miyazaki's masterpieces. Even if it's technically very good, boredom continues ... in the end, your total lack of originality makes me advise you not to mind watching it. I rated 2 of 10 (a bit harsh, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
