This movie is terrible. I was really looking forward to it, since I thought "Lantana" was great. <br /> <br /> The following criticism may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> First, the good things: looks great, some of the performances are OK. Bad things are all about it. <br /> <br /> The story, as you probably know, is about some guys who go fishing and discover a body, with the twist they find on Friday, but they keep fishing and finally report it on Sunday when Return. in mobile (cellular) reach. However, the movie takes its time (boy takes its time) to reach this central event. <br /> <br /> From the set of characters (about a dozen), none seems to like another (which is, I suppose, consistent because they are all unpleasant). I was extremely frustrated with the inability to adequately explain how the characters are related, and it was only at the end of the film that I could vaguely construct the family tree. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of a relentlessly dark movie, which is a flaw in the structure of the story, since the character's life seems as bad before the fishing trip as after. Once you have set the bar so high, it is difficult to prevent everyone from committing suicide. <br /> <br /> There are silly lapses in logic. The killer dumps the body into the lake and somehow he moves miles up the mountain. The fishermen leave on Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne comes home late at night after his wife went to bed. Then the next morning the cops knocked on the door to get him down to the station. Um, did not they hear the phone? At the police station, the media knows the whole story, less than 24 hours after they denounced the body. <br /> <br /> Total lack of history is the debate that the guys certainly had after finding the body. This is a mystery - everyone asks "how can you do this?" and the public is asking the same question. (The debate over what to do with the body is the key scene in "Deliverance"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone needs to get in the car, drive to the moving area, call the cops, wait and guide them back to the scene. If the others wait in the camp and fish, who cares? <br /> <br /> Most of this seems false. The only thing he confirmed was that, as the girl was black, the local natives clung to the actions of the fishermen as racist - "you would not have done it if you were a white girl." <br /> <br /> Everywhere there is a curious indifference to who could have killed the girl (I think the subject is mentioned once), and there is no mystery, since the public sees the murderer in the scene of opening. <br /> So, I'm sitting there simultaneously bored and confused, when there's a twist - not in the plot, but the theme. Suddenly it becomes about the quiet dignity of the mourning aborigines leading to a ridiculous ending with some incoherent things about black-white reconciliation. Huh? <br /> <br /> This is the Australian movie "at its best," according to The Age.
