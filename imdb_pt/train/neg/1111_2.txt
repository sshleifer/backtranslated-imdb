The closing song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately, that's all positive I can say about this Western movie. I have to write another 8 lines for my comments to be posted, but there are over 8 horrible lines in this western. I'm not sure if the movie was an homage to Hopa Along, or just a parody. The hero and the villain in this movie were very plastic. It is not realistic at all. Many of the supporting actors in this film seemed authentic, but the filming scenes were a joke. A previous commentator thought this movie was great and, in the comments, shot President Bush. This was not a democratic or republican western. It was just a western movie to be sold commercially. I wonder if that made any money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie made by college film students. If that was the case then it was a great movie.
