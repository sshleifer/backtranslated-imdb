I was not particularly impressed with this movie that has music without dimming and lasts only 40 minutes. Thank God, because I was falling asleep. I make excellent use of time-lapse photography to show the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all. <br /> <br /> My preference is for his predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi did in 1983 at 87 minutes and to prove that a sequel may be better than the original, Powaqqatsi did in 1988 running 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try both.
