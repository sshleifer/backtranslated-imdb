There is no denying that the first Azumi film was a commercial product; was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young actors attractive and certainly not lacking in the budget department. However, more than entertained for what it was, and I can not deny that I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" does not have just about everything that made the original so wonderful. The first thing that should sound the alarm is the absence of the superb Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. With him, he seemed to have not only his own visual and kinetic talent, but the original style, beauty and, most importantly, his heart. While the first had a simple plot of "success list," this one has a mess of history, with many bland characters stabbing each other in the back so often the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated. The effective interaction between the main characters ended; Azumi and his companions are often reduced to a lot of uncontrolled teenagers arguing in a forest. Characterization is non-existent; if someone watching really cares who lives and who dies, I'll be shocked. The same applies to the villains here. The final battle - indeed, all battles - is completely devoid of any kind of tension. The fact that they are badly choreographed and abysmally directed - not to mention few and far between - is made a sideline for its own sheer worthlessness. The villains themselves try too far to be exaggerated, and even if they were all combined, they do not come within a mile of Pete Burnsian's Jo Odagiri antics country in the original. <br /> <br /> ## Major Spoiler at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto tries her best that has to be said, and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films. Azumi is now a real killer, which means she can shake her sword in slow motion; unfortunately, now the character is instilled with a kind of mystery of the Man With No Name style, Ueto's model seems even more inappropriate. I know this is the point, but this combined with the inefficiency of everyone else in the movie, the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptitude of the movie in general means that it is absolutely impossible to get behind your character this time around. The less said about Chiaki "Remind me of Kill Bill", Kuriyama's performance is the best; suffice it to say that the "turning" from good to evil is as subtle as napalm. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was just a colossal disappointment. Any merit is made ten times better in the first film. A lazy mess, unsatisfying - and usually very annoying.
