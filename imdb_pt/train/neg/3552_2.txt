I finally saw the INCUBUS after waiting 20 odd years to see and well, it certainly was not worth waiting all this time to see it. The INCUBUS is strictly a horror movie: the invisible killer / monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film is like this: the movie begins with the killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah then another murder; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; yet another murder (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah, etc ... <br /> <br /> The film is totally predictable from start to finish. Even the stupid "big" red herring used throughout the film would not convince a 5-year-old. And I discovered the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character, so when the surprising final "shocking" came, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept laughing after watching the movie. It's so silly! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is so famous that the sequel to the "rock band" is one of the few highlights in this somber movie. It's a highlight scene, not necessarily because it's good, but because it's so funny and meaningless: the movie screened on the big screen shows a moment of rock video with a red leather pants face cropping its long hair this edited with scenes of a girl being attacked in the cinema bathroom by the incubus. The best thing I could say about this movie is the cinematography, which I really enjoyed. But in addition, there is almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS, except that it is unintentionally hilarious.
