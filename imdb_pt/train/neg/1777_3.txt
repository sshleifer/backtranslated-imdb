If you're the type of movie goer who likes original content and smart suspense ... then look elsewhere, kids, because sleepwalkers really sucks. I'm usually more eloquent than this, but ... wow ... this was bad. I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a ride home, she refuses, and then he is seen PASSING HOME. Where's his car? Anyway, I just do not see it, people. I really want to be more specific, but words escape me. Cats jumping on people. A guy being stabbed by corn. Cheesey lines up the proverbial "wazoo". I just do not see it. Wait, I'll take it back! See for writer Stephen King's participation as the guy who owns the graveyard. He is really very good. Even with special guest appearances from Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the film's best performance. But besides ... Wow ... BAD.
