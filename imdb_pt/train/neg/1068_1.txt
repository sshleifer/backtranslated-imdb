My wife and I just finished this movie and I came to IMDb to whine with the reviewers who found this film less than satisfactory. However, of the 10 pages of comments, only a handful is negative. I feel that this movie is a great concept that went awry and I want to alert those who are looking at the movie in the future. <br /> <br /> I admit, I'm more inspired to write reviews when I do not like a movie than when I do, so my bunch of comments are all negative. Still, that does not mean I'm inclined to dislike a movie, but I often find more eloquent reviews about the movies I like. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie I have ever seen. ve seen in years. By using an "intelligent" concept and adding great talent to a few short stories, the film turns out to be the worst of all worlds. It's art for art, but something a 2-year-old could dream up and do. Giving the director the free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment. Directors can not write, writers can not drive. (I'd also like to mention that Clint Eastwood is overrated, but that's because he's an actor turn director (which rarely works, too).) <br /> <br /> What turns out on screen is a mistake .. mess of tales that do not make sense, are not completed in 5 minutes and in total, ruin Paris for me. are watched, most notably Alfonso Cuar√≥n's play, but everything else will fall into obscurity.The Coen brothers short is passable, but can you name a movie of them that does not contain a scene with a guitar of choice? It's as if all the directors they decided to do what they wanted and chose Paris as the place to do it.As we all love Paris, this present company included, we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks.I actually think they put the names of the directors in each of the short films because the directors come am how bad a movie is this and decided to make sure they were guilty only for the 5 minutes. Seriously. Seriously. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is not a good actress. She is not a fairy dream girl waiting to be yours. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you acting or regurgitating performances from other films? I'm looking at you Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace). <br /> <br /> A final comment about the acting: I give twice Many compliments to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more human than you have in times or maybe never will. Find your short on YouTube as your 5 minutes are quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors are right. I'm thinking of Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, just to name a few. It's much harder than writing a complete novel and only the truly talented can achieve this. The same can be said about short films. It seems that only a director will live in the annals of history. <br /> <br /> If you defend Paris as a jewel to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story, then do not expect to Enjoy this movie at all. The directors either did not care or were lazy. In any scenario, the moment you are reading this means that you have rented. Glad you did not pay $ 10 a head in theaters for that.
