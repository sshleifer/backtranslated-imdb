I watched this movie based on the very favorable comments I read about it here by others. <br /> <br /> They definitely saw something in this movie that I did not see, for sure. <br /> <br /> The film starts at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting, so it starts to get inactive and dragged, not to mention completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Eventually you find yourself saying, "What?!? He's going to do it too? How far is he going to go with this thing?" <br /> <br /> The plot begins with the character of Jeff Goldblum, John, going to a delicatessen to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new clerk, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John walks into the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. That seems a little too much, but wait, there's more. <br /> <br /> John is totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make any kind of logical sense, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful and loving girlfriend, a secure and well-paid job, a legal house, a legal car, suits Expensive - He decided he wanted to be a loser like Auggie Rose, and to live life in a low-paying job, living in a dump with a fallen girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Why This Dimension A half-baked movie got favorable reviews that I will never know. Sure Goldblum does a good job of acting - he always does - and his appearance has improved with age - but unless you have a big crush on Jeff Goldblum and have to see all the movies he's in, I would not recommend that turkey . It's about two hours of your life that you will not come back - and believe me - you will have nothing to thank for when those two hours are over, as well as being grateful you are still not sitting watching this movie! <br /> <br />
