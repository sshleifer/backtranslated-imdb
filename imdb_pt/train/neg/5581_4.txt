The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC's miniseries (later released as a video / DVD as a feature film) about the treacherous 60's seen through the eyes of a white family and a black family. The first half of the film is driven by Dutton's excellent performance as the Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the plot between families. However, Dutton's character is killed in half and the black family is completely forgotten in a second half bland, incoherent and utterly awful. RATING: 4 out of 10. Unclassified (later classified as PG-13 for video / DVD release).
