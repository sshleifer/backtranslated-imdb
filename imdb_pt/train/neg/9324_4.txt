Okay, I own this DVD, I bought it on amazon ... I mean, I think it's fucking cool movie and melissa bale, the naughty girl they catch is hot as hell ... the acting is a drug and the whole polt just sucks the clown is some huge guy wearing a mask and its disgusting but its ok i would not recommend it as u wanted to rent a good fun movie after a hard day of work but if u have more nothing to do and ur obbsessed with these stupid movies like me, I watch someday, and I do not know how the handmade DVD has SICK in its DVD collection, sick not good enough to be owned by a decent movie business half way OK well that's all
