All this discouraging waste of movie stock needs is that Count Floyd appears every sixty seconds. Somehow they got Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty together on a set and could not get within five miles of a real movie. BOY makes this thing suck. There is no original line, thought, plan or effect of the opening sequence without brain to the end without brain. The magic, ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Parts - boring. Steve Railsback - annoying. John Vernon - boring. The big mistake - annoying. If this is a horror movie, Buttercream Gang is a documentary about wildlife. <br /> <br /> Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its evilness. Usually it's in the opening credits - "Written, Directed and Produced by" a guy. Or, in the center of the action, a bimbo so untalented you know there is one and only one reason why this turkey was made. Here, you do not discover until the last of the credits, where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the Canadian government is acknowledged with gratitude. <br /> <br /> Now I'm watching MST on Beast of Yucca Flats to take the taste out of my mouth. Ghod, what an improvement!
