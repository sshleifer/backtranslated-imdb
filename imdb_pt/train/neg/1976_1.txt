How is it possible that such a bad movie can be made? Bad performance. Bad script Just an embarrassment everywhere. This is just a bad cliche after another. <br /> <br /> This movie has some big name stars. Unfortunately they are singers and not actors. <br /> <br /> This movie hardly made money for good reason. The appeal of black cowboy films does not exist. Too bad they do not have a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> This movie has some big name stars.
