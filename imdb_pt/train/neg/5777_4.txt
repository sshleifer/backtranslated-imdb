It's funny when you stop and think about it: horror movie fans tend to have a deep and lasting affection toward those who frighten their daylight. The MASSACRE CHAINSAW from Texas can give us nightmares, but who among us (the Faithful) did not feel a real pang of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE - or for Ken Foree, forever and ever the resolute hero of the DAWN OF original THE DEAD ? His participation in the remake made me want to stand and applaud (as did the tip of Tom Savini); I'm not kidding with you. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you understand me (if not, stand up ...). These are some of the Horror Heroes. To see this many of them put together in a single movie is almost unheard of (at least up to this point, as far as I know). If only the writer (s) had participated in such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, try again. As long as it is not another indifferent effort (like the BLOOD BROTHERHOOD, for example).
