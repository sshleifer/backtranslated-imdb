I do not give out "them" often, but if there ever was a movie that deserved that kind of attention, it's "Gas!" This is a self-indulgent crap that reaches some of the environments of M * A * S * H ​​and falls flat in the attempt. I see what Corman wanted - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's immortal role in the original version of the M * A * S * H ​​film with a similar plot (in the movie " Whiffs "- look here at IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/ title / tt0073891 / for more information. <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould came closer to the brass ring with" Whiffs "than Corman with "Gas!" But did not get there. None of these movies came close to the success of M * A * S * H. What is wrong with "Gas!"? "No one comes close to actually acting on a level above the theatricality of high school." The production values ​​are bad. "Someone here mentioned the magical regeneration headlights on an escape car, and there is more lack of attention to detail. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" Actually put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> It's not a sure cure for insomnia, but very pr On the Cinematic Sleep Induction scale, "Gas!" falls somewhere between "Last Year at Marienbad" and George Clooney's remake of "Solaris" (which was notable for being more boring than the original Mosfilm, despite the apparent lack of familiarity with the studio with the idea of ​​keeping the audience's attention). judicious editing would have wiped out "Gas!" for about twenty minutes. The result would be useless, but no more than the original movie. <br /> <br /> Certain movies are so bad that they have a convincing quality that makes them worth watching anyway. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not at all funny.
