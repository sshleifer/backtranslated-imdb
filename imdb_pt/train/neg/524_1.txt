"The 40-year-old virgin" exists in a world I do not understand. A world where an employee of an electronics store can tell his boss to "fuck" and broadcast videos of his naked ass through the store and is not scolded. A world where it is very funny to drive drunk and collide with other people's cars. A world where it seems certain that a boss sexually harasses his subordinates. A world full of furious and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without funny jokes! I am absolutely shocked by the apparent chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad sketch of Saturday Night Live - not very funny to begin with, and it extended beyond all rational thinking. The waxing scene continued ALWAYS. <br /> <br /> The characters, besides Carell, were all of a note. And the romantic elements were completely planned, particularly the scene where Keener finds pornography in Carell's apartment. That was just lame. <br /> <br /> And I also found the sequence of "Aquarius" totally annoying and excessive. I hated hating I hated this movie!
