I see a lot of movies. Saw the original wargames years ago and I loved it. Computers where even "a great mystery" to most of us and the movie was compelling in its own way. <br /> <br /> This, however, seems like a low budget on Wednesday night's special. Total crap, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak, you will not believe until you see the movie (which I would not recommend in the first place). I can not point out an actor who really did a good job in this movie. But with this script, I would be surprised if anyone could do a good job. Lots of clich√© scenes. It looks like the CGI came out of the 86 version. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I'm in a bad mood just writing about it. DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is short to waste it watching bad movies.
