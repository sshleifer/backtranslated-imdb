Redundant and timeless shots, useless shots, useless scenes are what you'll find in this movie. In other words, it seemed technically bad for me. The musical segments are directed in an amateur way (there is no synchronization in the pretended dance, improvisation badly-post-synchronized, bad and obvious of the actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The movie is long and boring. Eventually, it makes little sense and even less sense. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas. Some of the comic elements are really effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film gets worse and worse, so it's completely unbearable and impossible to understand until the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, which is not true for the film. This means that the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual movie is something very close to a robbery.
