This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life. The acting was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any boring emotion. At the beginning of the movie, she should be discouraged. Instead, she shook her head with her lower lip pinned. She sobbed woefully without tears to the scene of crying. I was almost angry that of all the girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to tear her off. Everyone was suffering from over-action as well. It was boring and annoying. It was also an insult to figure skaters. Jordan took a month to train, and they climbed it as a person who does the Olympic team. It's practically spitting on the effort that real skateboarders put into their work. An unfortunate excuse for a movie and an unfortunate attempt to associate hockey and skating. Do not waste your life. It does not even deserve a star.
