Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was obviously received in different ways: some were shocked, some were shocked, others applauded the courage. However, I am completely untouched, bored and I can not help wondering why the display of incoherent and incoherent images that vaguely orbit around a central theme is considered an intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What was this movie about? Growing sexuality in a woman? I've seen great movies on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can anyone try to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not just as a narrative device for dreaming (nude) of beasts. Where there are no characters, there is no character study. The woman pursued by the beast was not a teenager, the girl having sex with the black butler (he is also characterized as a beast?) He has a very adult attitude towards sexuality, so where is the consistency? Is it a movie about religion? If so, we would need a little more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire for two boys. <br /> <br /> Is it bestiality? The film's metaphorical feel forbids any realistic examination of bestiality, especially since realistic examination requires realistic characters. So there is no real bestiality here. Some mythical beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the subject? I do not think like that. <br /> <br /> Is it about sex? Is it about something? I do not know. I just know that showing a gun does not make a movie a war movie. Dealing with a topic should mean more than displaying your own associations with the topic. <br /> <br /> So look at the controversy. Do not be scared of bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and other things. I'm not. Look at it as you look at any other story and you may find that this is an evil done, poorly edited, poorly represented, very poorly written (okay, some pics are really cool, and the main character is a very pretty girl) cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks that the rodeo in a hypnotic and slow way will make history clever. Do not do. This makes boring.
