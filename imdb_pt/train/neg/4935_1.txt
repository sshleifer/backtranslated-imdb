"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations, not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically, here's the show: Cave men are an alternative race, they face prejudices, etc. Quite possibly the most stupid idea ever created; almost worthy of imprisonment for writers. A show showed the cavemen going to a club, trying to catch girls, and nothing else happened. It was reminiscent of hearing a 22-minute Andy Rooney dialogue, followed by death by cannibal steak dwarf knives. For those who have not seen this show, here is an example of the dialogue: "You're sure it's okay to date a caveman." "Yeah, okay, I had about ten thousand!" Hilarious ... Possibly the best writing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes of cave men with horrible makeup, dealing with difficult social issues ... It seems like a fun night. I also love how bad the recent ideas are that they are resorted to doing a sitcom of car insurance commercials. I wonder if they'll do the Gecko then so I can have a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I'd even say it's worse than "Viva Laughlin." At least "Viva Laughlin" was ripped from something that was a little inspired. <br /> <br /> Shows like this make me hope there's a comet somewhere on Earth. <br /> <br /> (Unbelievable honestly ...)
