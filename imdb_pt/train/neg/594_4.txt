I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed. I did not feel anything in this movie. I felt sick because the blood was just shocking. <br /> <br /> I left my room several times, in despair, that something would happen to this movie. Have not we seen all this before? I did not like any of the guy's characters in the sewer cage. I felt bad for him. But again, I could not think why he was still alive and not murdered by Creep? So many questions need to be answered. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned references to the game for PS2 Silent Hill and I can see similarities loosely. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, it's not a good movie. judge for yourself.
