There is not a drop of sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys," which makes the title the only ironic moment of the alleged comedy Neil Simon. Simon, who adapted the script of his piece (which is not credited), amounts to old age with irrational behavior - and, worse, clumsy, rampant and petty irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is ruthless in playing an old vaudeville artist who talked to former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (they say they've been a team for 43 years, which raises the question "How long did vaudeville last? "). Burns, who won an Oscar for support, has the misfortune to go to the movies in about thirty minutes, after which Matthau has already blown the stuff to hell. The louder the film gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did a solid job when he was not attached to one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here Ross creates jokes like a beat-up amateur, hammering out the belligerent routines that are not worth it (like half-incoherent Matthau popping into a mechanic's garage to do a test for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he compensates too much, bowing and shouting. It was up to Ross and Simon to temper the character, nuance his temperament to give Sunlight Boys some sun, but Walter continues to project as if we were all deaf. The image looks terribly monotonous and crawls in a moodless rhythm; No one loses hope for this from the beginning. * 1/2 of ****
