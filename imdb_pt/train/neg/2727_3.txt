This strangeness in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION does not really need to be included as it is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. What it does, however, is to shine when it is on the screen. The next, less movie, plot is just an excuse to show some of the Warner's contractors of the day. JANCIE RULE shows promise and it's a shame she has not become a big star. Ruth ROMAN deals with the role of the "entrepreneur" with resourcefulness. Better if it were in color. Travis Air Force base sites with some rear projection work well. What's great about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes. If you liked THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN, you'll like this one.
