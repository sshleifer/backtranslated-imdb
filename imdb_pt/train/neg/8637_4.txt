Another mystery movie with some free horror elements released; mediocre in general. <br /> <br /> It starts with a woman having a nightmare in which her sexual partner gets out of bed, enters her son's bedroom crying and kills him. She wakes up. So that man is dying in a hospital, spitting blood. His distant daughter arrives, and he manages to contact her through his dreams (I think), and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body completely decomposes in his grave. <br /> <br /> There is not much mystery about who did it, or even how; most viewers will have discovered this long before it is revealed. I'm not sure if the way he was killed would have really worked. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the elements of horror come on the scene: a bloody autopsy, the man's recurring dream of killing the boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turns into eyes that are then cut, and several shots of the decomposing man, both in nightmares and, indeed, in his grave. <br /> <br /> I was a bit surprised to see a dedication in the end by Fulci Clive Barker! Interesting.
