Kerry Conran's challengingly ambitious science fiction, for whom this is clearly a labor of love. Unfortunately it's not so good. It all starts well - with an epic but contained soundtrack, a mixture of the Lucas-Hitchcock-style editing and the brilliant filmmaking of a Spielberg. The film also refers to many science fiction novels, serials and films as diverse as The Day the Earth Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet of the Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. The film, however, can not be as good as any of them for several reasons: being the main such a loving job, so preoccupied with throwing everything on screen and creating a brave new world, Conran actually forgets to make a movie . There is little or no tension, atmosphere or magic on offer here, despite air battles, dinosaurs and race scenarios against time. Even the noir elements fall. That's a wide way to see things - these elements mostly fail because nothing looks real and is so obviously fake - the green screen looks like a video game in half the time and it's obvious that the actors were glued after. . The actors also do not do much - Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is boring and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and it's all because of a horrible script - the kind that has to explain almost everything. It's a decent experience and some may have a sense of nostalgia, but ultimately this is a useless step in yesterday's world. Good ending though.
