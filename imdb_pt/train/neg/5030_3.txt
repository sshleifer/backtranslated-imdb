What is in the heavens? Is it a plane? Is it Superman? Errr, is not it? It's a turtle! See, this is what happens with the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other issues! Americans knock down a Russian fighter plane somewhere on the Arctic territory and the subsequent explosion thaws and literally awakens the gigantic prehistoric creature called Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly bug because it readily destroys everything and everyone in their path. The ruling governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a new, super-sophisticated ice bomb, but Gammera has another surprise in store? The damn turtle can fly! The first time this happens it results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence! Gammera is lying on his back, seeming defeated when, suddenly, the fire blows from his armpits and he rises in the air. How could you not love it? Then there is also a sub plot about a boring kid who is able to communicate telepathically with the monster, but that is not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people !! There is very little to write about this Japanese science fiction effort (and reissued by the Americans), plus it is an obvious and totally shameless cheat of classics like the original Godzilla and The Beast of 20,000 fathoms. The effects and designs of monsters are extremely fake and, unlike the above-mentioned movies, he never manages to create an apocalyptic environment. Respectful actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") do not seem to know in what shooting scene they are and even the original Japanese chaos scenes are not very convincing. But Gammera's very own custom theme song is pretty cool, so you get the extra bonus for that.
