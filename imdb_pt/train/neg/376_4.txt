The French film "Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte" directed by the iconoclastic filmmaker Philippe Harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer Michel Houellebecq.He also worked on the scene of the film.According to the British cinema magazine Vis√£o and Sound, is also known as "Whatever". This film was hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema due to its not-so-common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers. by his very evident voice about what introduces us to the main character. This makes the spectators feel as if we were watching a book that is bring reading. The basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is good, but the film gets out of control as the hero begins to report the misery faced by him and his friend. Instead of sticking to his main theme, the film follows in other directions for its downfall. Watch out: some female viewers may find not only the movie but even their two heroes as misogynistic idiots.
