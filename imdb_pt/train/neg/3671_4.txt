Monotonous, predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance (Weller) that runs through the country only to find his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, he kills everyone in his path just by a simple touch of his hands. On his dangerous track, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film does not have an original premise, but it can be much better. The end result is just a movie without suspense or hard times. Even the good cast is completely lost. I give this to 4 (four).
