This movie is truly annoying. He was banned in Chinese cinema and I can see why. It is not because it is critical of the communist regime, but simply because the film is of poor quality. I would never want to pay to watch this. I love movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I'm disappointed that such a bad movie can come out of China. It seems to totally ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the film for himself. The pictures of a person standing there, doing nothing for a minute, are hilarious and there are many of them. The cinematography and the quality of the video are unbelievably bad. I've watched this movie on the net and it looks like people really enjoy this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some movie fans think that if a movie is not in English, it's automatically good. I do not see any reason why people like this. this is not an art film, it's a waste of celluloid (that is, if they actually filmed the movie, which they did not)
