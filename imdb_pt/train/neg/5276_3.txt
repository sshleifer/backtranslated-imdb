No, this is nothing about that fairy tale with pumpkin trainer, fairy godmother and glass slippers, but if I were to elaborate, I would have to ruin everything for you, which I will not do. But do not let curiosity get the better of you, since this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those movies that get promising, before betraying your audience with cheap intimidation tactics and an incoherent plot. And that's a real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are his ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon while the other is his obedient, obedient, and handsome teenage daughter. Their relationship is like a hand in glove, so close that you would think of them more as brothers than as father-son. But things start to go wrong (not always) when the friends of Hyun-soo, who Yoon-hee has operated, begin to go crazy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is a warning to the public, and to those Korean ladies who do not clink their eyelids when they go to the knife, if you believe the news. The only really scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, although somehow, I thought Kim Ki-duk's time really had more blood in presenting and describing what happens during the surgery itself. <br /> <br /> It's a two-part tale, the first being an attempt to shock the public with standard bullying tactics, which, I admit, have come to me from time to time. However, the second half degenerated the film into meaningless mumbo-jumbo melodrama, and was well-planned to force his ideas down his throat. Some things start to make sense, and although attempts are always put forward to explain, you probably will not believe it, not that horror movies are logical to begin with. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are all beautiful, and there is a distinct absence of male presence beyond the despicable role of the police officer. But hey, I'm not complaining, although the story could have been tremendously improved. I recommend you watch this, only if you're a fan of mediocre Korean horror, on VCD. Stay tuned for those off-game moments!
