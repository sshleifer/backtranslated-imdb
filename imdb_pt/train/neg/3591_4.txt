First, let me say that I am a great believer in Fanpro's things. I see this as a way to continue a good show long after it has been canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So I have a weakness for fanpro stuff which means I'm going to ignore the things I ordinarily would ill. <br /> <br /> Then to ST: HF. Well, first things good. Enthusiasm is an important part of making any show believable and, for the most part, the crew of the various ships seems to be enjoying their roles. Then the effects are not bad for a home-made effort, with nothing to really make you shudder. The stories are not too bad either. Nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough and at least there are story arches in progress. <br /> <br /> But there are many flaws. <br /> <br /> First, although they obviously have to get Star Trek scenes, set scenarios, music and effects, I see no reason why they have stolen virtually every other sci-fi ever made. Everything from aliens to stellar troops, makes it an orchestral head at one point or another. Similarly, many of the filming are from other films, dutifully CGI to make it look different. Gray warships, for example, though in disguise, are obviously Star Destroyers. And the station is also quite obvious Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga of Star Troops. Similarly, the sound effects of several Star Wars films appear in space battles between combatants, as well as animations on filming. In a scene in the first or second season, I think, you even see two TIE fighters fly during a battle, which hardly makes their suspension of disbelief favor. <br /> <br /> The acting ranges from reasonable to horribly painful to watch. Everyone improves as the seasons progress, but expect to grimace on the screen, especially in the early seasons. They also made some interesting acting choices. Let's just say that the food replicators in this program seem permanently set to "cake" and leave it that way. <br /> <br /> The makeup effects are usually quite effective in general. But they really should relentlessly kill to death the person who decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than using background or "passing" shots. They are beyond unrealistic. Every time I saw one of them (besides trying not to laugh a lot), I hoped the unhappy soul would use it to draw a gun and announce, "That's a problem!" In one scene, a "Cardassian" speaks while using one of these. Not only do the lips do not move, but the mask does not even have an opening where the mouth should be. Someone needs to be slapped for it. They could not have brought a craft knife for it, for God's sake! There are also some well-made but unintentionally funny makeup works, such as that of Herman Munster-like. <br /> <br /> Writing, though coherent, is nothing new. Instead, the script runs as a continuation of DS9, with ships leaving the DS12 on various missions. The new enemy, "The Gray" is not very threatening and the plot surrounding them is effectively a reworking of Borg topics. that is, the Star Fleet meets the Gray, the Gray is immensely powerful, the Starfleet is barely able to escape with their lives, so through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy, etc. etc. All done before with the Borgs. <br /> <br /> The bone of contention is dialogue. Star Trek writers have long had the ability to type "insert technobabble here" into a script. This usually means exposing the ultimate plan to combat the enemy using "quantum phase discriminators" or "insulated loads" etc. In other words, nonsense that says they are in the case and a resolution is at hand. <Br /> <br /> Words are just scribbles, in fact. I have no problem with this, but where ST: HF makes a mess is where they include real world comments on this concept. <br /> <br /> A tactical advice like "We need to regroup" sounds good, but not when uttered by a trio of characters already standing in a group. Similarly, when asked what the situation is, a tactical officer is heard to respond "We count three warships". Did he really need to count them? Come on! I expected the questioner to ask him "Are you sure?" or "You can check again". But my favorite review of all time is this: Captain: "Can we establish a two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Conversation officer: "No, we can only send and receive .." <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> All that said, the show improves as it progresses. Seasons 1 and 2 are very bad, 3 show an improvement, but 4 and 5 are where it starts to look remarkably better. The 6th season so far seems quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with the media choice for the shows. Quicktime sucks, frankly and the sooner they move into the divx / avi format, the better. Some of us like to watch our downloaded programs and watch them on decent sized screen and not look for a small QT window on a computer monitor. Not only does QuickTime make this difficult, but the 320x180 resolution that programs are running on does not increase much. In fact, this makes the shows quite indecipherable, as if they were a tenth generation VHS tape copy. The least they could do was include a high-resolution download option. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show has a promise, and I'm even starting to like some of the characters. But it's 40 episodes, so I'm not sure if that says a lot about the character's development. <br /> <br /> But what you can say, it's free ... <br /> <br /> PS: From 28 votes, 19 people rated this program as 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... we were watching the same show? Or are you 19 years old?
