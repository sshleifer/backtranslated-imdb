Where to start, there is so much wrong and horrible about this movie that I do not know where to start. Okay, the two stooges who wrote this crap. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first they failed to invent their minds for a name. I think they split the difference, which is why the main title is BRAIN THAT WOULD NOT DIE, but the final screen says HEAD THAT WOULD NOT DIE. None of them know anything about the medical profession. After all, doctors take oaths to "do no harm". Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "damaging." Also, a little something called blood and fabric matching. The rejection would mean Jan's death in the pot. Also, anyone who keeps a patch works monster. In which medical school did Bill graduate, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECHNOLOGY? The monster had no name, it bothers the hell out of me. In addition, the brilliant surgeon Dr. Bill Cortner does not know how to keep a patient sedated? All and all a disaster from a movie, it's incredibly stupid and unattainable, except in MST3K. I give Thanksgiving TURKEY.
