The Sentinel represents everything about Hollywood's lack of soul and the sad lack of imagination present in so many movies these days. I can not think of a good thing about it, it's all so generic, so fabricated and so lazy ridden that it really only exists as an infomercial about making money with the unsuspecting, unworthy public. <br /> <br /> A plot about a secret service agent planning to assassinate the Prez could very well be fun. If manipulated by a good director or a cast of care that is. Douglas is the one that is framed. Basinger is the first lady, with whom he is having an affair (an undeveloped and unresolved device). Sutherland is the best friend who believes he is guilty because there would be no movie if he did not. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a Maybelline fortune and ... that's it. I think there are fewer demands on women when they enter the Secret Service. As usual in a film like this, the role of Prez himself is nothing more than a tool, a symbol and is very poorly written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, he who gave us the equally pathetic SWAT back In 2003, the mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland seem incredibly bored and call in their performances from afar. Eva Longoria, the most exposed woman of the 21st century, is basically just to attract the audience of Desperate Housewives. Her role is 100% useless and she does absolutely nothing to promote the plot or increase the character's development. She barely has 2 lines to rub together. A really shameless marketing trick. <br /> <br /> If you're a glutton for punishment, then do not let me stop you. But it's time and money that you will not get back.
