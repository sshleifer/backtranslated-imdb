He clearly rips Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu in Soko Kara (Agua Negra, 2002), with evidence of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but terribly blood-stained (a corpse green with red eyes!?) and a weak theme (I find it very difficult to find a scary image message). There were two moments in this movie that made me shudder, both involving an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another 1999 Miike Takashi) made me vibrate for hours after seeing it, and all the stolen movies were really scary, I can not see this movie as anything other than a sell-out for Western popularity of the great Japanese horror films. Two out of ten.
