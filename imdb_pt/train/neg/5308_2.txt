Nothing can prepare you for another bad bimbo ride! This time it's being brought to you by the ever-inevitable Fred Olen Ray! As for the feature films, this one does not click! Like science fiction, it's simple not original! All we see is an ugly female android wearing a bikini to destroy Earth and showing off everything that is almost naked to resist! Give me a break !!! If that kind of entertainment is your thing, then why not dust the old linens of the SI bathrobe from the attic for a change? This would have been much better if I had not set the sleaze factor too high, but that still would not make it great. I would like to highlight another film called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR. It illustrates why "femme fatale" first-person action movies do not translate well into America. Sorry, fellas!
