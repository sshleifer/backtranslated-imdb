I can not believe this clich√© piece of wood and writing was done. There are about four beautiful pictures (the director should think about switching to photography) and that's it. A strong cast is totally wasted, scenes repeatedly end at less interesting times and the script does not say anything new. Please, spare yourself from this movie.
