I think you can summarize this program as well as anything. Batman TAS may be the worst thing that ever happened to comics based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has been measured yet. It's too good. Was Batman good? "Yes, but it was not TAS." Is the Justice League good? "It's not so bad, but it's not TAS." <br /> <br /> Batman is not TAS either, but I will not hold it. It would be unfair and, besides, it has many other problems. <br /> <br /> The concept of a younger and less experienced Batman combat crime is great, and sometimes the art is very good. But all the rest of the time, art is useless Americanime, and this betrays many of the flaws of the show itself. It is rhythmic, written and designed as an americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I would watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could just hit my head on a wall at any time and get the same effect. The Joker is a homicidal, mentally unstable clown in a costume that uses his intelligence, unpredictability and ingenious devices to combat Batman. When he is forced to fight from hand to hand, he will either resort to something cheap or will be totally overcome. He does not pretend to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung-fu and can jump into the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they wanted to do this with a villain, there were other less important characters they might have used or * sigh * they could have created a completely new one. And it's not that re-imagining is bad, do not get me wrong. TAS (there I go again) took Mr. Freeze from his villain B, who wore the standard icegun, and made him a memorable and morally complex character. Of course Freeze was not exactly a classic villain at the time and they did an upgrade, but the point remains. What Batman does is get everything you like in Batman's comics and legends and gives him a big, stinking crap in them. Guess what? They were eating corn. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that this show can not be against TAS, but with your own legs and it still does not work for me. The plots are not good and do not develop better. They were written for the public of children under twelve. Should children enjoy a show? Of course they should. This should not be an adult show with profanity, nudity, and gratuitous violence. But the mark of a really good show is that it can be enjoyed at different levels by all ages. This show misses that mark. <br /> <br /> Is this show a TAS? No of course not. The problem is that it is not even a JLU.
