Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job like Mildred, I felt the film was not the best I had seen. At the end of the movie, I felt like there was something missing in it. <br /> <br /> But Bette Davis did a perfect job, and she made me hate her and pity her all the time. Leslie Howard did very well as the passionate Philip Carey, and I felt sorry for him throughout the film for being in love with such a horrible lady. It's such a sad thing when you fall in love with a bad seed. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive, though pathetic person. <br /> <br /> In the end, acting was what came through and not the plot. The final scene was particularly good, but I'm not going to give it. Although others might find this movie good, I found it that way. I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what can happen to them if they fall in love with this horrible person.
