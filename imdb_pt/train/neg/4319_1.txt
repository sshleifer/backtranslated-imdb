Sorry, but I'm going to ruin both the plot and the ending for you in the hope of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one I'm facing right now. The father dies and the mother asks Santa Claus in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas, ... and Santa Claus. Dad is velvety, happy, healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he was dead. Everything ends sweet syrup. <br /> <br /> But as a parent who recently saw my five-year-old son lose his canine best friend, it was a horror movie. Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his friend back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart - no amount of persuasion will convince you it was just a movie and your dog will NOT come back for Christmas. He was heartbroken to watch his joy just to know that Christmas Eve he will have to face his loss again. <br /> <br /> What a shame for you on behalf of all the believers who have recently lost a loved one. It is quite difficult to deal with loss once for a child, but there are some desires that we should not even portray as a possibility.
