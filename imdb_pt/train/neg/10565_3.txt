You can give a pass to JMS and the boys because they were at the beginning of the series and on a small budget but the movie is still below average. Do not get me wrong, B5 the series is by far the best TV series of all time, but if I were an executive watching this movie, I would not have ordered the series. I do not like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are silly and there are tons of clich√©s. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately set the series on fire and it was an incredible sight. If you are a B5 fan and have not seen this movie, see. If you're not a fan of B5, no ... you will not want to watch the show.
