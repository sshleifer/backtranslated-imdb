I usually like comedy movies. I really like them. But I really do not understand the point of "envy". I mean, it has a boring content / topic, and it's not very funny. <br /> <br /> Although the acting is generally good, it is not enough for the movie to get at least a little interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this film. <br /> <br /> So if you're about to rent a comedy, I suggest you definitely do not choose this one. Unless you want to be bored, and I can see that I'm not the only one with that opinion, because even Jack Black apologized for it (take a look at Trivia).
