This movie was awful. I watched it three times, and not even the whole thing. It is simply impossible to watch, the plot is a drug, it is depressing and totally disgusting. I do not write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts of the movie. The little child in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie in cinemas all over America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! The acting is all horrible, and the nakedness itself is lame and unpleasant. Another thing is that Starr Andreef, the other main character, has not been in such bad movies in the past, in fact, she was in some good times. Even with John Savage. This movie sucks!
