No cinematic achievement here, however, that's not the important issue. How do you go about your effort to be a competent date film - and a star vehicle? <br /> <br /> The formula calls for the cute female actress to Ryan or Aniston - check; there's a TV audience built-in! <br /> <br /> Add thick-headed, complacent men, usually including the ex-boyfriend / girlfriend problem - check it out. <br /> <br /> Set up a plot that maximizes the bankarization of the stars. So far so good. <br /> <br /> What does man consist of? He has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience (and the gay flight attendants) instantly faint. But ... he can not be so handsome as to threaten the male audience, and he can not overshadow the star. The problem is that Messing thinks she's still on a sitcom ... she just has a presentation: like the wide-eyed doormat she's made a career with. A capable actress could have achieved this after the love scene, where things immediately plunged into soap suds. <br /> <br /> You can not help feeling good for Mulroney ... you can read in his face that he sees all this. He received all the respect of a lifetime .260 hitter. This time he hits the warning track, and no one can figure out what to do, as he playfully carries the plate home.
