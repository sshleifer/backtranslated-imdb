A spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words can guarantee you a terrible movie? Canadian cheap production. The BRAIN fits perfectly with those words. Terrible script, stupid acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for all bad movie fans. Horror is hilarious. The post-production team seems to have given up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable in the second half, it really does try to be good! Can a little ingenuity and consistency save what's already a joke? <br /> <br /> It's the Christmas season. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest villains of all time. The next day, a rebellious teenager faces enough trouble to be sent for psychiatric testing. <br /> <br /> If a cop's head is cut off and a stranger with blood on it and a bloody ax tells you some children did, who would you believe? What starts as funny becomes monotonous and tiring at the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child can not be frightened by the scary moments. BRAIN is a very funny concept for trying to be gritty. The Institute for Psychological Research is larger than the major factories. Our ugly bandit and his comrades get credit for having acted the hard way I've ever seen. The viewer's discretion advised heavily.
