His first clue that this is a tacky movie is that it was filmed on video, not on film. The story is complicated and the production is incredibly sloppy. Note, for example, that when the couple starts landing in Vermont, where they were celebrating their relationship at a civil union ceremony, the plane is shown entering an airport surrounded by palm trees. His ceremony - in Vermont - occurs in a garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, which would not last five minutes in the New England climate. On another plane trip, the establishment photo shows a FedEx cargo plane taking off. Presumably they could only afford to travel in third class. As for the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, Arthur's devout Christian brother, is expelled from his church when the congregation discovers that his brother is gay. Not only that, but the pastor finally puts Victor with a killer so that Ben and Arthur kill "to cleanse their souls of sin." Apparently no one in this church ever heard of the Ten Commandments. If it were not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this movie would have no redeeming quality.
