I watched anime, but I'm not a hard fan; and I do not read manga. I say this because many of the reviewers who are lyrically talking about this movie seem to have that background. I saw "St. John's Wort," and although it's not a masterpiece of any stretch of the imagination, it made me pick up "Shinobi", especially since everyone seems to love it. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched this afternoon and fought hard to keep watching. Yes, it's very beautiful - the slow-motion camera scenes, the autumn leaves in the trees, until the CGI's blink-majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the fighting scenes, but overall this was annoying as dirt. <br /> <br /> It looked like someone was picking up "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers - and played in some "X-Men" for good measure. Two of the characters shared Wolverine's powers-the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the gray-haired guy had the ability to heal. So you have the girl who has a poison kiss - this is Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give such women such dumb powers? Poisoned girl shows off her leg and then kisses you to death. Dude, this is great power for you. And the other girl can create insects from that yellow dust that she rubs in her hands. The other woman, one of the lovers of the crossed star, has the power of a hypnotic look. Wow. <br /> <br /> I kind of got to the end of the movie, moving fast, and saw a bit more tragedy than I expected. Some people are comparing this to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero". Do not make that mistake. They may share similar endings, but that's where the similarities end. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I would say avoid this movie unless you are between 12 and 18 years old.
