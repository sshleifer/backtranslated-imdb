Stephen Feinberg, who played the proctologist and was one of the writers of the film, passed away in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was a year later when he told me that he had been a Hollywood writer years before, working mainly in TV promos. He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision', but it was already too late, I had already seen! In fact, I had seen it years before when it was released. At that time, I did not think it was such a bad movie. But seeing this as an adult my opinion was a bit different. Yes it is a bit childish as well as dated. Steve admitted it was not a very good movie. That said, he was just a bit proud of the sketch of "The Proctologist."
