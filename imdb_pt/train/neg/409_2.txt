<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed this. He became a joke about himself. Once again we have a movie that includes sex and violence, immorality, looking at women and lots of talk between the characters and the trays. It's all for nothing. Because there is no action in this movie. Fudge all your pieces. All the actors give the kind of performances of a Verhoeven movie. In other words, rampant on almost every level. Star troops fled because it was such a sexist world that the characters lived. In this scientists are acting in the same way. Sorry, Paul, but Soldiers and scientists are not really made of the same mindset. One major flaw in the plot was that after escaping that night to do bad things, Kevin Bacon's character returns to science. lab where we've spent enough time just watching these animated mannequins (Elizabeth Shue excepted) walking and talking. Why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world? How could they track him if he could be anywhere? Think of all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of history and characterization. So look what this movie does and you really have barely made it and understood that the whole project really was. <br /> <br /> Most insulting is Doco on the DVD, where everyone is claiming that Verhoeven is some kind of MAd Genius. Well, one in two is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing of interest in it. Just like the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
