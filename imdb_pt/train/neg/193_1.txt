The story of Norman Maclean is a masterpiece; The Redford movie is mediocre. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers over a waterfall and they date a decadent bar that has not even been suggested in history. The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, an outdoor genius, is laughable or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. In addition, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as if they were expected to be men. None of the women impress in the movie, which is unfortunate because Maclean loved women in their story and made it clear, even poetic.
