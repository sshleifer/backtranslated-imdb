Lynne Ramsey makes stunning images, and Samantha Morton can summon feelings with a gesture. So, what a difficulty to discover your wasted talents with this grotty and pretentious lark. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can not bring Quiet to life. His attempts are very artistic and oblique. Over and over, her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress, as if Morton's oblique gaze could provide character. We're in a Warholian inferno of self-indulgence: for a movie that has plenty of minutes on insects crawling across the floor, you might think it might go around to substantiate its protagonist. But how will this happen if she rarely speaks? Without the inner monologue of the novel, the celluloid Morvern Callar is no one. No wonder Ramsey had Morton undressed often. <br /> <br /> That said, the first ten minutes were so impressive, filmed and edited that my hopes increased. Give the film a lot: it knows how to make promises, if not how to keep some.
