"National Lampoon goes to the movies" is the worst movie of all time, surpassing even the foolish "Plan 9 from Outer Space". At least this movie was just inept; the film Lampoon, on the other hand, is ineffective and stingy. Once upon a time, movies used to respect the intelligence of their audiences. This one, however, keeps a fetid and rotting carcass on our faces - and then tries to rub our noses at it. <br /> <br /> Another critic of this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are: the nude scenes; and I agree, Miss. Ganzel and Dusenberry blink some meat and very beautiful flesh. But the directors do not seem to realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is none of this here. <br/> <br/> Perversely, the filmmakers save the worst for last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays a young eager cop who reports on work on his first day at work. He is paired with a tired and cynical oldtimer played by Richard Widmark. For just a moment, we hope that this movie will end triumphantly. Surely, we think, the brave attitude of the young man will end the cynic and change it for the better. <br /> <br /> Lost hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the young man's spark is erased forever. "National Lampoon goes to the movies" and goes straight to the bathroom, asking us to follow him down the drain. Nominally, this is a comedy. But where's the humor?
