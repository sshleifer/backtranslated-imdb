Woody Allen has lost his ability to write dialogues or characters that are clearly distinguishable from one another. This is the case of "Melinda and Melinda," where all characters speak to Allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and have problems and points of view that are unrelated to anyone outside a four-block radius from where Allen lives . They also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi-million dollar Manhattan apartments that seem to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living. <br /> <br /> Character that exists out of this dull mentality is Will Ferrel as the obligatory substitute for Woody Allen. Although he does not seem to simply make an impression of Woody Allen (like Kenneth Branagh in the horrible "Celebrity"), Ferrel does not have the charm or charisma that the real Woody had when playing the part in his best films. The end result is another in a series of self-indulgent hassles from a once great filmmaker who has been trading his old reputation for years.
