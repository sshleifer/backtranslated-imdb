Because? Why did they make this movie? If Timothy Olyphant had not been shirtless several times, there would be absolutely no reason to watch this movie, ever. Hmm ... plot? No. Well-defined characters? No. The only time I laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of the she-bang. P.S. Andy Dick? Do not.
