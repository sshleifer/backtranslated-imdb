I could not, for my life, follow, discover or understand the story. As the plot progresses, it is also incomprehensible. I'll guess and say there was a pre-production story / story problem that was never solved. Producers could never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, has the time and space to create from the other idea, which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the pursuit of the killer by the police. They ended up with many things going on in a movie time frame. Too bad that really because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to change things and excellent cinematography. In fact, a well made movie that one can enjoy and relax for a few hours.
