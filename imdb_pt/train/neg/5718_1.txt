There has been no characterization in this movie and it really shows how much this untalented hack who directed this needs to learn their craft. All of his characters in this movie were so unpleasant and I could care less. The best point in this movie was the final credits and the bath time after this cause I felt so dirty that I lost money with that smelly load. Hey genius .... triads and yakuza are from two different places that learn something about Asian culture. The dog scene in this felt so nailed and useless. This DVD proved to be useful, I love my new roller coaster. <br /> <br /> So kids do not waste their money on this crap, buy the Hostel.
