After a nude and partially pixelated shower scene, we set off for the races of this "Blair Witch Project" horror film about three girlfriends who venture into a desolate hut in the middle of the bush to escape their busy lives for girls' End of week out and smoking marijuana. They know two guys who seem friendly enough, so they drink and tell ghost stories, by the end of the movie, some of them are chosen. <br /> <br /> This is a rather slow movie, with unnecessarily prolonged 'suspense'. 'scenes, poor performance can not lead to the myriad of scenes where nothing happens but irrational jokes, and the film as a whole is a failure, a boring failure. Nothing happened until the last half hour, and when it happened, I was numb to really care. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ashley Totin shows T & A; Evy Lutzky goes topless briefly; and Jennifer Hart shows off her tit right <br /> <br /> My Note: D
