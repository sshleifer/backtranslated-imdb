I've been watching horror movies since I was 5 years old, starting with Childs Play. Since then, I've seen good horror movies and bad, but that's undoubtedly the DUMBEST movie I've seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The plot was just stupid. Plus it was just all gore. I can take a lot of blood, but that was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a character is stabbed in the back end and suffocated with his intestines! Simple stupid! Another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end of it is just stupid. But then again, go with the rest! In the end, when the girl walks away from the cannibal / ancestor, she gets help from an old lady. The old lady is making tea, but when she turns to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! She turned into a cannibal! Movie delayed.
