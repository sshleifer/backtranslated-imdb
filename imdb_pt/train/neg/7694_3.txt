Unless you're twelve, this movie really is not worth it. It's obviously a low-budget movie with actors B, and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that is not good. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I like to laugh at bad movies. I did not know how bad though. It is bearable until after hour 2, so it really starts to burn. Fight styles range from the normal fights that obey the laws of physics and wire fights. There is no real explanation for the transitions. It has a plot, but again, it's obviously a children's movie. It seems that there are explicit moral lessons of the day being broadcast, like Sesame Street or something. It is bearable. But much better if you are, say, nine.
