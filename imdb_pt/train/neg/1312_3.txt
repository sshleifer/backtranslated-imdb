Tom is listening to one of those old radio broadcasts, something that kids from the 1950s to today watched on TV. However, they did not do television when this design was made, so people got their entertainment - from comedies to songs, to scary stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom is literally shaking in his boots hearing some story about the "ghost." He is literally doing everything the narrator is saying, like "standing hair, chills on his spine, his heart beats in his throat," etc. Jerry meanwhile is watching Tom and laughing at his ass. We'll get a taste of what we'll see for many years after this cartoon in which Jerry tortured Tom for no other reason than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's taking care of his own business and Jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abusing him, I have a hard time cheering on the "little boy." <br /> <br /> These initial efforts of T & M were also one minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes that minute makes a difference. He made it here like this really dragged on for some time. It could have been cut off for five minutes without missing anything, because the sketches continued for a long time. This is usual for Tom and Jerry. Usually, they are much faster.
