Let me be saying that I kept watching this video watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked like the greatest horror movie ever, even though I thought it was just reasonably good. Bleeding is very bad. The best part is seeing the naked female cast. The blood is very false and excessive. It has its funny parts but it is extremely predictable and I did not want to stay to see the horrible ending. If I could ban these actors and actresses, the only reason is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has been in over a hundred other videos and I have also seen two other cast members in the same or worse movies. They should not allow this madness to continue.
