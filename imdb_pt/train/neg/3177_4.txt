I have to admit that Over Your Dead Body was not really as bad as I was expecting, my mother wanted to see, so I rented. I imagined just going ahead and seeing the horror before my eyes, but in truth this was not so bad. I was just waiting for this horrible movie, but it seems the writers did not do any harm, but the cast of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry), she seems a bit off set for the movie. I think I thought it would be a little better without her, but she irritates me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the movie a bit enjoyable. But you have to admit, there was no point for this movie, it was one of those quick payouts for the actor's kind of thing. The movie could have been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast. <br /> <br /> Henry lost his bride to be, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on the day of the wedding. But when his sister takes him to a paranormal, Ashley, Henry falls in love with her, but Kate is haunting her beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to go forward so fast and she'll make sure that Ashley will not torture her day and night with her outings, believe me, in Kate's voice, that's scary. <br /> <br /> Over Your Dead Body is a sure movie, not sure if it's worth it, but I'd give it a rental if you want to see it or it's curious. Eva Longoria simply does not have enough star power to make the movie work, no offense to those who love her, she only belongs on the small screen on the silver screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, she does not seem to be so friendly with anything she pulls, or her "gay" friend, Dan, again, not very friendly. Just with some rewrite and proper attention, this movie could have been better, but instead we have the average predictable romantic comedy that will come out with an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
