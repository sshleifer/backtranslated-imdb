This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. <br /> <br /> Television went out of my life in 1981, so I've never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting seems to have for most critics. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler warning) <br /> <br /> The Moonlighting pilot is his basic yarn "cave man meets fluffball", where a charming "red-blooded man" manipulates a wrong woman. in realizing what she really wants and needs. The premises on which the script is based may have become obsolete by 1950. It also contains some downright bad writings, such as the scene in which Maddie destroys the furniture rather than shoot the villain strictly to prove he is inept. woman who needs male help. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Faludi reacts exaggeratedly to seeing a chauvinistic conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I am all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped upon it. <br /> <br /> In a sense, however, this DVD is a must for all serious fans of Bruce Willis: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that got the work of Willis. Both features show the incredible extent that Willis's acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Rating (and I _am_ a fan of Bruce Willis): 2 out of 10
