** May contain spoilers ** A guy with a stupid Kong suit (the same one used in KING KONG VS. GODZILLA in 1962) provides much of the laffs in this much mocked monster movie. . Kong is resurrected on Mondo Island and helps the hero and other good guys this time around. The vampire-like villain is called Dr. Who - funny, he does not look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally plays with the pride and joy of Who, a giant robot monkey that looks like a bad metal sculpture of Magilla Gorilla. Like many of Honda's films, this may have had some merit before the American public got involved and added new images. The Rankin / Bass animation company had a hand in this mess. They should have joined top child programs like The Little Drummer Boy.
