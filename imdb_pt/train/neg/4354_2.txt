This show is horrible. without comedy, without plot without good characters. America you're blind give the prize to real shows. I hate this show along with 30 rock. Honestly I'm so glad they canceled this show. Thank you CBS. Keep two and a half men, hold Christine, keep commitment rules, keep as I know your mother, which is not really funny, but much funnier than that. This show is a steal from friends. with the same director, that's fine. but keep this show lost and never bring it back. never ever the only reason I did not give it a 1 note is because it keeps my state awake instead of sleeping. these are the types of movies or TV shows that I give one. The only reason I was still awake was because of the audience's laughter and I was looking forward to the next show. I really wish this show was funny, sorry, but my stupid opinion. very stupid. I do not see why everyone loves it. my opinion again. but I also find the theory of the big bang a bit stupid. my clever evil. the class, bye, bye now, I have a smile and it's not to watch your show.
