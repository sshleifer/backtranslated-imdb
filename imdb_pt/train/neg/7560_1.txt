How this movie can miss so many fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original film is truly remarkable. An incredibly thin and uncompromising storyline, deep ankle characterization / motivation, and a really awful soundtrack (replacing tension with vast noise tracks, replacing the archaic musical references of the original with digitized flaws and roars. are just "stuck" on the cracks ... Terrible In a world where Amerikan, brainless and brain dead, remakes The Italian Job (a tear pops up), Get Carter (sobbing uncontrollably) and Alfie defiled our screens recently, This takes the proverbial cookie, execrable nonsense, as Ellen Burstyn has already gotten involved is a marvel ... Garbage.
