I had absolutely nothing to do last weekend, and I accompanied my friends to check out a movie ... any movie. And since the only movie we did not see was Inspector Gadget, we decided to get into it. <br /> <br /> GREAT ERROR. This is a movie that can only attract kids. Oh, and it's not like I do not like movies aimed at younger audiences. But this film had absolutely nothing to hold my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, go to sleep. Better than wasting money on it. Go check out the movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
