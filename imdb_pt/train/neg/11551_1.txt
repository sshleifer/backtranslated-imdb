Seriously, there's absolutely nothing good about this crap fest at all. Randolph Scott, an armed homosexual who has lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is more tedious and boring in the less important role. At age 57 he was clearly too old for these romantic roles, though it does not matter so much here, because Gail Russell seems much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly because of her chronic alcoholism and smoking chain. Lee Marvin plays his usual villain role, but it is not enough to save this crap. Thank God, they do not make western movies any more, they are old-fashioned, racist films that fascinate weapons and murders. <br /> 0/10.
