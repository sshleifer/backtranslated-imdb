Each generation fully believes that it is living in the end times. This has been true for thousands of years now. And movies like that feed on that. How did they get the great Orson Welles to narrate this train accident? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. He tries to connect the prophecies as well as possible to what was happening in the days when they were made, making it obviously dated and half silly. <br /> <br /> Scenarios seem to be outside of "Unresolved Mysteries". <br /> <br /> In short, the film is dated, silly, reactionary and useless.Well, if you want a good laugh, but not good enough to really look for.
