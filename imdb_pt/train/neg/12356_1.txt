Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to go out in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I do not know what Ridley Scott wanted, but I learned that in the army women are as stupid as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight in combat, and this is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And anyway, what the hell was that final scene in Libya? Are they still fighting Gaddafi or is it easy to believe that Islamic people are always a danger?
