Jump Mission: Galactica and watch the original episodes of Living Legend. The network took parts 1 and 2 of Living Legend and put them in a single plot with the horrific episode of Fire In Space. Although Galactica has suffered from networked writing and the lack of time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space alone is one of the worst episodes . As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek and then the Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between networked science fiction and distributed science fiction.
