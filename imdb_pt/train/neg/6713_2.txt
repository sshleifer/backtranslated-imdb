But this movie was annoying. The story part was fine but the musical part was not. Not a song I cared about and no soundtrack to be heard. <br /> <br /> If Sweet Jesus "were supposed to be a comic relief, it would never work. If John Adams were the nasty and annoying, the rest they were trying to knock him out in every scene. Hancock and Jefferson were the only characters bearable throughout the film. Historical quotations and the debate about slavery in its history The context was interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical. <br /> <br /> You should not hum the songs after a musical, except for a few chirps, nothing more was worth it.
