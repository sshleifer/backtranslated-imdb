I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not close to low enough. I honestly could not tell what genre this movie was, and if it was a comedy, the mood was completely forgotten. The plot was non-existent and the performance was horrendous. My friends and I were able to watch about 30 to 40 minutes of this movie before turning it off and promptly begged the video store to remove it. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you're purposely trying to watch the worst movies of all time. I honestly do not know how this movie lasted more than a day in theaters and besides, I can not understand why anyone would watch it, considering not only the uninteresting title but also the lack of famous actors in the cast. This review is not a joke and I honestly think this could be the worst movie ever made. It's certainly the worst movie I've ever had to go through.
