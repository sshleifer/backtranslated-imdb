"The Fox and the Child" is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary "March of the Penguins." He focuses around a young girl (beautifully played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and his flourishing friendship with a fox. <br /> <br /> There are some truly fascinating moments here; badgers, a lynx chasing the fox through a snow-covered forest; a particular scene when the fox is being plagued by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even scary at times. However, there simply is not enough of them. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed; the cinematography is stunning. The kind of bubbly look in the movie is wonderful. It is undeniably a very exuberant production. <br /> <br /> The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but the little dialogue that already exists was very poorly dubbed. The score is also very sweet, or at least it is to my liking; and the script, though subtle, apparently jumps from one scene to another, leaving me almost perplexed. <br /> <br /> Although there is good morality in the heart of the film, and Noël-Bruneau's rather quiet performance is beautiful, the real star is the fox. These captivating moments, focused exclusively around our furry friend, are tremendous. However, again, there simply is not enough of them. <br /> <br /> - To keep up to date on the latest in movie news, including reviews, news, discussions and more, be sure to visit www.mybluray.com. com
