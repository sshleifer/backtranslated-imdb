Honestly, I was disappointed with "Expiration Date". Super clever title and interesting premise, but I do not think delivered. What was this? The main character's desire to reconnect with his native roots? Or, more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. But, he was not raised as someone who lived his life in fear - it seems his life was going well, but since the Last Judgment is approaching, he must now begin to worry. I did not buy. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film did not seem to have needs that blended into one comprehensive story. They were all doing their thing, running parallel to the main character. Also, what was treated as a "curse" seemed more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Because? When? Finally, why did not he plan to stay in his apartment all day on his birthday? Those are my criticisms, but I loved the Seattle scenes, the cinematography was beautiful, acting was good in times when it was not great.
