Saw last night at the Midnight Slam of the Monde Film Festival in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie is clearly rated by the fans of IMDb. The performance was only more regular. The direction did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot lacks pretty: the movie is all about the college graduates and the game they do by jogging (7eventy 5ive). And in addition, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like jogging and a slasher with an ax that makes you jump only once or twice throughout the movie, you may like it. If you do not, this movie is not worth it.
