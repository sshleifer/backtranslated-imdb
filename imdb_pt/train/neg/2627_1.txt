This bomb is just an 'explosion' after another, without humor and just absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of its strengths. I gave him a 1 out of 10. I would have made a zero, but that option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But then sometimes we all need to have money. And I still retreat with that farce of Tim Burton on Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that he was a turkey. But if that was a turkey, this movie is not even a gizzard. I wish I could say, "Give me back my money." You can bet I would if I could. But that's the problem with premium services, the variety of signatures.
