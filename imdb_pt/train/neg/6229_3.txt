First of all, let's put some things directly here: a) I'm an anime fan - it's always been in fact (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer all the time in preschool). b) I like several B movies because they are hilarious. c) I really like the Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> Continuing, when the movie first appears, it looks like it will be your typical B movie, up to the FX, but all a sudden BOOM! the anime comes! This is when the WWWAAAAAYYYYY movie goes downhill. <br /> <br /> The animation is very bad and cheap, even worse than I remember SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie that I "vividly" remember is when a lot of kids run out of a school ... and it's the same kids again and again! The FXs are terrible too; dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. Also, the transition to live action for the animation is disorganized, the dialogue and voices (especially the English dub I saw) were awful and I was begging my dad to take the tape off the DVD / VHS; The only thing that kept me alive was jokes and comments like the robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to enjoy this movie and survive at the same time. <br /> <br /> Heck, I'm planning to show this to another otaku my friend on Halloween for a B Movie Night. Because it's stupid, very painful to watch and unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I'm giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement over the 0.5 / 10 that I was originally going to give it to. As much fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will be as much fun as count to 15).
