I really hope the Concorde / New Horizons are not trying to make a serious horror or even an action movie when they created Carnosaur 3. The movie is completely silly from start to finish. Even the humor in C3 is funny because it's bad. Definitely a highlight in the genre "So Bad is Good". If you like the worst of the worst, this is for you.
