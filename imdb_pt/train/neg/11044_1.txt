Shown in Australia as a 'Hydrosphere', this incredibly bad movie is so bad you get hypnotized and have to watch it until the end, just to see if it can get worse ... and it happens! The plot is so predictable that it seems written by a high school theater class, the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures, and the acting is made of wood. <br /> <br /> The kids' muppet seems to have been stolen from the Total Recall props wardrobe. There did not seem to be a single original idea throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I found this movie so bad that I laughed most of the time. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should be ashamed. He obviously needed the money!
