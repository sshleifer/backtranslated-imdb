Spike Lee has been in decline since his early successes and this mess does not help at all. I looked at my watch often, hoping the movie would end or get to the point. Lee's first film with an all-white cast is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? That Italians swear and enjoy funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I would go to a Scorsese movie. The incredibly lame godfather character only adds to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admired several of Lee's films, especially "Do the Right Thing." This movie is a waste of time.
