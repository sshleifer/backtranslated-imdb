Someone really gave this movie 2 stars. There is a very good chance that they will need immediate professional help, since anyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if you can not reward any stars is literally scary. <br /> <br /> This movie is ... well ... I think it's pretty much a kind of attempt at a horrible pornographic / pornographic film without pornography or without really horrible pieces (apart from acting, plot, story , sets, dialogs and sounds). I mistakenly assumed it was about zombies. <br /> <br /> Watching is really very scary in fairness; you're terrified that someone will come and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll walk away thinking you're a freak watching home amateur torture videos or something. <br /> <br /> I am so surprised that I am writing this comment on my cell phone so I do not forget to try to lower the rating beyond the current 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I have ever seen and can say (with the hand in the heart) that never, will never be surpassed.
