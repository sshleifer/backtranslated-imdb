Let's start with the simple lines. On the viewer's side, there are some good "director details", some points of view in the movie scenes that are cool. The special effects are good enough, good acting / good scenery too. But the story is very simple. It shows how an elite army bombing unit lives, acts and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of living in war. In my cinematic experience as a serious action movie "junkie", I lost that click that made my eyes and my mind get stuck on the screen. One of the things that need to be present in a movie to consider it a good one is the ability to immerse the viewer in the reality and the time of the movie. That did not happen to me. I became "conscious" throughout the movie. Honestly speaking, I think this movie has gained its place in fame based on the "subconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not proper use as a film fame. More than a film about war, its popularity grows from that. <br /> <br /> A simple thought: if this were a WWII movie or me, just changing the time, with everything remaining the same, would it be this award winning? Of course not. Because? Because there are great ones that raise the bar level up. <br /> <br /> Compared to its rivals at the Oscars, I do not think that all the prizes they have won are correctly awarded.
