The basic plot in this movie is not bad. A lady makes great and returns to her alma mater to be adored. But despite good acting from Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. The guilt for this I put in Joan Crawford, the director or both, since her performance is horrible. Instead of being a real person, she does a wonderful imitation of a deer stuck in the headlights. In other words, she looks into space and has an expression of "I'm afraid to cry". After a few minutes, it really got annoying for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford movie I do not like for her performance since she did more than her share of overacting - in films like JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films like BERSERK! My advice is to try a different Crawford movie - certainly there was better.
