I am an incorrigible and agnostic skeptic and was therefore hoping to enjoy this movie. After watching it, however, I honestly believe I could have made a better documentary. His arguments seem to have only four spurious sources (though he is listed in IMDb credits that I have not seen Richard Dawkins anywhere), is roughly edited with ridiculously computer-loving effects, and does not even make the slightest attempt to appear impartial . The narration is permeated with a sarcastic and almost adolescent anti-Christian sentiment, ruining any possibility that the film really changes someone's mind instead of just preaching to the chorus (ie to me). Although there is some interesting discussion about the historicity of Jesus, the film hits an unbearable hurdle when it begins to strongly emphasize the Christian school the principal attended as a child, an institution that apparently assaulted him psychologically as he obsesses with it. Although the TGWWT obviously had a low budget, there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent commentary on the highly questionable roots of Christianity. There is certainly a dearth of religious documentaries of skepticism on the market, and this film could have helped fill the void. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with that piece of junk, which in the end seems to be some kind of therapeutic exercise for him. It is a pity that his Christian upbringing has traumatized him, but he does not need to subject an audience to his coping mechanism.
