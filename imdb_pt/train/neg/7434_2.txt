If this is based on the real-life relationship, as it is supposed to be, between Mrs. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I am excited to not meet them in person. This is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills throughout the movie while the theme song is played on the floor. Many stupid scenes with people who act stupidly do not contribute to a comedy.
