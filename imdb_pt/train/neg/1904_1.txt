=== smaller spoilers === <br /> <br /> I am, like many others, a big fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters up front, and the trailer coming up before MI: 2, expectations were rising. A production of Jerry Bruckheimer. Big cars. Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar - Angelina Jolie. What can go wrong? Very. <br /> <br /> The script is not funny (which is really hard to be) or exciting. You put on a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa !! Do you have comedy? I think not. Excitement is totally out of the question. First of all (and this is probably said many times) there are no friendly characters, so who cares who is dead? If you can tolerate the premise that a psychopath will kill Nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) is walking with Nic on the streets again. Is this excitement? I think not. Then comes the best part, the romance between Nic and Angelina. She really seems bored having to say all those stupid lines to Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see anyone?" "What went wrong?" etc. <br /> <br /> So, there's only one glimmer of hope left: the car chases. They are disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there is only one. A very long, stuck in camera shaking annoyingly shaken. I really had trouble following the action. <br /> <br /> So it's an action movie? a suspense? a romantic comedy? - no need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. I will give 3 out of 10 stars and feel that I am being generous.
