There's a big difference between casting an original movie, intense, extravagant, scary and festive, and doing as filmmaker Eli Roth and his team did with "Cabin Fever" and simply acted like it. The film follows five college students in a log cabin that begins to prove fatal when one after another succumbs to this mysterious, fast-moving, carnivorous disease. It does not take long for friends to turn against each other, and can barely stand the sight of each other, much less want to be in the same neighborhood as them. Rough as it may seem, there is a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that might have worked in the hands of a less arrogant filmmaker. Unfortunately what we have are poorly designed characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at first to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting, a banal script so desecrating that leaves the viewer tuning in the dialogue, and various incomprehensible programs. subplots that motivate little more than (in one instance) an appearance on the screen of director Roth. This is sloppy work in many ways! Avoid this time devourer.
