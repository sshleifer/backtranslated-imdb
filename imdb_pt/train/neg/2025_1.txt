My wife and I are kind of entertained by Howie Mandel's show ... I also like Shatner - even when he's the most pathetic ... But this is absolutely the worst show on television. <br /> Please cancel this show. It sucks. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothes than Deal or No Deal ... <br /> /> The questions are a mix of very easy and incredibly obscure way. And watching Shatner or the competitor say "Show me the money" makes me want to vomit ... <br /> <br /> That will not last.
