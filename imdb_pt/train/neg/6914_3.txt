I watched this movie for a while (while working on a movie production trailer) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is, at best, mediocre, Hopkins calls his performance (but still takes Hewitt out of his scenes together) and Alec seems bored. Trust me on this: you should avoid this movie as if it were a plague. It seems to last forever as the tired plot unfolds in the rhythm of a snail. It is relentlessly bland, cinematography is poor and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin must go to film school if he intends to drive again. In terms of his acting, his character is totally unpleasant, which makes it impossible to cheer for him. Dan Ackroyd is very funny and the jury's startling composition near the end of the film is cute, but this movie is just awful.
