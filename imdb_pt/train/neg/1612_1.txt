It is incredible that, with all the countless crimes that have been discovered and placed unequivocally at the gates of Marxism, the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago, the Cultural Revolution and the Khmer Rouge, there are still admirers of communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and there are still doing propaganda in their favor. It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In this particular movie, a psychotic killer is glorified. Needless to say, neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. The fact that both the director and the actor wait for the audience to pass through this seemingly endless propaganda film demonstrates the tunnel vision they have for their object of worship.
