After being a big fan of Stella Street's ten TV episodes, I looked forward to this movie with enthusiasm and anticipation. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was appalled by the way almost all jokes and pamphlets were taken directly from TV episodes and broadcast with far less enthusiasm and comedic timing. if the actors had said them once and did not bother to say them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt cheated for having separated myself from my hard-earned money to watch the same jokes again. The plot of the film begins with Stella Street (a normal English street in Surrey), gradually being populated by "some of the most famous people on the stage and screen of the last forty years," including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities on the street end up being thrown out of their luck by a local fraudster, and forced to live as vagabonds and ordinary working class people. There are some good times, but overall, writers get an interesting idea and make it pretty boring. * END OF SPOILERS * In TV episodes, all characters are played by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. Her imitations were not funny, and it seemed that her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do. <br /> <br /> If you were not a fan of the Stella Street episodes, you might find this movie entertaining. But if you were a fan, I think you can walk away feeling a bit cheated. 4/10
