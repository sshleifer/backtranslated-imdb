Richard Tyler is a little boy who is afraid of everything. He does not like to ride a bike or climb into his treehouse because he knows what kind of accidents can happen to him. Then one day he is riding a bicycle and because it is starting to rain, he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining. There the whole story happens. He tries out all kinds of people and in the end he is no longer afraid. But the whole story is unbelievable and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin have failed to make the story better than it is.
