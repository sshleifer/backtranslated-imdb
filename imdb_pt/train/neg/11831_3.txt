I do not understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and it does not matter how good (or bad) people are. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5,7). They are very fond of anything animated (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full and I was eager to see the movie with its superb cast. To tell you the truth, I was bored. It was unbelievably predictable and simply bland. There was some laughter throughout the movie and that was it. Of course they tried again and again to get the cheap laugh, but it just did not work out. My son almost always tells me he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not in it. My daughter fell asleep halfway. In addition, the children thought the character's animation seemed strange. I have not heard from them since I saw the Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the type that seeks the negative at all. But quality is quality and, like many animated films they throw out there, it has very little.
