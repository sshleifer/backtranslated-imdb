I was very pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy in services, director Stanley Donen, so far what is not to like? It's the kind of movie that makes me think of two things - when everyone involved (including some well-known names) realized that they had a turkey in their hands, and what's the worst of the conflicting aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the sinuous plot, ahead of the sometimes pretentious wordy script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of relationship between the characters. You have to add a very unequal performance to criticism, but it is understandable that the actors were struggling with these things and, in addition, they seemed under-tested. Often they can hardly get their speeches fast enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urban personality but sometimes seems uncomfortable and staccato in his delivery. I have to say, however, that I was relieved when the initial suggestions that his character will be paired with the indescribably vulgar Jayne Mansfield leave with the appearance of Suzy Parker. How's the movie? - for me, especially, the beauty of Parker, who also acts in moderation and a dignity like Grace Kelly. Overall, the film is good to see. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however, you should really be amazed at the horrible Fu Manchu tunics that they wear in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant can not look elegant in his. Back on the credit side, Ray Walston does a laudable job with his character, and for me there was an interest in hearing the pre-Hogan heroes Werner Klemperer speak without a supposed German accent!
