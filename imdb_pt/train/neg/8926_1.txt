I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it was first released in 1970. I was a 20-year-old healthy kid at the time who loved movies and really liked Rachel Welsh. Besides, I'd read Gore Vidal's novel on which it was based and I found it very funny. I saw the movie at a local drive-in and halfway through it I was extremely tempted to start the engine of my car so maybe I would die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of that wreck of a movie. He was not "intelligent" or "modern," he was rude and sloppy. All the actors were deaf and the director had no idea what he was doing. Mae West's cast was one of the worst cast choices in movie history. As one reviewer said here, his role had nothing to do with the movie or the book. His character in the book is sexually beaten by the young stallion, which he would never do for the legendary Mrs. West. Oh, no, the plot is changed, so she sexually slaps him, very credible of a 77-year-old woman who looks like every DIA of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a horrible movie. Bluto
