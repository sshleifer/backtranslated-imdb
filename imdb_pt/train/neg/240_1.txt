I never like to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I have to work hard. Talking about Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with extravagant wedding videos. Vivah is so tacky that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras behind. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment during the movie where I could say 'Oh! at least this thing is good '. Aloknath makes the clich√© in the role of the father of Girl, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster, besides ugly costumes, bad fantasies, banal plot, monstrous stepmother, actors difficult to be interpreted, cacophonic background music <br /> <br /> Now, the spoiler, I'm warning you that, as in all your other films, after a dire incident film ends on a happy note.
