Check out the movie's website, more time was put into doing this than writing the script for this movie. It could not be more in bragging. Original story? Original? They must have found the script hidden between the old testament, or face the legal repercussion for that piece of horn. High quality special effects? Come on, I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a jug of ear wax. Stylish Cinematography? Oh yes, America's most entertaining home video is still a classic. I'm sure they had little money available for this title, so of course the FC is not really that good, or a little bad from time to time, or just hilarious, but it's the story that makes this movie a waste of time and money. 4 stories in one and all brainless parts of before and already made.
