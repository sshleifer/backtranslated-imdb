Maybe you should not compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street has many original Hip Hop performers, but they obviously made it clear that this could be their big break, of course, to some, it was and that's cool. But if you see this as the original Hip Hop culture you are wrong. It is overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Instead, look for the first two movies I mentioned. They convey the aridity that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even accurate. This is probably because, although the story, acting, dialogues and direction are all terrible, music and dance are what people love about it. I love dancing, but at the time I thought electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so happy when, in mid-1986, a new generation of Hip Hop classical artists appeared, such as Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's , Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie, to name a few), and I still do not like most of the beats in this movie and that's why it does not work for me. I mean, Wild Style does not have much history, but the music is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and everything is fine. But as far as I'm concerned, this movie is rubbish except for the dance break and some of the songs and so I can not rate it higher than 4 out of 10.
