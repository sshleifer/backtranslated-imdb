the first Scanners may not have been a great movie, but at least it was original. There is no such novelty for this. The acting is worse, in my opinion, and the story is slower and nothing special. such as dialogue. and the special effects are no better than the original. This movie is less than the first in every way. The only thing different about this is that it is noisy and chaotic at times. Do not make a good movie. If they had done something better with the story and made it interesting, this could have been a decent movie. I really could not get through everything without moving fast. For me, this is a forgettable one. movie, and not much else. After all, there are worse movies. With generous humor, I'm going to give Scanners 2 to 4/10.
