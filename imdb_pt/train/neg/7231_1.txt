I saw this in an art cinema that also featured "Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin movies. Based on the quality of the other resources, I decided to give "Immortel" a try. I almost got out of this movie and I LIKE science fiction! The story is set in a futuristic New York City filled with Blade Runner-style ads and some similar cloning / synthetic human talk. Unfortunately, the screenplay was not condensed enough for a movie of one hour and forty-five minutes. There are three groups in this world: humans, artificial humans and Egyptian gods. Artificial humans seem to have the advantage and control the politics of the city. Humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu and complete with a decayed exterior, leaving a smooth "lid" on the pyramid.A floating futuristic pyramid would not be in perfect condition?). The pyramid stands above the city and no one on the ground understands what it is or why it is there. I will not bore you with the so-called plot, but there's a lot of unnecessary gore and lots of coarse scenes. The film, as I said, seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film, credits were listed as thanks to the UK, France, and Italy. The film is French, but uses British actors who do not speak French. So it is obvious that his dialogue in French was dubbed. This is a distraction, and I also thought that switching between real humans and animations was quite distracting. It does not help that the animations are bad - not better than a video game. Skip this one.
