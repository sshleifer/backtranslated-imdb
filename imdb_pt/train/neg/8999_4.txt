Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon and the SCTV alumni are all together in a sometimes funny cartoon film. <br /> <br /> However, it's very interesting to watch now, at the beginning of 2005. Twenty years after that movie Supposedly to happen, see how many of your jokes have become absolutely true: There's a simulated movie trailer, which probably nor was he clever at the time, for something called "The Pregnant Man," which came true with Arnold Schwarzenegger's donkey. "Junior" movie There is a commercial parody, probably not clever at the time, for something with Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrity Wrestling," which has now come true with a popular show called "Celebrity Boxing." There's a fake movie trailer, which probably was not even clever at the time, which shows John Candy in a movie about a severed head. Watch this trailer and see how the shots and the plot are similar to Frank Hellenlotter's Basket Case! And finally there's an announcement of a late-night documentary about "a dead dream, the only two left over ..." The name of the documentary is ... THE LAST HIPPIES! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies come true!
