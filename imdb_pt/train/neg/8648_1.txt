Well, basically, the movie blows! It's Blair Witch knows Sean Penn's ill-conceived fantasy about going to Iraq to show the world what the "War on Terror" really is. The script appears to have been written by an 8th grade student (no offense to 8th graders); the two main actors outnumber the entire film; they used the wrong type of camera and the wrong kind of movie (not that I know anything about these things - but they just did not look like actual documentaries I watched), and worst of all is that Christian Johnson had a great idea and did This sucks. It reminded me of the time I tried to take a picture of my dog ​​and I ended up with a very bad doll looking at something that looked more like giant dung. I'd rather watch the Blair VIII witch than sit through it again.
