Although there are many familiar names of "television" associated with "A Man Called Sled", there is nothing extraordinary about the movie itself or any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that sets him apart from a 60s-70s television series such as "The Rat Patrol" is a larger cast and much more violence. James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to get rid of all the light comedy stuff he was doing ("Maverick", "Support Your Local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter" etc. .). Unfortunately, his sympathy for the land works against him, since Sledge is a character without humor written to profit from the popularity of the western character of Clint Eastwood. But Eastwood's things were not so flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I suppose "A Man Called Sledge" can be classified as a spaghetti western, although the pace is too slow to really fit into that subgenre. Fans of the slow-paced "Combat" television series will feel an instant connection when Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Frank Kowalski. Play in some slow-mo shots and cross-dissolves, which draw attention to themselves rather than serving a storytelling purpose. <br /> <br /> The plot is the standard "big assault" thing (insert "The War Wagon" here) with Sledge planning how to steal a $ 300,000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while they are on the move, the cargo is guarded by 40 batters and while it is standing still, it is locked in a safe inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same plot. <br /> <br /> The story would give a decent hour of television, but it ages very fast like a padded feature film. Garner does not allow any of his charms to leak to his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to keep the viewer interested. <br /> <br /> The thing finally fails and burns right after the assault when the gang engages in an artificial and totally illogical card game. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
