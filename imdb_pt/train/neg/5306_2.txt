Okay, I'm blessed. I've seen two very strong stage productions, one in New York with the original cast, and one in the San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you're awesome!). Compared to any of these, the movie is almost impossible to display. I've been working on the DVD for the past two nights and I'm not done yet. Too strange dialogue, and waaay many added scenes and people. Yes, the four great performances are very good, esp. Ms. Streep. But comparing the stage to film is definitely an example of "less is more". The thickening of the piece to meet the need for cinematic variety and specificity was a poor choice. Please, please, please, find a stage production near you.
