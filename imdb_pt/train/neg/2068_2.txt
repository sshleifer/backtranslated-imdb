Lou's Gospel was a big disappointment to me. I got an email from the theater showing that it was a great inspirational movie. It was neither grand nor inspiring. Cinematography was very dubious with the whole movie. Many scenes were flash backs that were made in a way that could not tell at times what they were doing. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Also many of the people in the movie were much sought after. The relationship he has with his ex & son is never clarified. Also the whole movie has more of it in one direction, and then, suddenly, BAM, it's healed and inspiring people. The entire movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life the way he is living, but when he changes, he does not quit boxing, he teaches others how to box. Thumbs down.
