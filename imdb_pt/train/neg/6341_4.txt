The East Palace, West Palace, reminded me a bit of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra as the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I think, but it perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men too: it's made up of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The film focuses on an effeminate man who desperately wants to be dominated and bruised by a macho guy. He crosses the park without fear - he expects to be taken to the station by the officer. And this indeed happens. He then tells the officer his whole life story while undergoing light torture: made to crouch for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. That's what the gay man wants and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a virile man. The life story of the gay man (which includes flashbacks) is tolerable, but when he begins to describe ancient Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for the gays of China, who only want to play a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can not relate.
