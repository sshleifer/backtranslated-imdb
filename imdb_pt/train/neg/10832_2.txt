Usually I do not have a problem with free swearing in movies, but this really bothered me. All they did was swear. For the whole movie. (And, as anyone noticed, having cancer) It was boring, disconnected and pretentious. I would not take it if I were you. <br /> <br /> It's also not that I do not like movies that, like most people they like, will claim to 'watch life'. I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and all that happens is that a load of Taiwanese people take their lives. But I could relate to them. I've never met anyone who has sworn as much as the 'actors' in this movie, and I used to work at a construction site. Then go figure. Having said that William H. Macy made me smile. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, unless you enjoy boredom.
