Snow White, who just left in Locarno, where I had the chance to see her, of course refers to the famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coke. In the end, the real snow of the Swiss Alps also plays its part. <br /> <br /> So the three aspects of the title are covered in this film. There's a lot of drugs on the scene, and there's also a pale girl with dark hair - with a prince who has to go through all sorts of trouble to come to her rescue. <br /> <br /> But: it's not a fairy tale. It is supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the Tagline). <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is almost perfect. Unfortunately a weak plot, predictable dialogues, an almost unreal scenario and mixed acting do not add up to create authenticity. Thus, as a spectator, I remained untouched. <br /> <br /> And there were the cliches that drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled daughter of the upper class - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love because they were so busy all the time. His best girlfriend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a metallurgist and a housewife) live in a tiny, poor and happy apartment - and ignorant of the desperate situation in which their daughter is. The good boy (= prince) is a musician (!) Of the French-speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered the economically less successful but emotionally adjusted fraction of the country). He has problems with his parents. They are migrants from Spain, who do not seem to accept their wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And so it goes Naturally, the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers are ruthless, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, although a woman (!), has only his career in mind when exposes Snow White in artistic pornographic photos at a show This review does not need a spoiler to allow you to add these pieces to an obvious plot. As I like other Samir movies, for example "Forget Baghdad", I was quite disappointed. Let's wait for the next one.
