This is the story of two guys who found a copy of "Funky Monkey". Finding out this seemed odd at the time, imagining that there were still posters for the movie at the local Odeon Cineplex. After seeing classics like 'Every Which Way But Loose' and 'Project X', these two guys imagined that monkey movies are amazing. <br /> <br /> These guys took a long walk while watching this movie. There was some monkey that was replaced by a MAN stuntman when action sequences were needed. It was apparent that the monkey was not trained at Shakespearean acting school. Perhaps replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck might have helped the guys think. <br /> <br /> Maybe a strong helper would help like a Jackie Chan or even Hulk Hogan. Luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and Jet-Look resembling Matthew Modine. While some might argue that Matthew Modine does not come close to Jet Li, the camera tricks prove he's as good as. When it becomes obvious that an untrained chimpanzee can not handle the film, the film relies on Matthew Modine to be the true star. <br /> <br /> I mentioned that there are some idiot boy who develops a bond with Modine. and the monkey Is there a chance that the kid will learn confidence and even get a girl in that movie? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous of that (because using the pick-up line "I am the second violin of a monkey" does not seem to work with women). <br /> <br /> Shortly after seeing this film the two guys received a phone call from Matthew Modine saying 'Seven Days'.
