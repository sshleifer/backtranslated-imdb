At what point do we live when someone like this Joe Swan - whatever it is, is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker! Where are the new shoots of filmmakers with brains and talent? We need them bad, and to hell with mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This movie is about nothing, just as the characters in the movie represent nothing. It's this horrible call Gen Y, full of bored idiots, some of whom declare without bothering to learn anything about the ship before filming. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Current films like these show how stupid young people, so-called "filmmakers" can be when they believe they go out without a script, without direction, without thinking, without a legitimate "camera job" (all filmed horribly DV), no editing job, without anything, means "rebel" or "advanced" film. No, this is called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of the movies (and there is actually a "shooting shootout", so be ready). See the first films of any "indie" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog ... none of them made it so tedious and aimless as that, yet Swan - whatever it is, still goes to SXSW every year and is acclaimed as some sort of brave new talent. It's crap! I can not imagine anyone liking this, and everything else this so-called filmmaker did (seen by me) is so bad (the newest things clearly made to appeal to a more mainstream audience, one of the so-called sitcoms). Avoid, unless you are a friend or family member ... thinking twice, whether you are a family member or a friend, would probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations. . <br /> <br /> Total garbage. This is not art. This is the last opposite of this.
