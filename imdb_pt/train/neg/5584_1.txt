Do We Really Need More Narcissistic Garbage in the Baby Boomer Generation? Technically, I am a Boomer, although at the time when all the "idealistic youngsters" of the 1960s were reading Marx, burning their drafts and generally prolonging a war that had destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still at school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just stupid fools, who would believe anything since it was destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another self-importance exercise of children that has never really grown.
