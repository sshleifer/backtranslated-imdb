Unfortunately, this is not the best British film in the hellraiser series, although the DVD cover says so, which is what led me to buy it. It is, however, a tribute to many of the great horrors of the old films, especially the stable Amicus. <br /> <br /> Cradle ... is shot in mini DV, which, although we all know that it has more of a TV feel than a movie, can be done much better. Each scene, set and shot appears to have been lit in exactly the same way (standard key, fill, rear setting), which only increases the cheap appearance of the finished piece. The bloody content is frankly laughable. From the initial shots, where we see the rubber head of a man, obviously torn, through cheap hammers, the effects of the creature, and the terrible CG, there was nothing there that struck me. <br /> <br /> The acting is abominable, from the almost comatose detective to the brummie dwarf, via Dani Filth, the least convincing evil face of horror movies I have ever witnessed. Each of the substi tutions is more stereotyped than the previous one, and the ensembles get worse and worse as the movie is played. Stay tuned for 'Mental Asylum' - a Georgian semi-detached house with a bad sign outside, and the most bizarre (and not in a good way) padded cell I've seen. <br /> <br /> It took me four tries to get to the end of the movie without my attention wandering (no, run) away at any available opportunity. In fact, I found myself cleaning at one point while the movie was passing. <br /> <br /> However, it marks one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth's breasts, which I think is one (hum, two) things. You have to go for it. But once that's out of the way, it's all downhill. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I'd love to believe them, but on this test I'm not prone to. If you want a decent homage to Amicus, skip this and go to the special Christmas Gentlemen's League instead. <br /> <br /> Battling with Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of worst movie I have ever seen.
