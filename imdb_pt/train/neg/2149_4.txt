Well, the big money machine did it again! Disney, very shrewdly, takes advantage of idiots like me who feel we should own all the videos (good or bad) stamped with the Disney nickname. Why do I remain anxious for these "sequels" that make Don Bluth, on a bad day, look like Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three story lines (already a bad choice!) Does one of Disney's loveliest creations deserve at least a linear storyline? Of these three, only the latter comes close to the quality of animation and narrative I would expect. The music is atrocious and modern (that is, in two years it will be dated) and adds nothing to the story. Why does everything have to be updated? You know, the original design is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and faithful to the original with songs that reflect the same style? I can not wait for a continuation of Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky, we will have music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So Disney, if you're listening, remember that we are not all indiscriminate kids here. How about throwing a bone or two to the fans who've been around long enough to know the difference between crap and crap?
