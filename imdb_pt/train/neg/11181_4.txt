The film is about two stories: one is a political murder of one program girl, the other is a high-class political party. The point of passage is the character of public relations played by Al Paccino, since he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the night. <br /> <br /> If the script is terrible without decent dialogues and the direction zero Any sense of drama, Al's performance is memorable: how many comrades can be as convincing as a powerful and feared man (such as "The Godfather ") as a small servant (see also" Donnie Brasco "). /> <br /> In fact, the big young lion has become a tired old man. This years pass is very touching, because it makes the public think about getting older too. <br /> <br /> But its slowness is only a makeup, because it can recover its energy in the scene of the Church. <BR> It may be good that the movie is so bad because it put the light of the stars on Al's talent!
