First: I bought it at the store. Second: I watched. Third: it was annoying. Fourth: It was not funny. Fifth: Most of the tricks were lame. And last but not least: it's not just a bad movie, it's a total fiasco. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Adam Sandler, despite this disappointing and forgotten film. I'm sorry because it was your first movie. Even if you're a big fan of Adam Sandler, do not bother watching this movie. Instead, just take the video, board a yacht and throw it into the sea.
