bad acting, bad southern accents, inconsistent cinematography, horrible script ... <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this movie at a recent film festival and I was so discouraged after seeing it. It contains a quotation / unquote name talent, but they do not deliver. Of course the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story that is told. do not bother
