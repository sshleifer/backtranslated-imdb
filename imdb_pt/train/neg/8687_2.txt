When the Bush jokes are really easy to do, it's best that such a program be sure that it has something else. When this extra something is children's versions of political figures making jokes about the future that they do not yet have, it is simply absurd. Dick Cheney and George Bush are successful, but Dick Cheney grunts mainly. There is also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld, who is not really similar to Donald Rumsfeld. Democratic characters rarely give their names, so it's a mystery who can be who, besides Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. <br /> <br /> Episodes have coherent stories, but that is not enough to keep it from sinking.
