Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10. Worst acting ever. There's really no worse performance ever. David Hess (Last House on the Left ?? Not the seventies ??. Rent is really good) is the worst of the group (pretty tough competition, but he's unbelievably horrible.) One would be hard to find a movie participant in home with such a strange camera presence. The movie really makes a painful stop when it's on the screen. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie really does have some redeeming quality for Mr. Hess to ruin. It is filmed with a home cinema camera and by the looks of things, a very old and complete with a boom microphone. No post-production too. Come on it has to be a shovelware that a five year old computer could use to clean that image. Play bizarre footage of autopsy and aircraft carrier take-offs and this is a visually bolted image. Autopsy images are interposed in the same way that Italian cannibal films interpose those terrible killings of real-life animals. And the filming of the Navy is supposed to be some declaration against the war (because we know that all bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy). What in the world is the Lion Gate releasing that garbage? That would embarrass Troma. The plot is about the Zodiac Killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry ?? Not the seventies. Rent is very good.) Someone is shot in the stomach in Los Angeles and the cops assume that the Zodiac Killer is of return? Uh-huh What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book, not a psychiatric disorder, and where does the young killer look like a page from a congress and a closed congressman? Yes, hair cuts eighty and production values ​​find a Nambla subframe. Register me.
