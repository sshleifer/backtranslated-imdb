The main complaint with this movie is the fact that I can not tell who is who. No racism is intended, but these Asians all look the same! I can tell you a bit of the story, but that's as much as possible. The identities of the people are not a mystery, if they were a mystery, I would care for them. Instead, I was not off-screen as fast as I could. <br /> <br /> Tons of large scenes and silent faces without emotion occupy this film. Heck is annoying, not only do I not know these people, but they are just sitting there. <br /> <br /> The production is typical Chinese John Woo, terrible video with stained scenes. That sounds just a little better than Andy Lau's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a great movie). You would think that on a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90 years of Hollywood. I did not know that the Chinese had these beatniks of art.
