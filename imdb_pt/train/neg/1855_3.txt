This is the most horrible movie I've ever seen, but in all fairness it's watchable and pretty funny. I do not think the filmmakers wanted it to be their typical blockbuster Hollywood quality. It's just a stupid movie about a serial killer that gets soaked in a toxic waste load, causing a reaction with it and snow (like in the middle of winter). It then turns into a killer snowman that is enough to make you laugh alone. This movie is really stupid, but it's funny. The killings are hilarious. I would not advise you to go and buy it (like I did - the cover looked good!), But if it happens to be on TV one night and you're ready to laugh, then continue.
