To be honest, this movie is another in a series of big disappointments ... most of these so-called "horror masters" are just awful in terms of their insignificant effects and laughable stories ... plus Ron Perlman, all others in this movie can not act to save their lives ... the shots sounded as if someone was playing Bop it under the boom microphone or something, and it seemed completely unrealistic ... overall, this movie is just as scary as Home Alone ... the only good masters are Cigarette Burns, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they ruined the same genre that some of them really understood. .
