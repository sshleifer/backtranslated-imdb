Well, I finally saw that. I did not go when I first went out because, well, frankly, I was scared. Fear of how bad it can be, or how disappointing. Although not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it was not particularly memorable or satisfying. <br /> <br /> I was 11 when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the screening of opening to the final credits, it was a cinematic experience that I will never forget. A timeless story of the bored farmer who only knows he was for the most, saving the Princess and the Galaxy from the evil threat while being guided by the wise wizard, cheating pirate, and comic relief - all in one space - That is not punishing Luke for use an old formula. It's an old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, it gave him new twists that made him very special. <br /> <br /> Then came the Empire and history became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness came on the scene and we learned one of the greatest twists of all time. The great villain, Vader, was Luke's father. Wow, no one saw this coming. Of course, I'm convinced Lucas did not appear in the script either. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really matches. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is a fun movie - tremendous effects, lots of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie still lives or dies in its plot - the story it's telling. Oh certainly a very good acting can save a weak plot but a weak plot along with bad acting - this is a burden no director can overcome, certainly not as bad as I am forced to realize George Lucas is (Man has have managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers of some very good actors - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * The plot. Oh my. Understand, he's already harmed by what happened in the first two films, so it's an incredible burden. Too much for him to overcome. <br /> <br /> First we have the absurdity of the fund. We have Anakin being found as a child in Tatooine, the product of a virgin miraculous birth - the "chosen." Well, this detail is never explained remotely. In fact, the closest explanation is Yoda's remark that maybe they were wrong. Well, all right then. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now this same prodigy ends up being the creator of the C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And he will return to Tatooine and never know that he was from there? Wow!! What about this? Testing the old voluntary suspension of disbelief, eh, George? Anyway, we have this bratty, sullen, petulant, whiny kid who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinematic history - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - the good guy who falls for free, only to finally get redemption in the end. <br /> <br /> How, please tell, does it happen? Now, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, of course, he lives in a civilization that treats gravity as we treat gasoline, but it happens to be "dark" to maybe check with a doctor, maybe just maybe, this futuristic society can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think about is go kill some kids because the villain who is at the root of all the evil that is chasing after two movies tells him that he has the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> How can Luke expect us to see this foolishness and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place? I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was bad, but because he was pathetically stupid. <br /> <br /> Ah, by the way, Amidala finally dies. I'm not giving birth. Because? Well, they do not know. The doctor, who is an android and is itself indicative of the incredibly high technology for which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion that "she has lost the will to live." Well, oh, okay, of course she does. Maybe she finally realized how much she was asleep. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all of this. He knows the birth of Luke and Leia. You know who your father is, and you know what happens to them. You also know the role of R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, when Luke approaches masculinity and appears with 3PO and R2 (curiously, the mind of 3PO is erased, but not R2 - why ????) stating "I think these droids belong to you, "Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was built by the one he believed to be" the chosen one "and apprentice to the emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this same planet, says" strange, I do not remember of owning any droids. " Oh good suffering. <br /> Lucas simply did this as he went along. Once he introduced VAder as Luke's father, unfortunately, the story began to get out of control because HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THE HISTORY WAS. The plot of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine made any rational sense at all. And none of this is linked to the story he originally told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's a belated reflection, and it seems. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a high rating. . This reminds me of Triple X. A fun-to-watch movie, but totally forgettable. Star Wars will stay in my mind forever. Fortunately, this and the two that precede it will soon disappear.
