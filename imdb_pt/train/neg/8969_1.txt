The plot offers no new excitement, even the same as Cube I. This time there are no other improvements to the cube machinery, except for having an extra exit, which is not protected, very ingenious. The characters are also not as elaborate as in the first episode, they just became "boring" as in a novel. If someone gets to the normal exit, the person might ask some questions, like "do you believe in god?", is not really creative or original and, especially in my opinion, does not fit into the mystery of cube with traps. There really is nothing more to say about it.
