How can a major German TV station convey such a mess? It's amazing how the main actors avoid all the acting talents - even the well-known Gottfried John is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - as amateurish .......! The screen plan is very, very extended - maybe to fill two parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! The assembly is obviously a blue screen, e.g. the scenes on the ship with the unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version, the sound and dubbing are very bad - probably reason: different languages ​​of actors - but: other international productions deal with this in a much more professional way. Advice: DO NOT watch - it's a devilish waste of time!
