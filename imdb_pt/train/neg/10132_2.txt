STAR NOTE: ***** Saturday night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning The US military has just launch a large stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other. A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals and conspires for the US government to bail him out. So they are forced to send their best man, John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him in exchange for his freedom from a detention center where his mind would be erased from all the incriminating information he has learned over the years. years. <br /> <br /> I skipped Attack Force because I could tell by the cover and all the post-production tampering that occurred that would suck and when all the negative reviews and low user ratings appeared, just confirmed what I I thought. But I decided to give FOF a try because Shadow Man (the same director) was not bad and, what the hell, Seagal was my favorite action star once and maybe, just maybe, he could make a great movie again. Oh, what an idiot I was. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, horrendous images of aerial stealth jet fighters, horrible camera work, cheap production values, risible, unconvincing fighting scenes that have become the hallmark of Seagal and a boring induction that is not going anywhere Fortunately his upcoming film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'm about to skip), apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, which means no more of those terrible action movies with lenses and his upcoming film Prince of Pistols may mark a return to theaters. Hell, he did this before, and Stallone would have done it before him (Rocky Balboa). <br /> <br /> This is not a flight of fury. It's not even a fun escape. It's a flight that can not even take off. *
