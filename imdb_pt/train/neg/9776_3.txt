I do not know much about filming, but good movies have to tell a kind of story ... your characters have to start and complete their journey. In Last Exit to Brooklyn they can, but it is by no means satisfactory, and I am not meaning a happy ending, just ANY final. <br /> <br /> The Last Exit to Brooklyn, set in 1952 in Brooklyn during much brutal work strike, defines a number of topics in moving history. Most involve some of the most enviable characters who have ever been on a movie screen. But the Last Exit for Brooklyn does not take these stories to any conclusion ... leaves some of them hanging endless, or explodes in some bizarre stratosphere for an "artistic" ending. <br /> <br /> Two cases at the point, and they contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> A sad travesty character (an important character in the film), is hit by a car and killed. And that's for him in the movie ... he's gone forever, erased from everyone's memory ... there's no reaction from his friends, enemies, lovers ... nothing. On another topic A stupid, ignorant and secretly gay striking leader, having been rejected for work, his gay lover and discovered by the neighborhood thugs, is trampled underfoot by the bad guys. The final scene of the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the street lights are very, very similar to the Nazi concentration camps ... and the scene drags on and on ... and the camera moves to the body of the labor leader, and he was crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course that's it for him too ... the erasure of the brain ... over. <br /> <br /> In short ... no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this movie ... This movie is a depressing piece of mud. Avoid this. And if you're not warned, you really deserve an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional, and sexual brutality ... and do not let teens watch.
