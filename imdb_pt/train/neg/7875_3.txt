Les Visiteurs, the first movie about travelers from medieval times was really funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and, of course, a simple absurdity that would remind a little of Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors largely and the same time travel. The plot changes a bit, since the characters must now be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down the story without paying attention to the fact that it is getting more and more absurd as you advance in the film. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep everything together, but his character has been emptied, so there is not much he can do to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Now, the slave of the duke / helper, he really has all the attention. The movie is just about him and his being clumsy / boring / stupid or what he should be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter of the audience, but he can not. It's as if someone is telling you a very, very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling this joke to the end, adding details, to make your suffering a little more. <br /> <br /> If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you did not like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider seeing the sequence. If you liked this sequel ... well, I suppose you still need to watch a lot of movies.
