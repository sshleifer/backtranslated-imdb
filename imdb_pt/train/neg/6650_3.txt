I think this would be a much better movie if the Cajuns had been portrayed in a more believable light. My family is from southeast Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I've never heard the people I grew up talking about like these people did. The Cajuns were portrayed as backward caipiras. Most of the cajuns I know are well educated, proud, and unpolite people when they talk the way these people did. All in all it was an OK movie, with great scenery and music. I understand the writers were from Lake Charles, and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things Cajun, please make the actors study the language, live among the people you are portraying and understand all about how they are before you try to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are that person, it's a much nicer movie!
