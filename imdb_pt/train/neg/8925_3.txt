I've never really liked Myra's movie, so I appreciate how this pushed the Hollywood envelope back then. Certainly Miss Welch's fantasy has become an iconic image, though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image actually saw the film and know what it was - I saw Myra at FMC one years ago and did not think it had aged any better over the years. There is a segment on this in the cartoon history of Sexploitation Cinema's cartoon history, where due credit is given for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production. However, IMHO, the film is too bitter to be charming, too silly to be an excitement, and so busy trying to shock you do not inform, engage, or entertain ---
