This is a real bomb. We must believe that Merle Oberon is the kidnapped daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to Tom DeLay of the 1930s that he deserves to be supported as presidential candidate. Poor Merle can not go anywhere, but she is surrounded by politicians and their croak, trembling wives and supported only by the kindly uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper appears. Some rodeo shots could cheer things up, the "Misfits," but they were not that lucky. Gary later participates in a formal dinner, in which Merle is presiding, and although invited to sit down and join the group, reads a lecture on their snobbery. Where did the cowboy's sudden eloquence come from? The most excruciating scene from the film is a ghostly party that Gary keeps in his unfinished house for his absent wife, Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
