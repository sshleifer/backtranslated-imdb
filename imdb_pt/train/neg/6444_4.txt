Most college students find themselves lost in the academy bubble, separate from the communities in which they study and live. Your conversations are held with your colleagues and college. The Steven Greenstreet documentary is an excellent example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community on the basis of limited contact with a small number of its members. <br /> <br /> The documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population. As usual, the people who scream the most get more media attention. In addition to his misrepresentation of the community in which the film was filmed, the documentary was well done. My only contention is that the feelings and bustles described in the film were attributed to the whole community, rather than the few individuals who expressed them. <br /> <br /> Naturally, it is important to examine such a controversy and to make people aware. of the differences that exist between political points of view, but it is ridiculous to imply a whole community of people in the actions of some radicals.
