Facts about the National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, also known as National Lampoon's Movie Madness: 1. The film is bad, even by the typical Lampoon standards. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one will see a movie. <br /> <br /> So, after I finished watching it, I started to wonder why the heck it's called 'National Lampoon Goes to the Movies', and why it was designed, let alone really done . It would be like calling the An American Guy from Austin Powers to the movies. How lame He is not American and does not go to the movies. None of the characters in Lampoon's satire call it funny, and neither of them sees movies, which causes a small problem. I hoped it was something in the vein of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it's not. <br /> <br /> This was the first National Lampoon movie after Animal House, although you could not tell from the movie quality. Poorly developed, rough and amateur by any standard, induces headaches ?? is not a good sign for a 89-minute film that seems to double in size. <br /> <br /> I noticed a pattern. Really bad movies are typically renamed ?? and this little disaster falls into that category. It has two separate titles - probably to help try to promote it to dumb people to remember how bad it was received from video critics at home in 1982/83. 'Hmm, movie madness? I've never heard of this movie before! Let's rent it! And then, the realization: 'Hey, wait a minute, this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!' <br /> <br /> It was archived by MGM / UA, never to be released in theaters or DVDs; occasionally appears on television a few times per decade, which is pretty much the only place where you can find it. <br /> <br /> Is it divided into three floors ?? a parody of self-expanding videos, cruelty to butter and the corporation, and police brutality / cop-buddy movies (I think). The first segment stars Peter Riegert (Animal House) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other things. I'm not sure why because it was so annoying that my mind started to stray. Until the sex scene came along. <br /> <br /> Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a piece of butter (do not ask) who decides to become Queen of Margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products. There! It contains the only funny line from the movie: "Only I can make love to my son!" If you think it does not look very funny, are you sure? it is not. And just imagine ?? is the highlight of this movie! <br /> <br /> Part III is about a cop who chases a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) just to lose his nerve and shoot the guy. It contains a funny scene, but is it extremely over-acted? only Lloyd really exhibits any mood, showing his dry and compassionate, yet strangely surreal character. The part where he is suffocating his victim and the meek cop is watching everything unfold, at least evoked a laugh or two. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see such a cast of semi-famous names resorting to low standards. Do the writers in each segment clearly believe they are being too ironic and clever by falsifying so-called stereotypes? the flaw is that the film becomes a huge contradiction, favoring the T & A pattern rather than plot; crude humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate rather than inspired performances. It's easy to see that none of the actors loved the material, mumbling their lines, often so embarrassed that they rarely make eye contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, as I said before. I laughed once, in just a line, and even then I was kind of indifferent. Two laughs, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to the movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies seem like bands of regular laughter. <br /> I like the National Lampoon's Vacation series (or at least three of four installments), and his classic Animal House, but his recent list of direct video bombs, like the Golf Punks (with the genius of comic Tom Arnold), is a good example of why the magazine went out of circulation for more than a decade. It gets really old, very fast. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see a new movie called Gold Diggers being released with its seal of approval. Is it like condemning a movie before it even hits theaters? maybe they should start not announcing their name all over the place? <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is bad. Receives the National Lampoon seal of approval. This will teach you not to do something so horrible next time. <br /> <br /> Forget the death penalty. Just put a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch it again and again every day for a month. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I can not even begin to explain its putrid evil. I give up.
