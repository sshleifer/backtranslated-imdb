So, American Pie: Beta House is the sixth American Pie movie in the series. Although, it really has nothing to do with the three original American Pie movies except that some of the characters must be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (can not that guy do better shows?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to praise this movie. There are no funny jokes. The acting is painful to watch, especially the girl with the "southern" accent, which sounds more like an imitation of the Canadian of a British woman pretending to be a hick, using the word "ya'll." This movie makes me feel like an idiot. Why do not I enroll in a college where no one attends classes (but everyone gets good grades), girls always take their clothes off in public, everyone has promiscuous unprotected sex without the weight of babies and STIs, and you can ejaculate all the photos of a family girl without her caring? Actually, this series has dropped to softcore pornography standards. Maybe to the next, they will finally break and hire Ron Jeremy as the leader. I'm sure they can just tie the series by making the third uncle of his character Stifler once removed or something like that.
