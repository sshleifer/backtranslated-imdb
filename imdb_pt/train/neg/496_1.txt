Imagine that you are a high school kid, deep in a dark theater and without people with your girlfriend. How bad would a movie have to be, so you felt compelled to leave the theater and go home before it was over? This movie is so bad. Same. Movies usually get so bad they are good; this movie is beyond this stage of evil. It's painfully bad. Horribly, terribly, crime against humanity is bad.
