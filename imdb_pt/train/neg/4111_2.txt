Think of a budget-less version of the Syndrome of China being directed by a film student who idolizes John Woo and you will have "Power Play". The idea was good, but execution, acting and dialogue absolutely killed her, not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and sequences of disasters that were used to make up for the lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the film. This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously disappeared after they invaded the offices of an energy plant suspected of causing an earthquake frenzy. The somewhat arrogant reporter, going against what should be a more ruthless bunch of company executives, is chased by the city (along with anyone with whom he speaks) to "clear" any conclusive evidence that may remain of the factory's failures. Unfortunately, there is no real sense of urgency because the characters interact with much hesitation, along with idiot dialogues and a lot of horrible acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who can only be drawn to the film by his appeal in the action genre, is forced to endure an increasing count of bodies and ridiculous amounts of violent shootings, as well as scenes of earthquake disaster. The whole focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and a more interesting sequence of events that should have propelled the story. It could have been much better if the filmmakers had focused more on a thriller and paid more attention to the development of the corruption aspects of this story. Scary villains, a naive reporter and those who try to alert the reporter about what is wrong. It's stereotyped, but at least it would have been fun.
