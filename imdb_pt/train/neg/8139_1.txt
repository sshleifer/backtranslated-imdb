Or maybe it's what it seems. Anyway, "The Bat People" is as flat as a carpet, bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as smart as the three combined. (Moss) is bitten by a bat when checking a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and later, turns into a bat-well, not exactly a bat, but a bat-like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims from a first person camera point of view .... /> But then there is the sheriff's business (Pataki), which is about the worst kind of sheriff: the hickory type. He bores people, mocks married women, steals handkerchiefs (FIEND!), Smokes one of those cigarettes in his mouth and speaks at the same time, making him look and sound like Buford T. Justice in "Smokey and the Bandit "and (this is the worst part) ... IT IS THE MOST LIKELY CHARACTER OF THE WHOLE MOVIE! <br /> <br /> The whole movie, however, is just a TV-do-the-crapola movie similar to a week (guano, in this case). It's an AIP, for crying out loud! What did you expect, Oscar thing? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about a movie that even MST3K can not save? <br /> <br /> What about ... there are no stars for "The Bat People", full version OR MST3K version! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there's any sequel to this movie, I'm burying my TV.
