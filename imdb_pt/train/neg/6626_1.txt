I saw the movie and I got screwed because the movie was silly and boring. I thought Ram Gopal Varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole movie was spoiled and they spoiled "sholay". the cast and crew were bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie that some people ran in the middle. The performance of Amithab Bachan is bad, I thought this movie would be the biggest hit of the year, but this movie will be the biggest failure of the year, for sure. no one did justice to their work, including Ajay Devagan. this movie does not deserve any public. I bet this movie is going to fail. <br /> <br /> "FINALLY THIS MOVIE SUCKS"
