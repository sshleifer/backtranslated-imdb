I did not see the first two - only this one that is called Primal Species in England. I do not think I'll bother looking at them. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. Terrible acting, bad dialogues, cheap rubber monsters. Everything is so unpleasant. The nicer characters die very quickly and leave you with the annoying ones, especially one called Polchak, who is an incredible idiot. No one like that would have survived 5 minutes in the army. It lasted a long time, but I was glad when he finally had his head chewed - I was having nightmares that he would survive. The Colonel was rubbish too - all the grumpy grunts and out-of-the-way screams. And the moody doctor looked and acted as if she were out of a porn. I was waiting for her to take off her glasses, shake her hair and turn me into a vampire, but she did not. Too bad, as I would have animated the movie to the end. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman did not make decent films?
