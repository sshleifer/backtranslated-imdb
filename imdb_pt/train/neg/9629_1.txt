I saw it for free, fortunately, and I wanted it to be better than it was, but it's really the same thing that movie studios seem to have been foisting on us for the last ten years. <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are opposites - and yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If this plot does not surprise you and thrill you, the film will not either. <Br /> <br /> Many jokes and fart jokes. In the middle of the movie, I began to realize that Ben Stiller is not really funny, but he tries very hard. And Jennifer Anniston really is not pretty, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman must have gotten a lot of money to be in this kind of medium movie, I expect more from them. <br /> <br /> What was interesting was that I saw it after I saw American Splendor, which is a truly funny and original movie - and I compared the two in my head, and I found myself wishing the executives of the movie were forced to watch those two films back to back - maybe this would make sense to them and they would start making better films with unknowns, rather than with this stereotyped material that works best on airplanes.
