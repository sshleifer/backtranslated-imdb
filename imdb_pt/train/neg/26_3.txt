Assuming this does not end with a direct release for the video, I would have to say that I canceled that title at all costs. Unless you're bored with good, well-executed movies, that's it. I saw this last night at the AFI Dallas, and left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because I did not care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director ... this is strange). When you can see a fool of only 5 minutes in the movie (a shot out, a window broken before any shot is fired ... and then the window breaks with the first shot), things go wrong. Let's just say that this is only an indicator of what is to come ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I'll spare you all the details, but this is insignificant in every respect, even in half-hearted acting. by Michael Madsen is disappointing when you are expecting half of it. And the rape scene ... Christ! "Shut up and get him" should never be used in a rape scene. ALWAYS <br /> <br /> 3/10
