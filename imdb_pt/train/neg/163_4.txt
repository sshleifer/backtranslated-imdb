The previous part of the film was quite nice, but in the end it became banal. Although Turturro is an actor I usually like, his Lujin often resembled a bad impression of the Rain Man, and the portrait of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. Overall, it looks like this movie is trying hard and ends up pompous despite excellent performances.
