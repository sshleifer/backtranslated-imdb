Ironically, although he can make the "divisions," Thomas is a complete actor as an actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is etched in my memory as one of the most extravagant and incompetent movies I have ever seen. As such, I really quite like it. <br /> <br /> Still, the only reason this takes more than one star is that Thomas is great, and it's fun to watch his tiny, muscular body performing various gymnastic skills on the stones and poles of scattered shapes strangely. on the side of the Eastern European country (including the infamous "horse-with-handles" shaped cap right in the middle of a village square that Thomas uses to plant his feet on the faces of several insane villagers). But let the poor boy open his mouth and try to thrill himself, and any illusion that he might have a career in the movies is immediately undone. <br /> <br /> Thomas at least had the excuse that he was not really an actor. Everyone in the movie - actors, director, editor, camera, etc. - is at least as bad, or worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt does not go as badly as you think. <br /> <br /> I hope poor Kurt gets the money and runs. If anyone asks him to perform again in a martial arts movie, I bet Thomas kicks the guy in the face.
