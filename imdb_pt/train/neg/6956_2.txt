Sorry, but every time I see a movie where a woman punches a man and the man does nothing but hide, the movie loses all credibility. Then the new (female) Starbuck immediately contaminated the plot before even leaving the ground (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was far more plausible than the sensitive type of hero than the new era Kattee Sackhoff - whose interpretation is likely to be praised as "an attractive, exciting, unmissable and innovative performance" by the politically correct. new editors review review today; but in essence it's just a tired old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder the size of a house: the biggest clich√© on today's screens. I can give this series one more chance, but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned. As James Hilton once lamented, "A story, please, just give me a story."
