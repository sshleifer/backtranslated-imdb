Chances are that if I watched it again I could get physically sick, the movie is so annoying ..... unless you believe in psychics, reincarnation and the other tricks that this promotes on a grand scale. The "recycling of souls," they call it here. Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story was made several times before with films like "Heaven Can Wait". It was also made much better. Too bad they had to squander the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> At least it's a very tame movie in terms of languages. This is the only redeeming quality of this film.
