The continuation of "Walking Tall," 1973, continues the real-life drama around Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, but this movie is like a TV movie. Bo Svenson takes on the lead role of Joe Don Baker, but he is very mild to the role; he comes out as a country singer with a baton instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up having very little to do. I would give the one-star movie strictly in its good intentions, but the script is a lazy and transparent mass of routine predicaments and production is cheap. Followed in 1977 by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 by the television film "A Real American Hero".
