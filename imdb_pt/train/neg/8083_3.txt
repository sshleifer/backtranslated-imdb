Scorned by Richard C. Sarafian, this disaster took over the Japanese theaters before coming to the United States and immediately going to the video, where it was not seen again until Turner's networks needed something beyond infomercials to fill their schedules. 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock. tape on the bottom of your carton. The name Smithee should be used when the studio hacked the movie so badly that the director does not want his name attached anymore. But I'm afraid Sarafian can not blame the studio entirely for this. The actors, most of whom are newly formed from Overacting 101, deliver one line after another. The plot is complicated. Special effects are unimpressive. The parts that are not laughable are simply boring. The script or the book must have been good-why else would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this game? But something went wrong from the page to the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not bad enough to be so bad, it's good.
