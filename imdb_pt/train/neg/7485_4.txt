Granted, that sounds like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in a comedy by Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie, and you'll find out. <br /> <br /> In fact, Martin, the leader, is wrong. He's not making the big antics he's known from films like "The Jerk," but instead plays a kind of middle character that does not work. Hawn, with no one to play, is terrible. Cleese is the only partially funny member. <br /> <br /> On top of that, the plot is pretty stupid. I can not say how much of this may have been changed, but the characters do not seem to have the slightest common sense. They made a mistake in New York, doing nothing right and, unfortunately, nothing funny. Not only the whole premise is completely unbelievable, as it seems to give the message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a theme repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In short, instead of seeing this, go rent the original "strange couple" again.
