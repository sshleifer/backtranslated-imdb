I blind bought this movie and I am very upset that I paid as much as I did, but I would say that at least it is worth a rent for some legal deaths and a laughable acting. Not a good movie anyway, but I must say I was very entertained. I think it could be called so-bad-it-good. <br /> <br /> As I said, the acting is horrible, I feel I could have done a better job showing at least any emotion. The story is not new and was made better. I think I just have a crush on any carnival-like squire movie. I would say rent this or download it, but definitely not buy it. Not worth more than a clock.
