The British industry of "heritage films" is out of control. There is nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why should they all be filmed by no-talent? This movie rips the guts of Orwell's hard romance, turning it into a cute and harmless romantic comedy. "Aspidistra" may not be Orwell's best work, but no one who reads it can forget his superb portrayal of poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only the cold and the hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a dark, gray, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays it to be detonated by a squadron of bombers. But this film shows anything that can be disturbing in any way, and creates a joyous nostalgic trip to the charming London of 1930, in which everything is lit by golden sunbeams, and even the slums of Lambeth are picturesque and full of frescoes . hedgehogs and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the strong wind sweeping the garbage-strewn streets seem completely out of place in this world of chocolate boxes. Worst of all is the relentless bonobia of the script, old jokes and clunking dialogues. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the movie is packed with great actors. But it's all for nothing. This movie made me so angry! The literary history of Britain is something to be proud of for its richness, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? We employ no instros to turn it into anodyne pap centered on the soft for people who want to feel that they are "acquiring some culture" while they drink their Horlicks and they doze discreetly.
