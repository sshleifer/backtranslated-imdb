This delightful fusion of New Age buzz and absurdly bad filmmaking may not "open" you to borrow one of the movie's favorite verbs, but it can leave your jaw loose and your belly sore from laughing or vomiting. Based on James Redfield's bestselling book, first published in 1993, this kitschy cornucopia tracks the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who, as he travels to deeper, darker and stinkier Peru, smelling the air or something more illegal. Namely, what he discovers is a Shangri La filled with smiling zombies who may be crazy or just over medicated, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional cry from a celestial choir. Although there is a lot of talk about "energy," this quality is definitely missing from the heterogeneous cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly housed in the camp pantheon. For those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided the inept leadership while Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the screenplay. In short, easily the worst movie seen in over 40 years of movie viewing.
