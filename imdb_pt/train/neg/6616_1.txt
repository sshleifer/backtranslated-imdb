I need to tell you right away, I'm certainly not an authority on Bollywood movies and I only saw a handful. However, if you've never seen one, do not start with this! I really liked the ones I saw up to this, but I just can not stand this one. I must also say that I could not finish this movie - it was so annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character called 'Rambha' in the movie. He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - which I would have never believed would have been possible. He is so # @ ^! # Annoying! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think it should be a comic relief. Instead, it just irritated my nerves and wanted him to die ... slowly! His voice, his mannerisms and his displeasure - he just did not seem to shut up and mastered every scene he was in - and he needed to die! <br /> <br /> 2. Heroes had the incredible ability to avoid AK-47 bullets with ease. I'm not joking - there was a scene where several unarmed guys picked up a small army of guys with those assault rifles !! And, again and again, they avoided picking up a single bullet and hit the bad guys !!! That made Stallone's actions on "Rambo II" seem mundane !! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so loud, in your face and intense - it pretty much made my brain bleed !! It was as if the movie was made by people under the influence of methamphetamine !! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who can not take a movie with plot and wants almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made no sense ... none! <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're the hottest Bollywood fan and action, you can support this movie, but for me, I can see why he's on the infamous Bottom 100 list of IMDb. Wow ... this movie is bad and intensely bad !!
