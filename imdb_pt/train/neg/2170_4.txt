This film reproduces the fine line between satire and nonsense. While a system of bridges that have no rules can promote marital harmony, it certainly can not promote the winning bridge, so the satire did not work for me. But there were some items that I found agreeable anyway, especially with the great bridge game between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the movie. It is treated like a boxing championship. Not only is the arena for the contest surrounded in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a referee hovering among the contestants, and broadcaster Roscoe Karns offers uninterrupted chatter about the happenings. At one point he even lists "Um ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if a four-diamond offer was a deciding event. And people were glued to their radios for all of this, a common event for the championship boxing matches. This parody worked really well indeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. Paul Lukas does not have much talent for comedy and is miscast; the lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh did not get good enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a good comic twist like a forgotten blonde at the beginning of the movie, but she pretty much disappears after that. What a waste of talent!
