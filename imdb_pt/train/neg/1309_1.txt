This movie was extremely annoying. Should not less than 15 minutes. The images of children and animals being killed were a little disturbing. <br /> <br /> Generally I do not write comments, but this was so bad to have so many good and excellent reviews. I think in this case we are one step closer to the honest evaluation of this title. <br /> <br /> What more can I say? I sleep during this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I had woken up from 8 hours of long sleep period. I think that's the point in itself. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue between the characters except maybe two sentences at the end. <br /> <br /> When you fall asleep, once watching, do not try to back off and catch up because you will fall asleep again.
