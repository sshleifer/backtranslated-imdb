When I borrowed this movie from a friend (fortunately I did not buy it) in the package (which actually looked bad and ugly) was printed "The Ultimate Vampire Horror". After watching it, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. The "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is chased by some vampire / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> Lighting, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a festive video in a ten. years old, VHS system if not worse. I gave the film a 2 out of 10 and just because the promo-t-shirts looked kind of cool. I do not want disney-film-students or splatter-movies in general, but I've seen Braindead and I've seen a 20-dollar budget film of students that was ten times better than that crap.
