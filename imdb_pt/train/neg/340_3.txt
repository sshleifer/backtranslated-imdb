I'm guessing the reason this movie went so well at the box office is, of course, Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop", so back then it was hot. Whereas one made more than two hundred million and was R and this made about 80 million and was pg says it was not so popular so. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so that's probably another reason why I do not care much about it. This one has Eddie as a sort of discoverer of lost children. He must find the child of gold or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is, it does not compare to the special effects. I had seen better things done in the '70s than some of the things that made this offer, Ray Harryhausen made things better. Still, the main reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately he's not very funny in this movie and it seems stupid to put him in the "Lost Ark Raiders" scene. I think they were waiting for a fish out of the water effect, but for me it just did not work.
