'Iedereen Beroemd' has everything we can expect from a direct video to a video. It's the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star. The only thing he needs is to put her on the stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and blackmail. The problem with the movie is not the basic storyline, but how it's done. Everything is supposed to be funny, but it's not. It is trivial and clumsy, the characters are superficial and the final sequence is totally devoid of climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing, but just how pathetic the organization is.
