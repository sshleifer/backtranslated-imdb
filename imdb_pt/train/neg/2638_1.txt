Good. This is bad. And then theirs is The Sentinel, a political thriller that's among the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot of a mole in the Secret Service is good, but never has a movie with so much potential been so massacred. Directed with Clark's "nervousness," every actor in that movie seems to be working on autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas seems bored here. I can honestly say that I have NEVER, in my entire life, watched another movie with so many grotesque holes. The turnaround has been predictable since the first, and the character's motives are so ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a catastrophe of a film with no redeeming value.
