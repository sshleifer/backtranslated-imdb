So, 'thinner' ... Yes .. This Steven Bachman (read Steven King) talks about a man who gets his fair desserts from a gypsy old man he just killed, The story itself is there, no doubt, but I I do not know I do not know why I did not like it more than I could have. I think what really distracted me were the actors. I mean, who's the leader? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And if you want, please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian Mafioso role that ever existed? And while we're at it, does every Mafioso have to have an Italian mother to cook noodles? The only good acting job done here is less than 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as the gypsy old man. He is very good. But the rest, I do all of you, "best actors ..."
