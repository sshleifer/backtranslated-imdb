Prophecy II, what is there to say about it? They completely abandoned the originality of the first film and simply did a Chris Walken movie. It is not even written by the original writer! <br /> <br /> If you saw Nr. 1 I do not watch Nr. 2 is a real disappointment ... <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen Nr. 1 I do not watch Nr. 2! Go to see Nr. 1 to try something original and fun
