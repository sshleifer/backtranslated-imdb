One previous reviewer said the movie is not that bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies child sexual abuse. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked so let's give 5 out of 10 stars. Why not a total of 10? Because the film was "agonizing," the child's stares were "unrealistic," and the fat friend was "annoying." Nowhere in the critique does the critic express any indignation that a 1981 American film depicted scenes of a child having sex with an adult woman. I happened to get this steaming movie while I was in a hotel that had Showtime. For me, even if the fat friend acted in a storm and deserved an Oscar, I would still have to give the film only 1 star. Howard Hessman, who starred in the film while appearing at WKRP, is particularly ridiculous. But do not believe my word!
