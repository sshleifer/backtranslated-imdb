I give this five out of 10. All five notes are for Hendrix delivering a very decent set of his last day stuff. Unfortunately, the quality of camera work and editing is getting to terrible! We have countless pictures of Hendrix, where he could almost be doing something, peeing, maybe? We do not see his hands on the guitar, that's the point! Do we also have lots of pictures of Hendrix from behind? There seems to be three cameras on the Hendrix, but the amateur fools operate all of them. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be interested in diverting his focus lazily from the stage, as if Hendrix on guitar was a mere distraction. While the guy behind is more interested in focusing on some puppies in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that is bleeding the amplifiers (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) interspersed in the tracks there are clips of student losers protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun, complete loss of film! If Hendrix had lived for two more years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day for a full official release. The only jewel it contains is the incredible Johnny B Good, but all in a very poor visual document of the great man and inferior to Woodstock and Isle of Wight.
