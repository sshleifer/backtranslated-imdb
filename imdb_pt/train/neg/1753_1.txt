The writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer had a profound influence on my life as a Christian, and I eagerly waited to watch this film and find out more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film was disjointed ... it gave no background on his life, no historical context and nothing about his great writings (except for a brief and fleeting reference to "The Cost of Discipleship" by a colleague at the beginning of the film). Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the United States) and relaxing with his friends before deciding to return to Germany. Apparently, to show your human side. Okay, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part in which he defends his faith. Instead of emphasizing this, we have a very misunderstood romance with a 17-year-old student. Whether it happened or not, it should not have been an important part of the film. Now ... still waiting for the dramatic part, or some narration explaining what his writings were about ... or SOMETHING to make us know a little about the greatness of this man. drum-roll ..... waiting ..... waiting ..... ZIP. Anything. This is the kind of movie that gives "Christian Films" a bad name. All they had to do was set up a structure for the film to follow, with some background ... even some narratives, or his flashbacks preaching from their works ... some narrative about who he was and where he had been. But no ... that's what we have. Hardly fit for a hero of the faith.
