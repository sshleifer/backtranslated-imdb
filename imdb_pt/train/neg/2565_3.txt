There are so many wrong things in this movie. <br /> <br /> For starters, the first twenty minutes of the movie could have been packed in only five or maybe ten. The general movie is already (mercifully) short, but this could have been offset by giving a little more attention to the Evil Lion (how was the lack of a reference to "The Wiz" in that regard?) And working on his sub -frame a little more closely in the main plot. In short, the script had the seed of a good idea, but it needed a bit of rework. <br /> <br /> Second, it could have been done without the rude humor. The original also had some that he could have done without, but at least there was almost a belated reflection - here, flatulence and urination abound. <br /> <br /> Third, the program is a bit self-conscious. The original series did very well, as did the first film, but here it's just very, very. Brendan Fraser's inner jokes were a bit overdone (and why no mention of the "new Ursula"?). Other jokes with the Storyteller, especially some close-to-end interactions, also go beyond common sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, a little more attention could have been given to the work of the CGI. At first it was difficult to say that Shemp was not a real elephant (except for behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally, special effects should merely tell the story if they are good or bad, and at least they succeed, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> <br /> All that has been said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. Brendan Fraser's charm is missing, but Christopher only fails in that specific comparison - he even managed to give George a little personal depth, which should have been a big miss in a Jay Ward-inspired film, but it was not here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most of the other performances were pretty normal, not standing out in my mind as good or bad.
