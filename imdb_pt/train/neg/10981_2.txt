Or listening, for that matter. Even the soundtrack is boring. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the worst gay movie I've ever seen (this is about Billy), but it's pretty close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This thing creeps and drags and drags. It's not that the plot is empty - in the hands of a good writer, it could have worked. . . it certainly could have been a lot more fun. There is not a plot point you can not see coming sixteen miles down the road. The dialog box is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to injury, it's full of stereotyped one-dimensional gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leaders was possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamics, no evidence of why leaders love each other. . . We just said that they are in love. Difficult to find out when they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. Do they like the same book? Huh? <br /> <br /> The acting is not totally bad, but the pace is unbearably slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch - slow but not Jarmusch quality. In fact, that would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch movies, skip this one.
