This is one of the most putrid films of the 90's. I would not recommend it if you had something better to do. <br /> <br /> This photo presents African Americans as wild, uneducated, violent, inarticulate and reefer smoking sociopaths. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his bunch of friends are continually disrespectful to others in the dormitory, not just whites but also Asians, and are never disciplined by their actions. Despite all this tolerance, they continue whimpering and crying over the white and evil oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way. In fact, it is Fudge's influence that causes Remmy to relate to the skin chiefs, quit college and end up killing Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Skinheads are presented as a covert group of people who have Cushion off campus and generally stay away from everyone else. They never blow up their music to annoy people or insult the police. They have committed serious crimes such as battery and rape, but they are not as repulsive or threatening as Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> There is a lot of material in this movie that almost offended me. or made me laugh. Some of them are as follows: Fudge and Dreads are declared students at Columbus University, but we never see them in class and it is not known how they pay their tuition. All you have to do is speculate that the herb you smoke has something to do with your finances. Although they are students of what appears to be a private university, they can not pronounce a single line of appropriate English. His characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia. <br /> <br /> It seems like Kristen Swanson, drunk, knew exactly why Billy was taking Billy to his house. She even asked him to get an eraser so they could start. The fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape, while it would be great sex if he had a practical one. Later, Kristen was assured by Taryn (Jennifer Connely) that she has no responsibility in this matter, and although intentionally jumping on a guy's bed, she was not ready for intercourse and was cruelly harnessed by a sexual predator. Then, about a week later, she met and slept with an ultra-sensitive benefactor who knew how to avoid rape and brought a condom. The principal emphasized contraception completely. <br /> <br /> This film is complete and absolute trash that makes blacks look like idiots and women look stupid and fragile. Cole Hauser's performance and Laurence Fishburne's accent are the only reasons I can think of watching it. The writer / director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want, but keep in mind that the neurons do not grow back. Just follow the advice at the end and GO DOWN.
