Even same old old man about Che. He completely ignored the really interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg remade the same annoying narrative of Che. The silly and seductive tale of a rich Argentine boy who was so shocked by poverty that he became a Robin Hood fighting alongside the poor, until eventually he was murdered by the CIA. Yes, yes, I heard it all before, boring and without shame! The reality of Che Guevara is very different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messianic tendency, which openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatic that at the hottest moment of the Cold War he even begged the Soviet Union to bomb New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring the end of the world. CHE urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack on US cities. For the rest of his life, he stated that if his finger was on the button, he would have pushed it. When Khrushchev stepped back and literally saved the world, Che was furious with the "betrayal." If Che's recommendations had been followed, you would not be reading this review now. As a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film. It is incredible that no filmmaker has dared enough to show Che's real side and his posthumous transformation of the media. That would make an Oscar winning movie! I thought making independent movies meant taking REAL RISKS and being GROUNDBRAKING! They just stick to "safe counterculture themes", namely "Che cool", "Bad Wall Street", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are fanatics and stupid ", etc ... ad nauseum Oooh, how bold, how the mind blows Three anti-mainstream and nervous I wish they had some real balls and attack the Independent Cinema Oligarchy!
