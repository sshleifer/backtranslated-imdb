1 st attended 5/26/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Strange story about a druid witch trying to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. At least I think it was the relationship. A kind of scary quality is performed throughout this film, unlike Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholson's performance that is not at all in this movie. All of this is taken very seriously until almost the end when some headlines and attempts to alleviate the weather do not work. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything does not seem to merge very well and the viewer gets lots of information and no real understanding of what happened in the movie. There is a very small disposable performance of Christopher Walken as the granddaughter's uncle who, of course, gives him the highest billing in trying to sell the film. Do not buy this trick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
