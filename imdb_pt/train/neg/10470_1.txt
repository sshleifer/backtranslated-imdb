What else is there to say? <br /> <br /> I read all the comments here and most are correct. . However, a person went so far as to call this film evil and that Satan corrupted it (or something along those lines). Bad?! Wow, how shocking. . I mean, TBN basically made that movie. Open your eyes, please. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that was the lowest note of the absurdity of propoghanda that came in years. The most scary thing about the Omega Code is how much money they spent to do it. If this movie can be done, there are no limits, and therefore we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2," and "Ernest loses the Omega codes." <br /> <br /> For those of you Who is in the Bible stories, the new Dogma movie will catch where Omega Code has never begun.
