I admit I did not give much chance to this movie. I decided early on that this was not my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it looks great in terms of cinematography. The scenes from the early 70's in Manhattan look pretty good, as does the lead actress. It's a very crisp black and white that could almost make the movie look undated and cool. However, some of the other techniques filmmakers employ throw that perspective into hell. The disjointed issue is VERY late from the 1960s, somewhere between surrealism and new wave. The story also seems to have come from a very specific moment, somewhere between the idealism of free love and artistic experimentation. The film follows a young woman around town while she looks for a man she had an anonymous phone number. sex with By meeting other strange characters, she reveals her peculiarities and they reveal theirs. The film seems to be an irreverent comedy, but adds a vanguard feeling. I would hope that if you liked the Andy Warhol movies, I would be very excited to discover The Telephone Book. <br /> <br /> Some problems I had: Near the end of the movie, a character tells an anecdote that lasts more than twelve minutes - brutal to sit down. In addition, there is a very explicit animation sequence that I find coarse and youthful that serves as the movie's climax. I laughed out loud four or five times, and liked the ending (minus the disgusting animation). And when the movie changed to the color of the last string of phone booths of the night, I really liked the way it got even better. It turned out to be one of those experiences that I felt I could have really enjoyed if it were a little different. But that's what the filmmakers have given us. It is obscure, artistic and far to the left of the dial, but none of them is reason to recommend it on its own. I did not think I was single or creative as much as forced and pretentious.
