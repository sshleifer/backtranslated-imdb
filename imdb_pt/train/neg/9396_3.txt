The Radar Men from the Moon is a pretty typical fare from the 1950s. The special effects are pretty cheap, the lunar vehicles are obviously over World War II jeeps with plywood painted on them, and stuff like that. The acting is just like that. This inspires the children's imagination, which I believe has been directed. By today's standards, it's annoying, cheap and bad. There are also a lot of footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
