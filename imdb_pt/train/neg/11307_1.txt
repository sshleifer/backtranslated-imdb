The gun is perfectly stupid. I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal's movies intended to mock Jeff by making his forms to dance at the beginning of this stupid movie. The plot is predictable, the fights were fair and Jeff acts as well as the couch he beats with some kind of weapon in a scene.
