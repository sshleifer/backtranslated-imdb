I'm starting to see a pattern in the movies I give 1. There are almost all the movies my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop having faith in your taste for movies. Anyway, this is typical dribble intended for pre-teen girls, but made even more evil than usual. Again, the writer broke the fundamental rule of any film. It made the main character unpleasant. She begins by being a complete b * tch to her friend in the beginning, and then discovers when she becomes 30, that she is basically a bad person (having cases, etc.). Why would the F feel for this person? Okay, let's just say we can get over this. Jennifer Garner is as far as attractive without having some kind of deformity. I do not know if it's her or the writer's fault, but her character goes way beyond my limit of annoyance. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13 year olds are not fun, they are annoying. By far the most embarrassing moment of the movie happened when they danced to "Thriller." Wow, that was painful. This showed her practicing that dance in the beginning. That explains why she knows it, but a whole club full of people? Argh !!! The Macarena would be more believable! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job and no one notices? At least Tom Hanks' character in "Big" had a job that made sense to a child. These body / child transitions becoming adult movies at night are really getting out of control, and this is by far the worst of them so far.
