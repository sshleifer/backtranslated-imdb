Definitely one of Eddie Murphy's smaller films is this absurdity about a kidnapped mystical child, three-hundred-year-old dragons and a "Chosen One". <br /> <br /> Murphy is the "Chosen One" in question, and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world." A searcher for missing and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him he is "The Chosen One", and that it is his destiny to find and rescue "The Golden Child." For if the child died, compassion would die with him, since he is the bearer of compassion. <br /> <br /> If all this junk hocus pocus has not ruined this for you now, certainly will be movie begins. Suffice it to say that the plot is abominable and it destroys the whole movie. It meant being another vehicle for Murphy's selfish brand of humor (the comedy is not so good for you), the film fails on many levels. Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa can not do much for the process. Very silly and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
