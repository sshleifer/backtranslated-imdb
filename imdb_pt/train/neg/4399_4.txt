"Tapeheads," a fun and intermittent parody of the music video business, may have been the perfect short comedy, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly amid the senseless chaos involved. They play with two semi-compromised Los Angeles security guards who create their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties and a star on the deathbed. It's a shame that filmmakers have to come up with a dark plot to fill the run-time (pranks involving a corrupt politician and his henchmen who do not do much but draw the main force of the film by sending the musical culture of the late 1980s ). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a pair of originals here: nerds, but loose, street slickers, not hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same wavelength, and they never diminish each other. They are the real thing in comedies of friends. * 1/2 of ****
