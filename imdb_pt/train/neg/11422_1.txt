I saw it in the theater when it left, and yesterday I saw it again on the Cape. This I was able to reintroduce myself with the feeling of how revolting this movie is. The lot of characters are self-absorbed narcissistic preeners. Worst of all, it reinforces every negative stereotype about dating in the 20s, even when it comes to celebrating "meeting" people. The cool guys end up last, the guys are great, the smiling faces do better. The girls are all boy toy girls. Only one character ("Wendy") is seen doing something remotely useful to society, and she dispenses her virginity long ago saved on a night of disposable slack with a scumbag, in a lush scene that we supposedly think is romantic. What this really is is the young American Hollywood concept: permissive, detached, promiscuous, vain.
