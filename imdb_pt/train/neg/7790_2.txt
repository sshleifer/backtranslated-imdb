Like some of the other people who reviewed this movie, I was also getting nostalgic about it ... before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this film were completely unreliable, and it now turns out that Pauline's Dangers is an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and bland filming. Even the presence of old professionals Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can not overcome a rancid script, a horrible theme song and some unfortunate "special effects". In addition, the stereotyped representations of African and Arab characters contribute to a painful view, especially considering that this was produced immediately after the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia chronicles that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television, but inexplicably ended up being released in theaters. Judging by the results, this is a completely believable (and disconcerting) scenario.
