ba ba ba boring ...... this is close to the earth battlefield in the science fiction sleep. genie francis (also known as general hospital laura) has a small role as a reporter and that alone should tell you that this movie must be bad ... there is ben kingsley (an award winning actor in the gym) in that stink and some others decent actors. You have to know what possessed them to decide to make this movie horrible. Music rises and falls dramatically as if it were a great dramatic story. Even if you pay attention, the plot is impossible to follow. The effects are mediocre and look really dated. All the actors speak in a monotonous tone and have no realism in their dialogues. I could go on and on as this is a bad movie. At least Battlefield Earth is so bad, it's funny, but that's just for real. Avoid unless you want to be packaged to sleep.
