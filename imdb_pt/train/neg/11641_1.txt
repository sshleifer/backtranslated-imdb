Although I am often a supporter of the well-made film, I do not limit myself to movies that escape these frontiers, and most of the time I cherish and admire movies that "break the rules" successfully. And it is true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or at any real point. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work is visually shocking, but that's less a matter of what's really on the screen than it really is. filmed, and the noise of his films seems less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This is true for DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and while many directors did so with remarkable results under Pasolini's direction, his non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This is also true for DECAMERON. Pasolini often includes images designed to shock, offend or disconcert the public. Such elements can often be used with surprising effect, but in the hands of Pasolini these elements rarely seem to really contribute anything to the film. This is also true for DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I have been informed that there are many people who like and even admire the films of Pasolini. Even so, I never knew any of them, and I could never read anything about Pasolini or his works, which made the reason for such affection or admiration understandable to me. Judging only on account of his work, I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateur director who did not "break the rules" either by choice or lack of ability - and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his time for "existential audacity" , simply confirming him in bad habits as a filmmaker. I find your work tedious, unimpressive and pretentious. And that goes for DECAMERON, too. It is also, unfortunately, true in virtually every Pasolini film that it was my unfortunate to bear.
