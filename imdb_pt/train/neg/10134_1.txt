Steven Seagal's films have never been Oscar material, but with each release they get worse and worse. <br /> <br /> This one starts with Seagal being caught by the FBI because he killed some people in self-defense. Active military personnel are saved from prison to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the clich√© "evil English villain" that Hollywood is so obsessed with including today. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the film has terrible conditions. Dialogue that is almost always delivered with a cheese filling and lack of talent. The story is not interesting and there are segments of it that make absolutely no sense and add nothing to the story, characters from the movie as a whole, like the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main women of the cast that is there. purely for titillation to get viewers and yet it's not even twinkling just confusing as it does not make sense why this happened when you did not need it. <br /> <br /> In short, a terrible script with bad dialogue, delivered by sub-par actors, boring and sometimes poorly choreographed action scenes, and non-relevant parts that serve only to reach the near impossible and make the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your movie. life and give this lack even if you are Seagal's most ardent fan.
