Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. HERE WE GO. Now we know that this movie will be really horrible. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS, knowing it would be bad. But even I did not think it would be that bad. The plot is horrible, Van Damme is getting old (finally), but unlike Arnold, his films are as well. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie. I do not see that. Ever. I would not even get paid to see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - in the background is a wonderful ride full of action and excitement. <br /> Well, maybe not. , but marketers would like us to think, would not they? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
