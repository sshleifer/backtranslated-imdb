This movie commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The film supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics at Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt by a rookie director to make himself noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other subject, for that matter). <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis from the main character of the good but troublesome boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent, while the rape scene (being an exaggerated version of the "A clockwork orange" rape scene) is unbearable and I refuse to comment on their aesthetic values. There are some things that an artist should not do to try to reach their goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To conclude: shockingly brutal, revolting and not worth your time. See "Mechanical orange" or "Le pianist".
