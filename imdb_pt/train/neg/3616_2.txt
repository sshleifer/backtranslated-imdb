If you simply look at the cover of this movie, it's cool. DO NOT. The movie itself put me to sleep. It was slow, had minimal violence and a misuse of suspense. The acting was the bottom feeder material and the plot, although it was cool for a different film, was poorly shown here. They even kill the only nice character in the whole movie! I give 2 out of 10 because the only good thing was the turnaround in the end. Other than that, you may want to save yourself from this junk from the movie.
