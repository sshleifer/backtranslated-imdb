Not worth the video rental or the occasional time or effort. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that a child can do. The acting is over, the bad direction. * The edit was very unstable ... many things did not make sense or just seemed free. * Sound was poorly dubbed. * The music was highly inappropriate. * Casting was extremely off ... must have been in crack. * Zombies that talk much less ... driving, dancing, working ... just irritates me. * And the bad guy ... Damn! As horrible as he was ... he was the cutest zombie of all. Which does not say much. Cover Art was good but very misleading ... just like the DVD Main Menu ... great art and music. <br /> <br /> DO NOT TAKE!
