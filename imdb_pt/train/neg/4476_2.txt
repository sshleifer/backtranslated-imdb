I just saw the movie premiere on MTV. I must say that this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well, and I felt that there were many holes in the plot. There is not a nice character in this adaptation due to bad acting. I just think that all the characters are very possessive when it comes to someone they love. Besides, the love of Cate and Heath seems very incestuous. They look more like brother and sister than lovers. I do not understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of some actors that I respected and enjoyed watching in previous films, but like I said, it's extremely difficult to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrible, which was a complete shock. She was terrible at being Edward's evil older sister, and there were not enough lines for Aimee Osbourne to criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great to see him in something recent and, although his character was a bit crazy, he was the only person I was sympathetic to. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they should be our heroines, but they seemed tearful and overly dramatic. <br /> <br /> I just did not like this movie or its music very much. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but this little apparition would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job convincing me that this was a movie it was not. I just imagined something completely different.
