I did not like Frosty and this one. Both films are absurd with poorly written characters and more voices. The voices could have been made, but Frosty's return was worse than that because of the snowman they drew. Frosty's winterwonder land was great and so was the original and soothing Drama. The only good thing about this movie was Frosty, the snowman was similar to the classic 60's and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then Frosty walks out the window humming, whistling what he was doing, but all the rest poorly written and barely excited and barely got the plot. I saw the DVD cover in the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the artwork looked bad, so I did not get it until this year because the photos on the back looked a little touching, but I did this movie. It was a hassle of poor art characters, just like the DVD and it was just awful about what's going on. I watched it through the night and found it annoying that I fell asleep on the whole thing (Wait I always do this when I watch something while I go to sleep) But this movie was boring overall <br /> <br /> Overall rating: Grade - C This is like another bad special holiday rip-off on the icy returns and this. This is the 4th evil sequel as at home alone 4 well I thought the movie was OK, but at home alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad house alone 3 and 4 people hate it like that. My sister did not watch much, because when she came into my room to watch 2 and a half minutes, she walked away like "I hate the animation!" I agree with her as the third Frosty returns. Plain Awful!
