Do not get me wrong, this is a horrible, clich√© movie, but it's a treat for Olivia Hussey fans - possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever to grace the silver screen. A poster said she was unpleasant to look at - I wonder what his ideal woman is like - Paris Hil-slut? Blockbuster must actually establish a sub-genre for this type of film, since the plot of Fatal Attraction has become a genre in itself. When will Blockbuster adopt the "Adultry" section? It will fit nicely between the sections of drama and action, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered her ex-wife, who looks a lot like Mrs. Hussey. This new one goes on chasing Olivia and so makes her life hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I have no sympathy for characters in movies who betray their spouses, so I really was not hoping Olivia would get out of this shit alive. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There's a handful of violence in the film. <br /> <br /> Don Murray and Anthony John Denison get involved in a fight when Denison says he will not stop seeing Murray's wife, Olivia, because She is very good in bed. Olivia can handle it as well, a sniper and can start to tighten a round - I'll let you watch). <br /> <br /> NUDE: $$ (Olivia is the nude queen of brief and provides a bit here. She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and also has a shower scene - shooting distance). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $ (We've seen this plot before - a hundred times over, and often done a lot better. <br /> <br /> The man's dialogue <br /> When trying to decipher why this movie was a failure, it is William Riead. is exaggerated and imbecile: the man has no ability to tell stories and can not build veto human reactions to the plot These people, from the upper strata of society, speak as high school children - with the habit of sleeping during English classes. I put Riead on the Never-to-Be-Viewed-Again list). <br /> <br /> ACKNOWLEDGMENT: $$$ (The performance was not "telephoned" as the inmates say, but it was hampered.) Much to Riead's youthful script, Olivia Hussey says Anthony Johnson Denison is "strange" and " Don Murray was basically there - his character was not developed, and Edward Asner, a terrific actor when he received something with substance, is evil used in this movie).
