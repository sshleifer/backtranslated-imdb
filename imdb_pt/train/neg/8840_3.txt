Here's the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. That's the problem, is not it? The concept is new and full of potential, but the script and execution of it have no real substance. He should grab you from the beginning and then pull your emotions a little, get interested and invest in the characters. This movie does not have what it takes to take off and sustain the flight, and here's why. First you do not care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's supposed to be about normal people put into a stressful situation. They are not credible in the way they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a chewing cop is chewing gum, frowning and looking intense all the time is not the way to go here. I mean what is it?, It looks like he's in the bathroom or something. I loved him in the re-animator and the way he was playing the intense / neurotic and devalued medical genius was right about money. But not for that, he tries too hard to compensate, looking so intense and in the limit, but in a neurotic way still bland, it's not natural, I'm surprised he did not move his jaw during filming. The film is basically supportive of life, barely has a wrist and kept me waiting for something that would never come.
