What a load of crap .. I can not even begin to describe how horrible this movie was. The rating here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Particularly if you liked the first snaps of ginger. The first one was well written, well run, well executed ... a brilliant film with fantastic aesthetics and atmosphere. The second was' alrite'- decent as a standalone film, but clearly not up to the level of the first ... The third is an insult to the series, period. I rate the movies: 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, and yes, that's really happened in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all confused with some Native American mythology. The sisters have no real history, or progression, or even a clear relationship ... They are just trying to survive and stay together forever. That is as deep as possible. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the girls agreed to stay in this shit after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Ah, and another thing, action-packed action was terrible-people popping up out of nowhere regularly, like the girls turning around, and there's an elaborate candle-lit installation with a mystical Native American woman sitting there, about to get into a speech. The sets were terrible, they could not escape the fact that everything was obviously based on a set, which really did not help. In addition, there was consistently snow outside the camp, but not a trace inside (..on the set). <br /> <br /> Arrghh, so bad! I really hoped it was at least as good as the second.
