Someone mentioned the issue. This is poorly edited and what began as something intriguing has become an incomprehensible mess. To begin with, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choices for the kind of experimentation they are involved in? And what exactly are they testing? Apparently there is some great plan that some agency will explore. The acting is very bad. Everyone is emoting. Everyone is keeping secrets. They often mention that if it were not for the money, they would turn it off. There is a crazed minister speaking from the scriptures. And so on. But again, the biggest problem is the lack of a playing field for the actors. There are some really extravagant elements. Those small rooms and the chaise longues. The horrible wallpaper (it was wallpaper?). It was interesting, but it did not seem to go anywhere.
