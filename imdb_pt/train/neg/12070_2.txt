By chance I bought one of those collections of 50 "Legacy of Horror" movies and you believe I'm still looking for them to find a good HORROR movie? Sometimes you find a nice movie like Devil's Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of the great Alfred Hitchcock movies (some are not horror and they're only there because Hitchcock has directed some horrors and suspense), but other times it seems like they put movies like The Island Monster and that's because they can not accept the fact that they would be easily forgotten and should be for that matter. <br /> <br /> So, we opened up to a game idea of ​​Westing. . The rich but cruel and abusive father played by Carradine (the only characteristic of that) died and left his inheritance to his sons and servants whom he still hates. Carradine gives a good performance as always, but he is left mostly in voice recordings and sequences of flashbacks, leaving us to watch mediocre / terrible performances. The rest of the cast exaggerates or does bad things in scenes. Given this was an independent film from the 70's, lighting and effects are very limited. It's hard to create a lot of tension when the viewer can not see what's going on so well in some scenes. Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga give an effort at least and I'm ashamed to admit that they left me laughing in the end mainly because of sheer stupidity but still with a very small happiness that they pulled some version of a touch to a otherwise quite obvious who-made it, but not enough to improve the quality of the film. You should not like the characters because they are selfish, cruel or psychotic, but it takes you to a whole new level and makes many of them unacceptable. The death scenes are very bad and the suspense is not really there. This proves that you would probably enjoy the film of 20 "Chilling" movies, containing such films as House on a Haunted Hill, Little Horror Shop with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead on it. This is best avoided.
