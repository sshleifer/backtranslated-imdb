I could not help but think behind the mask: the rise of Leslie Vernon (an incredibly more incredible film) while watching this, because of the realistic feel, as well as the great innovative idea. This could have been a great movie. the acting is ... of some actors, that's fine. of others ... it's absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> That aside the idea is great and the format is great. the story is very good as well, although it often suffers from great blows to the logical mind. <br /> <br /> No matter what, right? after all, it's a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I really want to see it redone ... I really want it to be the fantastic movie that it wants to be. <br /> <br /> (and you can not really blame the minds behind the movie for it) this is obviously built on a shoe string budget. and fx really hurt the movie overall. <br /> <br /> Great movie. ... if you were to trade for a better and a little better performance. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has written this should continue, great idea here.
