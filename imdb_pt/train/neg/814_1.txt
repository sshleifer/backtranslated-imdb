This movie was just plain bad. Just about every cliche clich√© is present and accounted for. Does the bad guy run away? Checks. Partner? Checks. Wacky personality confrontation with partner? Checks. Newbie with something to prove? Checks. Rookie shows a gray-haired veteran. Checks. About the only ones who did not play were idiots throwing themselves in the foot and retiring, but I think they're saving the nuts for Dooley's next ride. Join the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with tired old jokes and banal stuff like Dooley's award-winning car being destroyed all the time and you have the recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this at all costs.
