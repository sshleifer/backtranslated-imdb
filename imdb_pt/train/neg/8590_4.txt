Ridiculous. Annakin, 9, turns into an angry 19-year-old brat, Annakin, who somehow looks appealing to Amidala, 5 years his senior. Now 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has some nightmares, and so leads to the slaughter of children, friends, and the whole structure of her existence because a mad old man convinced her a) his precious wife can actually die, and b) only he can avoid this. Ludicose squared. <br /> <br /> I think the people who like this movie are not paying attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are unbelievable (literally, not the perverted sense of "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the whole series, but at the climax, he cuts off Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava and lets him suffer. Anyone think it's a little out of character? Not to mention that it was too stupid to give him a chance to live, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> I was expecting at least one story to show characters consistent with plausible motives. None of this here. The story could have been written by a 10 year old. <br /> <br /> Ah, yes, the CGI is pretty cool.
