I saw the movie only recently, although it appeared in 2001. I expected to see a fun movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The "princess" is not very talkative, as you may have noticed ... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who just looked to make his point, then beat the shit out of the opponents. Throughout the movie, I waited to hear at least one confession about what she liked, why she was fighting, whom she loved and trusted. I waited in vain. Poor quality film. Low quality dialogue. Do not watch unless you want to be bored! It's so bad that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration an hour and a half. About. I give it a 4/10.
