An interesting idea involving an alternate dimension within a hospital. He recalled - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and episodes of the twilight zone. Strong atmosphere, the setting was great. There were also some very smart "time loop" moments, which always have this head-melt appeal. The story had many vague references that led me to believe that all the following weirdness - slippers / ghosts / a strange bat-winged demon and a ghoulish thing wearing rather silly heavy metal would be explained. And that's how the Dark Floor severely disappointed me. Based on my view, the movie DOES NOT EXPLAIN what is behind the events. Although, some ambiguity is always expected / welcome in this type of films. Dark floors led to new heights of imprecision. I do not expect things to be wrapped in a pretty ribbon, but I should not be feeling "Huh? .. is this? ... I got rid of?" Maybe, I said in the chapter to jump by mistake? The Dark Floor left me with a deeply unsatisfactory suspicion that "it was all a dream", which is a shame, because until the last roll I was very on board and enjoying the movie.
