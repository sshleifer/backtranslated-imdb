A warning to potential viewers: If you're looking for an adaptation of the classic story "The Most Dangerous Game," look elsewhere. "Seven Women by Satan" <br /> <br /> only superficially addresses the original work using the name of Zaroff and having said the character assassination of people. <br /> <br /> Some of the following items may be considered by some. to be spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine. While their ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey they really challenged, Boris' victims are usually in a position where they can not defend themselves. The film wanders from scene to scene with an almost total lack of clarity. The director seems to have disregarded the pace and left the viewer with a stifling film. Some individual scenes are slightly interesting (like a torture sequence), but as a unit, the film can not entertain. Viewers who are most interested in a variety of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of nudity may find the film watchable. Most will probably find their time better by watching the Mentos commercials. <br /> <br /> On a separate note, the extras on the DVD included a good amount of information about the movie's history. Apparently he was banished for several years in his native France, which virtually ruined any chance of widespread distribution.
