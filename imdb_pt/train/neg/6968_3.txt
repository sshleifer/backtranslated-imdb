An older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be withering. He is bitten by it or bitten by something in it. He quickly becomes ill, and in the hospital spits a large contorted white larva of some sort. A later attempt to resuscitate him with oars results in a splash of blood. <br /> <br /> A police officer is in the hospital because his partner was seriously injured in a shootout. Somehow, the cop gets paired with one of the female doctors as well as an entomologist who is brought in. There are several young children wandering around the hospital, which I suppose we should find lovable, but which are extremely annoying. brats. They enter the room where the specimen is being held and dump a growth hormone into it.

People flee and sometimes for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by military personnel who are prepared to destroy everything if necessary. <br /> <br /> There are no really convincing characters in the movie, and most of the time it seems like people are looking for the monster. It was pretty annoying. Obviously, it owes something to the Alien films, with the monster being born into a human and having various stages of its growth. There is also a character named Bishop, and the lead actress has Sigourney Weaver's hair.
