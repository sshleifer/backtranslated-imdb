After finally seeing this movie in its entirety, I am completely bewildered by the adoration it has received both critics and online users. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I would not say that. But "the last great Western American," a phrase I saw applied to him more than once? Not even close. <br /> <br /> A film that tries to tell a story like this needs convincing characters who speak a convincing dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most banal and clich√©d I have ever seen. The film can be measured in moans per minute; how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There are so many examples of this that it is a distraction. Lines of cheese come at you in waves; predictable, not original and often. <br /> <br /> If a bad dialogue does not bother you, what about bad shootings? Few Westlanders can show you a gun fight that is completely unbelievable, while desperately trying to get you to take action seriously. It's okay if there's a comic story in such shootings, as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very staged and rigid choreography of the early shootings is just one more reason to leave this movie off the list of goodies. The final confrontation rescues the director a bit in this matter, but by then I was so disinterested in the film that was beyond saving. <br /> <br /> In addition to these flaws, I can say that the look is impressive. movie well shot and the settings everything looks great. Acting is acceptable, especially considering what the actors received to work. However, if you're looking for the ultimate great American Western, do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
