I know John Singleton is a smart guy because he made Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and direct it? It's like the pilot of a bad "go to college for the first time," teen soap, a parade of stereotypes and boring cliches with some gratuitous violence to make it a commercial proposition I guess. Who would have guessed that the rape victim would pour sausage with seafood? The angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of neo-Nazis (and I'd stick with a Negro and a Jew - just to laugh!) Even Laurence Fishburne's reactionary history professor has just irritated me and I love the guy, it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Great ups.
