I really wanted to like this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I do not want to ruin this movie - do not worry from the beginning, you know something bad is going to happen - but here's an example of how this movie was made bad. Cowboy and "Twig" climb the ridge. Cowboy has a mustache on the handlebars. Cowboy and "Twig" go into a shootout and run through the middle of the ridge. Cowboy's shaved in the rest of the movie. At some point between the armed struggle and the descent of the mountain, the cowboy had time to shave, in the dark, on the back of a horse. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the acting of the four main characters is solid. .
