The version of this movie I saw was titled 'Horror Rises from the Tomb'. The horror in question is a perverse medieval magician played by the Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy, looking like he is playing Abanazer in a church panto. He rises from his grave when a stupid descendant (I think he is a descendant, as he is also touched by Naschy) returns to his ancestral home and gathers the head and body of the mage, who were separated by the sorcerers who executed him , in an attempt to stop him, er, coming out of the grave. <br /> <br /> Obviously, once the head and body are together again, all hell breaks loose and many people die. Like all good magicians, Abanazer here has a lovely assistant. This is touched by another great Spanish terror, the beautiful Helga Line. Like virtually every other woman in the movie, Line periodically takes the kit. There is a lot of nudity in this film, and not just feminine - we even got to see Naschy's bulging body, which is not a pretty sight, I can tell you. Most of the film's sexual angle is ridiculously free. There's a particularly funny scene in which Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and suddenly decide that they both have a blond-haired dick they've ever owned. <br /> <br /> It's also pretty bloody in some places - especially a Herschell. Gordon Lewis-esquire moment when Line dips his hands on a man's chest to remove his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the very effective zombies that appear at the end. They are quickly frightened by a fire and do not bother to return. What is a shame. The scene in which the zombies rise, however, is the most ridiculously inept moment of the film. Everything happens from a distance, and we have no idea what is happening until we see some figures staggering in the distance. There are lots of junk like this, thanks in large part to the bad editing. When a worker falls under the hypnotic spell of Naschy's head, there is a large close-up of his face that seems to last forever and is useless. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's not a great horror movie, but fun enough. Of course the version I saw was a dubbed American version that had probably been cut to pieces. As far as I know, the original Spanish version could be a masterpiece ...
