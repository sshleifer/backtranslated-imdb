One wonders if at some point in the production of this film there was a script that made some sense. The rough cut lasted 3 hours and was trimmed into the incoherent mess that survived? <br /> <br /> Why would anyone finance this mess? I'll say that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a good-looking young man and he does what he can <br /> <br /> with dialogue and dramatic situations (?) That he receives. But the characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is non-existent, and acting, cinematography and direction are (for a politely) amateur. Not a sleep is an unfortunate choice of title as it will probably be fake if someone really try to actually watch this movie.
