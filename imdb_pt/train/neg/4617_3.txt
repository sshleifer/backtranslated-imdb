Eight academic indications? It's unbelievable. I can only think that it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards. With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as protagonists, I would probably have swallowed the bait and watched anyway, but the Oscar nominations really sold me, and I distinctly feel cheated as a result. <br /> <br /> So it's a black comedy? Can someone tell me where the mood is in Prizzi's honor? It's certainly tasteless (the shooting of a police officer's wife is just another supposedly comic interlude in this much-talked-about farce about mafia life), but with the exception of a joke about "his favorite Mexican cigars" (which I imagine to be an old joke to Americans who have been officially banned from buying anything Cuban in the last 50 years) I could not detect anything comical in nature - and I tried. There are a lot of Mafia clichés, but cliché does not constitute humor in my book. <br /> <br /> Is it a romantic comedy? Never. The characters and their relationships are so incredible and superficial that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is it a clever parody of the Mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is simply absurd, rather than comically absurd, and usually has the feel of a really bad (and cheap) Mafia movie. It looks more like a tribute than a parody. With one-dimensional characters and little in the form of humor written to them, the actors are left making dishonest accents and pulling faces. Well, that's not enough; even when the face is being drawn by that comic facial expression master, Jack Nicholson (filled with swollen lip ... now this is to be a parody of Brando's flat dews in The Godfather? ... Oh! ... all I know is that it's not funny). <br /> <br /> Play in a slow and slow direction (this movie drags on for 2 hours), some hopelessly stupid dialogues and clichés like; "Do you remember Camora? Well, we're much bigger, we'll trace it wherever you go," and clichéd mannerisms and you'll be reaching for that fast-forward button before you can say "capiche?" Prizzi's Honor is far from being Huston's "masterpiece" and is a very bad last job. It is definitely a work on the canon of the great director who must receive a concrete overcoat and played on the Hudson River.
