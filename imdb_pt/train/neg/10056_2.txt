So ... we see images of Brando ... interesting, but not exactly Oscar. Susannah York was hardly sloppy. The new scene in which Lois discovers that Clark is Superman is a bit unbelievable since he does not realize that there are empty spaces coming out of the gun instead of real bullets. Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then thrown them down, but they forget ... we'll hear Donner making fun of Lester's version that made more sense. The President speaks of Zod "disfiguring" the Washington Monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Fitting this scene made this line completely absurd. The superman's "freedom of the press" line sounded silly compared to "..Care to step outside," which was delivered better and had a proper connection to Clark's previous scene at the truck stop. Then there is the end with the effect of "returning the world to go back in time". He returned everything throughout the film and made you wonder where exactly the rocket pointed at Hackensack, N.J. has already, since it does not release Zod and company anymore.
