I'm a cool guy and I like to think of myself as being tolerant of gender. And, I guess with that, I mean, I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre in which it resides. If nothing else, it saves me from feeling that I should be saying really nasty things about people or movies, which I do not like to do. <br /> <br /> The plot in this was evidently obvious, the very low production values ​​and sets, uhm, simplistic. The performance has turned into "good for a college play" territory from time to time. My feeling was that it was filmed in one day - please tell me who it was. Worst of all, sex, although reasonably abundant, was rather mundane, hampered by, at least in my text, a "sound-over" that was inconsistent with the action (groans and climatic screams while lying on a bed undoing a bra ???). There was definitely no "advantage" in it - nothing distinctive or interesting, and with surprisingly quick cuts. <br /> <br /> My vote is a "1" then with the following summary statement: it would have been better if the club's filling material had been expanded and the rest of the film condensed.
