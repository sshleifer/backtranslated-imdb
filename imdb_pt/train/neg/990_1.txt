Do not waste your time or your money on this movie. My roommate rented it because I thought it was the other movie called Descent (the movie about some travelers getting stuck in a cave). So we decided to watch anyway, thinking it could not be that bad. That was it. I can not believe this movie was actually produced and released to the public. It was so horrible that it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away, but you can not do it alone. I honestly feel emotionally scarred. It was from a low-budget film in which a college student is assaulted by a boy she's dating a porn movie. And it really is not good. I went from hating the woman rapist to almost feeling bad for him. Almost. All in all, a horrible movie that was definitely rated NC-17 for a reason. Do not waste your money. And do not let your kids watch.
