I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie, but, wow, that got crappy, or should I say, "just stupid". This is just another example of outdated humor. It may have been funny in 1940, but not now ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I especially liked him when he began to change from his boyish look and loud voice of the musicals of Busby Berkeley to where he is mature and also seems. <br /> <br /> He was just like "Jimmy MacDonald", but the rest The cast played only stupid characters, the worst being the boss (Raymond Walburn) of the Maxford House Coffee Company, who did nothing but shout the all the time. He was brutal to listen to and was a big injury to the movie.
