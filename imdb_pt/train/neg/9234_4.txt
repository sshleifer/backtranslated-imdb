Remade today, this movie would be a very scary, very disturbing, dark comedy. Persecution, obsession, and a web of lies and manipulations receive a 1948 glow of harmlessness that is not cute. Drake plays the stalker, a shameless user of people, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays the stalking victim, alternately irritated and unconscious. <br /> <br /> Very disturbing; I have not been able to look at classic novels with the same suspension of disbelief ever since. <br /> <br />
