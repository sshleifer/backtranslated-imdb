This movie seems to start in the middle, introduces the peripheral players as if they were significant and presents main characters with no substance and stories of thin and / or impenetrable background. Almost no one has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film. The plotting ramblings and finally does not come to naught, the dialogue is clumsy and banal and the director has little concept of how to get the best of their actors. It seems like there is a first half of this movie, but it was never made. <br /> <br /> We were told that a mysterious pyramid appeared in New York and that Central Park inexplicably became an Arctic desert. However, none of this seems to have caused much agitation among the general population and is only a minimal concern for the government. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to the "evil corporation" in eugenics, but this is really just a convenient concept to populate the universe with a pair of powerful minions. The whole double entender of "Eugenia-Ã©-mala" is heavy and never fits here. We should be concerned about the central characters, but we never learned enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely underdeveloped that it is a fatalistic rationalization of 1 hour and 40 minutes for rape. <br /> <br /> In the world of "innovative" digital animation created here, all I can say is that at about the same time this film was made, several other directors did the same thing with more consistent results and convincing. <br /> <br /> After spending time to watch this movie, the most pressing issue was left. in my mind was "so what?"
