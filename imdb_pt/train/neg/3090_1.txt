I really do not have anything new to add, but I felt I had to comment on this bag. So here goes: Atrozes. I'm going through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for the tenth time. It's very, very painful but it was next on the list ... You can see that there is a small core of a real movie buried beneath all the crap that is "Hobgoblins" but it just could not get out. Everything about this movie is the fourth rate. The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the "action scenes", the ... ahhhh, forget it. I can watch a piece of crap like "The Blood of Dr. Z" (also known as "Zaat") repeatedly with almost no negative effect (I actually like it - btw, it will be on TCM later this month - October , 2009), but "Hobgoblins" is a complete baseball game. <br /> <br /> The worst part of it all is that now it's about 12 hours after the movie is over, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my remedies, and yet the ersatz " New Wave "dance music that Amy, Red Shorts and Laraine Newman were playing in the living room is still going through my head. This torment will last for days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, will not you?
