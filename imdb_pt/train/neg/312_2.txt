If you have seen this movie, you know it! If you do not have it, and want to watch a classic BAD movie, I suggest you watch this movie because it ranks well with the worst. So, if you're really bored, go rent it. If you want to know how it is, here is my short summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some models of Ms Universe and five other people. Adam does not like how a passenger is picking up all the babies, and he tries to take over with the funny jokes. BUT WAIT! It just gets worse! You'll have to rent the movie to see just how bad it really is.
