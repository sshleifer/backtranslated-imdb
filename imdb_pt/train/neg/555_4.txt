The film is quite confusing and ridiculous. The plot is horrible ... but on the positive side the acting is very good, with some good shouting and complaints. Sharon Stone is fine this time ... not even half his original mind. The murders are not as bloody as the first, which is a shame. It is not the unpredictable mess that everyone says it is. Sex is quite graphic at times, while others of course it is fake (they are fully clothed). The script is weak most of the time, but the playful and argumentative scenes between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights. The plot turns a few times, but the ending is horrible. The tension is always constant with a huge dose of 'Oh my god!'. The chase sequences are brilliantly directed, and the shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to a movie that otherwise seems to be faster. Sharon's stone is a little old for that, too. The pieces where we see her breasts were, in the first, delights. This time they are too horrible to describe. The movies are fairly average, but worth going. Mainly because the film deserves a good buzz ... with the opening sequence being a highlight. Not to be critical, but if you liked the first - leave this. Do not ruin the race. You will be glad to have left this stone unturned.
