They should have called this movie: "Adopted Mouse Brother Who is Slightly Inspired by Someone Vague Stuart Little Memo, Who Kinda Skimmed the Book a Little But Mainly Just Remembered the Cover" If it was not so misleading I would give It's a review best. <br /> <br /> But seriously, people do their children a favor and ask them to read the book. They can actually learn something instead of being mind-numbed by what we all know as a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The book Stuart Little is not about a mouse, it's about a person who happens to be very small and mouse-like. He was born to his parents, not adopted. The book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey in which he embarks. There is a cat named Snowball who thinks he is food and wants to eat it, but Snowball can not talk. <br /> <br /> In the movie they spoil it all. I think the only things they kept from the book were the boat race and the names.
