An unexpected glitch from the normally reliable Larry Cohen (God told me too much, Q, etc.), the Full Moon tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably, even with decent turns from Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin seems embarrassed throughout his performance and son Adam just seems numb. This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic.
