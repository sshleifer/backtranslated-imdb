After hearing compliments about this movie for years, I finally decided to rent it and watch it. Let me start by saying that I am happy that the rent was free from the local library. This movement was slow, boring, unrealistic and the plot made no sense. After 2 hours, I was ready to bombard that Texas town and put the group of these characters out of their misery. I realize that the taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand all the hype I've heard about this movie. Dallas provided as fine a detail of life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can afford enough money for critics to convince the general public that a bad movie is good.
