First of all there was really nothing in this movie that really grabbed me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie where I said "Well, that was nothing special" after I saw it. There was probably drama and stuff, but it just did not grab me, but more semiduras. As I said in the headline, it seemed very cheap in a way. The quality of the film itself (the pictures) sounded like a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap movies made for TV movies than a well respected English filmmaker. The camera angles and shots were very amateurish as in my opinion. It really did not have close photos or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. I did not see many English films and the ones I saw really did not impress me more than that and they seemed to do something similar with camera work, colors and such. "Game" tried to be cooler, cooler and clever (see my review of "Lola Rennt" about it, if you like), but it was not successful either. Overall, just a little indifferent movie that was nothing special (at best, I'm scared) and basically, sadly, more than two hours wasted.
