This show looked good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like police series, but somewhere in the production, this show went awry. <br /> <br /> First, writers must have more suspects than one, you know who did it ALL TIME !!!!! This makes boring. The main character is incredibly annoying and unbelievable in any way. I know they wanted her to be tough, but she's mean, stupid and bad boss. The crimes are uninteresting and bland, and it's just a failure all the way. As said above, I hate .... <br /> <br /> On the whole, this was a big disappointment and really bad ...
