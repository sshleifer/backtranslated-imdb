*** NOTICE! SPOILERS HERE CONTAINED! *** This is a semi-autobiographical look at what might happen to Madonna if she were to get stuck on a deserted island. There is absolutely no challenge for Madonna in this role, and it shows. She's just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can not even get it right. I know what you're saying, you're saying, "How do you know that's what Madonna really is, you've never met her!" Correct, I have not, but we all remember "Truth or Dare", right? I know Kevin Costner does. <br /> <br /> You might think, in the year 2002, that Madonna might have learned something, one way or the other, from the "cross" women who also made their way through the silver screen. For God's sake, did not Madonna see "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the world of cinema HOW IT'S DONE !!! Mariah kicks Madonna's butt to the curb in beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, her name! All we see from this glimpse into Madonna's world is that she's the only one in it. <br /> <br /> If there is one thing to be said for Madonna, it is that she is consistent. When she was a darling of MTV, she put the world of women's fashion back 20 years ago. Now, in the movies, she has put women's roles in the movies and in society for 20 years, glamourizing all the most hated, horrible, reprehensible and odious qualities women have a reputation for locking in, qualities they have tried so desperately prove that they do not really have it. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ARE THE SPOILERS !!! DO NOT READ MORE EVEN IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ... This is the only good thing I'm going to say about this movie, and I was really impressed with it. They did not go to the "Hollywood Ending" - the Madonna character lives. In Hollywood's typical and happy ending, Madonna's character would have died on the island, and her husband suffered, oppressed and beaten would have been free to finally settle down with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be the exact opposite. of their deceased wife, and both live happily ever after. But in this most depressing conclusion, she is rescued, and once again this poor victim of a husband is again sealed with his wife demon, and his life will be hell again. <br /> <br /> *** HERE SPILL THE SPOILERS ***
