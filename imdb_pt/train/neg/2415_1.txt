... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire look for "life hood" you're in the wrong place as well. If you're looking for a laughable piece of film, this is a real winner! The performance is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by. I can tell he made the voice to the 911 operator also by the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box conversation, it would probably sound like this guy. Oh yeah, and the "zombies" made their best snake impression that is on par with their FANTASTIC acting in general (note sarcasm ... HOW DO NOT YOU GAIN A BOTTLE FOR BEST MAKEUP) Quiroz ...... did not do no kind of direction. I felt like I was watching a piece from the improvisation period (the period is more like that of Los Angeles 1990). The direction, however, is overcome by the worst script that I think has already graced a movie. I have not heard such beautiful lines, like the epic that begins in the movie "F ** k!", Since Ice Grill, which was another "urban" thriller. This just works, of course, in conjunction with the hip-hop soundtrack also epic! All 3 or more of his songs! All in all, what the hell did you expect from a movie titled "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with the intention of laughing at all the scenes, and boy delivered it and MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror movie (yes right ...) for the night. A memorable experience for sure!
