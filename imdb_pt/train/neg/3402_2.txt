See why the Jane Show does not work. Once again, Canadian producers and writers can not create a sitcom without putting a different twist on it. I think these people do not watch a lot of US TV, which has the sitcom down pat model. No, here we have to do something different, we have to make the story absolutely absurd and then have a significant B story to try to make up for it. The characters are two-dimensional and the story lines are well above: Forklift races ??? Give me a break. Here's a little advice for show writers, Do not write funny situations, find the funny thing in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write really funny things, not just being an impromptu monkey.
