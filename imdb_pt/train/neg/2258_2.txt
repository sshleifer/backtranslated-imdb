You do not need to write a script for this outrage! You just sit and watch a couple of women and guests deluding each other before an uncontrolled audience on "The Jerry Show"! Violent and nasty, this money from Jerry Springer's real show reveals everything the over-rated talk show does not show for you on the air - unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by "Cops" producers. "Even the outside world of Springerland reveals the most amateur performance of the decade!" This shows that THE GONG SHOW MOVIE had a central character in a movie turkey.
