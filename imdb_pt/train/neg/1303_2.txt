Edward Montagne's tattooed Stranger should play like a crime thriller with a bit of mixed-up movie noir to flavor. Instead, it's a reckless and inaccurate look at low budget and uninspired movie production. The plot is absurd and the performance excruciating and hard and amateur. John Miles, who has had a pretty lean curriculum in the industry, smiles and chuckles, and everyone acts as vividly as the characters in a government-made movie about driver safety. The film anticipates shows such as 'Leave It to Beaver' and 'Father Knows Best' in its abnormally healthy view of New York in 1950. Why, the viewer can not even see someone light a cigarette until a good-natured woman is interviewed in a flophouse in the middle of the movie. The only thing the film has for him (besides his brevity) are the excellent location photos coordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the film works in favor of the filmmaker, since the viewer is treated with well-framed photos of the interiors of New York City and wide exteriors. Unless you want to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles, I suggest watching almost any other movie.
