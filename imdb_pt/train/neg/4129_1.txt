After watching half of it, I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I held on to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is poor - far worse than acting in the 1980s T & A films. There are several mood attempts that fail miserably and the film is 100% predictable. Maybe if you're a teenager, this movie has some appeal, but for those who watched a lot of movies, you'll know how the movie will behave after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony, waiting for the final credits. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this.
