I usually do not like Sydney Pollack-directed movies ("The Firm" being an exception) and I've never been a Robert Redford fan either. Still, I thought "Three Days of the Condor" should be good because of the number of praise comments he received. While widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing to the eye and Max von Sydow does a good job as the ominous professional killer, I found the whole case tremendously disappointing. The film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the messy plot that does not seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> The film also contains one of the most unsatisfactory finals I've ever seen that really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what about this absurd novel between Redford and Dunaway? I'd rather watch any of Hitchcock's movies five times in a row than go through that piece of junk again.
