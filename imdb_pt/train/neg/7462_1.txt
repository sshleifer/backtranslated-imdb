Direction should be the problem here. Recently I heard John Cleese talking about working a play for Fawlty Towers. He should attack his car with a branch. The first branch was very fragile and it was not funny. The second branch was too stiff to be funny. The third was just fragile enough to be funny. That kind of attention to detail is lacking in "Corky Roman". No matter how embarrassingly bland the comic strip was, it was not repaired and was not left on the cutting room floor. The only value I can find in this movie is like a study of a very flawed movie that somehow escaped distribution without being repaired. <br /> <br /> I have reviewed dozens of other reviews here. The number of ratings praising this absolute waste of time reinforces my suspicion that some people are being paid to promote titles. I can not understand how anyone over 9 could rate this title more than 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is medium. I can not imagine anyone, even those who make money from it, rate it up to as much as the average. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst movies ever. And, hey, I really like the Three Stooges and I can tolerate Ed Wood!
