I had high hopes for this movie, because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature) was absolutely fantastic, the most surely cinematic film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> But a lot of CLAIRE DOLAN is totally meaningless and flat. Scene after scene seems randomly thrown into the mix, without much thought for narrative or character. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not? Hard to say. Why does she take the trick at the airport if she wants to escape this life? Why does not she pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her dye her hair with what is practically the same color? Why does Claire accept some johns and not others? The filmmaker does not seem to know. <br /> <br /> It is as if everything is improvised (although I understand that this was not the case) and the filmmakers held a camera as if they were making a show. After the screening, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative options by condemning narrative as politically conservative. It sounded like an educated rhetoric. I think it was a way out. <br /> <br /> I'm saddened that the creator of a movie as exciting as CLEAN, SHAVEN would make a movie as lame as this and then defend it with fatigue. old "political" clich√©s.
