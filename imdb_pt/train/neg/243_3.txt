William Russ is the main character in all this made for the TV movie. He left his family behind only to reappear and start paying his debts. But he tries to stay away from his family. That's where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to return home. <br /> <br /> The story is medium and they managed to get an old star (Peter Falk) and use it. to a reasonably good degree. But William Russ was not truly a star. However, it seems that their acting is still OK. <br /> <br /> I found delivery and history very tacky on how predictable everything was. In fact, in the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like this. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was an insignificant film. In a letter classification system, you would receive a "D".
