I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, liked this dramatic comedy, but I did not. It stars Luke Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, School of Confidential Art). The director is Matt Bissonnette, married to Molly Parker. All three actors do a good job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third. Everything happens in a house on the lake and looks wonderful. The film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama, and I thought it should be the other way around.
