<br /> <br /> I am a big fan of horror / science fiction regardless of budget, but after watching countless late night horror movies on cable and video, this has to be the worst of all the movies. With bloody special effects (what looked like a robe covered in fake blood or ketchup that was being shown repeatedly) and people running around screaming from the left, then right, then back again. Should have stayed with the convenience store scene from start and stopped there and it was 15 minutes. Instead, it is dragged for a long time. It's very, very low budget x5. Many scenes were very long. Narrator sounded very amateurish as a random person out of high school was talking. This is the only film to be lower in my opinion than Manos, Red Zone of Cuba, Benji and Godzilla Vs. Megalon, despite its higher budgets. 10 snoozes, try to stay awake through an entire movie in a setting or, better yet, avoid it as you would with a multitude of undead brains. The Why-Made-Me-Always-See-This-Part-Of-Zombie-Scarab-Blues. Epitome of nauseatingly bad films made, etc.add infinitum. -infinity / 10
