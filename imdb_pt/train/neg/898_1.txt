Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is completely and totally rude, raw, coarse and lude. This is, in fact, the only way to describe this terrible and useless stand-up game. Eddie Murphy goes for shock value, instead of laughing to try to win his follow up. He gets to be funny occasionally, but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and nasty sex jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Unless you like Eddie's dirty style. I do not think I'll worry about "Eddie Murphy Raw". I much prefer Eddie to the limits of a movie script. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
