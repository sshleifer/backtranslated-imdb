This is the last time I rent a video without checking in on IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote wrote the truly awful Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed this junk as Out of Sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a great actor and it's a shame he got involved in such a bad movie. There is a confusing and frequent edition that seems to have been a last-minute decision to make up for the lack or history, filming and simply common sense. This movie does everything wrong. What were they thinking?
