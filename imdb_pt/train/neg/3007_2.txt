Well, in the endless quest for horror, we come across this movie, apparently re-released on DVD recently for some unholy reason. The transfer is awful and the quality is awful. I do not think this is due to a bad remastering or anything, I just think the movie is poorly done. Obviously, filmed in an abandoned school with a budget that was undoubtedly wasted on cheap and untalented beer, "Slaughter High" starts slowly and does not increase the pace until about an hour. First, we see a "nerd" while he is chosen by a group of ... I really do not even know what they should be ... athletes? The leader, with his ultra hooknose, is so ugly that he should definitely be chosen as the nerd. So there's a "big guy" and a couple of losers and dumb girls who should be "hot", but they're not. It's a mystery why this group of rejects is choosing one of them, but I think the viewer should presume that these are 'cool guys' catching a fool. The cast choices are horrible as most high schoolers are played in their mid-thirties. As other reviewers have pointed out here, the actors (if you can call them that) are a bunch of Englishmen whose accents escape several times along this piece of crap. We are left to assume that this group of 'children' were the only students in this school, as the 'meeting' of them is just them in school, which is now abandoned, it's just them. <br /> <br /> The killings are thighs, blood is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: "This place gives me shivers ..." and "Someone give me a beer" are highlights ... Not good. Skip this one, unless you're getting lost with some friends and want to laugh at a real slasher attempt. If you want to see well, get "Bay of Blood" from Bava, made 14 years earlier and much better. If you want to see a good destroyer, see "Just Before Dawn" or "The Burning". 2 out of 10 children.
