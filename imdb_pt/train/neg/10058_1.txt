I was fascinated by how bad this movie was. Should the viewer learn anything or reflect on something here? What happened to the pumpkins? Should I be impressed by the photos of the motel? Does it matter if there are some garbage bags on a roof across the street from a hotel? Why the unsuccessful narrator mocks the people he interviews (it's so obvious that he edited the really informative parts of his interviews to get rid of). The best part of the movie was the interview with the film teacher that tells us how bad this movie will be before it even ends. <br /> <br /> I'm really impressed. I believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community.
