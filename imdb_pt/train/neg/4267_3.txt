I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Festival, as well as presumably all the other voters. The director was present and seemed to have worked hard and been very committed to the project, which I think explains the above-average reception and brand. It's more like a full-length episode of Aussie kids "Round the Twist," but he takes himself too seriously to even have this redeeming feature. The film itself is worth seeing if you're trying to tour the movie world by visiting all UN member states, since I can not think of another Fijian movie, but overall it was generic, poorly represented (albeit by an amateur cast) and attached to the subaltern mentality. The moral of the story seems to be that the natives of the island will try to get in the way, but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor, all problems can be solved (leaving the island).
