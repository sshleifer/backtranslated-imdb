This British movie is really awful, and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, even though he's dreaming about it. The idea of ​​a bomb on a train looks good ... but it turns out that this train has just been parked for most of the movie! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is evacuated, so there is no danger to anyone. In fact, this movie could be used in a film class to show you how NOT to make a thriller. The real thriller is generated by allowing audiences to know things the characters do not know, a fact apparently unheard of by the director. SPOILER: The train has two bombs, but we're led to believe there's only one. After the first bomb is deactivated, it seems that there is no longer any reason to watch the movie. But at the last minute, the villain, who has no apparent motivation for his actions, reveals that there are two. Nor are we sure that when the bombs explode, we will not even have a classic sequence of "time bombs". A good 10 minutes or more are spent watching French wife of Glenn Ford thinking about leaving him and then asking where he is. She's such a boring character that we do not care if she reconciles with him, so when that happens, there's nothing emotional about it. Most of the other characters are quite devoid of personality, and none of them have problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it seems long because it's tedious and monotonous. Do not waste your time.
