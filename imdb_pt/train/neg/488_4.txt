A horrible movie! It must have been against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They took the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and baffled him. My complaint is not that they took liberties with the facts; if the story was good, that would be perfectly fine. But it is simply bizarre - according to all accounts, the true story of this artist would be a much better film, so why did they invent this bleak script? I suppose there were not enough people in the factual version. It is hastily ended with a summary of the artist's life - we could have saved a few hours if they had favored the rest of the film as quickly.
