METAMORPHOSIS I'm working on the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie on the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS appears to be a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire," which also featured a scientist struggling for similar results. Defined in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie. <br /> <br /> A university researcher is working to break the human genome in order to create a serum that prevents aging. Pressed by the administration to publish their works; and produce some results (or risk losing funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first, thinking that he did not suffer adverse side effects, he finally discovers that the serum really changed him in the most unexpected way! <br /> <br /> The performance is booming; and the performances left me with very little interest in the film. The score is encouraging. And the science behind the experiments and their discoveries is not just fallacious; Is nonsense is ridiculous ?? at best. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the ending turns into a 30+ minute gag, which is seemingly endless. Without much attention, I would call this one, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde find the Black Lagoon Creature and find Casa Alone."
