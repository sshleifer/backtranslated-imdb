Again the same familiar story about a man (writer here) who sells his soul to the devil to have his most desired ambition in life: success. Stupid script (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand the "strong" message of "Christianity" (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a long judgment scene in the finale where Agent Hopkins hit the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things she did to this nasty character. There are no bad efforts of the actors (Baldwin also as director, Cattrall in a role of "Sex and the City" again, Aykroyd with a few funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Also try a not so popular movie from Greece called "Alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man give his soul to the devil to regain his youth)
