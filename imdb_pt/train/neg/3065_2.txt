This movie represents the times when it was made as much as the original, I suppose. Which is really sad, because on a deeper level, the title 'Vanishing Point', the original, is so ironic. I'm sure it was not meant to be, but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971. The REAL 'DISAPPEARING POINT' was the end of an era, which virtually ended in the early '70s. In this remake, all the countercultural elements were removed, and more PCs were rendered in an attempt to reach a wider audience, presumably. "Sanitation for Your Protection" <br /> <br /> The insertion of American Indian scenes was gratuitous, and the idea of ​​a "noble purpose" for the trip was subtraction by addition. I am glad that I watched however, made me appreciate the original that much more. The original is a cult and golden classic. This remake is terrible.
