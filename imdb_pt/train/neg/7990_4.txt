'Anita and Me' is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic England, more or less like 'Bend It Like Beckham', or more closely, 'East is East', with which it shares a scenario of the 70's. cheerful (despite the dark country accents) but the film does not have the vigor of East or East and the result seems rather thin and banal. In addition, the picture of the film's central relationship between an Asian girl and her white girlfriend is insufficiently profound to justify the way the film is structured around it. I also got tired of movies in which the hero years to be a writer, this is of course often something that real writers have tried but hardly a new element in a fictional story. 'East is East' was fun and sharp; 'Anita and Me' seems obvious and dull in comparison.
