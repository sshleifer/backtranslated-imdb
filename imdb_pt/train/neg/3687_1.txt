It's not just that this is a bad movie; it's not just that four of the "best" producers of Mexican films are in this film; and it's not just that the script is terrible. It's just ... this movie sucks ... big time. These people are wasting money on terrible scripts. We're supposed to criticize Mexican society, but we're fed up with that kind of movie. Is bad language supposed to be funny? I dont understand. The Mexican cinema is in trouble if this type of film continues touching (and being written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please do not think that this type of film is well received in Mexico: we hate it. they and they do not reflect us.
