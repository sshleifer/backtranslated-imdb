I could not watch more than 14 minutes of it. It's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad direction. The photos used are disgusting, they broke the 180 degree angle all the time. My head hurts trying to watch this load of "you know what." Dirt in the "mysterious machine" window makes you see the light from the lighting in the windows ... annoying. What else ... is so badly framed all the time, it's just making you want to scream at that lady driving there. I only directed short films, but I'm sure it would be a lot better than directing a feature film ... the story is unbelievable, only the long scene of French kisses at the beginning says it's going to be very bad. So, okay, try to avoid these really bad movies at all costs, you'll save $ 5 or more for the rental, and that 1h30 of your life you'll never come back ...
