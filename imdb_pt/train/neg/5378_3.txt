I watched this movie not really expecting much, I got into a pack of 5 movies, all of which were pretty terrible on their way to less than five, so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has some (and some stretches) interesting points, the sight of an occasional camcorder is a nice touch, the drummer is very much like a drummer, well, actually , the problem is that it is so boring, in that I can only assume that it was an attempt to create tension, nothing much happens and when this is totally tedious (I was with the thumb on the button forward, ready to press for the biggest part of the movie but gave it a chance) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that looks great, because they do not mention how beautiful he is, I thought He looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I did not even mention the killer, I nor am I going to get into it, it's not worth explaining. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, Star and London are just the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (which was pretty funny) it was not because of their acting talent, I certainly have seen much worse , but I've also seen much better. Best to avoid unless you're bored of watching the paint dry.
