Amy Heckerling's second film, Johnny Dangerously, is a parody of the 1930s gangster movies made in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle-aged gangster who looks on his hard life when he catches a child trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has health problems, so Keaton falls in crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord of Boyle and Keaton eventually climbs the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious twist like Danny Vermin, that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother who became district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor, his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton. The film seems notoriously cheap, making it look like a television show instead of a theatrical movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogues and jokes, the film remains in the first half, but then quickly loses steam and drops to mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the stage making his best impression of James Cagney. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are just nasty, not funny. Piscopo does the "once" a little too much. Several supporting actors try to hold onto the fort as Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as street vendor, Alan Hale Jr. as reception sergeant and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous janitor. The second half evolves into a hit or a kind of television show and never recovers. The closing scene using The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is the film by Clark Gable called The Call Of The Wild seen in a tent at the beginning of the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the target audience would surely be aware of the 1939 launch date of The Roaring Twenties. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
