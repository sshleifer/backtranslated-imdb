It's a bad movie, but I must give to the lead actress of this ... Francine Forbes. She seemed to be acting at least and I personally thought she was kind of cute. Too bad she only appears in another movie in the database. In addition, the film is full of scenes of blood and death. People are stabbed and they GUSH like 2 liters of blood! But, if you like watching poor horror movies, I highly recommend this.
