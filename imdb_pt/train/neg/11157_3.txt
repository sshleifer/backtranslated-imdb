Hip. Erotic. Evil sexy ... anything. It's "The Terminator" with werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. The cop rescues the girl (waitress!) From the great monster and refers to himself as his "protector." Lead actor Ryan Alosio does a good job mimicking Kyle Reese ... there is a massacre at a police station ... the villain is muscular with red eyes ... and even contains dialogues like "You said yourself, he never It will never stop. " The awful script comes from a first-time screenwriter who, thank God, has not sold anything since, and all of this is played together by famed director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The movie starts at a strip club. (always a good sign), and a medium-sized biker guy walks in for no apparent reason, pursued by three policemen. One of them is black, and (shock horror!) It is he who is killed in the first five minutes. The movie goes down the mountain for about an hour, then picks up a few decent action sequences, before ending everything with a lousy end. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, the cast is seen as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who is willing to settle for less. If nothing else they seem to be learning how to perform in this film and Alosio, along with some of the support cast, shows signs of talent. DarkWolf in his human form is played by the immense Kane Hodder - famous for his numerous interpretations of Jason Vorhees in the films "Friday the 13th". He is decent enough, especially considering he is not accustomed to speaking in papers. <br /> <br /> He has become famous among groups of teenagers excited for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who takes the kit out a few times in the great tradition of former Power Rangers actresses. And it's annoyingly clear that the editor spent a lot of time on that scene ... anyway, the main redeeming feature is that the physical effects of werewolves are good, and the wolf's design is not bad. is bad. Simply bad. I mean, seriously, if you can not achieve some level of realism - why bother? Just throw in some extra money on makeup! Besides the terrible script, this movie has moments, many of which are unintentionally funny. It's good to laugh if you have nothing better to do, but do not spend money on it. Please.
