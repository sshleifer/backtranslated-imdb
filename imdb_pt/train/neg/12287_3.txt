The late 1980s saw an unexplained eruption of supernatural horror films in gloomy penitentiary settings. Renny Harlin's superbly sandy and melancholy "Prison" caused all haunted hoosegow ball to roll; was immediately followed by the markedly lower "The Chair," John Saxon's fun and despicable "House of Death", the passable psychic "Destroyer" and this hideous exercise in hopelessly comatose boredom. His usual annoying collection of chowderheads of terribly unsympathetic college students taken by the moody tormented Alex (the extremely nasty Nicholas Celozzi) goes to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden and horrible death of Sammy Mitchell (played by Toni Basil, famous for his "Hey Micky" fame). Alex's brother becomes possessed by the demonic evil spirit of a vicious cannibalistic commander of US Civil War cavalry and continues the expected killing, forcing Alex to overcome his passivity and stand against this morbid spectrum. <br /> <br /> Although photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg, with some decent pieces and a scary atmosphere (the film was shot on location in the dark and rusty ruins of Alcatraz Island), "Slaughterhouse rock" cut it like a solid and effective feature of the scare. This is due in large part to the uniformly unpleasant and unpleasant collegial smartaleck characters, a vaguely smiling bunch whose vain comic pranks prove to be annoying rather than amusing. The acting flat from a remarkably uninterested cast further harms things, with former playmate Playboy and supreme hot blonde Marie Marieman making an imitation of Linnea Quigley especially annoying as the sexually manipulated nymphomaniac. Dimitri Logothetis's direction exhibits a flamboyant visual style, but the tone is uneven between somber seriousness and nonsense, horribly silly foolishness, and the most damaging, sloppy, inconsistent, overly complicated, and ultimately confusing script of Ted Landon miserably fails to develop the internal logic necessary to make the exaggerated story even remotely plausible. In other words, this stinking man is able, with sadness, to make scarce 90 minutes look like an excruciating cinematic prison sentence.
