In this day and age of incredible special effects from movies, this was a big disappointment. The actors seemed rigid and uninspired, as did the dialogue. Westerns are not so commonplace for Hollywood these days, but movies like "Silverado" prove that someone still knows how to make a good movie. Considering this, it is difficult to conceive that anyone would spend any expense on the release, let alone create such a weak movie. If you love and are looking for a good western, keep looking!
