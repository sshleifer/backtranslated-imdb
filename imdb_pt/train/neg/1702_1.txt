Let's be honest here: the only reason someone bought it, the only reason someone reviewed it, and the only reason anyone could claim to like it is because David Lynch did it and because you want to have David Lynch's children. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce crap. Maybe Lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience the absurd in yourself as a pure matter of knowledge. Perhaps the atrocious and cacophonous sounds and the visuals of chicken scratches should suggest something about the place of humanity in the world, about our relationship with the Real, about the absurdity of everything. <br /> <br /> Instead, it just says one thing to me: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to offend because of the offensive, I could put Hansen up and let my ears bleed. If I wanted absurdity for absurdity, I could just put a crap on a plate and watch it for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is only one redeeming quality in Dumbland - it's a goal, a funny goal. That is, it's so bad that it's not funny because it's so bad. This fact, however, is a bit funny. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, then buy Dumbland. If not, spare yourself the agony.
