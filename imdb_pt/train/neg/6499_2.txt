What a confusing mess I saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open-minded for the many marvels of cinema, but this is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> Although there may well be some good ideas / concepts and certainly there are some good performances (given the circumstances), everything is buried under a random absurdity. Sir Anthony distances himself much from the same genetic heritage of Natural Born Killers, U Turn, and similar films as far as editing is concerned, or he may have seen Nixon as inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least most of the time he has a method for madness. <br /> <br /> His quote from claiming that he made the film as a joke says it all. Not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
