Ok, I rented this movie because of the director ... he made some interesting films in the past (if you have not seen Waxork yet, you're missing out on a fun ride). Anyway, I had my doubts about this movie from the beginning, but I decided to suck it up and take a look. It's bad. Very bad. If you have not seen the movie yet and do not care about the spoilers, read on. First of all, the old saying "You can not judge a book by its cover" applies here. The box for this movie seems to indicate that Jill is the stone fox with long hair with lights. The back of the box has a cool photo of the red leather Jill and some other photos. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it is good. You begin to watch it and suddenly you discover that the movie happens (inexplicably) in 1977. Jill is a total dog that is not the girl on the cover. The movie is not as predictable as you think ... and that's not a good thing. The characters do so many stupid things without any motivation ... it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie Dolph and another lady have sex without good reason. Besides, what was the point of having Dolph killing this other cold-blooded lady who was helping him. Anthony Hickox, the director, should have seen a stench when he read the script. If it had been put into the underworld of the new millennium and made the half-intelligent characters, it could have been decent. To define it in the 70's makes no sense and has no influence on history. Avoid it!
