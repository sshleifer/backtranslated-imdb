Here's a movie with a good cast and good location job, but he just does not have it. Director Richard Brooks must have been a little tired at this stage of the game; How much better has your PROFESSIONAL been! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion, even during non-slow scenes. This movie needed to be speeded up, if anything. That horse foam looked awful to me and the obvious tire trail in those desert-tracking moments-just lazy. sloppy work. What a pity. The actors did okay, but I've certainly seen them all do better. Ben Johnson is always a joy, however. I saw this movie for the first time almost 30 years ago; was then disappointed and remained so after the second showing 30 years later.
