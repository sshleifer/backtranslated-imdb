I really felt cheated after seeing this photo. It looked like I watched this movie for 101 minutes for nothing. I do not understand what they were thinking when they did it. It hardly enters the murder of Jeffrey Dahmer and has no end. It looked like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. It was like watching a TV episode of the Sopranos. This ends suddenly, and you know there will be another episode next week. I also felt that I watched part 1 of a two-part film. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they were lazy, they ran out of money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to make a Dahmer 2. After seeing this movie, they all sounded very accurate. I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. Suddenly I hear this song playing, so the writing appears on the screen and tells how Dahmer fulfilled 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a colleague arrested and killed at 34 years of age. Wow, he leaves a walk in the woods for his death in jail. How about showing him how he got there? How about showing Dahmer's trial? How about showing more details? I can not even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place. I actually found myself saying in disbelief, "Is this, this is the end?" I want to conclude this review by saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie yet to be made. For the filmmakers, I'd like to say that if you do that, do it right.
