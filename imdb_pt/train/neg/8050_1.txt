just below the surface is what? A simply horrible movie is what. <br /> <br /> As other viewers rightly commented, the storm sequences are simply ridiculous. Cut wood already soaked in the rain? now this is smart. threat? feeling? sexual tension for those read dull and invented, dull and invented and dull and overly invented. <br /> <br /> I want to thank God for the sara mia shower scene, but in retrospect I think the producers of the movie having seen the complete mess scene realized that they had to put something to do halfway worth the penalty. then this just becomes more of a gimmick. do yourself a favor and give it a miss.
