The House of the Dead was the worst film I've ever seen, between the pathetic 'matrix' 360 camera angle attempts and the tacky acting that I've fallen asleep. I do not think the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I would rate this movie as 1 of 10, (10 being the best, being 1 the worst). Also skipping scenes from the movie to the game was very annoying, makes you wonder if they were just making up for lost time. I beg you to read it, not to see it. Not worth the time.
