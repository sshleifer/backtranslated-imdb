My girlfriend and I were shocked at how bad this movie was. After 15 minutes, we would have given up, except we were too curious to see if the movie could redeem itself. I did not understand. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the compliment given to this movie. The writing was absolutely horrible and delivered by some of the worst actors I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that bothered me especially about this movie was that often when people talked to each other it was an unnatural pause between the lines. I understand using a pause to create a sense of strangeness (as in happiness). It was not that kind of pause - it was simply a bad direction. This movie may actually be much better with subtitles, and perhaps the outside market is the best for this movie, because then dialogue and inappropriate acting would not be noticed. <br /> <br /> I usually like these quirky little movie types (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Charming and Wonderful), but this one failed on so many levels that I consider one of the worst movies I've been through. last years.
