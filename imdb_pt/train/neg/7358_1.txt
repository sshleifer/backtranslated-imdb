This lifestyle film takes the victim of middle-aged divorcee who then finally fights back genre to new depths of the absurd cartoon. <br /> <br /> Here the 40 something stay at home ex-wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter in college) is starting a new life after her divorce, helped by a college friend to open a new store of clothing as a kind of franchise expansion agreement. She even began a friendship with her attractive, maybe a little younger, architect / bib (who is black). But then the horror of the horrors of middle-aged women, ANOTHER 20 something feminine that she has taken on as a tenant to leave a room, begins to "take over" her life. <br /> <br /> What this new threat of a younger woman really does is flirt lightly with the gardener, and offer her a glass of wine that * gasp * really belonged to the divorced !! She runs up to the utility bills for not turning off the thermostat !! And backup the bathroom! And it leaves bad old food in the fridge! And hang your pieces of art (African) in the living room !! And so on. Well, she may have killed the cat too. Yes, okay, the extent to which he does these things is bad enough. But it's more than ridiculous, especially when it turns into a campaign. "The reality of the character is that any small part of it would drive this crazy woman mad (so why did she rent the room - and horror of the horrors?). , a much younger woman?) <br /> <br /> Supposedly this increasingly arrogant young woman (natch) has a mania of control of apprehension. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight against this evil (and erotically hot, of course) 20 something. But there is this problem. Any time the 20 something starts to get into trouble she uses her power - and just flirts or has sex with some guy, and escapes the consequences. (Well, there is really something for that good-looking ability, in the twenties. It's simply not * usually * used that way.) The premise is driven by the device of the 20 something it took the divorcee to formalize the agreement to rent her room with a written contract produced by her. Of course the 40 things do not know about these things, and the 20 things have been helped. The lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the entire house during the lease period, with utilities posted at the fixed price. Even if an eviction process is soon pending, the 20 something soon receives a temporary restraining order against the older woman, allegedly because she has threatened the 20 something. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all the disgrace of the sexy and sweet young lady. Finally, the "heroic" battle of 40 people back to THE HOUSE then begins. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horribly easy TROs (or protective orders) are for women to get involved with nothing more than their unfounded saying - although they are usually just that easy against men. Sometimes they are as unjustified and so motivated to take control of a home as here. In fact, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often take them dumped from their own homes or condos based on no proof but just an unfounded claim of threats, and sometimes without even listening to their side. Even when there is an audience, it is routinely impossible to refute claims of threats (to prove a negative) when the burden of proof is effectively upon the accused instead of the accuser. (This is one of the only areas of American law where this is true - and it is a sign of outrage at feminist excess, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course, it is not likely to be the subject of any Lifetime movie in this life. <br /> <br /> The absurd basic premise of this film depends on the explanation that the thing is psychotic and is not taking the remedy. Still, it does not make sense. She is not behind the successful ex-husband lawyer, although she gets her help (to the ex-wife's fury) in her quest. She is behind the house (technically, to expel the divorced during the contract period). This second youngest woman is after all that is left after the divorce, after affairs with another 20 a few years STOLE her husband !! (The ex-husband seems detached and basically solicitous after his adventure - never mind, he still strayed !!!) <br /> <br /> The protagonist is good enough in pursuit of his age. But your vision, attitude and focus are so small, misaligned and totally unimaginative or life force that it is impossible to care about it. Well, a core group of Lifetime fans worries, I think, judging by the average score that the small number of reviewers gave. (I kept watching just because it was so bad and caricature that I had an appeal to the camp.) I could not resist seeing how far they would take. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (if such a thing is possible with this movie). <br /> <br /> Well, here's a clue. The film ends with the 20 something being rescued from prison, promising to "listen" to his 20 something male co-worker and sometimes lover, and "do what he says" and "let him take care of her" (he means get her to continue to take the medicine) - and then deceiving him and returning to THE HOUSE. There, she climbs the stairs with a knife, chasing her demonic enemy 40, who is bathing by candlelight, confident in the thought that the younger woman is out of his life. There's a fight - and the 40's something the mother earns - putting the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of antipsychotic medicine she found. She then starts caressing her, Mother, and the two women have a moment of feminine solidarity! How sweet.
