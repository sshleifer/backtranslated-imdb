Jude Law gives it all in this beautifully filmed vampire movie that offers little more value. Completely lacking in eroticism, excitement or leadership of women with appeal. A decent fight, some moments of slight suspense. And a plot of a note. <br /> <br /> The film is philosophical in a series of conversations between Law's character and an obstinate homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are engaged in the cross of the banality of the film. With a minor actor in the lead role - and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis' cinematography - the Crocodiles would mingle the sea of ​​low-budget vampire addicts.
