It's very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies. They get worse all the time. Niki and Flo (2003) are a depressing stab at the camera. It is unfortunate that, of the many films that are made annually in Romania, the worst films are sent abroad (eg Chicago International Film Festival). This film without plot, acting or script is a waste of time and money. Rated: 0.02 out of 10.
