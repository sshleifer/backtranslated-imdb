I've seen enough of Little Richard in interviews and performances, and enough of poor Leon focused on those 50/60 musical photos to know that Leon was not the right actor for that role. Leon was as sure as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but he can not capture the essence of Little Richard in this movie. <br /> <br /> The actor Miguel Núñez, who played Little Richard in "Why do fools fall in love?" was a much more appropriate choice, having taken away the musician's powerful, yet effeminate personality. <br /> <br /> If the performances are not convincing, the film will be too. And that's what happened here. Concealed or wrong are the incursions of LR into homosexuality and voyeurism. What "The Temptations" did so well in capturing the group's rise, warts and all, this movie misses by a wide mark. <br /> <br /> What is happening to director Robert Townsend, who started off so well with "The Hollywood Shuffle"? He's a talented and funny guy, but he did not deliver anything close to that first effort.
