You get a gift. It is exquisitely wrapped. The box in which it is is made of the best wood and shows the skill to the smallest detail. This is then wrapped in beautiful paper, handmade and hand-painted by the most talented of artists. The whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made of fine silk lace. It is a sight to behold. <br /> <br /> So you cut the ribbon, tear off the paper, open the box and find out ... nothing. This is TOYS You want to take the pack or forget it. <br /> <br /> The film does not have its purpose: war is not a good thing. Well, that's not original! Morality is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to point out. And even this weak vision is undermined by a story in which elements of war - particularly war toys - are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys. It is as if someone preaches a stern and condescending sermon, only to end by saying "Just kidding." <br /> <br /> But even as an empty box, the film does not go through a thorough examination. Yes, it is a spectacle to be seen with some remarkable and striking images. Scenarios are imaginative and cinematography captures colorful scenes with skill. But the images are cold and emotionally barren. Like the screenplay, the film's appearance is carefree and sometimes aesthetically sterile and surreal. It's a movie that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, but shows that they are creations of a world that is empty and cold. The film struggles to be funny, in a half-gloomy way, but humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as the besieged heir of a toy-making empire, plays on his impromptu improvisation, which only seems strange to the bizarre and coldly structured world he is inhabiting. In fact, the topical references and insipid sexual insinuations that are scattered everywhere are tremendously contradictory to the childish fable that the film is vaguely trying to be. For this movie to work, or make sense, it needs to be set in its own universe, a distant Oz from Kansas. Every time the jokes bring us back to reality, the movie's toy becomes more and more an obvious farce. <br /> <br /> They say this was the pet project of director Barry Levinson, whom he had been struggling to get done. for ten years. It is obviously obvious why he had difficulty getting support. Like most of the pet projects that are finally made (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER and BATTLEFIELD: EARTH being great examples), it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision. Maybe Levinson had directed and redirected TOYS so many times in his head that he did not have a new vision when he finally entered the studio. He had perfected himself to death. <br /> <br /> Many of the toys featured in the film are awkward, mechanical and rope monstrosities. So it's the movie itself.
