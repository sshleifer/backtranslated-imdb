NOTICE! DETAILS OF LAND REVEALED! <br /> <br /> I can find virtually nothing positive to say about this movie. It's written so badly that every character is a caricature, but it seems to take itself seriously. It's badly fused, especially Ralph Macchio (all baby-face, 5-foot-none of it) as a difficult streetwise. Plot elements are all drawn in black and white, with all situations almost immediately reaching an extreme climax. Most noticeable of all (PLOTING ELEMENT TO BE REVEALED), perhaps has the most gratuitous and inventive naked scene in the history of the semi-serious film. One can imagine the filmmakers saying, "We need JoBeth to drop his top ... hmmm ... I did it! ... at the beginning of the movie, we're going to give Nick some ridiculous dialogue about undressing in the aisles ... so JoBeth you can use that line on it later and you REALLY find yourself in the hallway ... yeah, that's the ticket! "<br /> <br /> I'll give credit to producers for tackling a heavy subject in 1984, one that turned out very heavy in the late 90's with events like Columbine. However, the execution is terrible. This movie could have been a somber comedy in the vein of "Heathers", a campy political statement like "Network" or a serious examination like "Brubaker". Instead, he tries to be all those things - and ends up being none of those things. "Teachers" earn an F.
