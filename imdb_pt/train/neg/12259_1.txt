A film about a group of filmmakers who wants to make a documentary about a new type of surf in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of movies, including some types of animals or vicious monsters, I thought this could be my kind of movie ... it was not !!! This should be another guideline on how not to do this! It has a lot of accidental humor and the evil beast is an incredible joke, in the final scene it goes after the main characters * rolling *, the feet are obviously swaying in the air! It sounds ridiculous! Good for a laugh though. If it were only because of the lack of talent among the actors, the embarrassingly stupid dialogues and the hilarious and stupid crocodile, it would be a laugh at least, but it gets even worse: I think the people responsible for this movie have noticed how weak it was then they thought of the old idea of ​​"sex sells" ... Totally, I mean TOTALLY, for no reason, one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast. And somewhere in the beginning there is some kind of meaningless "catch". This is the last ingredient that makes the movie an absolute piece of junk for me. It's amazing how people actually spend time producing this crap! If you're looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie !!!
