A scientist on an island is in deep sorrow over the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark? Well, who would not? It is a bit difficult to deal with the fact that the hammerhead shark that is killing everyone is constantly being called "Paul". In addition, William Forsythe's cast as a MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday-type hero lacks credibility. On the other hand, there are some hotties that make you really look at the screen while the Paul shark bites another to death. In fact, I find the b movies to be fun. But for my taste, it would have been a much better movie if it was made to say $ 10,000 less. Then it could have been fun.
