The biggest success of National Lampoon remains "Animal House", and rightly so. It was funny, loud and humorous. <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of all the other Lampoon national films. Including "Class Reunion". <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or the fact that John Hughes wrote this confusing confusion. This meeting is as hilarious as the root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> A star, and that's generous. So again, I always found that most of my former classmates were demons, vampires and serial killers as well.
