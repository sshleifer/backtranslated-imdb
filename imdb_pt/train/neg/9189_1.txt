This movie received a lot of bad press from people who do not understand what it should be. It must be understood that this film was never meant to be taken seriously. It is the camp, in the same line as the "Army of Darkness". AoD was silly but funny and bad in a good way. "House of the Dead" is not "pretty bad". <br /> <br /> There are qualities inherent in good exaggerated films, the most important of which are believable fantasy. You have to believe what is happening in a movie to see the mood when the situation gets incredibly wrong. Without limits, the film becomes absurd. HotD has no credibility. <br /> <br /> Worse, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same twists and turns of characters that many horror films inevitably begin to display. For example, horror films often fall into the trap where the main characters find love between blood and destruction. I do not know about you, but when I'm being chased by zombies, I want to be with a hottie. Believe? Not? So you probably will not believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in that movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the obvious problems that haunt this movie like so many other horror films, Uwe Boll has decided to add scenes. of the zombie videogame being filmed, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is there no clear justification for this artistic choice, but it distracts the person from an already unbelievable plot. In addition, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and seemingly no attempt by the director to guide the reactions of the actors to the events ... leaving the film without redeeming qualities. Avoid...
