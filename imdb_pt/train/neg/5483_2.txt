I just spent four dollars renting this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a bad excuse for a movie is beyond me. But even more surprising were the reasonably good reviews that some Canadian reviewers gave to this movie. I'm tired of our media justifying a movie simply because it's Canadian and low budget. It's as if they expect Canadian films to suck, so they give a good review regardless. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie: The acting was below average (with the exception of the male protagonist, who was actually very good). The quality of the film was poor, which I think could be expected from the extremely low budget. The script was absolutely horrendous. An example is the story, which revolves around one of the main characters, a drug dealer who flirts with one of his clients so he can recruit him to fix and steal bikes for his gang, whose sole purpose is to randomly destroy SUVs. Supposedly many of her gang members' bikes are destroyed in these activities (I do not know how she can not afford to buy new ones, since she's supposed to be a great link from Vancouver to Toronto). Anyway, the point of the story (not revealed until well into the middle of the movie) is that the drug dealer plans to build incendiary buildings in the Toronto area to try to make the houses more affordable - since no one will want to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - I need to say more. <br /> <br /> Shame at the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film, Telefilm for supporting it, and the Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers to give such tendentious opinions. <br /> <br /> A movie should not receive special treatment just because it's Canadian !!!!
