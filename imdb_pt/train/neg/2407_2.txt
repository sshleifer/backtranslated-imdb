I watched this today, partially attracted to the cast of stars, and partly because I enjoyed so many other films of that genre. However, this is one to avoid. There are dozens of poorly cut scenes where continuity simply does not flow, the challenge of billiards at the beginning, for example. The fighting scenes with the natives are as good as you remember in those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you see a spear flying in the air and the camera cuts to a dead native lying flat on the floor with it glued to his thigh. Is this instant death? There are also several unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers. The really bad clay toys are too painful to watch. If you see this movie, the crabs that advance at about 5 km / h are the highlight. Somehow, someone can get close to David Mccullum and give him a pinch. It is as if there is no time to get out of the way, like when the obelisk in the city falls, the native has all the time in the world to take a step left, but no, he screams and drops him. I only give it 2 because of Ekland. And why does Mccullums' voice develop a stutter as the movie progresses?
