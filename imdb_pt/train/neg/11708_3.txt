Explode how this movie was made. I watched as I worked from home writing emails and answering the phone - I just watched because I expected the "revenge" part to be good. Needless to say, revenge and forced twists were not worth the emails during which they were observed. In fact, I do not even know what happened in the end. the performance was as bad as the re-enactment scenarios on the FBI Files program - by far the worst re-enactments (actually only "Arrest and Trial" can be so bad at scenarios). I did not even know the protagonist was in the third blind eye until I looked at the movie here on IMDb, but it's obvious why he has not made any movies since. I hope he's a good singer.
