REALLY? REALLY???? I know that if you make a political war movie, you will be noticed, but this movie was just crap. Horrible in every way. Terribly inaccurate in many ways. I find it easier to believe that the President of the United States is dressing, piloting a jet fighter and knocking down aliens. It is easier to notice the few things that were right. My jaw dropped when I saw someone say that this movie was the best of the last 25 years. It was overacted, seemingly useless plot deviations, and had questionable cinematography at times. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, utilities ACUPAT ?? Has anyone verified that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you had to do extensive research, it was only five years before this movie came out. I am a veteran of the Iraq war and if you spent a day with an infantry platoon or an EOD squadron you would realize how bs this movie is. Comparing this with Platoon or Saving Private Ryan is ridiculous. Why do not you play Commando and Red Dawn there too? I think those may be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see beyond the unbelievable plot, the historical and factual discrepancies, then this movie may be fine. Just it. If you keep listening to "Oscar", and you have to add your own pompous review, go ahead. As for me, I'm writing to the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back.
