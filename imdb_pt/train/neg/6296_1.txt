This movie looked interesting; I read the book a few years ago and he informed me that the feature followed the outline of the very strong plot. <br /> <br /> I started to watch it and almost from the start it did not live up to expectations. In fact, I did not bother watching the whole thing ... total nonsense - bad performances, bad acting and instantly unpleasant characters - that was the point of the movie, I think. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie left a bad taste in the mouth and put me in a downer for the remainder of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with this feature.
