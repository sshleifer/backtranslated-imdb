The only words you need to fear more than Joe Don Baker, if you are thinking of watching a movie are Greydon Clark, and if both are there, run for your life. However, this is a very funny movie because they really take themselves seriously! It starts bad and down the hill there, repeated scenes, the shooting Good The Bad and The Ugly will make you roll on the floor with so much laughter. Yeah, he's the best sheriff in Texas, following a mafia killer to Malta. as only he can. He makes his own rules, does things his way, all the time wearing cowboy boots and artillery cowboy style. Do you want to see a bad but funny movie? Go ahead, it's your move!
