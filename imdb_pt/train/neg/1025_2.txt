That's the only question I have left. Why was this movie so bad when it had a great cast? Why was the writing so bad that it left the audience completely disconnected from the characters? Why did not that make any sense? Why did the studio make a perfectly good premise and "Hollywood" when all it needed was good, telling smart stories? Because? I've never understood why movies that start well turn into a heap of crap the moment they're released. I hope that, because of Freeman and Spacey, who are Oscar winners, this will never be released on the big screens of America. <br /> <br /> As someone who is a bachelor of Journalism, the whole story is just totally laughable. I just ... I think the script had potential, but the execution turned it into a clich√©, and a terrible one at that. Only. Do not.
