I was very, very disappointed with this movie. started out really well and built a fantastic atmosphere and suspense, but when it finally came to reveal the "monster" ... it turned out to be just a psychopath with skin problems ... again. Whoop-to-do. One more crazy movie ... like we did not have enough of them. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the "shiver" is genuinely unsettling to see, and the way it moves and the strange sounds What it does are pretty scary, but I'm tired of renting movies like this only to discover that the monster is human, yet twisted, demented and bizarre. When I saw all the revealing rats early on, I was hoping for some sort of hybrid thing from monster-monster monsters ... it was so disappointing when the Creep was revealed. <br /> <br /> On top of that, some of the stuff in this movie does not make sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why on earth Creep kills security? What's the point, besides sticking a big horn signal that says "Oi I'm a psychotic and I live here" It's stupid, and only seems to happen to prevent the character of Franka Potente getting help. <br /> <br /> What the hell has he eaten down there? I have the impression that he was effectively surrounded, and only the unexpected opening in that section of the tunnel has let him loose ... so he has chewed mice all this time, and if so, why are they so close to him? Why is he so difficult to kill? He is thin, malnourished and not exactly at the peak of performance ... but seems to continue despite injuries equivalent to those that describe the non-psychopathic characters in the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD commentary says that it is intended to empathize with Creep, but I find it disgusting. It's a movie that's effective enough, but it wasted so many chances that it makes me sick.
