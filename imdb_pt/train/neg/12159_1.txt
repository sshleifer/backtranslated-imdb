I can not believe I actually watched this, but I guess I just wondered if this movie would be unintentionally funnier and funnier in the end. and it happened. the climax was the weakest performance ever given by the defense lawyer - so out of real life that even for a fictional story, it was very strange. no one on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did. and probably the worst promoter on earth. Why was he in court? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove that she was guilty. a simple search in his house would have resulted in the discovery of the rings. but do not go. he preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times throughout the trial - that was it. the lunatic lunatic was given a drug of truth to prove she was innocent, but not Brett. the lunatic almost had an altar of Brett in his house that could have proven his sick obsession. but again did not go. During the court scene, I felt the silent urge to take the needle from her hand and hit her several times against her head. even real weirdos do not look so silly fake "I'm innocent" as she did. And what does this movie tell us? never marry a woman with life insurance: as soon as she goes down the stairs, her husband will be thrown in jail, guilty or not. evil, bad men.
