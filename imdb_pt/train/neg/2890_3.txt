The past approaches a rehab addict when he reconnects with his sick brother and an ex-girlfriend after what he hopes will be his last detox period. "The dramas of life" presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable (not even writing has a bite or intelligence). The cast is made up of attractive actors who smile sadly at each other, and music and photography are dismal (some of the visual effects are laughable, indie-clich√© touches smelling of a paltry budget). Although written and directed by a man, this was produced by a woman, and I'm not sure, but I think this may be a distinct reason for that image on two men, separated brethren approaching, never icy, never seem natural or seems to be lived. It is an attempt to enter into a male relationship, but the careful and barren presentation is a fraud. No one's heart is in it, living, breathing or bleeding that stuff. "The Perfect Son" is quickly spread by many cooks in the kitchen.
