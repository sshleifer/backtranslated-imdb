This movie was very exaggerated. Many viewers, who thought this was "incredible", should be in the old school movies, because the whole movie is in the past. At first I thought the movie was just showing something of the past, so I was hoping the faded dream as enlightenment about the characters would pass, but just going. Basically, this was a movie trying to blend the future with the past, and the two did not mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You can actually see the blue screen with which the actors were working. There are a lot of movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there's no reason critics put the movie saying "it's the biggest movie ever made." It's just crap on a piece of wood. Nor did it help that the story line was so fucking. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to have this film produced, and I also do not understand how the actors in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. It's almost as if everyone read the script and forgot to read the fine print ... "Everything will be done on a computer". This was a movie that should have been in a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I'm really annoyed at myself for paying money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
