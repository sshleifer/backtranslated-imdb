I'm going to give a 3 just because it showed the story we need to know, to prevent this from happening again. I agree with the comments of the gentleman from the UK. The movie was pretty terrible. Every clich√©, no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look for the technical specifications of DE 529, or any Everts Class Destroyer, and you'll see what I mean. I am now your black history month in the US, and I will be called a racist just for saying this, but the story of this ship is not so good. They did some escort work, chased a "submarine" that turned out to be a hulk they attacked. Sorry, but the blacks did much more in World War II than this silly movie credits them. This movie makes you look like weeping. Let the name call starting, I can handle it.
