I do not watch a lot of television and I came across this show. Reality show? I hope this is not real. If I were a man, had a bad word and be married to someone so worthless, that would be grounds for divorce. I think it sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person he loves. That is one thing that is wrong with our world now, so many people in bad relationships, selfish and do not know the meaning of what it is to truly love each other. It is self-sacrifice and not something that should be in merritt. This does not give us a very good feeling, of observing what should be in private counseling. If your personality on the show is real, then he deserves a much better person who shows true true love and cares for him and enjoys him for who he is. Is this show a reality or compensated by ratings ???? I really would like to know. Sincerely, GB
