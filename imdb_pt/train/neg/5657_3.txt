I'm a big fan of Lon Chaney, but the screen written in this movie just did not work for me. The story jumps in a weird way (since then I've learned that the movie is missing a section), and the characters appear and disappear with a sudden irritation. Some of the captions are overly explanatory (for example, "because you're not a child anymore!" - cropping the image for a long time and slow - "you're a woman!" First time), but there are some spoken sequences that beg for explanations that never appear. (Let's hear the argument from Luigi and his blonde girlfriend, please!) The plot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively, if not technically) was disturbing to the point of being difficult to watch. To the author's credit, this issue was treated as a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the right and good inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (eg "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney does a good performance as usual, but I think he was better driven in the past - he overdid it a few times here, IMHO. I liked the sequences of clowns, and I was very impressed with the acrobatics. Loretta Young was charming, though surprisingly young. The movie has its moments, but so far it's my favorite photo of Chaney.
