I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not a gram of humor, not a gram of talent. <br /> <br /> I'm lazy. Generally, I see a bad movie and a curse. This was so bad, I actually did a review to try to save others from the completely boring mess I was victim to. <br /> <br /> I'm breaking my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> It is very lame to use a clean room. So boring. Watch 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, Shock, Shock' Absolute Crap that has some merit as entertainment. This mud looks awful, it's horrible, and whoever did it should feel awful.
