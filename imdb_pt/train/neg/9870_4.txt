I had several problems with the film: <br /> <br /> (1) The script - specifically, Kim Basinger's voice: Movies are not books; they should * show * the action rather than have a voice over * telling us what's going on. Occasionally I find a movie with a voice that works, but here it seemed more like a lazy way of writing the script. In fact, it seemed to me that she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice. <br /> <br /> (2) I did not feel any emotion in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and I also felt that Alex Carter's acting was very bad. This is a significant failure for me in defining the characters of Jessie and Thomas - without any connection between them, it seemed to me that she only wanted a stallion and that, for him, it was a matter of being deprived of sex. If it had been done correctly, the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book, I understood the middle age crisis of Jessie. In the movie, it sounded more like simple boredom. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I did not find the movie as bad as I turned off the TV. . . although this thought occurred to me.
