The cover art (which shows a man holding a scary lead pistol) would make it look like a martial arts movie. (Hardly) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the real title of the movie is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the US) This movie is loaded with homoeroticism. If you like that, then this movie is not that bad. However, consider these points: <br /> <br /> There are numerous close-ups of groin and extremities of actors, (one scene up features each actor with a protruding erection in his pants). The film is also bathed in garish. colors like lemon, peach and red. From a cameraman's point of view, this movie is a drag queen! Several scenes feature characters standing EXTREMELY close to each other, occasionally playing while chatting. Also, the hero's cousin likes women, and all the other guys in the movie are trying to kill him. Is there a message here that filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Should I go to the fight scenes? (Yes, somebody's private parts are caught in a fight.) The martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative. No fancy here, just your standard moves you'd see in an old Chuck Norris movie. There is also a car chase scene that may be the first low-speed chase placed in the movie.
