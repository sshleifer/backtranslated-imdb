This will be brief. Let me first state that I am agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians, especially xtian fanatics. However, this documentary took on a tinged tone from some angry teenager with his xtian mother for not letting him play video games. I just could not take it seriously. Mentioning how CharlesManson thought he was Christ to illustrate the point that xiticity can generate evil? I do not know if it was just cheap and childish - made the opposition seem ignorant. Besides, the narrator seemed only snobbish and pretentious. The delivery was a complete exaggeration. I can not take this documentary seriously. It might appeal to an angry teenager who will piss at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games.
