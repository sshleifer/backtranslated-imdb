this is amazing! Fidani (who was also a spiritist) was one of the cheapest directors in the world. This movie stole the original title from "Duck You Sucker!" but tell the story of an agent Pinkerton against the assassin "Testa di Ferro" (the unlikely Gordon Mitchell, a stunt double). Everything is poor and crazy in this film filmed in the beloved landscapes of Latium. The story is bad and crazy at the same time. Fidani was not able and naive at the same time. In the story, some kind of madness of illogical things happened (such as the discussion at the sheriff's house and the insane appearance of Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!? Yes, really Butch Cassidy, who is portrayed as an idiot). Terribles nuit americaine, absurd behaviors, illogical plot, bad acting and a fleeting appearance of one of the most awarded anchors in the history of Italian television, Renzo Arbore. Ah, sure: Klaus Kinski. Yes it's great and terrible but I'm sure he was only for money and to play with iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... DO NOT MISS IT!
