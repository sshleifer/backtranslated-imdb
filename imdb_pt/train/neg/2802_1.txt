I think if I went to a first school somewhere in the depths of the field and asked the last group of Englishmen to create a script, it would make more sense than that. I could then go to the first year of the drama group and they would act better than the clowns in this movie. That sounds really mean, but I'm sure they did it as a joke and are fully aware that they own it (see what I did there?) Nor the abilities to act or write anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Watch this only if you are incredibly drunk, tall or in need of a good excuse to find out why your decomposing corpse was found with severed wrists. Now I go to my aquarium and collect all the poop in the bottom. After that, I will shape it in the form of a disc and put it on my DVD player, hoping it will produce something much better than this trumper. <br /> <br /> Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 Breasts - 9/10
