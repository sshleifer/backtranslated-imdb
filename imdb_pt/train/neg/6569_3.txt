Max had the V-8, Trace (Wheels of Fires last and only hero) has a jet engine in the back of his car, allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the desolate wasteland half way. Surprise yourself when Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) is dissected and reattached as a new movie, although filmed in an uninteresting way with bad actors and lousy stunts. <br /> <br /> Why WoF is set? post-apocalyptic wasteland? Simple, the road warrior was! In fact, any question can be answered by: It was so in Road Warrior! Except for the mutant actors in the original 1960s film The Time Machine, who make an appearance shortly, to give the public a non-vehicular action to chew for a few minutes. In typical 1980s fashion, all cars driven by thugs that are bumped or lightly pushed explode in a huge explosion. Inevitably, all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will inevitably fall from them. Along with this kinematic wild ride of the 1980s is the rampant general misogyny in this cheap movie style. Usually I waited for Trace's rocket-powered car to accelerate and fire flames so there was another shot of him scratching his face as if he should be strong, which looks more like him looking constipated. Poorly choreographed action, coupled with poor acting, makes this movie a real flop. The value of unintentional humor can even wear out. <br /> <br /> Rats: Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior. And that alone is saying a lot! By this count Texas Gladiators 2020 is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A poor road warrior beats that he does not have enough cheese factor to make the film watchable. <br /> <br />
