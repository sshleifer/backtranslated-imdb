What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes are associated with something like that. If you're making a movie that involves baseball and showing baseball scenes, make the action look realistic. Why did the crowd always get up for no particular reason during games? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie .... what was that? Somehow we are led to believe that DeNiro has found his way into the field in a referee uniform, and that the game is being played in a torrential downpour ... one of the worst scenes in a sports movie. 3 stars out of 10
