Never, ever, consider watching this sad excuse for a movie. the way it is filmed, illuminated, acted, etc. it just does not make sense. It's all so bad that it's hard to watch. loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom. there does not seem to be a "normal" person throughout the film and the existence of the "outside world" is, well, simply does not exist. and why does this bald man suddenly become invincible? this movie is beyond stupidity. zero.
