Damn, I thought I'd seen some ugly Westerners. Can not top this one though. Hell, I think I'd rather have my clipped eyes open for a Trinity Triple Feature to cry aloud. I do not think I'll be able to watch Ben Hur again without laughing. Just too bad. <br /> <br /> But, hey, if you like stupid westerns with stars recognized in the thing, take a look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's so bad but so much funnier. 1/10
