It was all over with the slashers around 88, so it was time to beat those older movies. The Brain is well done, the script reminded me of Videodrome, but then in a more extravagant way as said before. Performance can go through this. But it's the effects that make you laugh, the so-called Brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown. The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching, the hallucinations are very well done and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street, remember the phone comes alive .... Some how you keep watching this movie, waiting for what is happening next. It is visible to all the freaks out there because there is no gore and as I said the blood is not there but there is nudity for the perverts. I've seen heavier movies than this one, I just wish they had made it more bloody ...
