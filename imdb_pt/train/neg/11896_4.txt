Before I begin, I love Eddie Izzard. I think he's one of the funniest ones for today. Possibly, that means I'm getting into it with very high expectations, but I did not find Eddie funny on this tour. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying so hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic book, and we all love him for it. But in Circle, he seems to be more irrelevant than funny, and he completely lost me in some places. Many of the topics he covers he covered before - I even think I recognized some recycled jokes there. <br /> <br /> If you buy the DVD, you'll find a behind-the-scenes look at Eddie's tour. (interesting in some places, but not very funny), and a French version of one of their shows. The tough ones will like to see Eddie in a different language, but the subtitled comedy is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Eddie, you already have it or go buy everything I say. If you are just passing through, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you will not be disappointed. With Circle, you probably will.
