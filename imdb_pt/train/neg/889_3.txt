I've never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime" I'm crazy to visit this city! I've been to NY several times and I love the city and its neighborhoods. I kind of expected to be touched by this movie, feel like jumping on a plane and flying there immediately, but here I am sorry for the time and money I spent on it. There are no love stories between people or people and the city. There are many dysfunctional meetings and relationships or people you meet and this simply does not work well. Perhaps this reflects a feature of the city, where it is said that thousands of people live alone. Can not you find love in New York?
