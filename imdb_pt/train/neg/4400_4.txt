One of the first Frances Farmer films; at 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in great voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in their time, is really tacky today. Roy Rogers also appears in a singer role. In my opinion, it's worth noting if you're a fan of Frances Farmer, and possibly a Bing Crosby fan.
