What could have been an engaging and emotionally charged character study is totally hampered by the predictable factor. Fox is as well as Nathaniel Ayers, the trained musician of Julliard who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney Orchestra until his attacks with schizophrenia take him out onto the street and end up unbalanced. Looking for a good story to boost his career, reporter Steve Lopez (Robert "rehab" Downey) knows him and tells his story. Taking all the elements of the classic "how we beat the skids" movies, borrowing very liberally from "A Brilliant Mind", taking the false "feel good" attitude of movies like "Rocky" - you choose sequence number - and whipping too much of the melodrama style of the 30's all that remains on the screen is a burnt shell of a movie. It is tacky, banal, totally predictable and touches very often on our feelings. I hate to say that, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hate it, people will give you a bad look. I really wish I could say something positive about this movie, but I really can not. The acting rescues in a way, but not enough for me to give more than one star. Strictly made for TV movie material. Not worth your time.
