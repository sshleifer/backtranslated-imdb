Although, unfortunately, thinking is (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie is mercifully fast. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of ​​the sadomasochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely banal, and John Lydon shows us, in the space of a movie, why he should never have freed himself from music. His performance is of an annoying and annoying note. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to make a good turnaround. Your last bad lieutenant would show how good actors can act, but fortunately their performance here is contained.
