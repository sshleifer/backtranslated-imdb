this was the most senseless movie I've ever seen, since there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the movie had absolutely no plot, I laughed so hard that my ribs started to hurt. the part where the old men when capturing Robert Duvall were ridiculous. on a level of direction, making a noir movie does not involve many rainy sequences and meaningless close-ups in the main character. This is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. since this was based on a "manuscript" of John Grisham, does not count it as one of his books to film adaptations, since it shows nothing of the suspense and captivating plot like films like "the firm" or "the maker of rain".
