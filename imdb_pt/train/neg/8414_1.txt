Yes. I'm sure I saw this movie years ago when it came to the Supremes. <br /> <br /> Another recycled storyline shone Hollywood-style, borrowing best movie scripts from the music industry. Nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More make-up, costumes and choreography = more money for Beyonce's questionable "talented" drawing. <br /> <br /> If you like kickback style, you should appreciate real groups that fought (without having digitized voices and a Hollywood empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonc√©'s involvement makes this garbage hypocritical.
