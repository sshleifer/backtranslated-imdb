That's the only thing I can say about this movie. Cleveland is the star, I've been there and I've never seen the city so beautiful. Beautiful river and urban landscapes. <br /> <br /> This movie is advancing at such a pace that they hope you do not realize the lack of relevance in the real world. People running and shooting with no consequence. For example, there is a shooting at Rob Lowe's house - two cars are stolen, and yet the cops do not show up there until much later in the movie. Rent murder never seemed so implausible. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this movie must be the recipient of one of the countless lost bullet movies. Many of the actors in this movie are much better than this. I check the date of the film just to make sure it was not written during the writers' strike, but unfortunately that was not the case. This movie is currently spinning on Universal's HD channel - unless you want to drool over Lowe, there's no reason to watch it.
