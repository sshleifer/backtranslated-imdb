I think if they made ANY MONEY make a complete bomb like this. I need to get into the film industry. I wiped my butt on a piece of toilet paper and did a better script once. Notice when the guy is running through the tunnel, they used the same 30 meter tunnel over and over and over and never changed the location of the stupid hanging light. <br /> <br /> I think if I get THRILL to meet the director of this GEM of a MOVIE, I think I'll start a fight with him and start with deficiencies in his LOADERS <br /> <br /> I guess I need to throw up now.
