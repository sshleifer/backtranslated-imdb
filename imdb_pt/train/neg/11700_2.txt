I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but after watching it I was very disappointed. The best part was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk can not act to save his life or any of the others. Some of the performances even made me laugh out loud! The movie was not as I imagined it, after reading the book which was amazing, I imagined darker and much more scary. If I were Stephen, I'd be crazy! <br /> <br /> I do not know why they changed the ending, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you just found out that the pie killed your daughter, you would not feed her to anyone else, would you ?! Book was much better!
