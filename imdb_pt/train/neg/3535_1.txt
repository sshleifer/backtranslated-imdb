OK. Who was? Who gave the Revolver 10 out of 10? Are you stumbling on ecstasy tubes? There were many of you. Did you do it for a challenge? Is this some kind of worship? Or has Guy Richie himself signed up 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before saying anything else, I'll say it. Just because you do not understand a movie does not mean it's not great. Maybe you had a bad day at work, or sat down to watch a movie after you had an argument with your wife and then you were not in a good mood. Perhaps there is a more fundamental obstacle - as if you simply did not have the mental capacity or a highly developed philosophical sense to get involved with it. BUT. And this is very, very big, but. The mega-size XXL the size of an elephant - but to do away with all the masquerades. <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not confuse incoherence with complexity and please do not confuse this two-hour non-squirter with an interesting movie. Same. You may think you're too smart. You may even think of yourself as a romantic figure: an independent thinker who defends a masterpiece against a chorus of pessimists who look like sheep. Please do not. You're embarrassing yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver is a waste of everyone's time. If you thought for a few minutes, you would recognize it too. It was a waste of the cast, a waste of the crew, a waste of vendors and definitely a waste of the precious minutes (you can not get them back, you know) from anyone who has had the misfortune to go through this unpronounceable and miserable . mess. <br /> <br /> "Do not wait," comes a voice in the darkness. "You just do not understand It's NON-LINEAR That means the story does not go into a DIRECT LINE This is actually the COMPLEX and SUBTIL work of an AUTEUR It addresses tough EXISTENTIAL issues And anyway - they defined FIGHT CLUB when you first went out - did not you hear? - Because they could not deal with COMPLEXITY They are eating humble pie now I bet you hate Lynch movies too, do not you? <br /> <br /> I hate disappoint but I am a big fan of Lynch.I like Memento, so a story told in an unconventional way does not necessarily fill me with fear.And although I studied this just a few years ago, philosophy interests me a lot. I do not like Revolver because of these heavy topics and big-brained topics, but I deal with them in an insultingly superficial manner to the point of being laughable.I'm not much of a chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​how chess works seems to be that of a four-year-old boy. I do not like it because the characters, without exception, totally alienated me. "Aha!" cries Richie's apologist. "Guy is skillfully giving the hat to Brecht!" Maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that he just can not write a decent script for toffee. <br /> <br /> Comparing Revolver with Fight Club is really instructive. The Fight Club has an acid-speaking nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. The revolver has an old-fashioned fortune cookie that rejects the lines that make your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great turnaround that makes you reevaluate everything that happened. Revolver has, as far as I can tell, several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because ... well, they do not make sense. If you keep pulling the rug from underneath the people, they will eventually drive you out of the house. And then they lock all the doors and windows. And they never let you go back. Ever. <br /> <br /> Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical implies repeating a mantra of short phrases. Mostly they are spoken, but often they appear on screen with assignments. It's almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this movie particularly remarkable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so well to all the clichés of gangsters in the world. Ultimately, it's so inconsequential. You do not care about anything. You do not understand anything. You go home. <br /> <br /> In fact, I liked it a little: the tense killer who has a crisis of confidence. He is great. But I can not recommend that you watch the movie just to see it. He's only been there for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. It's awful.
