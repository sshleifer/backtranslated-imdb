This film has been covered in scandal for so long that it has become a much sought after item ... indignation, mystery, etc. It had everything to be a great piece of footage, but ultimately failed at all. is a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror film, a lame erotic movie. <br /> <br /> The 2 disc DVD includes a beautiful booklet with stills, interviews, bestiality essays, etc., as well as an extensive interview with the director more than pretentious. For those who have heard about it but have never seen it, the package will look fantastic until someone actually sees the movie. Disc 1 contains the edited film, poorly translated into English, but with good visual quality. Disc 2 contains the cut of the director, in a terrible transfer, in French. <br /> <br /> What can I say about the real beast? a Kermit puppet, the frog, would have been more effective and shocking.
