This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega, I did not expect much, but I also did not expect this garbage. For starters, camera angles work against you in this game. The bike is your means of getting around. The bike is the worst part of the game. Whenever you run into something, you stay there and do not move. You never get off the bike or get in the way. The main character hardly talks despite having a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You ride through trees on your bike. The camera does the impossible enemy combat. This game would not even be worth renting.
