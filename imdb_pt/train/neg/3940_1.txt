This movie is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to pass this as a Blaise Modesty movie. If you are having trouble sleeping, then it all means renting this movie. The doll they call the actress who should be Modesty Blaise has to be the boring person on the planet. Maybe it could be used as a hat on the back of a real movie. Twenty-five minutes from nowhere, thank you for inventing the fast-forward button. If you see this movie, if you can call it that comes your way. I can not help but think that the Third World country could have used the money wasted from this crap. this movie is boring actors are boring waste of color a waste of air they breathe If you would like to see Mostey Blaise Film then watch what they did in the 60's maybe what the director should do.
