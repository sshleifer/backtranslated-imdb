I have a horrible pan-and-scan videotape of "Boom!", And I want to see it in all of its widescreen glory. So I voted "1" and I hope you do too. Together, we can pull this movie into the depths of the cinematic slag and expect someone to see an opportunity to make lots of money by launching "Boom!" in the extended version of its director. The film is one of my favorite whining - just look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the videographer, and you say to yourself, "Yes, I think you can fool some people for a long time" DVD release of "Boom!" We should note that, everywhere that has been shown, there have been crowds exhausted in theaters. But it was not until Frostbite Falls yet.
