I saw this movie for the first time not long in the series "Essentials" of TCM. The viewer's clich√© eye has never been more appropriate. This spectator saw little of value in this. I was intrigued by the endless attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Certainly, Mrs. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character is coarser than attractive. I'd think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would probably ignore Lucy rather than fall into an instant passion for her. In defense of Bacall, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight of his deterioration in health may have affected his performance. Of course part of that crap on Lucy's part was to contrast it with Marylee's slut, played to the fist and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene in which she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is by far the best scene in the film. Malone's performance outweighs the rest, although Jasper Hadley's fatigue with the disappointing behavior of his two sons is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Generally, however, I would have to say that I'm not much of a melodrama fan. The caricatured behavior of the characters only makes a story very implausible for my taste.
