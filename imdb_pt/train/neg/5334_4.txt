SPEEDWAY and live a little, love a little. So personally, I can forgive you for the misstep that was STAY AWAY, JOE, which at best pops up as an interesting glitch and is not all that bad. Of course, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are really embarrassing ?? like, respectively, an Indian doped to the character of Elvis and a noisy bartender who is also eyeing Presley - but is happy to see Elvis surrounded by talented veterans of Hollywood like Katy Jurado (like the Mexican wife of Meredith), two Jones? Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez, who is particularly amusing as the sarcastic boss of The Thundering Cloud, who is Meredith's stubborn father, still wearing the clothes of his old boss these days! <br /> <br /> Although there is a surprising lack of songs (if not undesirable given its usual softness), there seems to be no shortage of free-for-all parties were the male Indians hit the bottle steadily while Presley practice your womanizer skills in the back! As one might expect, Arizona's typically "western" setting is a major asset here, and the sleepy, snorting joke is not only a good but an important plot point. On the other hand, the climatic episode of 'house destruction' is one we've seen many times since and it does not work very well here ...
