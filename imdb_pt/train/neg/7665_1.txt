Honestly, I can not be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark gets only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. Can throw several useless plans into the air, but dropping all of them. <br /> <br /> 3. This completely disgraces the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based, being a complete failure in all aspects of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Doctor Boll, if it's really who you are (I'm thinking of proctology here), what on earth are you doing in a director's chair?
