This film has great noirish / neo-realist visuals, and tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar coverage, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes go on for a long time (especially the wedding), and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialogue more suited to the stage than to the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly disturbing, and seemed to worsen when the film continued. Most of the characters were Italian Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the 1920s and 1930s, but their dialogue sounded as if they were practicing lines for a play by Shakespeare as they mixed cement and laid bricks. Towards the end I was laughing, not because the filmmakers wanted me to. I think blistering poetry could be defended by saying that the characters spoke Italian, and the dialogue is a literal translation of how they actually spoke. But it absolutely did not work for me. Another line of dialogue made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly picks up a pretty bitch. British accent. I'm just assuming this has something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England. <br /> <br /> I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intent, but a considerably smaller note for execution.
