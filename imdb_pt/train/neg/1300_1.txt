This movie should never have been made. Honestly, I must admit that before I saw I had serious doubts. The director is not an excellent actress, although she has made many films in the Netherlands, and the young lady who took the lead is a TV personality with a constant smile on her face and little self-criticism. The actor who played the other main part that I saw recently in Bride Flight and although the film is better, it did not convince me. To start with the story, I have not read the novel it is based on, but the script that underlies the film is something that could have been done keeping in mind the kids having a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon, same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues, it was mostly spoken out loud. My compliments go to the cameraman, at least he tried to do something with that. It's a shame that the movie is bad, if not, some scenes have certainly been more reliable.
