It was one in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Do not judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We are back in time during the Spanish settlements. A group made their way to an island. It does not take long to find a great "reptile" that swallows your horse. Soon they are captured by the natives and, in order to gain freedom, they must kill the "reptile gods." The GC sucks; this reminds me of the CG of the first console video games. The meetings were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about it was the native hottie running around in a tiny outfit. Otherwise, it is only a medium effort.
