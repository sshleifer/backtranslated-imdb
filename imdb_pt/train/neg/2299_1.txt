Before you begin ... let me say that I fully believe in God. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay now that this is out of the way, I just want to say this What in the world these idiots who call themselves "hosts" think they are doing ?? The last time I noticed that a host did not discriminate, he spewed words of hatred on television, or tried to push his own beliefs down, to every unhappy soul venturing into the channel. All of these are crazy, stupid, conservative, beating the bibles, Fred Phelps's lover Pat Robertson does daily. I'm all for freedom of speech, but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture out of your ideal lifestyle, you're immediately sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of many problems. One day, in my classroom, we had a substitute teacher, so we decided to watch TV, since the teacher did not give us any work. And we (against many of us) attended the 700's Club, and of course Pat's idiot was talking about the Bible, and he said Simon in the line "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I actually heard a child "Hmm, I think he's right." WTF ??? Seriously, if the host is trying to make people think that another person's sexual orientation is a big sin then they need to seriously get the host, record it and throw him off a cruise ship in the middle of the Arctic .
