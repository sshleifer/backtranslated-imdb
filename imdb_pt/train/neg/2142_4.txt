If you are under 6 or 7, then you really will like this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV as she watches. As an adult, I can not stand !! I'm willing to have sequels ... when they have a decent storyline. But that does not even come close to the standard. Please forgive me for slating what a child's movie is, but when you have to sit almost every day when your kids love it so much, you will understand why. My daughter would watch this movie over and over again the same day if we let her. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4 out of 10 purely by the fact that it keeps my younger entertained.
