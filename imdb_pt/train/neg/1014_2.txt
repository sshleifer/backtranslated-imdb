Timberlake's performance almost did attack the screen. It was not all bad, I just think the role of the reporters was wrong for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the typical role of rapper, the toughest and meanest guy of all time. I do not think the film has smiled throughout the film, not even when it was proposed to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman practically carried the whole film. He has some funny scenes that are the highlight of the movie. Kevin Spacey was not good or bad, he was "there". <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a dull. movie. Bad plot. a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for the actors.
