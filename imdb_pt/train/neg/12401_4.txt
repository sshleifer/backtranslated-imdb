I'm at a distinct disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two movies in this series, although I have seen many Larry Cohen movies. Fans of the show seem to think this is a good movie. Judging on his own, it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> You never take a good look at the face of the maniacal cop (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was very somber. The death scenes seem to be staged to consume the greatest number of films, not to give any emotion. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 Director's Cut, I might be more impressed. <br /> <br /> The end with the car chase with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert David was quite intense. best part of the movie.
