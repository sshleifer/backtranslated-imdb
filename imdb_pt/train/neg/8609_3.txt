If you have seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous films and performances, you will recognize several of the jokes made in this strange piece of drink. Written as a comedy, this movie can not reach any kind of nice chord, from self-help doctor Molly Shannon to "I'm fat and therefore funny," John Linette. The 5 wives are quite nice, and if this had been done as a pilot in a series of action and adventure, it could have worked. Instead, it's like a male fantasy that is trying not to be politically incorrect.
