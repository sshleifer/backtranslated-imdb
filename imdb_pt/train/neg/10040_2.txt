... for this film defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all c ** p should now be compared. First, the beginning had elements of style ... and if well treated, could have become a cult classic, a police fiction or a desperate Desi ... but the plot (was it there? ) begins to snake and at one point loses completely. <br /> Play in a crazed maiden with an obsession for English, a call center smart-ass Alec, a femme tale that can wear a bikini and a Saree with the same resourcefulness, a levitating killer, gravity-defying and a policeman with a hundred (or were thousand) black cat commands on his trail .... good ingredients in competent hands. But here is where I would like to ask the director, Lord, what were you smoking? <br /> <br /> I'm sure that this movie would be remembered in the annals of Bollywood cinema - which should never be done - insult the intelligence of the dead brains of film goers. <br /> <br /> Possibly the only redeeming feature of this Desi matrix, apart from the desperate one, is the music ... watch the videos ... hear the airplay and you will not be disappointed. Vishal-Shekhar comes with some eminently humble songs. <br /> <br /> How I wish the director had spent the money on creating another eye drop ... <br /> <br /> When I retire, I really want to, I hardly know what it's like that Akshay Bullet wound disappears in a microsecond ... what have you editors been doing? Tashan, maybe ...
