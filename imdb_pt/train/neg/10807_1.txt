This movie has successfully proven what we all already know, that professional basket ball players suck everything apart from playing basketball. Especially rap and acting. I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie really is. First of all, is it just me, or is it the ugliest child you've ever seen? I mean, your teeth could be used as a can opener. Secondly, why does a genius want to pursue a career in the music industry when, despite having magical powers, it sucks horribly when making music? Third, I read the Bible. By no means was it said that Jesus made geniuses. Fourth, what was the treatment with all the bad special effects? I assure you that any adolescent nerd with acne and with a computer can have better effects than that. Fifth, why was it so bad? And what the hell is a djin? And finally, whoever created the nightmare known as Kazaam needs to be thrown from an airplane to the Eiffel Tower, because that movie takes the word "suck" to a whole new level.
