This is probably the most annoying, meanest and useless film I've seen in the last year. The storyline that purported to have some philosophical aspects came to me as a very bad copy of the matrix, with many cliches: the lonely police wolf, handsome, psychologically disturbed, sleeping with his weapon ... + good hardworking worker and shy, but good look her scientist, you add a 2 cent installment and you have, Robot! I was awfully bothered by the obvious advertising of brands like FedEx, Audi, etc. This movie stinks at commercialization and tends to be another bad ad point that unfortunately does not end after 30 sec. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy, if you have some free time, watch a good TV show or better read a good book.
