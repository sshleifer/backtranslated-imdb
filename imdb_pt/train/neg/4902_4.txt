Almost in the same league of Yonfan's pink flowers, Spider Lillies takes the idea that you can make cutting edge cinema without the edge, or much in terms of cut. It's a Taiwanese movie, which is now becoming a novelty at an alarming rate, but more than that, we can find very little in what is noteworthy here. <br /> <br /> You should know that ostensibly Spider Lillies is also a lesbian-themed story, but in every aspect this is no more than a plastic maneuver to seduce easily seduced and naive. In many ways, we have here a repetition of Taiwan's recent release, Eternal Summer. So it was the gays getting the exchange treatment, now we have the same thing with women. Zero Chou presents, for his non-existent edification, a tale that will probably take at most fifteen years of age. They got a little bit of the posture of the art house, but in the end, this results in a more uninteresting, simply uninteresting foray. <br /> <br /> The angle of Hong Kong comes in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here boasting its butch look yet. Although a bit nice in her previous jobs, Isabella in Spider Lillies is apathetic and needy in most departments. Either her heart did not like it or the whole lesbian drama did not attract her sensitivity. <br /> <br /> She makes a Taipei tattoo artist who is shy, reclusive and responsible for a mentally challenged younger brother. , played by John Shen, who fortunately gives the film its only redeeming feature related to the drama. The character of Isabella, strangely named Takeko, but supposedly coming from Hong Kong, soon joins Jade, a disgruntled young man (Rainie Yang, from the reminiscent Meteor Garden). The latter lives with his grandmother and has a whole list of grievances due to being left behind by his parents and life in general. Of course, the grandmother component works well and is touching, but on the other hand Jade as the protagonist is as immobile as her counterpart Takeko. <br /> <br /> The two women share a past and much anguish inadequately covered, with Jade working as a webcam girl, while Takeko keeps alive the legacy of his father with a unique tattoo of a spider stamped on his arm. Jade also wants to get that same design, which takes Takeko to explore the inner feelings of the issue through flashbacks and a minimal speech with the brave Jade. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is little talk about writing the basis, at least the relationship is memorable? In a word, no. They kiss and pretend to do unpleasant things near the end, but as Eternal Summer reminded us not too long ago, there is a gulf measured in the light years between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers think they are about to see sexual content. > <br /> This skeptical construction of expectation seals the fate of Spider Lillies. With a weak history, humble acting and a general shortage of relics to bring from the theater with you, this kind of thing makes Color Blossoms look good, think about it. At least there we took some of Teresa Cheung's boobs. No, the Spider Lillies is not an AV masterpiece and should be taken off the playlist of the most mundane and timid GLB film festival. Incredibly for a pseudo-indie release, not even the soundtrack and the cinematography produce moments of inspiration. This is good as it greatly facilitates the transmission of Spider Lillies. Believe us, avoid it and you will not lose anything good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
