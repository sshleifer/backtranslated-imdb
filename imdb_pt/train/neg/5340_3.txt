*** SPOILER ALERT *** I love Tim Roth, I really like it, and he does his best with an unbelievable role. I can see how this is a movie that may look good as a script, but it's complicated, unlikely, and finally silly. I saw false death coming a mile away. Ren√© Z. strives with a subscribed part, as well as Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can not remember (one who is not Chris Penn) is a great actor. See if you are not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever that you can not follow it, and so confused that you can not understand. See if you like cheese board work that makes you nauseous. See if you like watching Tim Roth working on a clumsy script. See if it's late at night for free. Otherwise, rent the usual suspects.
