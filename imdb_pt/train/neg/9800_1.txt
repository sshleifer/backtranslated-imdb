The powerful Morphin Power Rangers was released in 1993, supposedly based on the Japanese sentai television program that began in the 1970s. Now, as a fan of Japanese action movies and series, you would think I could have fun with this program. <br /> <br /> You could not be more wrong. What worked in the Japanese version became a complete abomination of television with powerful power rangers. <br /> <br /> The MMPR is based on five teenagers who gain the power to become superheroes costumed with robotic dinosaurs that form an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Now this premise is more absurd and ridiculous than anything in any Transformers movie, however, the ridicule of this show is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> It was followed by two really bad, and I mean, really bad, imitations of movies, and the actors starring in this series, have completely disappeared from the scene. <br /> <br /> If you must choose, try to watch the Zyuranger series from Japan. <br /> <br /> Also, what about the horrible haircuts of the 90s and all the earrings in the faces ? That makes everyone look feminine!
