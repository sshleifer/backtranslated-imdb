"The Cobweb" is an example of many examples of films that feature strong performances and high points, sometimes remarkable, but unfortunately they are destroyed and decelerated drastically by an obscure plot and very little to interest the public. It stars Richard Widmark as a physician working in a mental institution whose life becomes tumultuous due to family problems and a somewhat ridiculous and overworked conflict that does not really seem like much. <br /> <br /> The plot is absurd. . It's time for the institution to get new curtains for the library windows. An old woman wants her curtains to be put on, but many patients want to make their own. And somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally ironic conflict begins at the point where lives are in danger and families begin to crumble. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur among very young children. <br /> <br /> The questioning of plot logic and whether it really could happen is so great that one wonders if only a real lunatic could buy. Do not get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with acting. The cast that follows Widmark is comprised of other great actors, many of whom are Oscar nominees and winners. And occasionally there is a moment in the movie that works brilliantly but always excludes the stupid plot of the window blinds. Unfortunately, there is a lot about the doggone curtains and thus the movie slows down. Many of the outlets are long and made from the point of view of a camera, sticking to the slow pace and lack of viewing interest. <br /> <br /> In a short review, "The Spider Web" is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus, which happens very quickly . This does not really look like much fun to watch and I say it's not much fun to watch.
