Yes .. this is definitely up there with some of the worst MSTifieded movies, but I've definitely seen worse. Think Gremlins evaluated R. Well, anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some science fiction convention, which, amazingly, he was giving a lecture! It was one of those low budget conventions, where it all happens, and everyone brought something (if you want to see crap, you should have seen what some friends and I brought). It looked like a really cool guy, he was really cool about my questions and comments about Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and said he loved the MST3K version! <br /> <br /> In all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think it was made for evil like Mars Attacks. So I guess I'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and cheating on all my MSTies colleagues. Sorry guys.
