As a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can support ANY movie that can be foisted on me, but there is absolutely no reason for it. <br /> <br /> Classified as "Super Action" in the video section of Blockbuster. the dreaded "Restricted Viewing Sticker" I'm assuming these are the only methods that filmmaker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 from an unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> What a shame for you Robert Napton! It's a shame for you to exploit those poor Mexican actors that you've probably promised to hope to succeed in American cinema. You are a disgrace! <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in this movie that holds the smallest degree of action. Have you used snot on these people? Oh, look, they're having a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And this is not an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always daytime? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything .. and more importantly why did we watch the other 1/2? <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50.
